Unfortunately the evening was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.\\nWe arrived for our reservation at 10:00 p.m. and were promptly sat at our table. The server handed us our menus and said that she would be back.\\nWe wanted to start our meal with a bottle of wine which we had to wait for the sommelier to come over to actually order(mind you we already were set with what we wanted) \\nFinally it came time to order our meals. My husband tried to order the steak and was told they were out for the evening; he proceeded to ordered the lamb, and yet again we were told they were out of it! Why was this not told to us prior to placing our order?! We definitely would have left immediately. He ended up having to order the bone marrow(not great and lacked flavor)\\nI ordered the tortellini and was not overly impressed by the preparation of the dish(pretty Bland)\\nThe final straw of the experience at Sketch was the fact that my husband had a half glass of wine in front of him and after we were finished paying the bill the bus person took the glass away without even asking if we were finished.\\nSketch definitely has a lot of work to do before reaching the standards of a high end restaurant.\\nI come to London often and will definitely not be returning to this place.\\nThanks for a horrible evening.'}"
