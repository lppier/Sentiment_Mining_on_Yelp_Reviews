I've been to London a few times and I don't always want to have fish & chips with mushy peas, I decided to come to this place for dinner to stuff my face with Chinese noodles.\nThe place is located in a place that has lots of foot traffic, the restaurant itself is not that big, there will be a lot of people outside waiting for seating so one of the girls comes out and gives out menus so you already know what you want, when you've decided what you want, she'll take down the order and at the same time try to find you a table.\nSo now you come to your table, your finish ordering and they get to work, they're fast with the orders, I ordered some noodles with roast pork I believe and also some dumplings I believe, I have to say, the taste is amazing, full of taste, you can taste the spices, the meat and the consistency, delicious!\nIf you're in London and want noodles, yes, this is it, beware, it gets full but be patient because at the end of the wait you will be rewarded with a bowl of noodles that is big and plenty with great flavors all around."

We were in the Covent Garden Area and were looking for somewhere close and saw Lanzhou Noodle Bar through Yelp. The reviews seem pretty mixed in that some people don't recommend because of the service, but our experience was wholly positive.\nWe were seated very quickly downstairs which was nice for us because it seemed cooler than the upstairs area. We ordered two water bottles straight ahead and sat with the menus to decide for a little bit. My mom ended up getting the fried noodles (G1 on the menu Dao Xia Mian), and my dad and I ordered the mixed beef noodle soup (G21 with Dao Xiao Mian). I wouldn't recommend the G21 if you're not good with intestines and stuff, but if you like it then I highly recommend it! We also got the pork and chive dumplings which was so great !All the food was really delicious and super filling! Could've ordered less probably since we came for lunch, but did not regret ordering! Everything was also very cheap and it's 10% off if you pay with cash! \nA must try if you're in the area!! Go try!! \n(Side note: not sure how this compares to actual Chinese hand pulled noodles because my family is Korean, but the hand pulled noodles were delicious to us! )"

But actually it's probably one of the best places to get a decent bowl of noodles in all of London, not least because they pull and slice the noodles by hand. \nThe menu is actually quite vast but I would skip the rice dishes and just pick a noodle dish. You can't go wrong with lanzhou beef in either la mian (hand pulled) or dao xiao (knife cut.) get it with a soup and you're golden. It's like being in China. \nThe service is FAST because the chefs never stop. Literally almost the second you order, the food will arrive. Turnover is quick but there's no pressure to eat quickly. You'll probably want to dash though because the place is small and not very relaxing. \n\u00a38.5 is about reasonable for central London.

We stopped here after traveling for over 12 hours and beef noodle soup was the perfect comfort food that I needed after our journey. \nI've had lots of hand-pulled noodles but the texture of the ones here is definitely near / at the top of my list. The soup was good as well, but the noodle texture is what really stood out. One star off for service / experience - we shared a table with another couple and, when I asked about the super-thin noodles (you can ask for different thin-ness of noodles), the waitress told me that the regular was just fine (which, how did she know that? I'm into super thin noodles so I felt somewhat miffed...) Luckily the noodles did turn out to be good, hence the four stars, but I'm pretty sure I would've loved the super thin ones too. \nSkip the other food - we also had an eggplant appetizer and curry chicken and they were both meh.

I later ordered a chicken dan dan noodle, which was not as described at all. The dan dan noodle broth was watery and plain, when the authentic version of it should be thick, rich and peanut-y. I had to add a lot of hot sauce to make it more flavourful. The noodles were the biggest disappointment as they gave me soggy rice noodles, when I was under the impression that it should've been a thicker hand-pulled noodle.

I doubt you'll find a more real experience anywhere else in London.\nFirst, everyone working here is Chinese from the little lady barking seating instructions at the entrance to the cooks eating their own wares while pumping out dishes in no time.\nI think it was the comedian Russell Peters who joked you get your food within seconds of ordering at a Chinese restaurant. Here, the joke plays it in real life as it is comical how quickly your orders go from kitchen to table. I had one arm out of he sleeve of my coat when our entire four person order was in front of us.\nWe had the beef noodle soup (knife cut noodles) and the stir fry char siu noodles (knife cut). We also had their spicy Chinese cabbage (which was just kimchi lol) and the potato shears dish. Had a few egg rolls for good measure but they were only ok.\nEverything here is quick, cheap, and is legitimately Chinese comfort food. Our parents thought it lacked quality flavor though and the broth and ingredients are definitely on the cheaper side. But where else in all of London will you find good knife cut noodles for less than 7 pounds? \nThey accept card and your whole party must be there to be seated.

Perhaps my standards are too high, having had great authentic food in China and the US. However, the lack of quality and flavor in our food here leaves me to strongly suggest dining elsewhere.

Not friendly, but they get you what you need.\n~ Food:\nTerrific. Can't say enough good things about it. I recommend you skip ordering the non-noodles though, to be honest. In addition to our noodles we got a plate of steamed pork dumplings and spicy wontons. Both of those dishes were OK, but my partner and I both came out of the experience wishing we just ordered another plate of those glorious noodles instead.\nTIP: Order 'Dao Xiao' noodles aka knife-shaved noodles. The texture is out of this world and the springy texture from the noodle being freshly made is a perfect 10/10. I've had knife-shaved noodles a million times before but never had it as fresh as this.\n---\nIf you can get over the dingy atmosphere and the fact that you're eating right next to strangers communal-style, you'll reach food nirvana like I have.

This place is a total dive: the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, the service is close to nonexistent, and the cramped elbow-to-elbow communal seating probably violates the fire code.\nBut I'd be lying if I said the handmade noodles didn't make all of that worth it. Trust me, I'm from San Francisco, a world-renowned hub for authentic Chinese food.\nAn employee stands outside next to the line to take orders so the kitchen can start working on them before you're even seated. That way, your food will practically be ready for you once a spot frees up for you inside.

This place uses the name to lure you in. The inside serves a mix of different Chinese foods. You're also allowed to customize your noodles. Hint that it isn't authentic!! If I had seen the menu first, I wouldn't have gone in.\nMy husband and I shared a bowl of beef tendon hand pulled noodles. Soup lacked depth. The chili on the side was good and the saving grace. I ended up dumping two tablespoons into my bowl. I also had two lamb skewers. It was pretty good. I almost wanted to order more. All it was missing was the good ratio of fat. Their skewers were all meat. That's not a bad thing but it's definitely better with the pieces of fat in between. \nThe lady taking our order was so distracted by the girl next to us who wanted to change her order last minute that she failed to put down our order of roast duck and bbq pork. We had to ask someone to follow up. The guy we asked was the same one I saw watching horse races on his phone... He then proceeded to tell me they don't have roast duck so I said \u70e7\u9e2d (roast duck in chinese) and he goes oh yes ok. That's when we found out she missed our order. So we order and wait... The bbq pork was so dry I  had to spit it out. My husband was super disappointed by the food coloring. It's supposed to be red but we were disturbed how it wasn't just the outside, the red had died random spots on the inside, likely from when they were slicing. If you normally have this, it's red on the outside only... no transference of dye people... The roast duck came drenched in a sauce... \nI'm pretty sure they were trying to serve the duck cantonese style because it was a \u70e7\u5473 (A style of roast/bbq meat)... It was not accurate!!! Both were too sweet. Especially the bbq pork. \nFriendly reminder Hong Kong, located in the south of china, was a British colony. These roast meats are very common in HK. Also, Lanzhou is not in the south... \nI was disappointed this place was true to no region...\nEveryone was pretty nice except the guy who helped us at the cashier. Didn't ring me up stared at me. So I thought the number on the register was what I owed (28.10 pounds). This fool rang me up (22.50) while I was grabbing my money.

Only concern is with cleanliness.\nVery tiny restaurant with limited seating. We were a group of 4 and it was quite crammed at the table. We were seated in the basement which looked dingy but that was okay, we were here for the food not the ambiance. We each got a bowl of la-mien noodles which were quite good but broth was too salty. Service was what was expected for a cheap-eat Chinese restaurant. I ordered the sliced beef noodles and they brought out the wrong order but was still tasty (picture attached). Cleanliness is concerning which is why I'm rating it 3 stars; we asked for water and it was very obvious that our water came in styrofoam cups that have been washed with hot water and reused."

    "review": "After a long day of traveling yesterday, we ventured out for some good food this afternoon. After seeing reviews for places in the area, we decided to give Lanzhou Noodle Bar a go. It's a tiny restaurant that's run quite efficiently. We browsed through the menu during our 10 minute wait, and were seated quickly. Hungry and excited, I started to dig into my food only to be terribly disappointed. I ordered a chicken curry plate with steamed white rice; the chicken pieces had a strange texture so I started to take a closer look...\nRAW/UNDERCOOKED chicken... Are you kidding me? People can get really sick! I stopped eating immediately. Before leaving, I pointed out that the chicken was raw/undercooked and the employee rolled her eyes as she grabbed my plate to re-cook the dish (I'm assuming). But I told her it's fine and that we were on our way out. We paid for our meals, crossed our fingers hoping I don't fall ill and no one else does either."

    "review": "Big fan of hand pulled noodles. The first time I walked by I was kinda skeptical due to their hygiene score (a few months ago). However, on a subsequent visit they have improved their score so I decided to give it a go. It was a Friday night and this place was bustling at 11pm, from the drunk/clubbing crowd. There was a line and it was a short 5 minute wait as they quickly turned around the tables.\nYou'll be dining communal style (we're kinda used to it) and sharing a table with other people. This place is pretty fast and you can see them make the noodles in front of  you. I ordered the beef stew hand pulled noodles. It arrived in a matter of minutes and was sooooo good. Be sure to put plenty of that hot sauce in your soup for the best experience. I shared a table with two girls that barely ate their appetizers. They clearly ordered too much (3 appetizers and two soups). Don't do what they did... Total waste. Most of the people eating here are locals and I was the only tourist (or so I thought). It is near Leicester Square which has a bunch of tourists but not too many of them appreciate the fine art of hand pulled noodles. \nSoooooo good."

We also ordered the chill chicken which came with Sichuan peppercorns. This was also very good. \nThe meal came to \u00a323.50 for 2 which is a total bargain!  You pay at the cash register but please leave the wait staff a tip. They were on top of things and you could tell, working very hard. \nThis isn't a place to linger and the tables are communal and crowded.

Also because I'm obsessed with handmade noodles.\nAfter asking the guy next to me what he was eating, I ordered the same: stir-fried knife-cut beef noodles. We also ordered the ji dan jiu cai he zi (egg and leek \"pancake\") to share. My plate came, gloriously heaped with noodles. I reached for the clay pot full of hot chili flakes in oil, dumped a copious amount on my noodles, and dug in.\nThe cramped noodle bar, with its communal tables, fluorescent lighting, and cooks making noodles two feet away from where you're sitting reminded me a lot of noodle shops I went to while in Hangzhou, China.\nThe food was no frills, authentic Chinese at its best.

With how overcooked it was, it might have been the previous day's leftovers. The knife-cut noodles were too inconsistent. Usually, knife-cut noodles are good because of the little inconsistencies in thickness, and therefore, texture, but these were too widely ranging. Most of the pieces were too thin, which made it like eating little bits of noodles the thickness of dumpling skins. The remaining pieces were extremely thick, which made for lots of QQ, but also just too doughy. I would normally always recommend the knife-cut noodles over pulled noodles, but I say go with the pulled noodles here.\nStewed beef la mian (pulled noodles)\nBeef was very tender and tasted marinated, noodles were good.

It's what they well known for yet I can't help but feel sad when I see tourists or people unfamiliar with the cuisine going for a cheap container of their pre cooked buffet section.  Take the hint and order the freshly made hand pulled noodles instead.\nThe place felt like I entered a nursery with their bright colour walls of yellow, red and green and laminated printout of the food. \nStaff were efficient and quick but without the friendliness, which is very typical of a Chinese restaurant. With that in mind and the small canteen style restaurant, condiments on the table, short plastic and wooden stools, it was very reminiscent of canteens in Hong Kong and China.\nHouse special vermicelli \nOh my beautiful zingy garlicky vinegary salad of thinly sliced cucumbers, carrots, coriander, vermicelli and the novelty of frankfurters too. It was so refreshing, loved the crunchy texture and marinated perfectly. The frankfurters actually worked well adding some meaty sweetest to the dish, to balance out the sourness.\nChicken sour spicy la-mian noodles. \nI didn't expect the broth to be so umami and flavoursome. It had depth and a nice balance sourness as well as a good punch of spice from the chilli without being numbing. The noodles was full of bounce and generous, made long so it provided a really satisfying bite. The wood ear fungus gave a crunch to it and this was contrasted with the softer tofu. The chicken was a bit dry but that was the only compliant I have\nStewed beef Dao Xiao Mian (chopped noodles) in soup. \nThe broth was delicious and complex, once again full of flavour and depth. Sadly the noodles weren't as satisfying for me being short and doughy. It felt I spent more time chewing on the noodles than the enjoying the broth with it. Next time I might have it with the La Mian as the beef was spot on being incredibly tender and fragrant, with strong notes of the sweet soy braising marinating sauce. Nice addition of pak choi for a refreshing green taste and crunch.\nSteamed pork and chive dumplings \nThese were poorly made. The dough was too thick and chewy masking all the flavours of the meatball and the broth inside it. The meatball itself was nice and sweet, well marinated and juicy.\nFish ball BBQ skewer and lamb BBQ skewer \nThese were lovely and fragrant. It had a nice kick to it from the spice. The lamb was meaty and lean which was nice compared to all the fatty ones we've had. Fish balls were soft and bouncy with good umami flavours. It was great not to have a minimum order on them too like most places that sell skewers.\nChive and egg pie\nThis was very moreish. I love the doughy thin pastry, pan fried for a little bit of crisp around the edges. It was a bit greasy too but that kept it moist. Inside was a delicious filling of peppery chives mixed with silky eggs.\nI left so satisfied with Lanzhou Noodle Bar. For just \u00a36.50 for each of the noodle soups it makes me question why a simple miso ramen can cost double that. It's cool how you can see the noodles made in the open preparation kitchen by the chef and the skilled involved. Menu is actually quite extensive covering mostly northern Chinese food so if you're hungry you can always add it along to your noodle as a side like what we did. Looks like I will be back soon."

Lanzhou falls squarely in mainland/northern chinese cuisine. It's hand pulled noodles are freshly made and the sauce is super yum. There are all kinds of choices for everyone. I was excited to see that they served garlic and pepper marinated cucumbers, which is my favorite appetizer of all time. They don't serve water which is fine if you're getting a soup with noodles. \nThe restaurant is cramped, yes, but it feels pretty authentic that way.

They are made fresh  and super tasty (that's only if you are planning to be seated with a menu + order from the left side of the noodle menu). \nFor a brief moment sitting outside at the only table on the pavement and with one of  the chefs munching away on is own dinner next to us, I felt as if we could have been in Beijing. \nThis noodle bar is right opposite Leister Square station, so not the most atmospheric place in the world, but definitely worth the experience."

    "review": "I wanted so badly to love this place as I had seen it show up on many lists for London's best cheap eats. \nYes, it's cheap for ~6.90 for a bowl of noodles in Soho. \nBest? Far from it! The bowl is packed with so much MSG (flavour enhancers, you'll know it's jammed with the bad stuff after you go running to find a drink after dining here!), fatty cuts of meat (stewed beef is the recommendation and 80% of it is fat) and I counted one slither of bok choy (yes, one!). Most of the bowl is filled with broth that's way too oily to drink. The handcut noodles are impressive and lives up to the hype. If you're not a fan of MSG and really oily/fatty food, I'm afraid I couldn't recommend Lanzhou Noodle Bar. \nService is inattentive and poor. The minute you put down your chopsticks, there's already a table standing next to you waiting for you to dash out ASAP. I understand that seat space is tiny and cramped, but it'd be nice not having to climb over bodies to exit the restaurant. \nYou'd be better off paying an extra \u00a35 and grabbing a bowl of ramen nearby. Can I suggest Kanada-Ya? They have rad ramen and it's a consistent five stars from me."

    "review": "After a month of gallivanting around Europe, my cravings for Chinese food were at an all-time high. Found this place on Yelp and was super excited to finally get a taste of the homeland. This noodle joint is a tiny hole in the wall, super casual with cramped seating, but it wasn't anything I didn't already expect. \nMy boyfriend and I ordered the stir fried hot and sour beef la mian (hand pulled noodles), as well as the pork sparerib dao xiao mian (hand cut noodles) in soup. Food came quickly within ten minutes and was super fresh. The hand pulled noodles were definitely the preferred style between the two as they were more al dente and retained a light bounce. I normally really like dao xiao mian, but I found that since they were in soup, they ended up getting overly doughy/overdone quicker than I anticipated. The pork sparerib was crisp and well executed, and the hot and sour beef had a nice level of acidity and spice. \nOverall, a quick cheap eat that hits the spot. Just bear in mind that it's definitely a no frills type of establishment."

The noodles are still fantastic and the service will always bring me back to the quality of service in China. \nI'm taking two star off of my original review because while the noodles are fresh and amazing, their other dishes are less desirable. I ordered the Mu-er cold dish as it's one of my favourite things to have in China. As I was digging into it, we saw not one, but 2 very long strands of hair. \nThey were nice enough to make me a new one, but I was rather put off from the initial dish already and probably nothing could have actually made the situation better. \nIn hindsight: Go for the noodles. Maybe try the lamb skewers. But stay away from the cold dishes."

There's no warning of this charge also when you're queuing for a table - which is when you're most easily able to pop off to get some cash.\nYup, damn good noodles but somehow was left with a bitter taste in my mouth from the p**s poor service."

    "review": "In my younger days when lunch choices consisted of Soho's wide range of eateries as opposed to today's regimented packed lunches, there was one spot that was a consistent favourite. Wong Kei. This evening after a long day at work followed by a lengthy meeting and beer, I decided to revisit my favourite old haunt. It's as good as ever. I ordered my standard:\n- Ho fun with beef and scrambled egg\nIt is a dish that sums up my love for the restaurant; hearty, authentic, homestyle cooking that will fill you up on a budget with the finest of ingredients - simplicity. There is nothing fancy about a plate of wet noodles with a generous helping of tender beef and eggs. Its taste is mildly salty with a slight spring onion sweetness and there isn't much else to it. What you get however is a sense of warmth and comfort with every bite that few other places can offer at its price point. Wong Kei has long been infamous for its abrasive staff and unassuming environment (both things I have no problems with personally) but in dishes such as this, it provides care in the way it feeds you. It in some ways encapsulates the very Chinese way of expressing love without words and not many people appreciate that, or open themselves up to notice such things at places like this.\nI will forever love this place and hope it stays forever. As a little pro tip, this has to be consumed eating in to make use of the plentiful chilli oil crucial to this dish and for that rarest of perks by today's standards: free tea.\nWong Kei, please don't change."

The menu has lots of different choices and variety. We ordered the fu-king fried rice, malaysian noodles. The food came out and I wasn't amazed by it. It was your typical Chinese food. I am not really sure if I like it enough to come back though. Everyone seemed to really love this place and the food but the food doesn't live up to the hype.\nSo bleh. Just Chinese food.\nAlso, I was surprised we had shared tables. So if you have a small party, they might sit you with a shared table, I don't know how common it is in London? I see shared tables as a norm in Asia/China though but not usually that common in America."

Very old furniture, very working class, not trendy, not cool, \"you get the best value here\" attitude of service. BUT I highly recommend it!\n1. Price is damn good for most chow fun, fried noodles and soup noodles. Cheaper than the United States Chinatown in NY and SF. For other dishes, prices are average NOT cheap.\n2. Roast duck is very good but NOT as good as Four Seasons around the corner which still has the BEST duck in London!  Half duck with NO bone is 11.5 pounds at Wong compared to 14.5 pounds with NO bone at Four (number may be off slightly but conclusion is the same). If you want the best duck, go to FOUR.\n3. The wonton soup at Wong is average. Soup is meaty, little salty and not clear, not very tasty. Good wonton soup should be clear and strong with seafood (shrimp) taste. Wonton itself is average average although each one has a big piece of shrimp! It could have some MSG in it and it will taste a lot better!\n4. Beef stew flat noodle soup is not bad and it is very vinegary. This type of strew is not common in Cantonese style. \n5. Tea is FREE.\nBathroom is acceptable marginally. Service is ok, not great.\nBottom line, good authentic Cantonese noodles restaurant BUT with very affordable prices earns Wong Kei  ****.\nCASH ONLY, BUDDY!"

I'm only here for the food! and then I looked over at the gaggle of staff hanging around the bar and then one stuck two fingers at me lazily (basically indicating a table for two) and I said yes and then he waved us off in the direction of the stairs. He didn't escort us upstairs nor did he come to the front to greet us. It felt very self service, almost empowering :D \nWe then helped ourselves to the best table of 4 after realising there weren't a table for 2 around but the waitress hurriedly ushered us to a 'table for two' which we later realised was a shared table with another two customers!!!?? I tried to protest but in vain as the waitress was having none of it. Honestly, the whole concept of customers are always right and you must prioritise customer's needs before anything else are completely foreign to these people. \nThe other two customers were as surprised as we were but later whispered that at least we all got into the exclusive dining area normally reserved for Chinese folks and as a Chinese myself, I got my non asian friend a free pass to the exclusive club which had linen covered tables with comfy enough seats compared to the greasy cheap looking mish mash of tables and chairs downstairs.\nWe were so fortunate that our fellow neighbours were such cool peeps and abit like the shared benches in Wagamama, we were like 'can you pass the soya sauce please?' etc. I mean I totally would've shared their food too (if they'd let me). Totally. Love the fact that Wong Kei forces us to interact with complete strangers. Such a unique perk. Also they know the issues with London's first world problems in their lack of communication with one another and has set itself on a mission to break these barriers. ;-) So admirable!\nOur neighbours even helpfully smacked down some annoying flies and wiped it off the table for us. :') The flies acted as a bonus decoration ;-) The authenticity in this restaurant to the Far East is so in tune. You want abit of China? Go to Wong Kei!!  \nIf a food restaurant other than your typical Mcdonald's and Burger King, offers a drive through speedy service then this is it! The whole service was comparable to a factory conveyer belt. Time is precious and every second counts despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty with ample amounts of unoccupied tables and chairs scattered across the floor. Compared to your typical Chinatown establishment, this one takes the prawn cracker! As soon as we were seated and handed our menus, a waitress hovered above waiting to take our order (like less than a minute after we sat down). When I asked her to come back in a few minutes, the look on her face was utter shock. Truly funny to see. Honestly our table was wicked. We interacted with our neighbours and made such jokes that the same waitress came back looking horrified with nose flaring, that we were enjoying ourselves lol. \nNow onto the food. This is what I came for. Prices have gone up ever so slightly since well, the last recorded menu prices online) but still remain ahead of competition in terms of value, portion and quality. We had hearty meals of won ton noodle soup which was laden with won ton dumplings that when I finally demolished those meat parcels, I was actually surprised to see noodles underneath it! For a fiver, it truly was the epitome of eastern comfort food like bangers and mash is to English folks. For the side, we opted for bean curd with chilli and salt. I would totally recommend it to anyone because once you try it, you can't stop! Might need some water at hand because they don't use that msg sparingly!! \nService is quick. You're in and out of there like fast food. In fact so quick you needn't worry about time. What they lack in service they more than abundantly made up for in quality and quantity of food.\nQuestion of whether you're genuinely welcomed sits in the balance. Service charge is optional (thank goodness!!) and the waitress counted the money at our table (quite insecurely) after hovering nearby for a while whilst we emptied coins from our purses lol! Not to forget that the tea is freeeeee!  \nComing here is an experience onto itself like a ghost ride in a theme park. You love to hate it. All in all, I'd definitely be coming back here in a rush!"

I was asked to meet a few friends here from Hong Kong for dinner before we went to the theatre. They heard it was famous for their bad reputation so they wanted to try it. I personally do not understand why they came all the way from Hong Kong to the UK to have Chinese food, but there is neither here or there. \nFood: If there's food in front of me, I'll eat it! I completely forgot what we ordered, but my friend pouted and said they all looked the same: stir-fried bbq pork, stir-fried vegetables, stir-fried a whole bunch of stuff and deep-fried tofu with chillies. Whatever we ordered, it came quickly and that was a good thing for us because we were in a hurry.\nAtmosphere: It has a typical Chinese cafe-style atmosphere: busy, tacky oriental art, and a slight layer of grease on the wall that comes with a dive like so. Where the chairs are from an 80's diner and the plastic cutlery and crockery has been used so much, their logo is wearing off. If you're looking for 5 star dinning, you've come to the wrong place. If you're looking for fast, cheap eats, look no further than this lovely dive full of oriental tourists getting upset that it's not up to par with their home cooking or Chinese students that miss home and did not want to have instant noodles tonight. \nService: The service wasn't that bad. I do want to say, it was surprisingly good based on their bad reputation. We walked in, told them how many people and were seated accordingly. In typical Chinese fashion, sometimes you may need to wave them down to get some service, but I feel that is the norm for busy restaurants."

I love it in here, and even though the staff aren't overly friendly, if you're polite and thankful to them, they are actually very friendly back! \nDefinitely check out Wong Kei's, especially because of the delicious food and GREAT PRICES!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!"

To be fair, there was a little less \"throw it at you\" on this ocassion but trying to engage in conversation with any of the staff proved to be a rather pointless task.\nAnyway, food is just about ok, it could be my age but all the dishes seem to be merging into one another. \nHad it not have been for some ridiculous \"one way pedestrian\" crowd control system on Chinese New Year, we would probably have ventured further down Gerrard Street."

They were fine - not friendly exactly but civil. \nAlthough, we were smelling distance from the toilets. Oh, and one of our tea cups had a faint lipstick stain smeared on it. \nBut, hang on a sec because there're some good points too. The food is tasty. And it's dead cheap. Like \u00a35.50 for a huge plate of heartwarming crispy noodles, tender beef and crunchy pak choi.\nFor that price, I'd almost expect a bit of old lippy on the crockery. \nGive it a go, if you dare - an essential London experience."

    "review": "Wong Kei used to be infamous for cheap, filling Chinese food and rude waiters who would scold you and it was all part of the fun. I used to go as a student a long time ago and so it's officially a London eating 'institution' in my book. For me, the brusqueness of the staff translates to efficiency which I would take any day over ineptitude and slowness which drives me mad.\nIt was the first time I've been back since the re-opening or new management or whatever happened. On this occasion I was dining solo (always a good spot for solo dining) and was immediately directed to one of the solo dining tables right in the entrance area. The waiter came straight over and asked me what I wanted. I kind of like that, taking me for a regular because if I did know, I would just say right away. I asked for a menu instead since it had been a while...\nI ordered a wonton soup and singapore noodles. Pretty straightforward.\nMy order came quickly and I was surprised to see that the wonton soup was a large bowlful with plenty of wontons which were really good. Prawn and pork, freshly made with big chunks of prawn with a good ginger note. It made me think how good this was especially for the price around \u00a33.50 vs the \u00a311 bowls of ramen noodles that have sprung up everywhere (was never comfortable with paying \u00a311 for a bowl of soup noodles).\nSingapore noodles also didn't scrimp on the meat and shrimp and a good sized portion. A bit overly salty not helped by the salty soup but overall solid.\nComplimentary tea.\nSo. If in the mood for a quick spot of Chinese in the centre of town and want to get served quickly with no hype and no queues then come here.\nGreat value and good food. Still love Wong Kei and the quality seemed better than before."

Here you'll be shoved into any seat anywhere, separated from your group like Nemo from his family and left to flounder and eat awkwardly in front of strangers, four flights away, up into an adjoining space in what seems like breaking into or being smuggled into an open-plan office block/ come restaurant floor next door to sit with said random people, whilst you're left to recount your steps and your experiences thus far. \nOn being escorted away from my dining companions, I'd have lost my mates if I hadn't grabbed a discarded prawn cracker at a nearby table and left a Hansel and Gretel-like trail back to them. \nSo, I ended up joining an adjoining end of table, table. On my own, within waving distance of one of my friends, but I had to muscle in on another couple who had been lucky enough to sit together. \nIt took sometime to get a waiter's attention, but it didn't take long to realise that the couple I'd been proffered to give my services to as a third wheel and Capering Gooseberry, had not just been stuck for conversation, but were simply too frightened to ask for; water, a napkin or anything else you'd usually expect at a restaurant. \nFinally a waiter, dashed to my attention. \n\"Drink?\"\nJust as I flicked my eyes down to the menu to enquire, he was off. Fed up by my too long split second hesitation. \nThe food came quickly, in fact when it did arrive it almost hit the linen before the plates did. \n\"Noodles\", my waiter announced. *Slam* \"Chilli Beef\" *Slam*. Down went the bowls, whilst before they hit the table, the broth defied gravity remaining in mid-air and began cooling from the gust of wind created from the clipped turn of my waiter's back again.\nHe'd gone! Thank Christ, but I'd still not ordered my drink. I saw a couple of my friends separated over on two other tables making perplexed gestures to me in nervous fits of laughter. I thought they were having a good time, but I was to discover their waitress did not linger, who's laconic tone implied she too could give even less of a rat's rear about my or their whining on about being thirsty. In the end she abandoned herself from their table for mine, offered me a drinks menu and rolled her eyes so hard I thought it'd affect the gravitational pull of the moon.  So I did the darnedest of things and ordered what was to be a flat sodding cola. \nWell, if you must hanker for Anglicised greasy run of the mill Chinese food, go here, go simply for the terrifying experience and GO ON, GET OMLETTE AND CHIPS I DARE YOU!"

The prices went up a little (not by that much), although the portions are the same, the staff got a little friendlier and service just a tad slower. But what's important remains the same. It's a place where you can get a plate of relatively good Chinese food quickly for not a lot of money. It's by no means the best food in the world but it is at a price that's cheaper that the rest. \nBy all means go to the buffets in Chinatown, but unless you eat smart, you're losing out, the drink you have there will push you to the \u00a310 mark... At Wong Kei, eat in, and your tea is free. I don't go for the really elaborate dishes, they specialise in the one plate meal in my opinion, rice or noodles with something on it. Larger plates are a pretty much a plate of the main, and you then order rice on the side, good for groups. I've only once ordered off of their Chef's specials list - udon with seafood and XO, and to my surprise I loved it, but it was expensive, so don't think I'd get it again. That and most of my colleagues didn't really appreciate it...\nSo stick to the basics, don't worry about sitting at the communal table (people, it's meant to zig zag so you're not sitting next to someone, please learn this! Talking to you Mr sweaty businessman who proceeded to elbow me for my meal and cluck that I was in his way - I was there first!).

This was the first sit down restaurant that we headed to in London. \nWe went here for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening and were seated on the basement (may be called the ground floor) and service was prompt and efficient. We ordered the eel, hot pot with tofu and Singapore style thick rice noodles. Hubs loved the eel since this is not something we have in the USA or at least in Michigan and ate all but two pieces. The tofu hot pot had fish tofu as well as the regular braised tofu. As is typical with everywhere but the US, the hot pot was smaller than what I was expecting but tasted on par with the average hot pot. Lastly, the Singapore thick noodles were pretty tasty, but I found the curry flavor be not as strong as it's done in the states. The flavor was still good and contained mini shrimps, BBQ pork, onions, and sprouts. \nGiven the price of around 25\u00a3, it's a great place to grab a reasonably priced, some may even say cheap eat when you are looking for a Chinese fix in London."

    "review": "Okay first off, this place is awesome. You're might think that it's probably awesome because of the food. Wrong. Or that it's awesome because of the service. Nope. Or that it's nostalgia from child-hood days (You might be right). But overall no. It's pretty much the best place in Chinatown because of the no fuss (read: efficient) service, down and dirty, give the customer what they ordered and with complimentary tea. No service charge, but it does go appreciated so leave what you can.\nWhat elevates it above most other place, is the chilli oil. Hands down the best chilli oil in all of chinatown. Nobody else does it. Nobody else has re-created it. I have literally eaten here and nearly eaten half a glassful of the stuff. I know that's probably not a badge to be proud of, but it is just that good and I probably wouldn't eat here as the food is nothing special without it. Cheap, but not special.\nRecently however, they've started raising the prices a little and portions are quite variable. You used to always get a gigantic (how do I finish this) portion. But nowadays you could get that, or get something a little more manageable. This said, The price of the dish I always get, either the shredded chicken/pork fried noodles (always make sure you get crispy noodles) or the belly pork/bbq pork on hot rice have increased from \u00a33.80 and \u00a34.00 a decade ago to \u00a34.80 and \u00a35.00 today. Take into account inflation and this is probably a below inflation increase, you still get unlimited tea and the amazing chilli which haven't changed a bit.\nIf you're a wetherspoon snob however, and you know who you are, you absolutely won't like this place and this review won't convince you otherwise. For others that like to give new things and try and risk poor service/variable quality good, Wong Kei is great, you just have to understand how it all works. What appears rude service on your first visit is actually efficiency engineered over many decades. After all, if you're there on your own sitting at the front, why would they give you a menu?? You should already know what you want, and most people do!\nPS. Like other budget chinatown places. Cash Only. They also do takeaway. I kid you not, sometimes you can get this from ordering to in your hand in less than 45 seconds. They give you a little container of chilli oil, but do it properly. Open up your chinese foil takeaway box and add more yourself."

Anyway, they're still reasonably priced (cash only, folks) and the food remains good. I wouldn't say it's a life changing culinary experience, but it usually delivers and I never had to send anything back. The trick is to order food from the back of the menu; basically lots of options of meat with rice or noodles. It's even cheaper and the portions are huge; you won't miss out for not ordering the \"posher\" sounding dishes on the first few pages.\nI can't stand green/jasmine tea, but if that's your thing you'll get it for free to your heart's content. There are some communal round tables where you sit in close proximity with strangers; if that's not your thing keep in mind it's always a risk. :)\nIf you want a chatty and smiley staff this is not the place to go (as it happens with most chinese places where staff is usually tired and overworked anyway), but if you like quick and good chinese food in central London, do try. I love sitting there during off peak hours with my tablet and munch on rice and meat while I people watch. There are always some amusing customers around, and sometimes the interaction between them and the staff isn't so smooth. Ah, the good old Wong Kei will always be the good old Wong Kei. ;)"

It was served extremely hot and after a few minutes of waiting for it to cool down, I picked up a slice with the chopsticks. Do you eat the skin? Oh, there's bone in there too. It was messy. It was... interesting. It was... odd. Would I have it again? I think I can safely say I would have something else, though I would absolutely return to the Wong Kei.

I'm used to the whole mostly rice, very little meat thing that asian restaurants do, but the value at Wong Kei compared to what you can get elsewhere in London straight up bad. As a tourist from a small Canadian city with superior Chinese restaurants (in my humble opinion), I gotta say...

Purely relying on cheap prices to fill seats in your restaurant?\nWith this as their business model, I will always have a soft spot for Wong Kei!\nThe first time that I ever came here, I was introduced to the place by a friend of my dad's when I was still in my teens. I really did not know what to expect. Upon returning with my best friend, he and I spent the evening completely perplexed as to what was going on around us, even though we were the customers and we were the ones who were placing the orders. We most definitely were not in control or command of what was happening to us! \nI seem to remember almost random dishes appearing with no explanation as to what they were. I also remember very well ordering portions of egg fried rice and the waiting staff slamming the bowl down and me repeatedly asking where the other portion of rice was. Each time I asked, the waiter immediately started walking away and shouted at me \"You got it!\" \nAfter grabbing a more senior member of staff, he finally explained that two portions is one bowl. Thanks for that!\nSo when I returned here very recently, I was wondering if they still had \"the same magic\" that they used to.\nWell, to be brief. Prices have most definitely escalated compared to what they used to be here. However, you most definitely get great value for your money. I can most definitely eat & eat & eat. And.... The relatively few dishes that I did order really challenged my eating prowess. \nService here is still fairly crazy. But I suppose, it is all about perspective. I personally feel that over the last few years service in London has gotten worse and worse. Get me started on this topic I will tell you that it is the fault of including service in the bills, but I'll back off that for now.

    "review": "This whole hype on social media in regards to Wong Kei closing and then opening with new management really got me wanting to go back to see if there has been any changes. \nWong Kei has always been a place for a simple fix of food at a cheap price and a place I can get fresh ho fun stir-fried at a reasonable price. Hate it when people state 'ho fun' in the menu when in fact it's just dried rice noodles rehydrated. Portion sizes is always a plus too along with no service charge and free green tea. But I never expect good presentation of food, wok energy, particularly good service or a very positive memorable experience.\nSo it caught my attention when news coverage was saying that the new manager is trying to input better service. Whilst customers were worried about the change in portion sizes, cheap prices and taste in their favourite chilli oil. So on Saturday me and my friend decided to test this new 'Wong Kei' out with a few of the most popular dishes and see if Wong Kei has lost it's original values.\nAlthough there has been a repaint, decor is still exactly the same, same off green/blue tables on the ground floor, plastic white plates with 'Wong Kei' printed on them. The only thing that looked any diffferent were the soy sauce that are now in Lee Kum Kee glass bottles. \nWe were given the new menu where the dishes looked exactly the same however all dishes were hiked up by 0.20p-0.40p. This certainly gives room for other Chinese restaurants to top Wong Kei in offering the cheapest one dish plates. \nWe started with the most popular Roast pork and pork belly on rice. Either we were very lucky on the occasion with the cut or the meat has improved in quality. I was quite impressed with how lean the roast pork was, succulent and well marinated. The generous slices of meat did have a good bounce to it with a generous portion of rice in the same sweet brown sauce I'm used to. Nothing had changed here, if anything it was better than a lot of times I have been. \nMy friend was so happy to find the chilli oil had not change either, still fragrant with notes of garlic and flavoursome. A spoon of that onto the rice dish add that perfect kick needed to make it a good simple lunch fix.\nMy usual char kway teow went downhill sadly. It was still fresh ho fun but it lacked flavour and depth. It was not as spicy as it used to be and in fact it was more bland than it used to be. There was minimal egg to be seen and portion went down as well. I've heard most of the chefs have left since the new manager took over but no reason was given. That could explain the cooking changes. They must be using a different curry powder or paste to.\nCrispy pork noodles had mix opinions. My friend was sad to find that the noodles had change and are a lot thinner. It didn't effect me as it just made things more lighter and crisper but some might like it with more bite. As a business perspective I can see these noodles being quicker to fry. This actually became my favourite dish of the three as I enjoyed the long shredded pork and the thinly chopped mix vegetables on top that created a good layered of texture. The sauce was seasoned perfectly for me and yes although greasy it was expected, nothing has changed there. \nNow I didn't feel service had change at all- not like it bothered me. But there was no major improvements. Still no smile or polite welcoming. Our waiter still quickly pointed to the back which some can consider rude and asked us to pick any table there. Our female waitress who delivered our food was nicer and answered the majority of our questions given but she seemed genuinely nice and not like she had particular training. \nStill quite intrigued if any other dishes have changed at Wong Kei especially the Wonton Noodle Soup. Still I somehow feel the old Wong Kei is lost and being the most 'cheap' and 'generous' portions in Chinatown is no more. But for it's roast meats, chilli oil and crispy noodles there is a reason for return."

Just came from a walking tour of Downing St, Big Ben and St James Park changing of horse guard.  We had the roast meat rice \u00a36, wanton noodles \u00a36, mushrooms chicken rice hot pot \u00a38 for small and fried rice noodles with egg sauce & beef \u00a36. About \u00a326 for 5 of us. There's a 15 mins wait for the rice hot pot. We forewarned every one on our table that service can be variable in tone. Not bad for a cold gloomy winter's day. Free hot tea but we opted for hot water."

Overall, it was decent. None of the dishes really stood out to me. They're merely meeting my expectations for Chinese food. My parents did say the steamed fish dish that they had was actually amazing though so that counts for something I suppose. \nI encountered inconsistently slow service here which isn't uncommon for Chinese places. I'm pretty sure the two tables next to me got their food before me despite showing up afterwards. However, being insulted at one is new to me. When I asked the waitress where my food was long after her estimates had passed, she said it's my fault that I'm so impatient because I'm from mainland China. Thanks for assuming that just because I'm a foreigner who can speak Chinese, I'm automatically from China. \nI was also hoping for a break from pricey pubs, but in the end, the total came out to about how much I'd spend at a pub so it wasn't as cheap as I had hoped. Also an itemized bill would be nice so I can be sure I'm not being ripped off."

Personally I am not a fan of the free jasmine tea they serve, but that's just personal taste. \nThe chilli oil provided on the table is also amazing - definitely the best in Chinatown. No other place comes close with their chilli oil. \nService has gradually improved over the years, though still known for being rude, it is now more in a playful fashion, as if only done to keep up the reputation. I tend to find that you are treated nicer if you come alone and sit on the ground floor, and treated more as a burden if in a group.\nWould be 5 stars if they accepted card - cash only can be a drag."

Most Chinese in the US are Szechuan and/or dumpling--even if they have no special dumpling skill: they serve the standard steamed dumplings.  I appreciated that Wong Kei sticks with what they do best: noodles.\nWe shared a beef with black bean sauce and a shredded chicken with fried noodles. Both were good. they did not bring any white rice for the bean sauce dish, which is odd when coming from the US--they brought it when we asked.

I'm not saying this place is dirty (figure of speech), but its cleanliness is on par with a typical cheap Chinese restaurant.\nI've had the Beef Flat Noodle and Slippery Egg & Beef Rice, which were average to below average. Quality was okay, service was pretty nonexistant; just go in, eat, and get out. I did feel slightly rushed here - though it might have been a more psychological thing for me than actual waiters trying to rush us out.\nThe servers seem to give bad service on purpose, but it's all in good fun - as if they're playing a part. They actually aren't rude and quite courteous. I remember one visit I was watching as a waiter kept his eye pinned on a little kid jumping around in a seat. The server mentioned to the family that it was dangerous for the kid (~3 years old) to be jumping on the seat like that, and that it could tip over - which the parents just ignored. The waiter had his eye on the kid whenever he wasn't serving someone else, and would occasionally jerk towards the kid/seat when the kid seemed to be losing his balance. Nice guy - though he told one of our party to get their own chopsticks when asked to get a set of chopsticks (which he did get)."

We awkwardly sat down and said a little hello to our neighbours opposite us, already eating their meal. After they had finished and left, they were replaced by two others. So our date turned out to be not so much a date. We had it good though on our table of 6 with only 4 people. Behind us were an older couple sat opposite two young Indian guys on a four seater table. It looked super cramped and awkward. At least we weren't single diners. The downstairs is reserved for single diners only. I don't know what's worse...being singled out because you're single or being forced to sit within perfect distance to be able to hear the couple opposite whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears whilst we devoured our food.\nOnto the food...We had the deep fried salt and chilli squid which was actually amazing. Not greasy, lightly battered, great flavours. We also had a pork, chicken, duck and vegetable dish which has basically just pork with pak choi. Find duck or chicken and you were lucky. Good sauce though. \nWould we come back? No. Too many other places to try in Chinatown and this one did not stand out. Service was okay compared to what other diners have written.

I decided to walk inside to grab a lunch and see how they do. \nWhen I got inside, they quickly gave me some tea. The tea was fairly bitter and tasted kind of bland. I don't think the people who work here speak English very well, and I ended up speaking Cantonese Chinese to them. The t-shirts they wore were pretty cool as well. \nI ordered the Fish with tofu over rice. The fish was pretty bony, but there was a decent crisp in the fish, and I thought it was decent at the best. It is not high on my recommendations to order at this place unless you do not mind eating fish meat from the bone. The tofu was pretty good though as well as the rice. The dish also had some Chinese mushrooms and ginger as well. The ginger put some flair into the flavour of the dish, while the mushrooms were pretty tasty. Portions were pretty good and I got my stomach full. As for the prices, most of the dishes were under \u00a39, so it's fairly inexpensive for a city like London. I paid \u00a35.70 for my dish, which is probably the least amount of money I spent for a meal in London so far. \nOverall, this is not a bad place to grab something inexpensive to eat in London and I would not mind coming back here again.

The food is actually incredibly good for the most part, with some of the best duck soup noodles and soft shell crab locally in my opinion (a lot of the local competitors use a lot of veg in their soup so a lot of the rich duck flavour is lost). It is very good value for money, with massive portions, and is very cheap. You can tell it's cheap from the decor, the tableware and the fact that Wong Kei is infamous for it. Do not expect Western-style service. You will not get it. The waiting staff are very quick and also very to-the-point and for the majority of times I've been there, are not going to faff around. I personally have no problem with this but I know it's not for everyone. If you are a couple, you may be seated at a large table with other people if they're very busy. You could always wait for a smaller table to become available but it could be said to be part of the Wong Kei experience. This has only happened to me once and I've been as a pair several times, usually being seated downstairs on the smaller tables.\nGreat food, great price for said food, and exceptionally fast service."

    "review": "Wong Kei. The best part about this is the name which let's be honest is a bit hilarious. Especially when your aunt keeps saying it in a slightly northern accent. She was raving about the Singapore fried noodles here and since she was the woman of the hour, we went.\nThe place looks like a canteen on a large scale. Not to worry, I thought, the best Chinese places tend to look unimpressive as they care solely about the food. So I said to myself (no I didn't say \"Self\"...I mean who actually does that?) that I'd judge it on the food alone with just a bit on the service.\nThe service overall was pretty good, barring a slight issue at the beginning where they refused to put two tables together (there were roughly 15 of us in the group). Why you ask? No, not because they were too busy or that they didn't' have the tables (they were about half full at best and could easily seat 100 covers), but rather because they \"just didn't do that\". A bit of an odd response for a restaurant to have as I'd imagine keeping 15 hungry diners in a half empty restaurant is a pretty good idea business wise. So we had a mini-standoff between several angry Indian mums and 2 Chinese guys...needless to say the mums won.\nAnyways, finally seated together, I get left with the dubious honour of ordering for the group (as seems to happen more often these days...). Naturally we got several portions of these Singapore fried noodles along with a selection of meat dishes and a roast Peking duck to start.\nThe duck was alright but by no means up to par with that for the Four Seasons (the lovely restaurant in Queensway or Chinatown not the hotel). It has some decent flavour but too much of the fat had been rendered away leaving the meat just a tad dry. We also ran out of pancakes quite quickly and couldn't get the attention of any of the waitstaff to ask for more.\nThe meat dishes we had ordered (the typical staples of Westernised Chinese dining) included beef in black bean sauce, pork in oyster sauce and chilli, cashew chicken, and grilled eel. The eel turned out to be a popular favourite despite not being the melt in your mouth bbq eel I had expected. It was grilled with the skin on and a light flavourful sauce. The skin was too rubbery to really eat but had done an excellent job of protecting the tender meat within. The rest of the dishes could not distinguish themselves from the average Chinese takeout but were satisfying in general.\nFinally, the Singapore noodles. I love my aunt, but I don't know what she was on about with these things. They tasted a bit bland and limp and lacked any of the fiery bite of other such noodle dishes I've tried nor did it have sufficient variety in texture to be appealing. They functioned just fine as a base for other dishes but then again so does egg fried rice. Overall, very disappointed in this but that might be due to the hype as well. \nThoughts: It's cash only so be sure to bring a few notes. Price wise it's pretty decent with the whole meal coming up to around \u00a310pp (which in true asian fashion was fought over with each adult trying to pay for all of it). You can BYOB but they will charge you a corkage fee of \u00a33-5/bottle that they see. So bring a case of identical bottles, just open one, and switch out the empties for a full one whenever the staff aren't around!"

The food is great, the service is quick and the quality is fabulous.\nThe thing is about Wonkies and this is whether you like traditional Chinese meals or not there service of feeding people is known all around London and the rest of the world, the prices are reasonable and the restaurant itself has the all the Feng Shui you need to know where you at, what style of food your eating and more importantly you will be able to eat in the knowledge your not being over charged.\nThe grubs great, its always busy and the staff there have been there since day one. This business is making money, and they need to because the overheads down West End are sky rocket.\nThe type of people who eat in this restaurant vary, you have the traditional China town residents, regulars and people like me who venture down West regularly to eat Chinese food. Even if it was not Chinese food I would probably still eat there, because I like Chinese tea (sound familiar?). If so you will love Wonkies as am sure you already know having been there is you get free green tea, not just any old green tea but green tea that helps you clear your palette before eating and green tea that helps you wash down your food.\nIf I have any grumbles about Wonkies it is about the pepper, now it has not happened for a while perhaps because its the summer and the air is much drier but previously I have found the pepper shaker to be blocked. This means simply tapping the pot and sometimes means having to take of the top lid and scrape away the troublesome blocks of pepper, once years ago the pepper fell out onto my food, but anyway I still ate it because I get very hungry. I once invited my pops and brother but unfortunately they declined coming and took me to the pub instead.\nWell what did they miss out on rather than just speaking about the free condiments and wonderful abundance of chopsticks. Sweet and sour is always a favourite with us English. For the health fanatics out there I recommend asking the waiter for greens with your meals, the crispy belly pork is great. The best thing about Wonkies though is the duck is does not matter whether your talking duck pancakes or Duck on rice is all very yummy. Another great meal if your ok with pork and don't mind prawns is a pasta based meal. This meal is called fried Quon Dou its yummy just try it with a huge dollop of the yummy chilli sauce, you will not regret this one the foods great.\nSea lovers ship ahoy there's a great meal that is a set meal with pasta that comes with yummy fish-balls calamari or squid and a yummy spinach based leave to soak up the gooey sauce.\nIf your in two minds about eating Chinese when your down the West End in London and are unsure where to turn or take your large party of hungry friends then Wonkies is where you should turn.\nP.S. Another little tip there is often budget meals on the walls with special that are not necessarily on the menu, there nice but I would not get to distracted the food I spoke of here is well worth checking out for now. If your really adventurous your could try the intestines or the offal dishes but I usually go with what's your normal Chinese grub, but if its a dessert your after your stuffed there are no sweets at Wonkies. Final note yes they do sell Chang beer. Happy eating."

The interior is clean and the menu is expansive with options for everyone.\nWe ordered the duck, the chow mein, tofu with broccoli, and orange chicken. All of the food was FAR too salty besides the duck which was cooked perfectly. The only thing I would order again would be the duck. Everything else was too greasy, slimy, and salty.\nOverall, would not come here again! I had hopes since the yelp reviews were decent but this place disappointed me."

    "review": "My husband and I found ourselves wandering around Chinatown shortly after seeing a musical in the West End.  Many of the restaurants had menu boards outside.  Most of them were open late and we were interested in a snack.  \nI had a terrible time deciding where to stop.  I'm pretty picky about my Chinese food after doing a study abroad in Shanghai a few years ago.  However, when we came upon Golden Dragon, all signs pointed to \"here.\"  First, there were about a million Yelp stickers on the window and I love yelp, it rarely steers me wrong.  Secondly, Golden Dragon is the name of our favorite Chinese restaurant back home.  Third, my husband saw the ducks and knew that was exactly what he wanted so in we went.  \nMy husband debated over which version of the duck to get and eventually decided on the duck with rice based on the recommendation of the server.  He LOVED it.  He said it was one of the best things that he ever put in his mouth.  It was by far and away his favorite meal in London, but one of his favorite meals of the year.  He wouldn't shut up about it the rest of the trip.  \nI ordered egg fried rice which I know sounds really boring, but it sounded incredible to this pregnant lady.  My stomach is super out of whack these days so I wanted something simple.  It was also very late so I didn't want to eat anything too heavy either.  I don't think the photo I took of my rice does it justice.  It looks really boring, but it was actually super delicious.  It had great balance of flavor.  \nFinally, the prices were reasonable and the service was fast and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place."

But then I looked over at someone else's table and their version looks like it's ready for a tv commercial. The waitress told me it was because I said I wanted soft noodles inside of crispy. The bbq pork looked like it was days old, had no red outer glaze, and was inedible. I asked the other waiter if he would eat it and he paused for a good minute making an awkward smile then replied no. Nothing was done to resolve this.  \nThe other dishes we ordered were ok at best.\nFYI - Service fee of 12.5% is added to your bill automatically. The table next to us was screaming about it"

    "review": "My girlfriend and I luckily stumbled upon London's Chinadown while taking a stroll around Piccadilly Circus. Although there were plenty of restaurants to choose from, we rolled the dice on Golden Dragon after seeing their decent Yelp reviews. \nIt was no surprise that about 95% of the customers were non-Asian and, from the looks of it, were probably tourists, but don't let that deter you from thinking the food was not legit. Once we got inside and were seated, we actually could have easily mistaken the restaurant for any Chinese restaurant we had been to back home in New York. In addition, we were greeted by employees that spoke to us in Cantonese, and in a way it made us feel like we were home. \nAs for the menu and food, the menu selection was huge and very detailed. Every legit food that we could get back home was on the menu for all to see. All of it in Chinese and English. The only gripe we had about the menu ... the prices! Everything was much more expensive here.\nAfter mulling over the menu, we decided on the Crispy Sucking Pig, Orange Duck and Tofu with green vegetables. When the dishes came out there was an obvious observation and that was that the dishes were kind of small for family style type food. The flavors were OK, but nothing like we hadn't had before. However, it wasn't a bad thing either because we now knew that London had a Cantonese food scene that we didn't realize existed prior.\nBottom line: The restaurant was huge (with 2 floors), the employees were fairly nice and spoke good English, the menu was legitimately true to Cantonese style food and the flavors were average compared to what we had experienced back home."

I dare not offend, but yes!\nMy mates and I were just craving some Peking duck and this restaurant, filled with yelp stickers on their window, served us exactly what we wanted. I would say I have an average knowledge of Peking duck around the world. Beijing tends to be really fatty and oily because that's how they like it. Hong Kong tends to serve the skin and aerate it so it's crispy and light. London, on the other hand, serves it crispy and light but cuts off loads of meat so we can eat the meat too!\nWe also ordered some other side dishes as well. Roast pork, Pei Pa Tofu, Kung Po Chicken, Garlic Kale. They were all very tasty and I can see myself trying other things on the menu in the future. I'm making a mental note to try their Dim Sum in the new year!\nIn terms of service, I felt that it could be better. Like any Chinatown restaurant, I find that they're a bit pushy. They wanted us to order food as soon as possible, eat and leave. I'm use to that. But I don't see why they need to be that pushy when they still have extra tables for customers."

This place is in the heart of Chinatown in Soho and while it was very busy the night I was there, it took less than ten minutes to be seated.  Taking a tip from other reviewers I tried the crispy duck appetizer, then some wonton soup, followed by a crispy beef with chili main course.  Overall the food was quite good and I did not find it too salty as some reviewers have found it.  The duck was the best and I would not hesitate to go back just for that dish.  The soup was overflowing with wontons which was great, but the flavor was mild.  I expected the crispy beef with chili to have some heat to it, and it may have, but this was cut by its sweetness.  Reminded me of General Tso's chicken I have had elsewhere, which would have been fine but I was expecting a more savory and hotter dish (this was no fault of the food or it's preparation, just my expectations)."

For food we went for three dishes - sauteed prawns with vegetables, monk vegetable dish, and honey barbecue pork (I don't remember the exact names) - and three orders of white rice. \nAfter we ordered, the lady taking our order indicated that she thought three dishes wouldn't be enough for us - this was fine, but what bothered me was how when we said we would order more later if that turned out to be the case, she said that if we did that we would have to wait 20 minutes for the next round of food...I also didn't appreciate how when we got three orders of rice (for four people) and I asked how big the rice portions were, she said they were \"very small\" and \"only for one person.\" Both of her claims turned out to be wrong, however, as the three dishes were perfect for feeding four people, and the rice portions were HUGE.\nAnyway, I was very satisfied with the food. My favorite dish was the prawns, which I thought was very light but well-flavored. I also liked the monk vegetable dish, which came with stir-fried tofu, mushrooms, and other greens. The honey barbecue pork though...I wasn't a fan - it was very difficult to chew and was too heavy on the sauce, in my opinion.\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here (despite the service in the beginning) and the food definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food. I've been to a couple other Chinese restaurants in the area, and this place has definitely been my favorite so far in terms of both food and service (overall)."

It didn't take long before we were seated, at first we were told to go upstairs, but the lady saw we had luggage and didn't wanted to hand them in the \"wardrobe\" so she found another spacious table for us close to the door. We ordered a couple of things and got our chinese tea pretty quickly. 1 teapot were charged for 5 people and I see the same teapot everywhere it doesn't even depend on how many people were drinking from that. Our orders arrived pretty fast and before we thought about taking picture of our first dish, it disappeared quickly since we were so hungry! It looked delicious but I miss a bit taste to it, the others at the table agreed it was the fried beef ricenoodles. Then our fung chao arrived, there was nothing to complain about it. The charsiu buns were also fine! We also ordered 1/2 duck, it was perfect but a little bit raw since the meat was a bit too rosy. We also ordered charsiu cheong fun and it was smooth and delicious! \nLast but not least, we know that in London there's always a discretionairy charge so we were fine with it, but the waiter never came back with our change, at least if he was expecting tips, he should have come back with our money first, BEFORE TAKING WITHOUT ASKING.

We had:\n- Baked crab with ginger and scallions:  this is a classic Cantonese preparation of crab although I'd never had it baked.  The crab was perfectly cook and the flavour was spot on.  They used a bit too much cornstarch to coat the crab though and brown crab and coating generally was gloopy because of it.  Still tasty but the consistency could have been less viscous.\n- Gai lan with oyster sauce:  again, another classic Cantonese dish.  Unfortunately, the gai lan was overcooked.   The stalks should have been still slightly crunchy but instead were very soft.\n- Salt and pepper pork chops with chillis:  very tasty seasoning which was great with rice.

First of all, the dim sum menu (like most Yelpers said) is super friendly - with pictures for each menu item served so you know exactly what you are getting. I'm Chinese but my Chinese is shabby so I always somehow manage to order a wrong dish when faced with a menu with no pictures and just text (even when it's translated into English). The wait was under ten minutes for two people at 2:00pm on a busy Saturday. \nWe got: shrimp/chive dumplings (good), bbq pork triangular pastries (a must get, there's a reason this menu item takes up one FULL page of their dim sum menu - it is definitely one of the hottest centrefolds I have ever seen), chicken feet w/ black bean sauce (really good), scallop cheung fun (pass, I have had better), fried shrimp dumplings with salad cream (pass, I have had way better), beef chow fun (good), taro croquettes (good), duck tongue (good, if you are into that stuff--my date was), and steamed spare ribs w/ black bean sauce (portions are too small but they are good). \nAs for the spotty service, we didn't experience any. You get different servers who bring you what you have ordered and some of them are smiling, some of them are not - but who cares? I feel like people who leave bad reviews just because not every server smiled at them when they put the food down is just looking to get their egos stroked. The food is piping hot, fresh and delicious. When you ask for water, it comes fast and when you want an extra plate of chili oil, it comes right away. Tea pot out of hot water? Flip the top up and put it on the edge of your table - it is a Chinese standard way of telling the servers you are in need of a tea refill. Tea is \u00a31.50 pp but it has unlimited refills, and the refills come fast, which is surprising since my date and I  were seated in a dark corner - we thought they would forget about us, but that was far from the truth. \nI'm a generous tipper but don't like to be ambushed with the mandatory 12.5% service charge when handed the bill. This was the first dim sum place in Chinatown to have that mandatory 12.5% - so I took one star away.

It deserves 4 stars for the food, however, the service seems to be a bit worse than before. \nLast weekend, a friend and I decided to have dim sum for lunch and I suggested GD. There were only the 2 of us, so, we were going to order 4 dishes. When we finished placing our orders, the waitress said, \"Minimum order 6 dishes!\" Well, we had no choice but ordered 2 more. \nGuess it must be a new policy, I don't really suggest anyone to go alone in this case, unless you have a big appetite. \nBut at the end the dim sum were still good."

So I actually want to Mark it as 3.5 out of 5. A nice to try out but I am not amazed by their food.  \nI always find it hard when my friend asks me for a authentic Chinese restaurant for them to try. It is not necessary the way they cook are different,  but it is just the fact that you can't get the same fresh meat and seafood in the UK compared to China.  Especially for Cantonese cuisine,  the freshness of the ingredients are the soul of the dishes. Similar to Italian cuisine,  if the ingredients are not fresh,  u can't copy the taste in Italy. \nBut this Restaurant is surely perfect for family as they have lots of space!! So difficult to find another like this in China Town.  So easy for family with kids!"

We ordered tea, --the waiter poured out hot water, caught himself halfway through the pour and came back with actual tea a few minutes later.  Beware the food takes time coming out; the appetizers came out timely, the entree dishes took another 45 minutes & we were served finally only after we asked a waitress -- our original waiter had disappeared --  whatever happened to our order about 30 minutes in.  She checked the order computer then came back and assured us just another 10minutes.  It was another 15minutes, and I was a bit tired and grumpy at that point, but okay let's blame it on the disappeared waiter.  \nbtw London Chinatown itself was hustling and bustling and fun for people-watching on a Wednesday night.

It is my default recommendation for anyone looking for dim sum because the quality is consistent and well above average, plus the location is central. I know Chinatown restaurants seem to get a bad rep, but I go by my taste buds.\nThe dim sum menu is really friendly, with pictures so you can point if you're a newbie. The service is \"Chinatown standard\", brusque and efficient, sometimes a bit hard to get someone's attention, but only a little rude. They only have one kind of tea, unfortunately.\nMust-gets: baked pork puff, taro croquettes, prawn and chive dumplings, egg tarts for dessert. Their specialty is sesame balls, which are sweet, and I haven't quite figured out when to order them because they take some time to prepare (unless they're sold out). The time is variable: 15 minutes to an hour(!). Sometimes I order them with everything else, and then they come before we're ready. Sometimes I order as we're finishing, but then the wait is too long. It's a mystery. But totally worth it.\nFine: cheung fun, steamed pork bun, beancurd prawn rolls, Chinese greens (hard to mess up). I once tried the crispy seafood noodles, which were a little disappointing.\nThey don't take reservations for Sunday dim sum, so just show up at noon. By the time we leave, there's always a queue out the door. Last time was just under \u00a313pp with 7 people, including tea and service charge."

We wanted something relatively affordable and served quick to feed 7 hungry people.\nIt didn't take us long to decide what to order and in 15 minutes, piping hot dishes of minced pork with aubergrine, mushroom and chinese broccoli, chicken fried rice, beef teriyaki, chicken with scallion and ginger graced the table. It was like a war of chopticks and forks when everybody dived into their food. The roast duck with steamed buns took longer to arrive and by then, we'd already placed an extra order of fried rice, because, Asians LOVE their rice! the boys each had a bottle of Tiger beer to round out the greasiness of our food. I stuck with good old black tea.\nDecor is typical Chinese resto with wooden accents and year round Christmas tree lights. The tablecloths were tattered looking but the plates are clean. Service was so-so and we had to flag our waiter down for our bill which was 100 quid with tips. Overall, an ok choice in Chinatown but we should've just gone to the $6.99 AYCE buffet across the street."

They charged us about 3.5 British pounds- that's over 4 US dollars-for a small bowl of white rice!  The worst part of our experience was that we had 2 grand-babies with us. While the 3 y.o. quietly ate her small bowl of plain white rice, the 2 y.o. was getting restless so we let him play with the small salt shaker where he put salt into a bowl, so he doesn't throw a tantrum or food around. The short man, whom I found out was the owner, marched over to our table in anger and scolded us for wasting his salt. He looked visibly angry. We spent 37 BPs ($48) for the light lunch, so I am sure we more than paid for the 5 cents worth of salt my grand-baby wasted.  As we were leaving, he lectured us about controlling the children. What a piece of work. He was plain mean and stingy."

Furthermore, in order to get our last plate to come out, we tried to flag a waiter down several times, only to be either ignored or unseen. One of the members of my party had to get up and talk to one of them in order to get them to bring the last dish out.

Just going by their conventional menu GD appears to be no more touristy than the next.\nHaving visited for dim sum several times before booking Chinese New Year dinner, both of GD's on- and off-menus are, in terms of breadth and regional focus (soups, seafood and veggie dishes of the Cantonese persuasion), very much congruent to what one would find in major U.S. cities with a size-able Chinese population and, arguably, Hong Kong itself.  \nMost tourists and locals would for the most part opt for the BBQ items dangling from the shop window, but it's clear just looking about the dining floor that Chinese customers are calling up steamed sea bass, lobster on egg noodles and single-serving specialty soups.\nLike anything else in the city, eating out in London can be quite expensive and Chinatown is no exception.

They don't keep the checklist at your table like other places do. We were served ice water that was absolutely funky, tasted like watered down rice wine. It probably wasn't alcohol, but maybe some result of a dirty glass?"

    "review": "On previous trips to London, I've walked past Golden Dragon, thinking it looked too touristy.  But I read some good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try.\nI walked up next to the cash register, waiting to be seated.  Many employees were rushing by all around me, apparently busy.  Finally one noticed me and seated me.\nThe Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (hoe yau gie lon) and the rice arrived at the same time.  They were both tepid.  With electric rice cookers nowadays, which can keep cooked rice fresh and hot for 24 hours, how is it possible to serve tepid rice?\nThe tofu and seafood hot pot (dung gong dau fu boe) did arrive hot and steamy.  It had generous pieces of tofu, some pieces of squid and shrimp, some mushroom caps, and very tender but not overcooked baby bok choy -- all in a broth.  This is a standard Cantonese menu item.  Here, however, the tofu had been stuffed with shrimp and deep fried before being put into the broth.  I wondered, why go through the bother of deep frying something and then putting it into a broth?  And why stuff the tofu with shrimp when this dish already has shrimp in it?  Then the thought crossed my mind that the deep fried shrimp-stuffed tofu could be an \"overstock\" dim sum item.  This dish (dung gong dau fu boe) is typically made with regular, plain tofu.\nThe service was not friendly, but it was efficient.  It was easy for me to flag down a server and ask for some hot sauce.  (In some Chinese restaurants, this is impossible.)\nMy beverage was Chinese tea.  The bill came to \u00a324.40.  It was not itemized.  I added a 10% tip.  However, I was just re-reading some of the of reviews for this restaurant and they mention that the gratuity was included in the bill.  My bill had nothing broken out."

I never get their main entrees and just stuff my face full of dim sum so can't comment on that (although my father had a beef entree there which was huge and that he enjoyed).  \nDownside of this place, like most of the restos in chinatown is that it looks a bit run-down, easily forgettable decor for sure, and the staff is not the most attentive or gentile buuuut, I don't think I've ever been to a Chinese restaurant where the staff cracks a smile so I'm going to assume it's a cultural thing and just shove another dim sum in my belly.  Cause at the end of a dim sum day, that's all I really care about, quality dim sum that isn't ridiculously priced and you'll find it here!"

The Golden Dragon is a special favourite of mine, simply because it's never let me down. \nWhilst the menu is full of all the standard tasty stuff, it's the Dim Sum that I dribble over. There's none of your Ping Pong pretension here -  presentation is average, but the dishes are reasonably priced, generous and taste divine. I absolutely love the Prawn Cheung Fun and the Char Siu. \nThe place is big, sprawling and I often wonder whether they have a hierarchy system in placing people upstairs or downstairs. I'm still trying to work that one out as it all seems rather random. Service is typically unfriendly but fast and efficient. \nI've spent hours here over lunch, catching up with friends and slowly becoming more whale-like. It's definitely easy to keep eating. At least it keeps gym memberships alive!"

Maybe because of the rave on YELP and also an auntie we met on the road that said this place is quite well known for its Dim Sum in the area, so I thought it was going to be good but turned out to be sub par. Pretty average dim sum in my opinion. Nothing really stood out. Not elegant, no unique taste.\nTaste Breakown\nHar Gow: it was ok. just your typical taste, typical size\nSiu Mai: there was a piece of shrimp on the top. feels a bit like the taste of har gow more than the typical siu mai which is more of a pork taste.\nSiu Long Bao: no juice inside. did not even make my mouth water (not hard to do when I'm hungry).\nI thought the price was ok since I have had more expensive ones and also cheaper ones but maybe in London, this is cheap. I saw another table ordering actual dishes and those look quite good so maybe their other food might be better but based on my own experience on the Dim Sum... it was sub par and therefore the 2 stars."

The entrance is a bit hidden in the corner but once you locate the bouncer at the door, the location is easily given away.  We arrived at 8:30 on a Sunday night and the place was hopping. You have to make your way down a dark staircase to the Uber cool cavernous space which opens up to a giant multi-room restaurant with super high ceilings and very minimalist and tasteful decor. The bathrooms are so well hidden the panel doors look like part of the wall. They're very beautiful inside once you find them! \nWe made our way to the bar for a cocktail after we requested a table with side by side seating (which they were happy to accommodate with a modest wait). The bartender has apparently been with the hakkasan family for 8 years starting in Abu Dhabi and now taking up residence at the original london location. He informed us that despite the crowd we were seeing that evening that this was a particular quiet night and that the place is usually so packed that the wait at the bar can be quite long. We opted for the London only cocktails specifically the Tusan Fizz  and Mountain Peak. Watching the bar tender make these cocktails was like watching an artist at work.. and they were just as tasty as they were beautiful. \nWe decided to try the three style mushrooms and the London only spicy okra for our vegetarian dishes. We also ordered the spicy prawns. But the two stars without question were the crispy duck salad and the sweet and sour pork....omg...heaven on a plate. \nThe desserts at our neighboring table looked elaborate and yummy but we were so full. The service here was so wonderful. We chatted with several servers during the course of our meal and they were attentive, friendly and doting without being overbearing. \nWe loved this place so much we vowed to try the NYC location as soon as we return stateside. And we will be making our way there with very high expectations in just a few weeks! \nFrom what I understand the newer Mayfair location in London has parking and is busier than this one, but there's something about this venue that just oozes \"trendy\" and the mystique is just hard to replicate."

A woman at the door checks your name and then sends you in and down the stairs.  There is a little bit of smoke and incense on the walk down and it just adds to the aura.  \nYou are met downstairs by a hostess who checks your coat, and if the table isn't ready, escorts you to the bar.  We only waited a few minutes before our table was ready and we were seated.  Our server took our drink orders and got us on our way.\nThe menu is huge.  Really huge.  We decided our best bet was to order several small items and get a broader taste of what Hakkasan has to offer.\nWe went with the Supreme Dim Sum Platter, Crispy Duck Roll, Morel Mushroom and Vegetable Spring Roll, and the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs.  \nThe Supreme Dim Sum Platter is amazing.  The presentation was outstanding.  The platter came with eight dumplings total.  It consisted of two each of the following: gold leaf lychee and lobster, abalone and chicken shumai with caviar, Royal King Crab jade, and black truffle and Dover sole.  I wish I could do the taste of the these dumplings justice with my words but I just don't possess the vocabulary.  It was flat out absolutely delicious.  \nThe duck roll, spring roll, and pork ribs were also extremely tasty.  You can't go wrong with any of these orders.\nThe place is a bit loud so be prepared to speak up and have an amazing experience at Hakkasan!"

    "review": "So ok, this is probably the best dim sum you can get in London.  However, they are on the pricey side so be prepared to pay more than your normal cheaper dim sum place like Oriental or Royal China (best 2 cheap dim sums).  And their dim sum are served in odd number of 3 as oppossed to the normal 4.  Which also shows how pricey they are.  That's said, it is by far the best dim sum you can get in London.  Try not to go there for the normal Chinese food as they are just OK and they are cheaper elsewhere.  Just come for the dim sum on weekend and on Sunday, I believe they have the dim sum menu for brunch so only go for this if you want.  If you go on other weekday dinner, their dim sum is extremely limited and only for appetizer (unless they have changed this but I encourage you to check the time they will serve their extensive list of dim sum.  Cocktails here are great too as they have asian flavours in them."

    "review": "The only Michelin-starred restaurant we have been to in London has been Barrafina, but a year or two before they were actually rewarded a star (I know, so much foresight). So it seemed to me that not having eaten at one before we leave for good would be a mark on our soul, so I looked up...Yahuatcha...due to my own love for dimsum. But after perusing through their menu, I became unsure as to whether there would be a marked difference between the dimsum there vs the dimsum i might find at Jade Garden in Chinatown, aside from the prices and ambiance. \nAnd then I perused the menu at Hakkasan. And then I couldn't decide. And then I consulted my college roommate who's been Yahuatcha and didn't see a huge difference and i was still in indecision..until i found that Hakkasan has a tasting menu of  \u00a338 which included a cocktail, an app, main, and dessert (per person). It also came with rice and stir-fried asparagus during the main, which i did not expect.\nThis cheap tasting menu is only available before 6pm Sundays to Thursdays or something (can't remember the details) and not advertised in the restaurant. Although we specifically made a booking for that menu, when they seated us, they did not provide us with it and we had to ask for it in the dim dim underground lighting. The servers when we asked, also told us that we likely will not be full from the menu but we were undeterred.\nThe cocktails were so good. And the food was even better. I was really surprised because my expectations were really low - believing that Chinese food is just Chinese food, but they made it better! Rather than explosion stir-fried wok heat flavours, the food is more delicate and nuanced. \nAfter the dimsum platter, wasabi fried shrimp, duck, cod, and asparagus, the server was right, we were still hungry so we added some ribs from the a la cart menu. Holy the rib was the BEST. And then dessert was so good too. We walked away about \u00a3100 lighter in our bank account, but it was actually worth it. \nI'm looking forward to coming back again."

Took a while to get served for drinks but when we did they were very good.\nWe were then seated at our table. It's a busy, vibrant dining experience so don't come here for a quiet romantic dinner. It's cool though and I liked the vibe.\nTo start I had the veggie dim sum platter which was huge and very tasty. For my main I had the crispy fresh water prawn with dried chilli and cashew nut which was amazing. A mix of beautifully crispy prawns with whole dried chillis and nuts. Honestly loved it (as did my husband). \nHowever, our waitress was pretty terrible. She was rude and spoke limited english (I think she was eastern european) and not very accommodating. This may have just been bad luck but I was not impressed.

The style of food is called \"Modern Chinese,\" and as that implies they take liberties with the classic style and present avant-garde dishes. I went with my granddaughter for their Sunday brunch and we both enjoyed a wonderful meal. One of our favorite dishes was the Crispy Duck Salad, but we also liked the Steamed Dim Sum Platter and the Fried and Baked Platter. The Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs and the Grilled Chilean Sea Bass were also excellent.\nWe left very happy and well satisfied with the meal and the value as well.\nAny complaints? Well, to be completely honest, the service for us was merely 4 stars. No one waitperson took responsibility for our table and the appearances by various individuals were impersonal with rote presentations. Although the servers were rather pleasant and no doubt knowledgeable, we had no Asian servers and they seemed to be mostly Eastern European with heavy accents that were a bit difficult to understand."

A friend and I had a catch-up there after work to treat ourselves, and were given a wonderfully polite welcome from the start with no sign that we were there for last orders from the cheapo menu.\nThe only choice you need to make is meat, fish or veg - my mate and I went fish and meat respectively and shared which was perfect. We both enjoyed our Ling Ling Collins and a trio of dim sum to start - har gau classic, scallop and something yummy with chives. Her aubergine and shiitake salad then arrived but I think we were both more excited by my jasmine tea smoked organic pork ribs. I couldn't taste the tea per se but they tasted delicious with a good amount of meat on them. I liked the nice touch of slicing up the rack at the table and the way they kept it classy by serving them with finger bowls. My main was a generously sized spicy prawn dish, though this time I liked my mate's grilled seabass and honey better. We finished with a delectable trio of macarons in espresso, matcha green tea and passionfruit flavours which (unusually) I could barely finish.\nThe restaurant had gradually filled up around us and it was only on the walk to the toilets that I realised quite how big the place is. The low lighting keeps it feeling intimate while you're seated though, and combined with plenty of dark sexy decor and how beautifully the food is presented I think this would be a good date place. Go between 5.30-6.30pm or after 10pm for the set menu and you can impress them with your savvy bargain-hunting skills too!"

Hakkasan is a gorgeous space, the dark interior with well placed spot lights, delicate gold tapestry, plump noir pillows and pattern carved screens to section off the room and enhance the intimate feel.\nHakkasan is special. You should make an effort to go as its interior will certainly upstage you. Glam, classy and stylish is what you should go for as its a place to celebrate. Beautiful place, food, drink and people. With all this effort on the packaging, what does the content have in store? Well follow me on my birthday dinner journey and you will see. \nWe selected a \"Tast of Hakkasan\" menu for \u00a338 per person. It included a three course meal and cocktail. Value money if i do say so myself and as we roll on, it will become clear why. My cocktail of choice was the Lychee Martini which was absolutely delicious. No scrimping on the Vodka, you could taste the Belvedere. Sam Vanilla, my birthday host, had the Hakka, a mix of vodka, sake, lychee, lime, coconut and passion fruit. Cocktail are a thing at Hakkasan. For years I have heard how amazing they are and they were not a disappointment. \nAs we started our michelin star dining experience, it was a dims sum platter and crispy squid with avocado mustard dressing and caramilised walnut to start. The dim sum selection was a medley of colours and gorgeous ingredients. I tasted king prawn, shitake mushrooms and much more. A delicate devil of a starter! Sam Vanilla loved her subtly coated squid with the right balance between crispy and tender.\nWe settled on a meat feast for our mains with black truffle roasted duck and tea plant mushroom. Wow, truffle is my favourite so the aroma was very tempting. Unfortunately this was not my main choice, so i had to do with a cheeky little fork full of meat and pat the truffle filled air into my direction. I tried something a little different with the wok-fried lamb in a spicy mint sauce. I hit the jack pot too as the lamb was amazing. To describe the food is near impossible as it really is a food journey of loveliness. The sides comprised of baby crunchy asparagus and sticky rice. Again, no taking the eye off the ball, even for the accompaniments. I was truly delighted with this place as a birthday treat! A big thank you to Sam Vanilla, but also a big thank you to Hakkasan for standing the test of time.\nNow it was time for the dessert. Not being one to have a sweet tooth, it was a stab in the dark for me. I was delighted when my milk chocolate, hazelnut praline and rice krispies Jivara bomb arrived. There it was, the wee birthday candle and a message on my plate. Lovely. The bomb was heavenly. Sam Vanilla had the lemon and sesame tart with candied lemon and meringue. A picture of perfection and zest filled dream."

    "review": "I love this restaurant. I went there for my birthday about five years ago, and returned again recently for a special night out. Both times were exquisite experiences - and I use the word experiences, not meals, because this is exactly what separates a good from an outstanding restaurant: attention to detail and the crafting of a dining experience, rather than a focus solely on great food. It's rare that you find such an upscale, modern, sensual and trendy dining experience centered around traditional Cantonese food. Thank goodness they haven't taken the \"Asian fusion\" route (one that almost unfailingly results in quality reduction). \nThe restaurant is down a dark alleyway off Oxford Street. Think James Bond, sexy spy movies, understated luxury. You would assume you were gaining entry into a secret celebs-only club, not a Michelin-starred restaurant. Down the stairs you go, your interest piqued and your excitement growing. The entryway will not disappoint. The interior was designed by the set director of the film The Matrix, and it's stunning. The intricate woodwork, lighting, bustle, aromas, ambiance...all are intoxicating and immediately provide respite from the stressful streets of London. Beautiful people, beautiful food, beautiful bar. \nI remembered specifically the heavenly texture of the silver cod on the menu, so wanted to make sure we ordered it this time. Because of the tantalizing selections on the menu (lovely cocktail list too), we decided to go with a Signature Tasting Menu for 60 pounds per person. We got a dim sum sampler, some of the most flavorful smoked pork ribs I've ever had, and an array of entrees that lived up to my expectations (what a relief). The silver cod was just as perfectly cooked, tender, moist and slippery as I remembered it from the past. The Angus beef stir fry, vegetables and prawn dishes were also amazing. Service was flawless. My husband commented on how it was one of the best dinners he'd had in some time, and how surprising it was that this was Chinese food.....\nThe clientele here is a mixture of people celebrating special occasions and smartly dressed businessmen and women having work networking dinners. The dining room seems to maintain that perfect equilibrium of gregarious but intimate. It's alluring AND trendy. Not sure how the place manages to keep the balance going, but it works and it's a wonderful escape. \nIt's not cheap, but I highly recommend saving some money and time for an experience here if you can. Dress up, go balls to the wall, and have some fun."

The other dim sum were decent, but nothing really stood out and one amazing piece of dim sum doesn't qualify the entire platter.\nThe chicken corn soup was also not impressive, I have had better at Good Earth. It tasted mostly of chicken and not much else.\nThe pepper rib eye beef was really good though and had a lovely peppery aftertaste. I really enjoyed the tender pieces of beef and the yummy sauce they were in. The deep fried prawns were a bit too sweet for me, but my husband really liked them.  We also ordered Hakka noodles, which were thin noodles with great texture but very little flavour at all. They would be great to mix with a spicy sauce-y dish, but on their own they are pretty bland.\nI was excited about the Michelin starred food and although everything was good, nothing really blew me away. It was like going to a good concert but with only low volume music. Perhaps if I had ordered more in a big group I might have been more impressed. The restaurant itself was nice, stylishly dim, but nothing special.\nI have heard that the service is iffy, but our server was nice enough, although I was a bit worried that she was a robot sometimes.

    "review": "Came here for their Dim Sum Sundays as a way to celebrate turning in our dissertations and completing our Master's programmes. I'm super overdue in writing this as we came here last August and the menu has changed a bit. But it was the most perfect, delicious and relaxing lunch I've ever had. I can still remember it as if it was yesterday!\nBesides the food I think a major draw of this place is the atmosphere. The restaurant is hidden away on a tiny side street and when you descend the dark stairs into a wide black-walled yet well lit room it feels very exclusive. The staff are very friendly and polite though I imagine more so when you have a reservation and know exactly what you're doing than if you just happen to wander in. Nevertheless we were well taken care of. We got a nice corner seat with a great view of the whole restaurant. And even though it started to fill up by the end of our meal, we had a sense of privacy the whole time.\nI don't think my descriptions of our dim sum would do the food justice so I'll just say this; it was outstanding. Seriously one of the best meals of my whole life. I can't even decide which course was my favourite. Between the cocktails, the appetizers and main meal, to the desserts and the tea I was a huge fan of everything. And it was so beautiful! Nothing I enjoy more than food that is not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing as well. \nAs far as I know this is one of many Hakkasan restaurants around the world. Now that I'm back in LA I can't wait to try the one here. I admit this is not a restaurant you go to when you're not a budget. But it's nice to splurge every once in a while. Treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience at Hakkasan. You won't be disappointed."

The food was absolutely out of this world. It's hard to put a finger on why it was just so good - but it really was! Tender, moist, flavorsome... just wow! I was really blown away.\nAside from the food, the service is good, the decor is Gothic nouveau and the pricing structure is certainly palatable. For those who have a little cash to spare, you can enjoy some delightful dishes that cost up to and over \u00a3300 a plate. For those that are on a tighter budget, you can go for the tasting menu at around \u00a335 each.

    "review": "My friends and I decided to continue our girls dinners with an early dinner at Hakkasan mid week. We found a \u00a335 Taste of Hakkasan menu, which includes 3 courses and a cocktail - not a bad offer! \nWhen arriving at the 'original' London Hakkasan off of Tottenham Court Road you go down a dark stairway, past the blue lit reception area, into a dark and moodily lit space with the bar at the back.\nAfter a first cocktail at the bar we were shown to our table, they kinda squashed us in, but it was a nice round table.\nWe had Dim Sum and Crispy Duck Rolls for starters, then a choice of either Roasted Silver Cod, Pipa Duck (more crispy duck - I can't get enough of it!) or Stir Fry Black Pepper Rib Eye.\nDesserts were selected from the full main menu - I can recommend the chocolate one!\nSo what's the verdict? \nThe food looked & tasted amazing too, I was only uncertain about the sauce with the Roast Silver Cod, but that wasn't my dish!. Unfortunately the dinner was let down by the service. With a Michellin starred restaurant I expect a certain level, certainly not what we received.\nNot only did we get told that the Taste menu wasn't for those that were hungry - a suggestion that we literally were not going to get enough food, but also the impression that we were being looked down on for choosing this option - staff repeatedly walked into me when serving or clearing the table (it's not that dark in there surely?!) and food didn't arrive at the table at the same time.\nI can't excuse any of these issues when I've been to similar caliber restaurants (Roux at the Landau and Maze) on similar deals and been treated superbly, so this is something that Hakkasan should work on for all levels of client - not just those dropping \u00a3700 for dinner for two (true story, but it wasn't me!).\nAnd the staff member was wrong - we had plenty of food and left feeling stuffed, especially after a pot of tea, post dessert."

We have both wanted to come here for ages but never seem to remember to, as its smack bang in the middle of Oxford Street/Tottenham Court Road. There is another Hakkasan in Mayfair but we wanted to try the original. We were staying at the Hoxton so we had a nice stroll to the restaurant for a pre dinner drink. Our table was ready for us so we had a couple of glasses of bubbles while we drooled over the menu.\nSo I'm incredibly greedy, especially so when it comes to eating Chinese. I pretty much wanted everything. My husband reassured me we would come again so that made making choices less fraught. \nSo to start the dim sum platter and fried soft shell crab. The dim sum were a picture! Best har gau dumplings I've eve had. The scallop shumai was pretty special too. The soft shell crab was cooked to perfection, juicy and crisp.\nFor mains we had the claypot poussin, the black pepper rib eye with merlot and chilli morning glory with rice. The beef was incredibly tender, super tasty and I was sceptical about the merlot. The poussin was covered in an amazing sauce.\nWe were now faced with dessert. Part of me wanted to order more starters after seeing other dishes passing us by, in particular the prawn toast which looked epic! I always get food envy. I had a word with myself and we shared the apple tatin with coffee and jasmine tea.\nIt was a lovely evening and I can't wait to come back again."

We were ushered into a cramped corridor of a bar, where aside from not being able to hear ourselves speak, we were unable to get to the bar as it was so crowded. The disappointing thing was that the bar was full of dissatisfied customers waiting overly long on their tables. Our 9 o clock table came at 9.40, after a huge amount of pestering of the overworked staff. \nThe table we were given was so near the DJ that we couldn't hear, and the table was so dark we couldn't see. Typically, a second after opening the menu, a waiter impatiently asked if we has chosen, and we told him that with our senses so deeply inhibited, it was fairly difficult to discern your a** from your elbow, let alone chose food. In the end we left the restaurant without eating, as the place had the all the charm and character of a reversing dump truck with no tires on. \nIt was a typical restaurant that was greedy- and overbooked hugely, and tried to be too cool. One doesn't go to one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants in the world to listen to repetitive and shoddy music from a low end DJ- in fact a DJ has little place in a restaurant at all. Put a candle on the table, and stop thinking your a hip place. You're not."

Well good for you, but Hakkasan is probably not the way to go unless you don't mind spending an extravagant amount of money on good (but not great) food and don't mind sitting in the dark or being restricted to a 2hrs stay. Having been awarded a Michelin star, Hakkasan does seem self-indulgent with bouncers at the door, service that opens the door for you, takes your coat and bags away from you and is there at your beck and call. All this and yet the entrance looks like it is the entrance to a seedy nightclub, the decor within is dark and simple as if to hide the fact that they couldn't be bothered to inject some vibrant colour into the place and the seating is not only not that comfortable but the tables a quite close together so it is easy to see the food the people next to you are eating.\nNevertheless, the food and drinks are inoffensive and packed with a good variety of ingredients that you may never have tried before, the staff are well trained, and when they cook a chilli dish they don't hold back."

The other aspect that we immediately noticed was the abundance of service staff; it felt more like a hotel check-in rather than a restaurant.  Suppose that's what you should expect form somewhere with a Michelin star!\nAmbiance was dark wood everywhere, but lighting helped with that and set a nice mood.  The star of the show for me was the black truffle roasted duck, which was bursting with rich flavor.  It's not going to hit the spot if you're looking for a sweet taste, but rather the savoury flavour hits you right away.  The sweet and sour pork was also prepared well and was a good price compared to most of the other dishes on the menu (though probably not going to beat your local takeaway).  It gave us pause like 'What's the catch...', but no ill effects to speak of to date.\nDefinitely an occasion restaurant as it's quite pricey, but the service and quality of food seemed worthy of a Michelin star."

    "review": "This is one of my favourite restaurants in London, every plate combines taste with aesthetics and the preparations are always so colourful and good-looking.\nHakkasan is a well known name as it can be found all over the world. In London there are two restaurants, one in Fitzrovia and the other one in Mayfair. The style is nearly identical, consisting in wooden surfaces, glass panes and coloured lights; a cocktail bar, a low-lighting and intimate ambient with some music playing in the background.\nThis is probably one of the most popular restaurants within its category. In fact, people need to book their table some days in advanced since there is always a lot of people and it is very unlikely to ind a table without having a reservation.\nSome of the dishes I suggest the most are the Crispy duck rolls and the Dim sum platter which are two of my favourite plates and I always get them when I go here.\nIf you like Chinese cuisine I strongly suggest you to check this out and maybe also let me know what you think about it. If you are more into Japanese food, there's also that! Always a part of the Hakkasan group, it is called Sake no Hana.\nThis is a review taken from my Travel blog which can be found here: \ngoo.gl/kvy5Oi"

    "review": "This is essentially overpriced Asian food off Tottenham Court Road. I've been to both branches of Hakkasan in London and this is pales in comparison to Hakksan Mayfair in terms of service, food quality and also general decor. Even walking to HHP feels a little eerie given it's at the end of a dark side street. Unfortunately, the inside also suffers from the same poor lighting.\nThis is based on two different experiences from around two years ago as well as one last year (for the sake of clarity) and there are some good dishes on the menu but I've always felt underwhelmed and hungry when leaving. The drinks are average and truthfully, the first time I visited the waitress pretty much turned up her nose at two of my friends who are strict Jains and do not drink. For a Michelin starred Chinese restaurant this is disappointing both in terms of food and service. I live in Hong Kong now and have been to many other dim sum restaurants in London and although some of the dim sum on the weekend menu at Hakkasan are creative they do not justify the price tag in my opinion. The ambience at the other branch is much nicer and I've had better experiences with staff as well as enjoyed the food a little more. A quick tip - don't bring your own birthday cake unless you plan on also ordering dessert here, you will be charged a cake cutting fee per person."

From walking down the two flights of stairs to sitting down in the dimly lit but chicly decorated restaurant, it was a very complete experience. \nI ordered the vegetarian dim sum, which was probably some of the best, most flavorful dim sum I've ever had. There were 4 different types of dim sum in the bamboo container, and 2 of each type. For 11 pounds, this was a great value! It came out steaming hot, with a great texture. I think it had fake meat, vegetables and sauces, and the dim sum came with both soy sauce and spicy chile sauce. I definitely recommend this dish! If you're not too hungry, you can definitely order it as the main dish and split a side of rice.\nThere were 4 of us, and we shared a bowl of fried rice. This was only 5 pounds, and each person got a full bowl. I also tried my friend's vegetarian spicy black bean chicken and beans. This was delicious as well, and super flavorful. \nWe finished with 1 dessert split between the 4 of us. We ordered the Javindra Dessert (or something like that), which is an ice cream chocolate mousse ball coated with a crispy layer and covered in dark chocolate, which they pour after setting it down on the table. It also has pop rocks on the side!\nAll in all, definitely coming back here!"

It was probably the best I have had - lots of flavor and no flavorless dollops of tofu. I had the Three Style Mushroom Stir fry. Normally, I would not select a mushroom only dish although I am a huge fungus fan - largely because I usually find the dishes to be uninteresting but I was intrigued given other menu selections and the restaurant's reputation. It was a good decision - the mushrooms were amazingly flavorful with just the right sauce. My date selected the dim sun option as an appetizer and the stir fry peking duck. Both were very good. Ordering brown rice as an accompaniment must not be common as instead of a substitution for white rice, I got a huge bowl of it and it cost an additional 8 pounds. \nAnd here was the downside:\nService: ...was uneven, and not just a little uneven. We had good service at the bar where service was efficient. I was especially impressed with the well chilled glass in which my date's vodka martini was delivered - perfect!  However service went downhill once we were seated. We dined downstairs. It appeared that the waitstaff was assigned to a section and our waitress was challenged with keeping up with orchestrating the meal. She would disappear for a while and appear at times when we weren't ready. The addition of a second person to take our drink order was poorly coordinated and he did not seem to be very interested in his job nor in our requests. He wasn't interested in explaining the wine list; he plunked our drinks down as if he couldn't wait to leave. We waited an inordinate amount of time to get our bill as well. \nIn addition, the wine list was terrible! It wasn't organized by varietal nor region, nor even flavor profiles. Instead, it was a weird mix of selections under topics such as \"Classics: Fine Wines with History\" (most wines have history and nobody offered to provide the history nor was it explained in the list), \"Vielles Vignes: old vines\" (NOT all French and old vines is an undefined designation) and \"Purity: the expression of the fruit\" (huh?!). I love my wine and I love to peruse a good wine list.  The Hakkasan wine list was just painful and its organization made it impossible to make a selection.  It was so poorly organized that we gave up on finding something and ordered cocktails.\nPrices were really high. I could chalk this up to it being London and London prices but the prices were over the top.\nBefore leaving, I stopped at the bathroom and met another American while washing my hands.  We looked at each other and almost simultaneously said \"Weird\"."

This was amazing how the flavor of the duck and the crispness came together in your mouth. I wish they had brought more. \nThen came out 8 different dim sum dumplings in all. Generally typical (prawn Pork etc) but what stood out to me was the venison. However I wish I had used more pepper sauce on these. \nNext was our appetizer course- since we ha four people we ordered both the squid and the vegetable. Both were crispy. \nI should mentioned that during the meal we had champagne being poured for us the whole time. Not fancy bottles but still very tasty. Went well with meal. \nFinally the mains came and we were getting full. But alas we enjoyed the Seabass and the lamb. The Seabass was a bit fishy tasting (it is fish) but seared well. The lamb was tender but needed more flavor. The fried rice wasn't special but the Bol Chou was good. \nAfter this feast we thought we were finished. But alas after a brief period of rest came dessert. The rest of the table ordered the chocolate sphere thing which crackled in your mouth. Really good with the chocolate sauce poured over it. I however went or the macaroons. Always tasty. Did I mention we also got a dessert cocktail? I got a whiskey one which was quite a nice ending and I thought went well with the macaroons. \nAll in all a great value for Michelin star food. It took all afternoon an was a great opportunity to spend time with friends. Some of the flavor a could have been stronger. Lastly wish it wasn't in the basement but I think it's part of the desired atmosphere"

Considering a cocktail is over \u00a310 and you get one, plus dim sum, a main and a dessert the deal is pretty good. \nIt's kind of classy in a 90s kind of way, it's dark and modern but at the same time it feels a bit bit dated for some reason.  Service was good and the atmosphere was good, food was ok. \nComparing it to the best Chinese, the dim sum was a nice modern twist in terms of flavour but the steamed dim sum's pastry was too thick and floury, and the balance of the filling in the duck spring roll wasn't quite right.  \nThe beef in Merlot sauce was very good with great aromatics, the pippa duck was probably sitting on the pass too long as the skin wasn't that crispy and the cod with champagne and honey sauce was awful.  The cod dish smacked of something to put on the menu to try and elevate the place, why ruin the delicate flavour of fish with such a sickly sauce?  In true Chinese cooking sugar and sweeteners are used as seasoning to bring out natural sweetness not make the dish sweet.  The cod aside it was a pleasant meal (though I wonder why we were offered garlic chilli paste as a chilli dipping sauce) and good value.  The ambience of the place suits a venue to impress because of the all round adequacies but there are better tasting Chinese plates around London."

The first could be your cynical side, observing Hakkasan is basic dim sum and chinese fare prepared exquisitely well.  Could I reconstruct the tastes at 1/5 of the price in LA via an afternoon crawl across the San Gabriel Valley?  Of course.\nBut, much like people, there is something to be said about a restaurant that knows what it wants to be, and has a personality to back it up.  Huge diversity, perfect drinks, and good service make it an easy recommend.\nI have learned very few lessons in life other than the most essential (Always bet on black, never fight a land war in Asia) but a 3rd Hakkasan has confirmed is 'When confronted by Ostrich on a menu...order every damn time\".  It never fails, their version is an amazing balance of heat, sweet, and saltiness over rice."

We paid 120 pounds for 2 people with shared starter and shared dessert. Plus 2 cocktails and Water.\nBut if you want to have a special dinnrr with somebody. Hakkasan is a good spot."

    "review": "I was taken here recently, specifically to be \"impressed,\" and Hakkasan is very much a place to see and be seen. It's tucked away in a subterranean space on a small side street, but once you get inside, it's overwhelming for the senses, with ultramodern d\u00e9cor and a loud, lively lounge atmosphere. \nI tried a number of plates, including the dim sum platter, the stir-fry black pepper beef, and the sweet and sour pork. All were of reasonably high quality and presented gorgeously, if a bit small in size. The drinks were exceptionally strong. Even though I spread out 2 cocktails over 6 shared plates, I still stumbled dizzily up the steps and onto the street as we left later that evening. \nI hate being a party pooper, but it wasn't necessarily the best Chinese I've had - and I'm of Chinese descent to begin with. It was simply very good. I guess stylish d\u00e9cor, attention to detail, and reasonable food quality is all it takes to dress up otherwise conventional Chinese food into a Michelin star and command a truly spectacular price premium.\nIn the end, I enjoyed the overall experience, although I must stress that I'm by no means a high-maintenance person when it comes to being \"impressed.\" ;) All in all, if you're ready to pay a pretty penny, then it's not a bad choice for a special night out or to celebrate with friends."

Six courses, couple of drinks, champagne and dessert. For a very good price. \nThe first course, a crispy duck salad was simply amazing. I still dream about it! It was followed by dumplings, dim sum, rolls, a main course, a small snack, and it was all very very good.\nThe staff was very attentive, the food was excellent, we had some amazing drinks and a lot of champage. All included in the menu we went for. \nThere was a DJ playing, and the restaurant was packed, but even though it was packed, you got all the attention you could expect from the staff. We had a very good time, and I will defiitly go back!"

Rather than anyone intimidating, a very nice women met us outside and checked our reservation, as well as making sure the staff downstairs was prepared for us.\nIn terms of the meal itself, again I can see how it could anything from three to five stars.  The menu is fantastic.  Probably twenty, twenty-five dishes I wish I could of ordered.  The problem was there definitely was inconsistency.  Some food was wow, this is what I expect from a top London restaurants.  Others were weaker than what you would get at a local Chinese restaurant.  Started with the Dim Sum platter, which was interesting, but flavor and complexity did not stand up to the top Dim Sum around Leicester Square.  The appetizers that jumped out were duck rolls (spring rolls filled with duck) and the ribs, which had a great caramelized exterior.  Both of those clearly five stars.\nI was with four other people so we were able to sample multiple entrees.  I had Pipa Duck, effectively peking duck without the pancakes.  It was perfectly prepared and everyone who tried it loved it.  Also stand out was a black beef dish.  On the other hand sweet and sour berkshire pork had no more flavor or complexity than I would expect in an airport and was left half eaten).  Dessert was also good but not memorable.\nService was definitely five stars, friendly, attentive, but not overpowering.  Atmosphere is fantastic either for a business dinner or date.\nOverall a great experience but the food should have been more consistent."

The miso cod was delicious as was the Rice Krispie dessert with pop rocks (!).

    "review": "My birthday fell on the Chinese New Year this year (well, at least on London's celebration of the fact) and we decided to embrace the theme. Accordingly, we booked Hakkasan for lunch and its sibling, Yauatcha, for dinner.\nI didn't know much about Hakkasan, but man, were we pleasantly surprised.\nOk, first things first, this is definitely toned-down Chinese. But it's classy toned-down Chinese, and if you just embrace the fact that you're eating upscale fusion food, you'll be fine.\nThe d\u00e9cor is really pleasant: it's sort of a cheeky take on a traditional tea house, with cut wood dividers and little dabs of tat. It's dimly lit and just modern enough, without being so chic that you feel alienated. There's a DJ spinning pleasant background mood music right in the centre of the central wing (there are three, and I believe a few private rooms), and a full bar.\nDrinks: really good, balanced, and as described in the menu.\nFood: solid, and set at an appropriate price point for quality/quantity. But don't get the pumpkin tofu; it was a massive disappointment.\nService: spotty, but not for wont of trying. The place was packed, there were lion dancers weaving in and out, and you got the distinct impression that it wasn't normally this chaotic. There were two slips in the service (the wrong drink, and the aforementioned tofu arrived around the time we were ordering dessert) but the staff were trained to the calibre you'd expect for this level of establishment, polite, unobtrusive, smiley. Great overall.\nAs a bonus, the dessert here wasn't an afterthought, and the tea menu was delightful. I have a soft spot for places which actually brew my tea well and yes, Hakkasan, you did just that.\nI do wish that the flavour profiles stuck a bit closer to their roots, and that's the only reason Hakkasan misses out on its 5th star. Aside from one fried nibble with dried scallop inside, and some very very mild preserved duck egg in another, I found things just a bit lacking in the flavour department overall."

    "review": "This is by far London's trendiest place for Chinese. Walk past the bouncers and down the stairs into a decadent dimly lit lounge. It's definitely a hot scene so be sure to dress the part!\nUsually places like Hakkasan are more about the vibe and B-list celebrity spotting than the food, however, that is so not the case here. I went to Hakkasan last month for a friend's birthday. We had an elaborate tasting menu, which annoyingly had to be vegetarian, but was still quite the feast. \nOne tip, if you do the vegetarian tasting menu---some fake meats are clearly better than others. The black pepper vegetarian chicken and surprisingly the fake pork (or what tasted like vegetarian pork) were divine. I never had such tasty vegetarian food, seriously and I've been to Saf! The fake shrimp on the other hand had a less desirable gelatin texture though the sauce was great for my rice.\nFor drinks, the cocktail and sake menu is extensive. There is a fantastic and slightly eclectic range of house martinis---get the cucumber saketini. \nThis isn't a proper review unless I also describe the toilets, and specifically the tiny woman who guards the door to the facilities. She is as diminutive as the door is massive. I'm still not sure how she can sense when you have left the toilets and how she musters the strength to open the insanely heavy door. Bizarre comment, I know, but check it out yourself! Everyone who went to the toilets commented about the WC attendant.\nIn summary, if you are in the mood for some tasty and very very scene-y Chinese look no further than Hakkasan."

    "review": "Came here for over-priced dimsum and mainly to see what's the fuss is about. The restaurant is located in a sort-of alleyway hidden somewhere behind Tottenham Court Road which was a little difficult to find at first. \nWhen we got there, there was the scent of joss-sticks which is nostalgic of the wrong sort. It reminded me of Chinese temples or the altar room I had back in my home. Having this scent permeate a Michelin-starred restaurant was quite odd and the dark and dim lighting reminded me of the time when I visited Abercrombie and Fitch sans the loud music.\nGood service was expected of a Michelin-starred restaurant, so at first impression they were doing OK, then I started finding flaws later on. Our coats were collected before we were seated but before we were even sat, my friend noted that one of the waiters gave her and us a once-over. How rude! I know we weren't dressed up posh but it's not like we came from the slums either. Nevertheless, his attitude was quite off-putting. \nChoices of dimsum were severely limited. Despite this, the food that we ordered were good and well made. We enjoyed the standard selection of har gau, siu mai, etc. but it was quite disappointing that we were made to share when the dishes came in either 3 or 4 pieces per dish. The waiter could've told us this when we ordered or made exceptions so all of us could happily have one each. Perhaps I am expecting too much but 13% for service (0.5% more than the standard 12.5%)??\nOverall, the food was good but the service was meh. I expected more out of a posh restaurant because that's one of the key points (besides the food) that sets it apart from the normal non-starred ones. \nHonestly, for the service, I can get better elsewhere. (even normal-posh Chinese restaurants overseas have way better service... with better lighting as well)."

The duck salad is one of the best things that I have ever eaten, and the dim sum was pretty fantastic as well.\nOverall, this place blew my expectations away compared to what I thought an 'Asian Fusion' place would be like.

    "review": "It was difficult for me and my husband to justify paying as much as we did for Chinese food, when we are so used to getting the real deal in Chicago's Chinatown (and for free from our friends back in Detroit) for the past five or so years. However, the innovative cocktails menu, the high quality of the ingredients in the dishes and the posh vibe made up for some of this hesitation.\nWe were pleased to see not only the long list of options for drinks but also very unique combinations of flavors, so we ended up splurging by ordering two each and sipping on each other's.\nMy husband, fellow Yelper Eliter Michal, has an obsession for cocktails with egg white. The U.S. mostly shies away from using it except with the New Orleans Ramos Gin Fizz. However, at Hakkasan there were at least four or five options that had egg white. He got one with a \"jasmine egg white foam\" that had pomegranate. Afterward, he went with a whiskey drink for contrast - \"Smoky Negroni.\" \nI got a not-too sweet but very zippy martini called the Thea and was happy to see it was mixed with one of our fav Polish vodkas (Michal grew up in Poland!) - a hard-to-get bison grass variety. With a blend of sharp ginger, slighty sweet yet tart apple and lime juices, this drink was smooth yet strong. My second was a very refreshing Kumquat Mojito, a fruit I rarely see and never with mint and rum. I'm grateful for our server's suggestions!\nNow for a quick run-down on what we ate: We decided to forego the preset menu because all the dishes looked too familiar yet too expensive to us. Instead, we opted to do family-style sharing/tapas-style with all appetizers (in order of what we liked best to least).\n*Crispy duck salad- Props to our server for suggesting this, as it was our fav dish of the night. Duck has always been my fav protein and Chinese preparation (usually Peking BBQ) is my jam. I enjoyed these tiny fried morsels mixed with bright microgreens, which was just the perfect fresh complement to this decadent meat.\n*Soft shell crab - amazingly tasty with right amount of crispies and seasoning, devoured quickly with hit of spice from red chili flake and curry leaf\n*Turbot soup with mushroom (AKA wild fungus and goji berry) - flavorful broth with wild mushrooms not used to seeing.\n*Fried aubergine (eggplant) and mushroom - surprised at how crispy yet light these were! A bit larger of a portion than needed though.\n*Dim Sum Platter of shumai and dumplings (one with lobster, another with caviar/scallop/shrimp, another with crab and chives) - seems overpriced until you consider the filling but this one was not worth it to me because I'd rather just eat the filling if I'm paying that much.\nFor dessert, I was excited to see calamansi as that lime-like fruit reminds me of Filipino food, so we got the calamansi and chocolate ganache. It wasn't too sweet with the perfect balance of tart and rich, but it also was not too heavy or big to end the night.\nUltimately, go for drinks and a few apps to share for a special night out that won't break the bank (too much)."

This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in London and I recommend Hakkasan to anyone who asks.\nSuper classy sexy place.  I liked the idea of the \"list\" and bouncer upstairs at the entrance.  Gives a feeling of exclusivity.  Of course we didn't have reservations  :-(.  But they just called down and it was no problem.  And they didn't seem fazed by the fact that we weren't dressed up at all (jeans, boots) and were loaded down with shopping bags.  When we got down the stairs they were expecting us, and took our jackets and seated us right away.  I liked the service was snappy.  \nAlthough Hakkasan can be expensive, it doesn't have to be.  I might have mentioned this in my initial review but the dishes range from under \u00a320 to over \u00a330.  And there's plenty of choice throughout the entire price range.  Since we weren't that hungry we ordered the shanghai dumplings, dimsum platter and mapo tofu.  They also have an extensive cocktail menu.  Though not cheap at \u00a310 each, they are incredibly good.  Real cocktails, not just cosmopolitans.\nThe shanghai dumplings were good but not as good as I've had living in SF.  I remember the dimsum platter being amazing, and while still good I think I've had more experience with high end dimsum.  I still think it's the best I've ever had but the comparison gap wasn't as large.  The map tofu was made with beef and it was amazing.  We were already full after the 2 starters but just couldn't stop eating the the tofu!  \nTotal meal was less than \u00a350 for 2 starters, main, cocktail and tip.\nFunny story about their obsession (good) with appearances, when tipping for the coat check we noticed that the dish had 3 pound coins arranged in it.  We added one more and received our coats to put on.  When we turn around they've removed one of the coins so there are only 3 again.  Only someone obsessed with design and aesthetics would ask the staff to do it."

    "review": "Just returned from this restaurant.  This is a fun upscale place with mostly quite good Chinese food.  Close to 200 pounds for a rather light meal for 3.  We ordered drinks and food.  Was slightly taken aback when soup and appetizers arrived before our cocktails--but didn't think much of till our mains arrived before the rest of the appetizers and grew cold before we got to them. The dim sum plate was above average and very pretty to look at. The taste was good, but no where near as good as you'd find at a place catering to a primarily Chinese clientele.  The reviewer who said the har gau were the best ever has probably not eaten many. The cocktails were quite sweet even tho the waitress had told us they weren't.  The duck salad was very good;  the sweet and sour Berkshire pork was so-so: the pork not crispy an the accompaniment heavy on the onions with a few bell peppers.\nWhen we finished they offered us dessert.  We chose some tea and while we were drinking it, we were asked to vacate the table-another party was waiting for it and there was a 2 hour limit!  So that was the reason for the slapdash service--they wanted to turn our table.  When I complained to the manager he said this was a policy of the restaurant, that we had been informed of when making the reservation (I didn't make so perhaps) and that we'd been called to remind us of that (an absolute lie).  The crucial point is that at no point when in premises were we informed of this and we were offered tea and dessert when we didn't have time to drink it.  Also,  I couldn't help but notice that many of the people seated near us had been there when we arrived and didn't seem to be under a curfew.  The manager did English Officiousness very well; giving a sh-t, not well at all.  As much as I enjoyed the classy, fun atmosphere and some of the food,  I would never go back.  Food 3.5.  Atmosphere 5.  Management 0."

These people are professionals of the upmost degree, and hats off to them.\nThe food was excellent. We shared some 4 small plates and entrees, plus a noodle dish and some excellent vegetables. I'd say the highlights for me were the small plates, particularly the salt and pepper squid and the dim sum platter (i'm looking at you little scallop and prawn wrap of tastiness) Unfortunately, it was still Chinese, and despite spending some $400 American on a meal, we were still hungry a few hours later and ended up at a Burger King. \nI can't say i'd come back unless I was once again invited as a guest,  as this place is definitely WAY out of my price range.

    "review": "This review is for the dim sum.\nBest kept Dim Sum secret.  Cost?  Pretty much the same range as any other dim sum place in London...a small premium.  Quality?  10x better than any other dim sum place in London.  What's that you say?  You thought Hakkasan was for the filthy rich?  Not authentic enough?  Wrong \nI admit that I had my doubts.  A look at their dinner menu posted outside made me scream a little in my head.... tricked into another overpriced Chinese restaurant in London.  Puh.  Well, that may be the case for the dinner menu, but the dim sum menu is very reasonably priced.  For two people, the cost came out to be the same as Royal China except everything about the Hakkasan dim sum experience outshone any other dim sum place I've been to in London (and we were stuffed for the rest of the day).  So let's talk about the food.\nThe menu is a combination of traditional dim sum plates and a few plates with a unique spin.  We had a go with both types, and were pleasantly surprised with all.  Generally speaking, every dish was good and very well executed both in taste and texture.  However, four things really stood out to me:\n1.  Chang Fen with Beef Flank - I can't recommend this dish enough.  My boyfriend nearly devoured the whole thing, and I was trying to fight him for it.  Hakkasan have taken a little spin on the original Chang Fen idea, and topped off the Chang Fen with...well, basically a version of Cantonese Beef Stew.  Who would have thought to put the two together?  The Chang Fen itself is phenomenal.  PERFECT texture----slippery and soft, but firm enough to not break apart when you pick it up with chopsticks (No other dim sum place around London has seemed to master the texture of Chang Fen.... most of the time, it's overly soft).\n2.  Shanghai dumplings - do not get this.  It is basically just pot stickers.  I thought it would be real Shanghai dumplings, which is one of my favourite dim sum plates.  Remember that Shanghai dumplings should always be steamed, filled only with meat (NO VEGGIES), and so juicy that when you first bite into it, you get burnt by the hot juice splattering across your chin.  If a Shanghai dumpling does meet these requirements, then it is not a true Shanghai dumpling.\n3.  The dessert menu had White fungus & pear soup.  Surprise!!  Don't be put off by the white fungus description!  This soup brings back home for me as my mother used to make it in the summer time.  You can drink it cold (the way I like it) or hot, and it's just a really smooth, not overly sweet, dessert to have at the end of a meal.\n4.  Tea.  I probably drink more than a litre of tea a day if I'm at home.  And all Chinese teas I stock up on from trips to China.  Hakkasan actually have a fairly good tea menu with some pretty traditional teas that you don't normally find in other Chinese restaurants.  Pu-er cha for instance and Tie Guan Yin (which we had, and was very good!!!).  \nI am definitely coming back here.  I am not even sure I would give any other dim sum place in London a chance again.  It's worth the tiny 5 pound premium.  The quality of the food is just amazing, and really under-priced in London terms."

    "review": "Dim sum is one thing that can be done very well for reasonably cheap, so I entered Hakkasan's luxurious space afraid we would be shelling out for the chic flower arrangements, the lush seating, and the seductive ambience.  My fears found themselves unfounded - yes, Hakkasan presented its food with impressive, elegant trappings, but these were just a gorgeous frame worthy of presenting the attractive and phenomenally delicious dim sum.\nI'm going to get two brief complaints out of the way first.  1.  No pictures allowed, and that's company policy.  2.  Our waitress seemed a bit impatient at first, as we were first-timers who didn't necessarily know how much to order or how this new-fangled cartless dim sum worked.  She answered our questions, but seemed a little surly about it.  She did warm up to us quickly, though, and service was generally unproblematic and even friendly at times.\nNow, the food.  We were presented with a la carte and dim sum menus, and went all dim sum, with one order of vegetarian dim sum from the a la carte menu.  We started with this vegetarian dim sum platter, which came with two pieces each of crystal dumpling, vegetable shumai, yam bean and shiitake dumpling, and vegetable beancurd roll.  We proceeded with the steamed king crab noodle wrap, the chinese chive dumpling with prawn and crabmeat, the seafood dumpling consomme, the scallop shumai with tobiko caviar, the char sui bun, and an order of the Singapore vermicelli with prawn and squid.\nEach dim sum order came in its own little bamboo container or ceramic bowl, and everything looked beautiful - dumpling skins in deep honeydew green, glistening scallop topped with jewel-like tobiko, burgundy pork peeking out of white clouds bursting quietly at the seams...the presentation was a cut above any dim sum I'd ever seen before.\nIncredibly, it tasted even better.  Every last bit of dim sum was cooked gently to unveil bold flavors and toothsome textures.  The dumpling skins were impossibly good, the consomme soothing and deeply aromatic, the Singapore noodles fluffy and wonderful laced with firm bits of seafood.  Not one bite fell short of eye-opening, and Hakkasan unlocked a new level of dim sum in my culinary universe.\n \nWe should have stopped there, but curiosity got the better of us and we tried the tapioca pearl pudding, which came with little snatches of vanilla panna cotta, poached banana, passion fruit sorbet, and caramel popcorn.  I prefer the humbler version of this dessert offered at lower-end dim sum places.  This one tried too hard and the result was a messy hodge-podge of clashing and cluttering flavors.  The rest of the meal was so delightful that I'm going to forget this final bit ever happened.\nHakkasan was a revelation.  In one meal - and a lunch, at that - I obtained a new lens by which to judge dim sum.  My experience wasn't perfect, but the core of it was, and it is upsetting that I can't go back and repeat it any time soon.\nAlso, the bathrooms are REALLY COOL."

If you have read any of my other reviews you could guess that this is not my type of restaurant. \nDim Sum starter was ok but took about five minutes to cool down enough to put in my mouth. Crispy duck rolls somehow managed to not be greasy without being dry. However they were bland and needed the sauce served with them. Sha cha seafood toban was bit uninspired. \nI'd never come back here."

So some request may be lost \n-no leftover take-out: we first under ordered and then over-ordered.  At the time we get the check, we were told that there is no left-over takeout.

    "review": "Last summer, I reviewed the Hakkasan restaurant located at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami. I absolutely loved their food so it only seemed logical during my recent my week-end in London to have dinner at one of their London locations which, in my case, happened to be the Hanway Place one.\nUpon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that the restaurant was almost identical to its sister location in Miami for the setting there is absolutely stunning. I had their Dim-Sum platter which were tender and perfect.\nThe Dim-Sum platter tenderness was matched by their Wagyu beef which was a delicacy that I really enjoyed.\nAll in all, I had a very good dinner although I hated the fact that I felt we were being rushed out after the main course as our waiter told us that our table had to be cleared for their next customers and that since we had gotten there ten minutes late, they could not allow us to have dessert. I, then, argued that hadn't they had directed us to the bar and left us there for a good 25 minutes after our arrival, we wouldn't have had to order dessert so late. Finally, the restaurant manager \"agreed\" to let us order dessert which we did.\nAll in all, I had a great experience food wise but the aforementioned \"dessert incident\" is the kind of things that can absolutely spoil an otherwise perfect dinner. I understand that this restaurant seems to be always full but how can anyone in their right mind tell their customers they can't order dessert?\nOne last detail: as this restaurant is located beneath ground level, there is no cellular signal whatsoever anywhere inside.\nOne last detail: as this restaurant is located beneath ground level, there is no cellular signal whatsoever anywhere inside."

    "review": "I'm making my way through high-end Chinese restaurants in London. In general, I have a narrative in my mind that while some asian foods, like sushi, enjoy a high markup, Chinese food in the Western world is often seen as cheap takeaway. You expect to have your kung-pao chickens and beef and broccolis served up to you in a takeaway box for about \u00a35 - leading to caricatures like Panda Express in the states and Wok to Walk in the UK. The problem with these too for actual Chinese establishments is that because of this unidimensional view and a universal expectation of cheapness - Chinese restaurants end up battling over operational efficiency - cutting costs, skimping on taxes, paying minimum wage. Re-imagined, upscale Chinese restaurants would bring the benefit of giving Chinese chefs in the western world more freedom to experiment and explore while raising the overall expectation of what a Chinese restaurant could be.\nYauatcha, I'm visiting right on the cusp of having Duck and Rice yesterday. But Yauatcha is in style more similar to Hakkasan than it is Duck and Rice. So after I've eaten all of these foods, imagine my surprise when I realized that all three of these restaurants were created by the SAME GUY - Alan Yau; Yautcha of course being his namesake, Hakkasan named after his ethnic minority background of being Hakka and Duck and Rice I can only imagine because the guy probably GORGES himself on that stuff. Good for him.I happened to come with my Asian American roommate from New York that also went to Harvard (many shared identities as you can see) and we both had the Tou Chan. You can find the menu online, but I'll run through some of my favorite of the dishes:\nChicken Gyoza\nWild Mushroom Dumpling  - I generally like anything named \"wild mushroom x\" and this was no exception\nBeef in black-bean sauce - so good, it reminded me of my childhood favorite \"dou chi ling yu\" which is fish with black bean.\nUltimately a great meal, for a reasonable \u00a335.\nI also highly enjoyed the \"nan\" and the \"nu\" on the door and briefly wondered how a non-Chinese reader would be able to distinguish between the men and women's bathroom, until I looked more closely and saw the \"W\" and \"M\" etched into the doors."

The chairs and tables were lower to the ground than usual, which was interesting.\nThe service was top notch, very solicitous....until the last few minutes when we had to ask for our bill instead of it being brought to us, but that was minor.\nThe food was really delicious! The sweet and sour soup with mushroom was very flavorful and thick....and served piping hot in a bowl with a lid. The Thai chicken was crispy yet moist and tasty, not spicy.\nThe Kung pao chicken was quite good but had way too many peppers in it--they were a quarter of the dish! \nThe vegetable fried rice was so good-- lots of flavor.\nAnd we had one of their slices of mocha cake for dessert; so much flavor packed into a few delicious bites!\nPricey but worth it!"

I was expecting it to be westernized since it's not like your typical dim sum restaurant. \nI went solo so couldn't order too many things thus just got a few classics.\n- steamed pork buns : pork was good mix of sweet and savory and the buns are nicely filled with the pork, they didn't skimp on the filling. It was slightly oversteamed but the taste was still really yummy.\n- scallop and pork siu Mai : unlike traditional siu Mai, the scallop wasn't dried it was a fresh one! Probably why it was so expensive for just 3 pieces. I prefer the cheaper version with dried scallop but this was also quite tasty. \n- Xiao long bao(pork soup buns) : the wrapper is thicker than I usually prefer it but the taste of the soup and pork were on point! \nOverall really good experience, great service and ambiance. Heard their cocktails are worth trying as well. Will have to come back with a bunch of people to try more dishes!"

    "review": "A Michelin Chinese restaurant in Soho London that specializes in Dim Sum. It opened in 2004 by Alan Yau who also created Wagamama and Hakkasan. Rated as one of the top restaurants in London plus multiple locations worldwide.....I was excited to try this place. But what a shocking disappointment in regards to the food. \nThis place was highly recommended by some friends. They said this place offers some of the best Chinese food in London......I would 100% disagree. Maybe for non-Chinese people (which is all I saw in the restaurant).\nThe inside is a cool and sexy contemporary vibe. The ambiance with the bright floor, star-lit ceiling, neon lighting, and aquarium bar in the basement is a clever refreshing way to bring light to this otherwise dark and cave like space. \nWhen we arrived the hostess took our coats and bags and seated us at the bar downstairs for a few drink while our table was bring prepped. It was at that minute I noticed not one other Asians were eating here.....\nAt the bar downstairs the drinks were divine. My husband got cognac and me some tropical lychee non alcoholic drink. The bartender was excellent. Drinks were delicious. \nDishes are colourful with strong flavours and texture contrasts according to the website with dim sum as the highlight. \nOnce are table was ready they brought us to our table to start ordering. Here is what we ordered:\nScallop shui mai\nChar siu bun\nCrispy duck roll\nPrawn cheung fun\nWagyu beef puff\nStir-fry rib eye beef in black bean sauce\nEvery tasted off. The stir fry rib eye and crispy duck roll was the closest to authentic...even that was a far stretch. I looked straight into the kitchen and saw only Chinese chefs......I should have asked to speak to a chef and asked him to cook me something off the menu. My husband ordered so much because he was simply hungry. But I asked him to stop ordering, grab the check, and let's head to Chinatown to eat after here. I was not about to waste precious macros on bad food. \nService was pretty standard and could only get so good as it was super busy. The bartenders offered great service though. Definitely deserve a mention. \nI can see how this would get a Michelin Star for interior design, service, and playing/presentation. Food though no offense reminded me of PF Chang's in the states. I don't see how it get a Michelin Star. But that must be why not one Chinese person was seen here eating when I visited. \nGo if you want a sexy and fun dinner. But not if you want authentic dim sum."

I didn't try it that night, but the next day and it was soooo delicious! \nThe decor is designed to perfect.

The lady that helped us was really friendly! I asked if I could take a picture of the cake before she boxed it and she actually gave me the best looking one and asked if I wanted to take picture of any other cake.

They accommodated us quickly and got us a seat in the bar area that worked out great.  The food was REALLY good and had a lot of variety.  \nFood - We tried a few different things as there were so many good options on the table.  Dim Sum, Duck and a Noodle Dish were the things that we tried:\nDim Sum - Char Sui Bun, Pork and Prawn Shu Mai and finally Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumplings.  All were very good.  Char Sui Buns are classic dim sum, great flavor.  The Pork and Prawn Shu Mai was good.  Finally the Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumpling were also done very well.  \nMains - We had the Crispy Aromatic Duck and the Singapore Stir fry vermicelli with prawns and squid.  The duck was incredible (first time trying it).  Not too oily and had great flavor.  I didn't have any of the noodles but wife really enjoyed it. \nAtmosphere - The restaurant is very modern looking and tastefully decorated.  We ended up sitting in the bar for dinner, but it didn't matter.  Many times I didnt feel that I was in a restaurant.  It felt like a cool place to hang out.  \nService - The service was top notch.  The servers were attentive, but not overbearing.  I never had to ask for a refill as they approached us at the right time.  The dishes (yes there were a lot) were brought out in stages as it didn't feel that we had things piling up.  We took our time and really enjoyed the experience.  \nGreat Job.

The environment was classy and it was very enjoyable looking at all of the desserts displayed on the side. Even though the dim sum is pricey compared to other Chinese restaurants, I think it's still worth the price since they use more expensive ingredients. My favorite was the scallop xiu mai.

The best part of this dish is the flavor of the soup that the dumpling is steamed in. \n- Shrimp cherng fun - The noodle wrap is very soft, yet not soggy.

It is one of the few Michelin-starred Chinese restaurants. The ambiance is hip and has a night club feel to it. I'd compare Yauatcha to Hakkasan; I do prefer Yauatcha a little more.  \nExcept for the kitchen, I don't think there was a single Asian staff in the restaurant.  The wait staff is comprised of good looking young men and women that seemed like aspiring actors or models.  With that said, the service was professional and attentive. \nWhile the food (dim sum) is traditional the quality was steps beyond most dim sums I've had, even in L.A.  The non-Asian part of the restaurant is the large display of European desserts and hand-crafted gourmet chocolate.  There is also a 25-feet long macaron bar by the front window that makes every passerby stop and admire.  \nThe sweet and sour pork was delicious beyond my expectation. The batter was crispy, the pork seemed like lean pork tender loin and the sweetness and tartness of the sauce was perfectly balanced.  The softshell crab was served with garlic chips that looked like almond slices and, along the the Thai basil, added good body to the flavor of the lightly battered crab.  The various steamed dumplings were all delicately made and tasted great.  The biggest surprise of the meal was the baby bokchoy.  It looked quite simple without any garnish yet the flavor was quite complex.  I never thought that a plain vegetable like this can taste this good.  It tasted like it had been stir-fried with chicken stock and Shaoxing wine.\nThe desserts were all excellent and the presentation impressive. The tough part was to make the choice from so many options.\nExpect to pay for the superb dining experience; but it is worth the money."

You won't regret it!\nI went with a bag of 6 for 9.80 pounds, which is pretty affordable given Yauatcha's status; they could have easily marked up their prices! The 6 flavors I chose were the coconut, matcha yuzu, apricot pistachio, strawberry, salted caramel, and the sesame. Extra star for the superb service - for my last macaron, I couldn't decide, so I asked for suggestions. The employee recommended the popcorn or the coconut, in which I went with the coconut. To my surprise, she then gave me a popcorn macaron just because! If a popcorn macaron sounds weird to you (it sounded strange to me at first), fear not because it was absolutely delicious!

Service is fast, friendly, and formal. Star Granted. \nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\nMacarons are expensive these days, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my macarons at Yauatcha, where were notably large, only priced out to be $2.10 USD each once I did the conversion from pounds. That's notably cheaper than (smaller) macarons that I've had at Pierre Herme in Paris, which is certainly a win. I also ordered a signature 'Chocolate Pebble' that was a staggering six pounds, but I really can't fault the prices of flagship specialty desserts. Star Granted. \nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\nOne thing I'll point out is that the macaron flavors were just a tad bit limited at Yauatcha compared to some other shops that I've been to. Sure they had salted caramel and coconut and orange, but missing were classics like vanilla and rose or fun contemporary options like apple pie or banana. That's not really a fault (Pierre Herme has the same issue), but it was note worthy. \nThe macarons themselves were excellent. Outside of the coconut all six of my macarons had excellent and more importantly consistent contrasting textures with powerful flavors on the back end, and the salted caramel in particular was divine. \nArguably most surprising was the Chocolate Pebble, which was a symphony of truffle and liquid chocolate that had me appreciating chocolate like I'm not sure I ever have done. Dual Stars Granted. \nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\nYauatcha has earned all of the acclaim they've received, but their macarons fall ever so short compared to my all-time global favorites at Miann (Auckland) and Pierre Herme (Paris). I will certainly be back for the food though to give Yauatcha a proper and more thorough look. No Star Granted."

I told him I did not eat cilantro, and the one item he recommended (wild mushroom dumplings) had cilantro. After taking a bite, I left the rest untouched - but I never saw the server again, and even when I mentioned to another server what had happened, there was no attempt to apologize, or ask if I'd like to order something else in its place.  \nThe other dumplings I got (poached chicken) were excellent. I also tried the crispy duck - and while I wanted to like it because it was a different take on Peking duck (I have no idea how it was prepared as that was - of course - not explained, but the duck was shredded in front of you instead of sliced), it was so dry that it was inedible without the sauce (which my server said would be \"oyster sauce\" - it was not - it was the classic Peking duck sauce). \nToo bad. Hope you have better luck than I did at this joint."

The food is nothing more than any good Chinese restaurant in your local neighborhood. What really surprised me was the service. We had to request several times for our drinks. Water was not refilled and my utensils were not changed even though we asked for new plates. Our table was left uncleaned until we had to ask the manager to wipe it after 10 minutes or so. It seems they employ young untrained waiting staff. \nIf you are looking for a good Chinese meal with very uncomfortable seating in a hip environment this is the place for you, however if you have visited other Michelin restaurants you will be deeply disappointed."

They phoned me up 2 days beforehand to check that I was still coming which was good. \nArrived at the restaurant and the staff were really friendly. Sat down and was offered water and a Cucumber dish with 3 difference dips. One was really hot (chilli type dip) another more of a sweet and sour type and the last one I think was soy sauce. Ordered our drinks but had to wait 45mins for it to arrive which was the most annoying thing of the evening. First dish arrived which was the Venison puff, tasty bits of meat in a pastry with sesame seeds on top. Had to wait around another 15-20 mins or so for the next 3 dishes to arrive, scallop shui mai which was delicious, lobster dumpling which had a hint of ginger. Last one was Champagne scallops which was also nice. We then had to wait another 20 or so minutes for our beef in black bean sauce and rice and noodles dishes to arrive. When they came, only the rice and noodles arrived and we had to wait about 10 mins for the beef to turn up. By the time it came the noodles were cold. Shame, because the beef was really nice and soft!!! Didn't bother ordering desert because we couldn't be bothered to wait again and we had already been sitting on the table for nearly 2 hours. Asked for the bill (waited another 10 mins for it)\nThe food was top notch, staff really friendly. Only thing that stops it being 5 stars was all the waiting about. Would give the place another go just to see if the waiting about was just a one off!!!"

As requested, we re-confirmed the day before for 8pm. So far business as usual.\nWe arrived at exactly 8pm, and got our table downstairs as requested.\nUpon ordering, our waiter seemed quite uninterested, and was almost 'bitchy' when I asked about a dish we had the previous time. Hmmm.\nThe music was extremely loud, even more so than previous times, which made conversation quite strenuous.  We overheard the table next to us complain about the same problem. (On a separate note, they were annoyed as well about getting their main course before their starters).\nThe food quality was excellent, as always.  Nothing to say about that.\nHOWEVER .. when we decided to order desserts at 9pm (one hour after arriving, ordering, and getting our dishes), we were told that \"our table was booked only until 9:15pm, so it would be almost impossible to serve us desserts\". Wait. WHAT?\nSo we called the maitre d' to enquire about this.  He first started asking us if we were walk-ins.  Then proceeded to tell us that our reservation was for 7pm and we'd been an hour late. SERIOUSLY?  How UNPROFESSIONAL can one be?\nIf we'd been an hour late, our table would have been gone for 45 mins, since they have a 15min holding policy, so that excuse didn't fly! And not knowing we booked several weeks in advance, and then making us feel like it was our fault? NO WAY!\nAs said, the quality of the food was excellent, but the service is an absolute disgrace!\nIn the end, the desserts were on the house, but a situation like this should NEVER have occurred in a Michelin-star restaurant!\nThe whole experience left us leaving quite annoyed and bitter, and ruined what should have been a memorable anniversary dinner.\nWe'll give Yauatcha another try next time, but if this is the standard they're holding up now, it's bye-bye, never again."

The chairs that we sat in were uncomfortable and really low to the ground, and the tables were so close to each other that any movement to the side results in you rubbing against the person sitting next to you.  The service also leaves much to be desired; it was really slow, and it took forever to get a waiter's attention.\nSome of the dishes we got were pretty good.  The pork and prawn shui mai and the prawn and beancurd cheung fun were our two favorites, and we really enjoyed them.  The crispy duck roll was pretty mediocre; you could get something better at other dim sum restaurants.  When we ordered the chicken cheung fun, however, the dish came out very soggy and the chicken was really bland and dry.  The edamame truffle dumpling had a weirdly crunchy texture, and the flavors didn't blend well at all.\nI probably would've given this restaurant a 3-star rating if it did not have a Michelin star and was less pricey.

The place is beyond stylish and feels like when you're at your best friends parents house and they've seated you in the guest living room, and your kind of too frightened to move in fear of breaking some expensive antique.

Try to book in advance but if you come here on a Sunday afternoon dim sum time, then be prepared to wait.  That's when the Chinese family have their big outing and eating dim sum.  We had an issue with our last order and it came really late.  We decided to cancel and the manager was quick to come and apologise.  They even gave us free dessert each so we were happy for this.  This is what you call professional.  If you go to some other restaurants, they apologise and bring the food out late right when you are cancelling it and you are forced to eat them or take them home.  However, the one star is omitted due to Hakkasan performing slightly better.  That said, it is still probably one of the best dim sum in London so I would not miss giving this place a try at all.  Must go in London."

    "review": "I liked their food but I didn't go crazy and it didn't make me want to return tomorrow. Here are the details:\nOne general observation - all dishes were underseasoned ranging from moderately to seriously.  That said, since every dish was made in house from scratch, I think is enough for the above rating.\n- Singapore noodles - the blandest of all dishes I tasted.  Sigapore noodles need a (serious) kick and they tried to accomplish that by adding sliced red chili peppers.  Unfortunately, the peppers were as mild as they get... This dish has a lot of potential, but they need to fix the seasoning.\n- Beef fun noodles - seasoned better than the above Singapore noodles, but still on the short side.  I liked the way the beef was prepared.  A classic dish that desperately needs a twist.\n- Dim sum - good to very good, but also mostly neutral."

It turns out that Yauatcha has a Michelin star and maybe it deserves it, but if you're looking for dim sums there's a couple of similarly good (non-starred) options in China Town."

Also the steamed lobster roll and Venison puffs and spicy pork wonton were incredible. I would love to say we made it through to some of the delightful looking main course dishes on the menu but we simply couldn't get past the Dim Sum menu.

So fast forward some years and I'm finally seated inside. \nIf I want dim sum, I don't need to pay such an extortionate price. I could just opt for an authentic place down the road in Chinatown. So I opted to try a few plates, unique to Yauatcha instead. \nWas I impressed? Sadly not that much. Maybe it was because I'd paid double (or even triple) the price for a few dumplings. Or maybe it's because I'd had so much expectation for it for so long. \nSo I guess, if you're looking for decent authentic dimsum, don't go to Yauatcha. If you're looking for a fancy venue, then Yauatcha is for you!"

After trying a place close by with an insane wait, my group was fortunate to stumble upon a free table at exactly the right time. \nUsually when I think of dim sim, I think of carts coming by or offering delicious, but often unsophisticated looking dumplings and buns. Yauatcha is a dim sum restaurant that made me feel like a grownup (and that is not something that I say lightly). \nThe dishes here were excellent. My group and I ate about 8-10 plates between us, and each item was fantastic. The char siu buns were steamed to perfection. The shrimp and bean curd cheng du...I could have eaten like three plates of that. The dumplings (considering I had about 3 different kinds) were all inhaled. And the turnip cake was the best turnip cake in the history of turnip cakes. \nThe plates are small, but shareable with about 3-4 pieces per dumpling and buns. Topping off our meal with some delicious sake made the entire experience complete.\nI felt a little out of place with my jeans here, and had I known this is where we were going to end up, I would have opted for something dressier. \nThe wait staff and FOH managers were very accommodating, and would check up on us often. Or suggest another delicious dish for our meal.\nSo many stars. I'm sad I had to stop at five. This place was one of the best meals that I have ever had."

    "review": "Hip and happening this Chinese restaurant is delicious. Sort of... People with shellfish allergies beware, as most dishes served here are with oyster sauce, even dishes that look vegetarian, and what first looks like an extensive and exciting menu limits those people with shellfish allergies down to a a measly few dishes to choose from. And when I say measly, I mean you can count the selection on one hand. This is important to note as one in our party was allergic and this meant that person had little to eat. \nEverybody else feasted. And the cuisine while distinctively Chinese had a modern approach which made for a truly tasty experience. Pork belly with truffles... foie gras, duck, and delightful pumpkin dim sum shaped into little pumpkins were divine. \nWe came for desserts, however we were disappointed as by the time we were finished with our meal, the tempting dessert selections we had seen upon entering the restaurant were nearly all sold out and we were left with little to choose from. So, that was sort of the theme of the night here at Yauatcha: So much to tempt, so little actually available. \nThe decor was trying too hard with its fish aquariums and Asian inspired seating. The seats themselves were very close to the ground and people were too close and on top of each other. My chair was next to one of the pillars and I had to sit a bit sideways and nearly on top of the table, so it was a bit uncomfortable. And yes, a bit noisy. Waitstaff too could have been a bit more attentive and not so rushed. \nIts a shame really as it is a fun place, great for small groups of friends. I think it definitely merits a try, as what was good, was tasty, but perhaps avoid Saturday night and the weekends."

Everything we had was typical chinese dim sum but they were just presented so clean and tasted mediocre. My parents remarked that we could get better dim sum for way cheaper back in San Francisco. I enjoyed all of the dishes we got, but I believe that there was nothing special about any of them. All of the plates were remarkably tiny sized for the amount we paid for it. \nThe only dish I thought was worth checking out were the Prawn & Beancurd Cheung Fun. \nOh and this place is the slowest service I have ever experienced before.. It takes forever to get anything done. Food comes out slow, waiters never seem to see you, water takes forever to come to the table. Oh and make sure you ask for tap water or they'll charge you for still water. \nI would recommend just coming here for drinks and desserts. We tried the Raspberry Delice.

    "review": "I've been going on and off pretty much since it's opened and it's retained its quality. Of the dozen places I've been to in London this is by far the best and the only one that comes close to what I'm used to in Hong Kong and Singapore, although I have yet to try Hakkasan which is supposed to be on the level.\nYauatcha brings modern cooking techniques and interesting ingredients to dim sum. The venison puff is a textbook butter pastry with French, rather than Cantonese techniques. The parcels (sorry, \"spinach prawn dumplings\") would not be out of place in a Vietnamese kitchen and are also reminiscent of greek leaf rice parcels. There are a few twists on classics, such as the pumpkin crystal dumpling which plays pumpkin's softer texture against just a hint of crunchy water chestnut (expected) and the oily nasal nuttiness of pine nuts (unexpected). Since the classics are done well without using the usual bulk frozen quality items, they taste different: the prawn and deep fried tofu cheung fun was crispier and more flavourful than expected although it's a shame they hold on to the sauce pot after pouring. The kitchen team here has taste and knowledge and the cooking is consistent. I like it, authenticity gets boring after a while.\nThey have always had amazing desserts but having not had one in 3 years I cannot comment on whether quality has been maintained, only point out that many tables were ordering some and they still look very pretty and skilled.\nThe restaurant itself is still claustrophobic downstairs, although it feels less packed than when it first opened years ago. There is also less queue, although it is still full. The audience, visually, seems half Chinese, and sounds mainland, probably a good sign, from large groups of men to lone diners enjoying a taste of home. The waitstaff has become more European.\nPrices feel much higher (4-5 GBP for the cheapest punnets), maybe I'm not used to London eye wateringly high food prices anymore, they are high at all the yum cha we tried this trip. I forgot that the \"pot\" did not have leaves and you have to pay twice as much if you want to be able to re-brew. One of the many ways in which your bill can skyrocket here, especially if you are used to tea being included.\nThe other way in which it does not feel like yum cha is that you are somewhat rushed every step of the way. The seating is uncomfortably low, the space between tables limited, the space noisy (downstairs especially), your legs hit the table legs, and they start cleaning your table before you've even finished your pot of tea. But I expect this considering the location, fame and long queue. If they let people linger 3 hours there wouldn't be any tables for walk ins and the prices would be even higher.\nWell, sometimes you want to have some yum cha that does not taste of MSG and frozen prawn and this is the place to go for it in London. Maybe I should try Hakkasan some time but old habits die hard."

I also double checked on Yelp and noticed most of the bad reviews were non-Asian or complaints about the restaurant, service, or tip. Aka, good food? Im down! \nThe entrance and ground floor is tight but we managed to be lead upstairs to our table. I am glad they gave us a bigger table for our winter jackets, shopping bags, and room for the food we ordered. \nWe asked what were some of the best sellers and ordered two dishes to share. Plus an appetizer of xiao long bao. \nThe xiao long bao was meh, skip it. \nWe also ordered the crispy aromatic duck and lobster. The duck was extremely good. The lobster as quite good as well, but not a good as impressive as the duck. The duck I highly recommend getting when visiting here. Next time I will get the traditional roast duck as it has been deemed by the Financial Times as \"the best roast duck in the world\" lol. That probably means at least in the UK it is the best. \nThe waiter does speak Chinese and English so no worries if you cant speak Chinese. \nThis place is pretty traditional from the food to experience.

While in most Cantonese joints, non speaking guest will often get the \"bad pieces\" Four Seasons knows no such concept and every single piece was fantastic and no survivors were left on our plate. For our family of four, the half portion did just fine.\nDuring your menu selection be sure to look around at what the locals are eating, we did so and were not disappointed"

Then 3 starters, meat spring rolls, salt and pepper ribs and dumplings.\nThe rice was a decent portion but the sauce that was wrongly sweet. The duck was OK, the pork was delicious and the chicken came with no skin, no bone and the spring onion came ontop of the duck! Why?? Plus the overall meat portion was small. \nThe starters were appalling and clearly aimed at an unassuming audience who wouldn't know better. The ribs were bone dry and bland, the dumpling skin was thick and fried, but not in the way you'd want. The spring rolls were supposed to be 2 large pork ones but ended up being 4 small ones with non-existant chicken. \nOverall, I'd cone back for their expensive rice dishes if I had no other choice, but the starters were awful.

We ordered the half Roasted Duck and Oyster Pancake. The Roast Duck was good - the meat was tender and juicy, but the oyster pancake was pretty tasteless. Prices were standard Chinatown.\nService was brisk and adrupt - normal for Chinese Restaurants so I had no complaints. However, we did ask for oyster sauce for our oyster pancake, but the waitress gave us Chili Oil. Maybe oyster sauce is more of a US thing and they don't have it in London?"

The three of us ordered the duck pancakes with a half duck and salt&pepper tofu (beancurd). The duck pancakes were delectable! The half duck was served in shreds to make it easier on us to make our own pancakes with cucumber strips and onion strips. We were given the duck sauce (looks like BBQ sauce) along with a trio of spices to fully customize our heavenly duck experience. \nThe salt&pepper tofu was alright, but it was nothing special so I wouldn't order it again. \nCONS - It's a bit spendy for the amount of duck you get but Four Seasons know they are hot shit compared to other roast duck places around Chinatown so they are \"entitled\" to price their duck that way ;) So the problem lies solely with me and that I should get a higher paying job to eat more duck pancakes, dammit!"

We ordered a whole roast duck (\u00a324), sliced beef (which was savory and slightly sweet, but so juicy and delicious), choi sum vegetables stir fried with garlic, tofu with prawn stuffing, and a herbal pork soup with black and white pepper which was a milky white color because of the carnation milk they added (we took a chance with the soup because it was so cold and we were so glad we did, it was so yummy and helped clear out my sinuses).  The total bill was around \u00a3100 but the food was amazing,  definitely one of the best I've ever had from both the U.K., and the USA.  The restaurant was fairly old and small even though it has two floors. We sat in the first floor and there were 6 tables. The staff was incredibly attentive. When we arrived, they took a few minutes to set up a table for us (3 adults and a toddler) and the toddler seat was set up before we even asked for one.  Once, we had dropped a chopstick, and the owner (manager?) immediately  grabbed us a new pair of chopsticks. When all our dishes arrived, our table was quite crowded and they quickly lifted up the extension of the table and gave us more space.  The staff spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin and I felt completely at ease conversing with them in Cantonese as they were extremely friendly and customer oriented. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for amazing Cantonese food. They also own \"Little Four Seasons\" which was more on the main side of Gerard Street but I have not yet tried it."

My friends had been raving about the roast duck from the moment we started our Channel crossing on the Eurostar train, and I was thinking: how good can duck be?  Turns out it was so good that I dragged them back for a second round of duck in our 4 days in London.\nThe duck (GBP22) was suitably tender and well flavoured, and the gravy complemented the taste well.  Other dishes were typical Chinese fare that was above average.  We ordered 2 types of Chinese soups that were typical standard for Europe: barely passable but that's so not the point of being here.  \nThe staff were somewhat curt but very efficient.  They managed to quickly get us a seat on the ground floor (important as a friend was hobbling with a walking stick) when we walked in on a Sunday afternoon.  The queue on Wednesday dinner was long but we solved the problem by ordering out - the main thing we were interested in was the duck anyway.  \nStood eating on the streets before our theatre show (restaurant is walking distance to many musical/ theatre venues), and decided there and then that \"duck followed by theatre\" shall be part of my next London routine."

My friend and I were looking to grab a simple dinner in Chinatown, and when I looked up restaurant reviews, they were all around 3.5 stars out of 5 and I wondered how they could have all been so poor. There is nothing that is 4 stars or above. I've been here a few times to get barbecued meat or roast duck for takeaway, which somehow always managed to set me back \u00a310-15, but it's well regarded for having the best roast duck in London and the char siu and crispy pork belly was always solid too. It's expensive, but on the bright side it's the same price to eat in, so that is probably the best option at this restaurant. The other items on the menu were outrageously expensive - the highlight was that plates of seasonal vegetables will send you back \u00a39, when clearly the cost at the supermarket next door would be something like \u00a32. We got stir fried prawns with seasonal vegetables (which turned out to be broccoli, not even anything special) for \u00a310, but at least there were prawns. We also got the crispy duck with pancakes, which was nice because we could order \u00bc duck, which you can't with the Peking duck, but the crispy duck was a dry, shredded, indistinguishable version of the normal glazed and juicy roast duck glory. I wouldn't recommend it. The table next to us got the Peking duck and I had serious food envy. Our last dish was the young chow fried rice. The disappointing part about this was that it was served lukewarm. The whole meal costs us nearly \u00a340 in total, which is terrible value and you should definitely be able to do much better in Chinatown. I might come here for the barbecued meat or roast duck takeaway, but it's not worth your while to eat in."

However I decided to give 4 stars because of their service, which should be better. \nAs a student based in Leeds, I go to London from time to time to watch football, and usually before that, I would go here for lunch. \nQuite a lot of times, I went there and it's a 50/50 chance the service would be good or bad. I've had the good service twice and the\nbad service twice. \nBut for food, the duck is the best around. No question. The aubergine with fried pork meat is amazing. And for the price, it was worth trying. It's just that the service could be better."

The roast duck I was served was extremely fatty, some pieces were 80% fat, 10% skin and 10% meat. I like fatty duck but this is pushing it a bit\nAlso, the egg noodles in my soup was a big block, all stuck together! I am quite sad writing this as I have no idea where else to go now!"

We were seated quickly and the experience was noisy but enjoyable. But somehow the noise adds the feeling of a bustling busy restaurant which is fine... So we went back a week later. \nAnd.... \nI don't think a restaurant could drop the ball any further... And they weren't even as busy as usual.... Maybe that's a sign of the times. \nAfter 40 minutes we received our duck pancakes,  the duck was nice but seemed to be dry from sitting out too long,  then..... Nothing.... 20 mins later we received cold soft shell crab.... Ten minutes later Kung Po... Very tasty.... But cold.... No rice.... 10 mins later... Rice.... What's the point \nNo apology just an interest to take money and run. Also the pricing is higher than most Chinese restaurants so we left feeling like we paid for their reputation not there service and sadly not their food. \nWe won't be going back. There's plenty more tables in London serving exotic Cantonese wonderment."

This I can deal with, but when the number of patrons impacts the service I start to become wary.\nMy meal was excellent, tasty and felt authentic. However the venue for the meal lacked any ambiance or class.\nI came here because of the good reviews, and my food lived up to them. The over-all experience though was tainted by the lack of ambience and friendly service. Don't get me wrong - the service was good.

    "review": "This is my other half's favourite haunt for roast duck. It's not hard to see why as their Bayswater branch is famous for it, they have won countless awards (and glued these to their window and walls, including newspaper clippings for you to read while you wait!)\nA quick summary before we begin:- If you want tasty roast duck, come here. If you want excellent service to go with it, please look elsewhere because you will not find it here.\nTo elaborate, the roast duck is the juiciest duck you will ever taste. Sometimes it may be overly fatty but the fat is what makes it taste so good. The soya sauce that comes with it is really sweet and I can only imagine the amount of sugar that has gone into it. However, I cannot complain as I have a sweet tooth and generous helpings of this sauce with the roast duck makes me a happy bunny.\nI usually get the roast duck for takeaway to eat at home, unfortunately the price has gone up recently, it's around \u00a318.50 for a whole roast duck. If you are ordering takeaway please ignore the queue outside and just go straight to the till to order. \nSometimes if you come really late in the night (I actually mean 9pm) they would have sold out of roast ducks. Have no fear, they opened another branch about 3 min walk away down the end of Gerrard Street, at Wardour Street. They usually have a few roast duck hanging up even though this branch has run out.\nOnto the issue of service. Inevitably you will see a queue start forming here as early as 6pm. The restaurant is tiny and there are just too many people trying to eat here all the time that you end up freezing outside while you wait. If you do manage to get a table, you will get one of these two:- get ignored by the waiter for refills of drinks, or get hurried by the waiter to pay up and leave so they can sit someone else down. If you are lucky you will get both treatments!\nTip: maybe stick with takeaways and cook your own rice at home!"

We all split the duck with the pancakes. I was quite hesitant to try duck, as I never have been fortunate enough to see this variety in my daily diet. It was amazing! The pancakes (of course, I had not known what this was since Americans have a different cultural knowledge of pancakes) complemented the appetizer so well, that I wanted more! But I'm really glad we didn't. Our main course came, and we all sampled the variety of duck and chicken in many different sauces: sweet and sour, orange, and kong-po. I know there were some other dishes that were ordered, but I do not recall at the current moment.

I do happen to be a fan of duck, so when he recommended we go to the Four Seasons in Chinatown, I was all for it!\nThe place is fairly small and looks like most Chinese places I've been to.  There were seven in our group so we were sat at one of the larger tables in the back that have rotating glass in the center (very good for family style sharing).  Since my friend had been here before, we let him do most of the ordering.\nWe started with hot and sour soup (one of my personal favorites) which was much spicier than what I've had here in the States.  I'm a huge fan of spicy food so that was no problem for me!  We then moved into our main courses of whole roasted duck and BBQ duck, both of which were absolutely delicious.  The whole duck came with thin tortilla-like wraps that we used with veggies and sauces to make our own duck wraps.  I'm not such a fan of the BBQ duck as it's a little fatty for my liking.\nWe also had a shrimp dish which was pretty yummy.  For whatever reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to order Lychee wine.....yeeeaaaahhhh....not the best.  It was way too sweet, strong, and just overall not good.  Wouldn't recommend it.\nFor dessert we had just plain old Lychee which WAS delicious.  Those sweet little balls made my mouth very happy (that's what she said).  When you're done with your entire meal, they bring you oranges (kind of like an after dinner mint).\nThe service wasn't too bad.  It was a little slow at times and one of the smaller dishes we ordered never made it to our table, but they were very nice about taking it off our bill.  Overall, I would have to agree with the masses and say that they have the best duck around."

The Duck was as good as I have ever had, really meaty, we ordered a half and we got a big half! \nAfter a leisurely start we were obliged to order mains, even though we were actually all full.

Four Seasons is known for their barbecued meats and for good reason. Their Peking Duck is succulent and tasty. I also have their Crispy Aromatic duck which is very flavourful and crispy- the most perfect incarnation of this dish that I have ever had. In terms of other starters I have had the Peking Dumplings (strong flavour and very 'juicy') and Vegetarian Spring Rolls (Crispy with a high amount of vegetables inside). In terms of Main Course I have a group of dishes which are some of my favourites in the world. The Pork chop in honey and pepper sauce (from the Chef's Specials) is delicious, the pork chops are always flavoursome with a crispy exterior, the sauce is absolutely delicious and sweet with an almost caramel texture this combined with chopped up onions makes an absolutely stunning dish. The Black Bean dishes are also very good. The Beans themselves are as tasteful as ever and are slightly soft as (in my opinion they should be) and with a kick of chili it is very good. I would recommend the Beef in Black Bean sauce rather than the pork as the Pork is sometimes a tad too fatty for me. The Singapore Noodles are also very good with another hit of Chili to add to the flavour. As someone who is a huge fan of Mushrooms the Chicken with Chinese and Straw mushrooms is delicious and always comes with a hearty helping of various Mushrooms. The straw mushrooms are especially delicious!! \nEven though I have visited many times and have eaten many dishes there, there are still loads of dishes I want to try, the Fish dishes will be next I think. Anyway it has a great range of dishes at very competitive prices; we spent about \u00a325 a head and had more food than we could eat. The only negative for some people may be the service. It is not always particularly efficient and/or 'chatty' but thats exactly what gives this place it's authentic charm.\nOverall:\nPrice: Very good for the volume of food (Around \u00a315-25 a head)\nFavourite Item: Pork Chop in Honey and Pepper Sauce.\nWorst Aspect: I honestly cannot name one.\nWould recommend? Definitely I plan to go back as soon as possible."

I'm not too sure it's the best in the world but it's the best I've had in London and on par with the roast duck I had at the considerably more upscale Peninsula Hotel in Beijing.\n One piece of advice based on my experience at Four Seasons: forego the rest of the menu and just order the duck. Everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good but nowhere near as good as the duck. Besides there are plenty of other decent Chinese restaurant around Chinatown."

Note, this isn't an authentic dimsum place as such, but it's a neat westernised atmosphere if you're not feeling like going to Chinatown. My favourite were the chicken with cashew nuts and the hargau. \nService was decent, though it was generally busy in the restaurant. Allow for extra time before and after if you want to make it to a show."

Just remember this:  Dim sum is not an arithmetic calculation gone wrong, its the name of steamed, bite-sized, Chinese dishes with a variety of selection to please any palate. \nThe pre-selected order had a nice variety, but the server also recommended the beef and kimchi dumplings. This was by far my favorite dish of the evening!  The perfectly seared dumplings might as well have been little fireworks exploding with flavors in my mouth. There was the right amount of spice, heat, and flavor to make my tastebuds smile like the Cheshire Cat. \nI fell in love with the decor, but I'm a sucker for koi.

Because they said this, I ordered a fried spicy chicken addition.\nIt was more than enough. We were both very hungry and ended up being full and ordered too much food.\nThe ambience doesn't match the look of the store.

Granted, coming from South East Asia my standards are probably higher than most, I can still count several other places that have daily dim sum that are better. For example, har gau is meant to look like a shiny jewel that you can just about see the prawn through. The har gau here was far too thick so it felt like the insides were not enough. I mean it tasted good, but considering the portion was as small (3 pieces) and not superb, I was let down. The iced teas were really nice so there was that. \nTL;DR - You want dim sum?

Instead we ended up on a rather small two person table outside - which was made better once the nearby heat lamp was turned off as suddenly it felt like we weren't being cooked.\nFood was fine but the manager who took the order slip from us didn't notice we had ordered two portions of the pork buns.

We had high expectations and the anticipation was exciting.  Our server was not very friendly and seemed shocked we did not want anything but tap water.  The ordering process is like a sushi bar where you mark your own list of dim sum.  We picked items and tried to flag our server down.  She comes back, took our order sheet, then a while later says they are out of a ton of stuff, crossing out several of our order list and other items....okay thanks.  We decided to stick with the remaining first and ended up adding one item (shrimp toast).  \nThe food took forever to come out and when it did, it looked pretty good but tasted terrible.  Sometimes the temperature was off (our first dish was the honey chicken on rice and it was partially hot and partially cold).  As my mom put it, the food got worse with each dish.  The duck spring rolls were mushy and bland, the beef lettuce wraps (a special) were just boring plain shredded beef with no flavor, and it was just so disappointing.\nUnfortunately, it was pricey too, and we left spending way more than we should have for a meal that was barely edible.  Don't be fooled by the crowds and go somewhere else!"

The black tea was a bit bitter but full of flavour so I enjoyed that without needing to add any sugar.\nI felt quite full after that meal but the guys in the group (the other two set menus) did mention they could still eat more so you may want to keep that in mind and order a couple more dishes. I'd say ordering lots of things and sharing would be the best option.\nIn general it was a lovely place for a midweek lunch with my team and I hope we go back again."

We ordered steamed buns that have broth in them (and are served with a spoon to catch the broth), but no spoons were brought over. We had to use our soy sauce dishes instead (serendipitously, our soy sauce was empty so we hadn't used the dishes yet). 15 minutes after we asked for our cheque, I again had to flag someone down (a host) and ask for it again.

I planned to have a quick lunch armed with my newly registered Ping Pong Loyalty Card, Email for a free cocktail and booking for the Super 8 Menu. The Super 8 menu consisting of a chicken rice pot, tea of your choice, won-ton soup with dumplings, and 5 pre-selected dim sum pieces.\nI opted to sit outside as it was a nice day. It was a little breezy, but every table has a heating element above it, meaning you're not left shivering in late September. I would imagine these would be ineffective when the weather drops below 15 degrees.\nThe staff were pleasant, but there seemed to be a lot of confusion around my cocktail voucher, and to be honest the waiter was clearly new and picking things up. First to arrive was my cocktail. This was a ginger passionfruit crushed ice cocktail. It wasn't very good. Next my complimentary prawn crackers with assortment of dips. Note: you'll need a ping pong loyalty card to get this, but it's free! These were okay. \nThe dim sum arrived shortly after, and I was left slightly puzzled. Normally when I dine chinese, I expect the soup to come first, followed by rice then everything else. I didn't know whether to pick at my tiny dim sum pieces or wait for the soup and rice pot to arrive...after 5 minutes I decide to tuck in. The dim sum was obviously made in house. Both the taste and shapes made it obvious. These weren't your run of the mill production line dim sum. But also left room for skimping on the size. The only one adequate size was the chicken/prawn one. The rest were far too small. If I was paying around \u00a33-4 for 3 pieces I would most definitely be disappointed. However in the context of the deal and extras, it was more than filling. \nAs I polished off 2 of the 5 pieces, the Lychee Red Black scented tea arrived. The aroma was dazzling, and the taste wonderful. Full of flavour and silky smooth without any bitterness. Beautiful. Then finally the rice pot and won-ton soup came. The soup was strange. Tasted nothing like the wonton soup I'm used to and was surprisingly sour. The wonton dumplings were great. Quite large and tasty. The rice pot was the highlight of the meal. The oyster based sauce full of flavour, and plenty of chicken and lots of chinese black mushroom (a delicacy). One of the best rice pots I've ever had. The dipping sauces included chilli oil (all oil, no actual flakes :/), and chilli. The special sauces as a loyalty card holder included chilli black bean sauce (delish), sweet and sour and sesame hoi sin sauce. They were pleasant, but really only the chilli based ones worked with dim sum.\nSo in all, the decor of the place really impressed. Somebody really though about the experience visually. Unfortunately the food (in respect to the dim sum) is below average and the order dishes arrive is a little random. Two things that wouldn't take a lot of effort to improve. Otherwise it has all the small touches I appreciate. Unprotected wifi, loyalty card scheme, lovely interior, unique tea blends. Lets see the major food points fixed, and this place would be an easy 5 stars."

    "review": "I have been on a Ping Pong hiatus for about two years, but was recently in need of a quick bite before a show at the Southbank in December 2014 and decided to revisit. I was craving steamed buns, so we were determined to get in despite the queue that was trailing outside of the restaurant. We barely managed to get food, however, and our experience was utterly tainted by overburdened staff and misinformation- I can confidently say we will continue to avoid Ping Pong for future as a potential dining venue.\nIn particular, we were told that the waiting time for a two person table would be 20 minutes, but it was at least a 40 minute wait before anyone made any effort to seat us. Only after we complained were we directed to a communal table, so we put our foot down and demanded a two person arrangement as we had originally requested. To our astonishment, we were then swiftly seated. \nWe nearly had to physically grab a server because we were having difficulties getting anyone's attention and were forced to order all of our food in a frenzy while stressing that we only had 20 minutes to dine. The server attempted to be congenial and arrange for our bill to be presented immediately to help speed things up, but was still very slow in manifesting this and to take payment. We had no sauces on our table and asked another passing server for these, but they never arrived and we ended up sharing with our neighbours. Our table was literally so close to both adjacent tables that we were pinned to the wall as well- it was the most stressful and uncomfortable meal I have experienced in recent memory.\nIt must be acknowledged that they did honour an NUS discount and that I have previously eaten at other, smaller and speedier branches of Ping Pong in the past, but the Southbank branch is best avoided if you wish to enjoy a relaxing meal. I can barely recall the quality of the food because we were so dissatisfied with the visit and were forced to voraciously stuff everything in our faces, but I recall that the steamed buns that I did order would have otherwise proved satisfactory as they are a specialty of the chain."

We had to wait 30 minutes but we cracked open a bottle of wine upstairs in the cocktail bar so that was fine. \nOur waiter was really lovely and friendly, but a bit useless (ie lots of running around and flapping but not much actual doing). That said, I don't really mind crap service when someone is as nice a fella as this dude was, he made us laugh a few times and that's worth its weight in gold (we're cold as ice Kent girls). \nThe food was good, no complaints, nothing super special I'll warrant though. They forgot a few dishes which we had to nudge them about.  \nI know it's a really lame thing to say but I'm not really into the sharing tables The tables and benches are rounded, and ideal for a group of 8 or so. But for the 3 musketeers alone, nay so good.  With 3 or 4 groups ordering food and wine, there was no space for anything. The chairs don't have backs, which means if you chilling out for the long haul (we were there like 3 hours gossiping away) you're potentially going to be doing a lot of hunching over your table and my back was creaking by the end (I need posture lessons, must Yelp that next).\nIn short, I would go back if someone else really wanted to go.

Then the waiter returns with your order form, and as the food is prepared and arrives steaming hot to your table, he crosses the dishes out one by one from the list. \nIt's a great flexible system that can accommodate both snacky and havn't-eaten-in-days customers with the same ease as you basically tailormake your own menu.

My FAVOURITE kind of food ever is Dim Sum. Little parcels of heaven, often washed down with a fragrant smelling tea. I and do LOVE tea.\nSo Ping Pong, known in my circle of friends as the upmarket chain dim sum restaurant of choice in London (we are working on a catchier title trust me!). This one is in prime location, South Bank. Also nice decoration and always busy, even upstairs at the bar. That tells me that Ping Pong is doing something right. So I went in with high expectations. A fragrant cocktail at a very reasonable price (hibiscus mojito, why yes I'll have more please) started the evening well. Then we attempted the dim sum. Drum roll please. Well, in my head anyway. \nThe Dim Sum was nice, good selection and tasty indeed. I felt slightly overpriced for what you were getting, especially considering Chinatown isn't a million miles away and hidden in there are some SUPERB cheaper places (if you know where to look). Don't get me wrong, a wonderful evening - don't go for a cheap meal (don't get dim sum if you want a cheap meal to be honest) but I would go again. Mainly for the cocktails, but considering this is my favourite kind of cuisine EVER I was satisfied. Yes readers, that is Daniel P and his high standards... ;)"

Coming in on a Thursday night at 7:30PM, I immediately thought to myself that the noise level was way out of hand. Even though we were just three people at the start of the evening, I could not make out what the other two were talking about, even though they were sitting next to me. \nMy grumpy mood might have been affected by my hunger, because it was soon forgotten as  the food and drinks finally arrived. In short, the dim sum was all in all pretty good. Not mind-blowingly good, but for the price I was more than satisfied. The dim sums are a bit \"fusion\" - far from any classic dim sum restaurant in Chinatown, but they cater well to a Western palate with safe choices like honey glazed ribs and the like. No boiled hen feet on this menu ...\nAlthough you can't go wrong with the beers they serve, we definitely went wrong with the drinks. The mojito they serve, of which two of us ordered, was the worst I have had. 90% ice, very bitter, and not a hint of any booze in there at all. We ended up returning ours. We had a couple of others that seemed alright, among those a  passion fruit drink. All in all I just think drinks are not their forte."

    "review": "In a word: YUM!!!\nI came here last week with some friends and we loved this place! The overall vibe is trendy, modern, and just generally cool. We arrived at around 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! With the promise of being seated in 15 minutes, we put our names on the list, took a buzzer, and decided to get a drink in the lounge upstairs.\nThe lounge is outfitted with plush seating and sleek wooden tables. While the space looks pretty, it's a bit impractical. The seats are quite low and packed closely together, which is inconvenient for my fellow members of Team Long Legs. Also, the lounge features table service, but there was no clear host/hostess on the night that I visited. I think my friends and I caused a bit of a kerfuffle amongst the staff when we 1) seated ourselves and 2) ordered drinks from someone who wasn't assigned to our table. Welp I don't feel bad because better service procedures would have avoided the confusion.\nWhen our buzzer finally rang 30 minutes later (!!), we returned downstairs to one of the circular family-style tables. Our waitress recommended that each person order five dishes. I'm not entirely sure how ravenous one would have to be to order that much food, but I was very hungry and very satisfied with two dim sum dishes, one rice pot, and a lite bite. All my items were delicious, filling, and well worth the money!\nThe one other issue that I had with Ping Pong was our waitress. Le sigh, here comes the classic \"bad British service\" complaint. But seriously, our waitress rolled her eyes at my friend when she asked for a different liquor in her cocktail, which the lounge hostess upstairs specifically told us was an acceptable request. Then when we asked to split the bill, our waitress handed us a pencil and told us to split it ourselves. I personally didn't have a problem with that because I assumed that doing the math ourselves ensured that everyone paid for their own items. After our waitress took the divided dim sum sheet from us, she returned with receipts that did not match the sums that we calculated for her. On top of that, she added 12.5% gratuity. I did not recall seeing a note about automatic gratuity on the menu. I would certainly expect that for a party of 6+, but not for 3 people! And certainly not for such mediocre service. We all paid it anyways because we didn't want to cause a scene. \nI think I'd return to Ping Pong for the food and the atmosphere, but I'd just avoid that particularly rubbish waitress."

    "review": "First of all, if you want a true dim sum experience, there are better places in Chinatown.  And that says a lot.  You lose that authentic ambiance without the rolling carts bustling about.  Not to mention that the selection is missing a lot of the more \"ethnic\" gems.  I suppose much of this is to be expected given the clientele of the establishment.  *cough*cough* NOT ASIAN *cough*cough*  Ping Pong is more of a white-washed, fusion restaurant catering mostly to bland taste buds.\nWith that being said, if you look hard enough, you will be able to find some tasty options on the Dim Sum menu that take a few steps away from standard Chinese dishes.  Be prepared to use a lot of sauce to capture the flavor though.\n   ~ Five stars:  The Crispy Prawn Balls.  Superb, and unique.  A flaky and crispy shell with a thick, paste of a filling.  Pretty heavy.  These were the favorite of the night.\n   ~ Five stars: Hoi Sin Vegetable Puff.  Also a favorite, crunchy and light.  I could have eaten five more of these.\n   ~ Five stars: The Honey Glazed Spare Ribs.  So popular that night, that they ended up running out.  I was pleasantly surprised and would have ordered more if they didn't run out.\n   ~ Four stars: Steamed Sichuan Rabbit Dumpling.  Mmmm, rabbit.  This is a seasonal special.  The leanness of the rabbit paired well with the hearty steamed bun shell and syrupy sauce.\n   ~ Three stars: The Crispy Duck Spring Rolls.  It's actually an egg roll.  Still, I pretty much love anything with duck, so long as it's prepared right.  The Hoi Sin Sauce is obviously what made this dish delicious, but I also found the duck to be tender and flavorful.  \nNote that each selection comes in a set of three.  So if you're with a party of four, order doubles of each dish?  \nTotal came to around \u00a311 per person for a group of three.  We ordered no drinks, except hot tea.  There is a \"Set Menu for 1\" deal priced at \u00a39.95 per person that includes a single serving portion from 10 different dishes, but the selection isn't that fantastic.\nI'm used to putting up with bland food while I'm staying in London.  The taste buds here are atrocious.  And honestly, though most of the food selections were underwhelming, I was still pleasantly surprised with many of our selections.  Not to mention that Ping Pong is a frequented establishment for many of my friends.  \nWhile I'm sure that at any other time, I would have awarded Ping Pong with just three stars, I found the complimentary hot tea a nice gesture, the overall price affordable and decent, the atmosphere cool and chic, the service fast, the bathrooms clean, and the location convenient."

I've never known defeat like it. \nWhat lets this branch down, though obviously too is a plus, is its location on the busy  chain & tourist fest that is the Southbank. You cannot book, so on one busy Sunday we were turned away, and they are always busy so you have no other choice than to savour one of their delicious cocktails; juices; wines in the bar while you wait. You also need to be prepared to be seated with others while you dine. Sometimes this doesn't bother me but when you are trying to eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and you and your friends want an adult conversation, you'd rather it not be listened in on by tourist's and their young son! \nThe staff were friendly and the service was good / quick considering how busy it was but I would rather not return to this branch."

It does, however, defy another semi-truism about London:  It is not always easy to find a delicious meal in a good restaurant for reasonable price.  \nMy family and I ate lunch here.  We were sat at a tale with some other guests - a move I always find cozy and quite conducive to friendly feeling meal.  (Conducive that is unless you are sat next to the Adams Family or Stalin.)  The decor was a zen sand garden, rocks of tables place gracefully among carefully raked sand.  \nMy family and I ordered a variety of dishes as one often does in dim sum.  Some steamed dumplings with prawn, some veggies with spice wrapped in something quite nice made of rice), soup, steamed rice, and more.  All items (soup excluded) came in sets of three like the Triplets of Belleville.  We were more content than a hoard of otters playing in the water.  Everything made our stomachs cry out with joyous choruses of \"hallelujah!\".  \nOur soprano, mezzo soprano, alto and baritone converged into a chorus golden as Orpheus strumming his lyre.  The bill came to about 7 or 8 per person.  We didn't eat heavy, but we ate enough, and walked out light on our feet.  \nThe only deceiving aspect was that no paddles and ping pong balls were provided as a diversion.  Guess I'll have to bring my own next time.  Think they'll mind if I run around the restaurant smacking a small white off the wall?"

Dim Sum is well made and tastes good. I would prefer more choice. Offers loyalty cards which gets you some free nibbles. This place charges 12.5% service"

    "review": "Never in the history of Dim Sum have such small parcels of food been so expensive to eat for so many.\nI made the mistake of going here with the family on a Friday evening with no reservation.\nThey found us a table quickly to their credit as the place was rammed. The service, despite the pace of the place was commendable. Fast, friendly with no fuss. \nMy biggest complaint was the food: way too expensive for what it was. \nAs a steamed dumpling fiend, the chicken Shu Mai hit the stomach in the right place and in truth, there's something here for all tastes. Thing is, though there's lot of different things to eat, there isn't a lot to eat.\nCall me old school but i like to have a lot of Dim Sum on a few plates, rather than half a dozen platters holding three so-so parcels each. You'll eat but you won't be getting satisfied any time this side of the Rapture. \nPing Pong's all a bit too sanitised and lacks surprise. As for the drinks make sure you actually receive liquid rather than a tumbler full of ice.\n \nConsidering that there was no alcohol involved, the best part of one hundred pounds for a meal, after which i felt hungry again wasn't a good advert for the popular chain.\nThe saving grace i guess was the location, on London's perennially busy South Bank but you can't eat a view can you?"

Don't ask me why -- I've seen it around town and always meant to go, but for some reason I was never able to get around to it until yesterday. I'll set the scene. Its a frightfully Grey and painfully cold Monday. My Monday morning blues are immense and the vibe at my office is bleak, so my colleague and I decide to head out for some comfort food on our lunch hour. We headed for Southbank and the genius revelation to make this the day that I visit Ping Pong for the first time came about. Upon entering we were greeted by a lovely hostess who took us to our table and informed us of their lunch offer. \u00a38 for an 8-item set meal plus a signature tea drink. Amazing and yes please! We placed our orders and I could feel the Monday blues leaving my system immediately. 10 minutes later we were surrounded by a plethora of food. For a mere \u00a38 we each got.....4 steaming hot sticky chicken and prawn dim sum balls, sauteed mushrooms, steamed broccoli, hot and spicy chicken won ton soup, a steaming bowl of honeyed chicken breast and rice and a bottomless flowering green tea. By the end I literally felt like a Dim Sum. I was stuffed to the brim, happy as a clam and....ready for a nap. Sadly, we had to head back to the office, but my \u00a38 delight definitely kept the spirits up all day. \nOur waiter was so lovely as well. He was extremely helpful and attentive and made our meal that much more enjoyable. \nThanks Ping Pong! I'll most certainly be back...but I may have to skip breakfast next time around!"

    "review": "Best dim sum I've ever had? No, probably not. Fun and enjoyable afternoon with good company and tasty food? Yes, definitely!\nOn arrival at Ping Pong, I was nervous that the table that I'd booked for 10 people late last night online via the Ping Pong web site would not be available since I didn't receive an email confirmation. But I need not have worried since as soon as I arrived and asked about \"my reservation for 10 people\", we were whisked upstairs to the lounge/bar/dining area. I have been to this branch of Ping Pong once before, but hadn't realised that there was an upstairs area. However, I was very pleased by this as a) there was only one other group upstairs besides us; b) it was much quieter which allowed us to chat to our hearts' content; and c) the sofas were much more comfortable than the benches downstairs albeit slightly lower. At this point, a big tick for Ping Pong's technological advances and wise decision about seating allocations. \nWe ordered our drinks (all choosing fancy teas of varying fanciness - my favourite of the ones I tried was the lychee and ginger iced tea cooler, which was very refreshing) and settled in to analyse the menu. Another tick for Ping Pong on a special occasion for the wide range of teas that we don't normally have when we go for a traditional dim sum meal.\nThe girls chose a selection of dim sum for the group, which the boys promptly tripled... The food arrived quickly and was served hot and fresh. The flavour complemented each other well - I love Ping Pong for the variety of unusual combinations (like black prawn dumplings). My only criticism is that the steamed dim sum were a bit too sticky, which meant the skins broke and the contents spilled out. We were also slightly disappointed that they did not have cheung fun on the menu. But decent quality food all in all. \nWe also had desserts - the Ping Pong sampler, which I won't describe in detail as it would spoil the surprise - but each mouthful was was delicious and only made you want more. I'm glad I managed to squeeze in dessert!\nOverall, we had a great afternoon - great company and lots of food. However, I think it is over priced (in my opinion, you can get much better traditional dim sum at a very reasonable price), but you do get the more unusual/fusion combinations (like scallop and shitake dumplings, duck spring rolls or seafood pastries). That said, we got what we paid for - a slightly different, very relaxed lunchtime gathering of friends."

    "review": "Ping Pong opened the last year I was with my old company, and we had our departmental Christmas dinner at the original branch opposite the London Palladium. It was packed solid, and I remember it was difficult to get a booking. I had the day off due to moving into my new home that day and met my shortly to be ex-colleagues for what was a very fun evening, with delicious, madly affordable food served in a gorgeous setting. My boss managed to give me no sign I was to be fired right after Christmas.\n My fondness for Ping Pong survived this incident and I went back with my now ex-colleagues (minus the boss) for a catch-up about 6 months later, after the legal wrangling was completed. Again, it was fun.\n And I've been back subsequently with very different crowds  once with my houseguests in the summer, after a performance of The Sound of Music at the Palladium, and last week with my brother and the niece and nephew after our Royal Society lecture.\n Both visits were great. I think my older guests enjoyed themselves  the Jasmine tea is always a show-stopper  and they are the type of older visitors who appreciate an experience of 'trendy' London. The dim sum were duly demolished while friendly banter was exchanged with a couple down from the North at our communal table.\n Some critics have sniffily compared Ping Pong to Hakkasan and Yauatcha. I think the Ping Pong dim sum stand up very well, considering Ping Pong is aiming at a completely different market: mostly the post work crowd; with the dim sum hoovering up alcohol consumption.\n The trip to the new branch at the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank was a wonderful half-term family treat. We arrived just after 8pm, me thinking innocently that there would be a lull as punters left for performances at the Hall. Ha ha ha. The place was hopping, with a queue snaking out the door. We were told we had a half-hour wait but would shortly be moved into a bar area. I asked if the kids could have a snack while they waited, and my brother started complaining we couldn't wait 30 minutes with the children 'at this hour'. I mentioned there was an EAT around the corner  but my nephew bridled at this (EAT is clearly their default pit stop in Cambridge). Also, he had spotted the Chinese script on the ceiling and wanted more.\n We were asked to hang on for 5 minutes and a table was magicked up for us. I was really impressed they even bothered, considering they had flocks of people to spare. Service was brilliant and slick, and the dim sum arrived smartly. Stand-outs were the Har Gau and the squid in satay sauce. The Jasmine tea blew the children away  my little nephew thought it was an alien pod hatching.\n The dim sum are keenly priced for such a glam atmosphere  the most expensive item is \u00a33.99: each menu item comes with 3 portions, allowing easy sharing. My nephew had a series of lemonades with fruit 'shooters'  these were as phenomenally beautiful as the jasmine tea. My brother and I stuck to G&Ts  quite fabulously delicious. These were Tanqueray but on a completely different plane to others I have had recently. 3 G&Ts = half the bill for 4 (12 courses) : \u00a367 including service."

I'm quite a fan but they've certainly gone down hill recently.\nNow we hadn't booked a table and I do have to commend them on getting us seated pretty quickly on a busy night. However, we were told to go upstairs to the bar where we then had to queue for a table. Being in a queue because we're already in another queue really isn't great.\nWe were called pretty quickly but were unfortunately sat outside on one of the coldest nights of the summer so far. They wouldn't switch the outdoor heaters on so we spent a good part of the evening shivering.\nThe food we chose wasn't bad at all but nowhere near as good as what I'd had before. The pork buns were a delight as usual but the rest wasn't much to write home (or a review) about. Much of it was fairly tasteless and much of it all tasted the same. Was it chicken, prawn or something entirely different? It leaves you wondering whether they've labelled the boxes not because people don't know what each piece should look like but because people need help identifying it when they've got it in their mouth.\nDue to the cold we all drank tea to try and warm ourselves up and I had to admit that the lychee tea is rather lovely. The cocktails did look lovely and most are priced around the \u00a36 mark so definitely worth a shot if you're sat out not in sub-arctic conditions.\nThe bill came to \u00a345 between three of us which wasn't too awful although I did have to buy a bag of crisps on my way home to keep my stomach quiet."

Being from Vancouver, where Chinese food is practically the local cuisine, I have high standards for my dim sum, and I (mostly) wasn't disappointed!\nThe decor and menu were interesting, and we ordered round after round of the yummy dim sum - 10 orders and prawn chips between 3 of us. \nFavourites included the crispy prawn balls (we ordered a second round of these) and the shu mai. The crab spring roll, shrimp har gow and prawn and shitake dumplings were also delicious. \nFor me, the only miss was the veggie steambuns- wayyyy too sweet for my taste.\nThe cocktail list was fresh and inventive - I tried a fennel and apple martini, a basil, lemon and black pepper martini and a vanilla vodka lemonade that tasted like Lucky Charms. Yum! Just one question - when we order mixed fancy fruity cocktails here in Vancouver, they are generally made with 2 ounces of liquor, but I am sure that these were just made with one. I noticed this a few other places in London - is this standard?\nThe service really petered off by the end of the night - in order to make this a five star experience the wait staff really needs to keep the standards high thoughout the whole night. \nOn the whole, give it a try!"

Its stylishly designed over too floors, and upstairs is a cocktail lounge bar where you can meet friends before your meal. \nThe service is very fast, and the dim sum is deliscious. This is a great place to meet a large group of friends - the circular tables allow you to see everyone at the same time. And you can share a large variety of food, and get pleasingly sloshed on the excellent cocktails before taking a short walk along the river to watch a movie. Low lighting and candles make it a good romantic spot in the evening too."

All top-notch.\n I went here on Saturday night - I've been there when it's been busy before, and it was fine, but this time around we should have seen the warning signs when we were handed one of those stupid pager things that Student Unions hand out if you're waiting for a burger and chips. After waiting for a table in the bar, we then had to literally wave at the waiters to get somebody to take our drinks order.\n When we eventually got a table to eat at, we discovered that a lot of food on the menu was 'not available' - much to our disappointment. The food, when it arrived, was delicious as ever, but then when the mains were finished, a bill was whacked down on our table, without even asking if we wanted dessert or tea, seemingly in an attempt to turn the table around quicker. We were given a dessert menu after a request... but then had a bizarrely epic wait to get the bill at the end.\n What used to be a great restaurant is now swamped and understaffed on busy nights - leaving yourself up against a bizarre conflict of staff who one minute seem desparate to get you out of the table, and the next are impossibly hard to get ahold of in order to take orders / provide service. Dining is supposed to be relaxing, not leaving you stressed at constant efforts to get the attention of staff, as you squeeze around a communal table that is simply not big enough for the food of all of the dining groups.\n At \u00a375 for 2 including service, it ends up leaving me with a horribly nasty taste in the mouth. The food was great, but did I have a pleasurable dining experience? Not in the slightest. The staff tried their best, but there just wasn't enough of them.\n I would not go to the South Bank Ping Pong again, at least not on the weekend. I think I'll be returning to a quieter branch in future..."

Ping Pong is no exception.\nImagine a huge restaurant filled with bustling carts piled high with steamers chock full of plump dumplings, plates of just sauteed vegetables, dishes teeming with crispy fried squid, pushed by no-nonsense ladies who don't speak English and cut your taro root with scissors in front of you at your crowded, noisy table of 8 people about to burst with tiny dishes. Makes me hungry just thinking about it. \nPong pong is nothing like that. Portions are small, the decor is trying hard for a lounge feel, and they serve pricey martinis. But even if you really want a chichi martini with your pork dumplings, at least those pork dumplings and those martinis should be good. And you should get more than 3 in an order for a dish costing over \u00a33.\nI realize I have high expectations for Chinese food, particularly dim sum. But this place is a perfect example of promoting atmosphere over taste and charging way too much for something that is designed to be cheap and delicious.

Equally the d\u00e9cor seemed okay inside.\n Being two of us they did ask if we wanted to sit immediately if we didn't mind being in the sun. It was absolutely fine I add.\n We considered the Unlimited menu but wondered whether we'd really eat that much bearing in mind the price of \u00a318.79(?) does not cover drinks and some items of the menu.\n Ping Pong do Dim Sum and they do it well. The two most memorable ones were the Black Prawn steamed dumplings and the one with Turmeric. I notice they sell them as three's so one each and then you have to split the third?\n It's not all perfect: I found a piece of clear plastic in my mouthful from one of the Claypot selections.\nI knew I had to highlight this and the waitress quickly said she would get the Manager who apologised and offered us a couple of glasses of wine on the house.\n Prior to this episode, the first steamed Broccoli that was delivered to the table was like mush and was sent back. The second one that came was exactly the same. More about this later.\n We hadn't had breakfast and ate quite a lot, more than we needed to. If we had gone for the Unlimited, we'd have made a small saving each - say the equivalent of one dish so be certain you are going to eat a lot.\n I thought the set menus looked good and took a lot of hassle out of what to order. Any feedback from others on their value?\n Back to Broccoli: When it came to paying I pointed out to the Waitress that the Broccoli had been mush. She just said sorry.\nThen whilst waiting for the other half near the exit the Manager came over to say goodbye and we had a little cordial chat. He asked me if everything else was okay and I asked how the broccoli should have been served. Apparently crispy (with a bite).\nI told him about mine and in reply he told me how hard it was to monitor so much being steamed especially on a Sunday.\n Is that a reasonable excuse? I don't think so. I rarely have fault to complain so never too sure what to expect when I do - not that I was on the Broccoli - I was giving feedback though I should have mentioned that \u00a33.79 for a tiny portion of steamed Broccoli is a rip-off.\n Will I go again?

Not good at all. While the food came reasonably quickly afterwards, there was complete failure to clear empty dishes, and we eventually had to ask (twice!) for the bill.\nThe food was merely okay... yes, it was dim sum, but not exactly good dim sum. Their interpretation of bao was undercooked, their jiaozi were quite good but also slightly undercooked, the prawn toasts reasonably good, the wonton broth rather gritty and tasteless (although the wontons themselves were fair)... you get the picture.\nFortunately, the company I was with saved the evening from being a total disaster -- along with the actually quite acceptably tasting (but VERY weak!) cocktails. It's not worth the premium they charge though, I'm afraid. Overpriced, ineffective dim sum -- there are better places to go in London!"

However, the bill they calculated turned out to be wrong on many items, so we had to manually check them and get them to correct for us. \nAmbience was modern and spacious. Not your average Chinatown dimsum place and good for reasonably stylish gatherings."

    "review": "Came here after a day of shopping looking for some take away food to have for dinner in the hotel. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because many of the items on their menu they didn't actually have.  One of the items they show off on their side walk board out front of their entrance, they only serve for lunch. So we were a little disappointed. But the food was amazing nonetheless. I'm glad we didn't walk out. We ordered 2 different chicken dumplings (chicken with cashews and spicy chicken with vegetables) and both of them were so fresh and flavorful. They were surprisingly out of vegetable rice so we opted for plain sticky rice and it was good and fresh. Their chicken skewers (3) were delicious and well portioned. Lastly, since their pan fried noodles advertised outside but only served for lunch were not available, we chose a vegetable dumpling and noodle soup and it was still hot when we got to the hotel and was packed full of goodies. We were very happy with everything we ordered and hope next time we can try the items they didn't have available. It was busy the entire time we waited for our order and every wait staff we encountered were very pleasant and kind. The place had a great vibe!"

I booked a table for 3 on a Weds eve and we were given one of the solo tables rather than being along the shared bar which was great as it's much easier to talk when facing each other!\nUnfortunately it all went a bit downhill from there as the service was inexcusably bad. We had around 45 minutes of happy hour left when we arrived so were pretty confident we could fit 2 drinks into that time, I ended up chasing the waitress down in order to get our second drinks ticket in on time. We also had to wait around 20 minutes for them to pick up our order sheet, despite the fact that we filled it in straight after ordering our first drinks. The biggest bug bear was after our food arrived my friend asked for a fork as she can't use chopsticks, and after at least a 10 minute wait sitting with our food going cold she had to go and ask a second waitress to be provided with one.\nI've given 3* rather than 2 as the food  and drinks were good and reasonable for the price we paid. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is buzzing, but on this occasion the service could have been a lot better."

    "review": "I do find it amazing how rare it is to find a restaurant that offers dim sum after the 5pm cut off point. Although not your typical china town establishment, Ping Pong has obviously honed in on this little niche market and has done quite well in delivering food quality wise and has even produced dumplings which have been experimented on Heston style. We are talking art form here and everything in this restaurant is very classy, very modern, very artsy. One place you definitely need to pay a visit to are the toilets (not for that reason!!) which is situated down a dimly lit corridor (which is my excuse as I accidentally walked into a room with funny wall sinks...) and which are accessible by swiping a hand over a motion sensor panel. The decor is very upscale market and although the food is quite expensive individually, it does work out better value when opting for the set menus which offers several dishes and which does fill you up! In the event of you not being full, and wanting to try more or as much of the dishes as possible, then please do visit Sunday's special buffet, neatly labelled lazy sumdays ;-) for under a fixed price of \u00a325 you are treated to a wide range of dishes which you can easily get carried away with. \nIn terms of drinks, try the teas, as healthy as they are, it's also very fragrant and they come prepared with a 'tea bag' propped open with the tea contents shown."

If it was in Lexington, Kentucky, I could see the novelty but with the great options in Chinatown (and others) I would not return.\nWent with a friend and we tried multiple dim sum.  None were bad and some were pretty good:\n--  Duck bao.  One of the more disappointing.  The duck was smoked and I prefer roasted while the sauce was somewhat thin.  It was a nice sized portion, though.\n--  Duck spring roll, good but not great.\n--  Prawn toast with sesame seeds, one of the best options.  Tasty, a lot of prawn, not much filler.\n--  Spinach and mushroom dumpling.  A surprise success, especially as I normally don't care of mushroom.  Very tasty, fried but not greasy.\n--  Honey soy chicken wings.  Looked and sounded good, meaty wings, not much flavour\n--  Char siu bun, a standard but well prepared and tasty, good balance of filling and bun\n--  Prawn and chive dumpling, good but not great\n--  Black prawn dumpling, most interesting and innovative dish, good flavor\n--  crab and prawn dumpling, good but not incredible\nI also didn't like the service.  Empty restaurant but they could not put us in any of the tables we wanted.  Ended up eating outside, which was great, but they were really kind of jerks about finding us a table.  Overall, a competent meal but not worth the opportunity cost."

You almost feel as if you're in a fish tank looking out! There's a lot of natural light for an underground floor. \nThe wait staff are very polite and gave us a complimentary bottle of beer as it was a birthday in our group which was a nice touch. \nOn to the food...considering dumplings aren't really a speciality dish in their native country, Ping Pong manages to make the dish very appealing both to the eye and the palate. The selection is huge - seafood, chicken, beef, pork and lots more. Our favourite was the Shanghai Xiaolongbao. It's necessary to get the dipping sauces to add extra flavour to the dimsum. \nAnother top dish was the broccoli with the mustard dipping sauce. Then it's also worth trying the duck spring rolls with black sauce. \nThe portion size of the seaweed and prawn crackers was slightly small however they are of a higher quality than you'd typically find at a Soho Chinese restaurant so not too big a complain there. \nHuge recommendation whether a small family group or a large gathering of friends."

    "review": "I was invited out to lunch by a friend and we decided to go to Ping Pong; I had heard about them and she had already been. I love dim sum and wasn't too disappointed; it isn't the BEST in London, but it's tasty enough, the price is right and it's served on a decent environment with good atmosphere and sleek, modern decor (typical dim sum places can be noisy, too brightly lit, uncomfortable and that clich\u00e9 \"chinese takeaway joint\"  decor can put one off).\nYou are given a menu and a list where you tick your selected dishes - quite fun and makes ordering easy. Each portion comes with around three pieces and most are under \u00a34. The baskets come to the table all at once and will be stacked high if you order a lot; tables are on the small side, so it can become a bit awkward juggling all that stuff. But you'll manage. :) It is the right thing to do here, though; the portions aren't huge (they shouldn't be; it's dim sum after all) and it would be very time consuming to keep refilling your table everytime you finished a basket, increasing waiting times.  \nIf you're not too ravenous you could order two or three + a small main meal (one of the rice dishes, maybe). If you're really ravenous, well, you're going to spend a little more or go elsewhere. If you're going for the set menus they are good value, but remember you'll get mostly individual pieces instead of a portion of three as in the a la carte.\nAlmost everything I ordered was tasty, especially the honeyed chilli chicken and mushroom rice pot (not a big portion, but it's only over \u00a36 so I certainly wasn't expecting a bucket). The char sui buns (steamed bun with BBQ pork) are ok; I've certainly had better, but also much worse. Loved my drink called Hibiscus Spritz; you are given a glass of fizz with a flower inside an ice cube in which you pour a concoction of liqueurs; very \"chemistry class\" and deliciously refreshing. Didn't have time for more cocktails and dessert, but will do next time - the drinks menu look particularly appealing and I really liked the one I tried.\nApparently they are always changing the menus with the seasons. A good trick to get you coming back, and I intend to. :)"

It's not the place!\nSpeaking about the food, the quality of it is really high: dim sum are great, with several different fillings and everyone with its characteristic taste and smell, delicious! strongly suggested the black ones (called black prawn dumplings), with squid ink pastry, and the chicken shu mai, chicken and asparagus in a top opened dumpling. But, just take some of them, portions are not that big (from 2 to 4 dumplings each) and it's just so good to share everything with your table!\nDon't forget to have a cocktail or something to drink, this place has a lot of different options you rarely see and their presentation is always special (as example, take the hybiscus spritz: awesome!)\nI still have to try the upper floor, with tables surrounding the kitchen, but I can't say anything bad about this place, this is just great! ah and it's not that expensive!"

I have been to a few of them over the years and they always serve delicious tasty food.\nPing Pong Soho is no different.  When I ate here recently it was full of people happily indulging in their favourite dim sum dishes and guzzling Ping Pong's fantastically exotic cocktails.\nThis is a particularly good venue for big groups and looking around this time I could see that most of the tables were filled with large groups of people.  The only small issue I had this time was my group of 16 were seated on two separate tables.\nThe food here is really delicious.  For those of you not familiar with the concept it is mainly Dim Sum, small bite sized portions of food which are traditionally served in small steamer baskets.  They can be steamed, fried or baked.  In addition to the dim sum they also serve a number of rice dishes such as Honey-Chilli \nChicken Rice Pot or Vegetable Sticky Fried Rice and some small plates such as Honey Glazed Spare Ribs and Chilli Squid.\nFor those of you a bit unsure of what to order there are set menus which will give you  a decent variety dishes to try and this is particularly good if you are ordering for groups.\nIf however you do fancy ordering for yourself then I can heartily recommend the aforementioned ribs, the Potato and Edamame Cakes, The Crispy Prawn Ball and to start the Garlic and Black Pepper Prawn Crackers.  Just don't go mad.  The food is a lot more filling than it looks and you can always order more later. \nThe big selling point for me though has to be the cocktails.  They put a big twist on your common or garden variety cocktail.  With names like Hong Kong Colada, Wasabi and Amaretto Sour and Smoked Nashi Negroni  they are sure to be a conversation starter and the best bit is they taste as good as they sound.  For those of you not so keen on alcohol they have  a good choice of mocktails and lemonades, and for those of you who want something simpler they have a good selection of beers, ciders and wines and a huge selection of teas.\nAnd the best bit of all is the bill at the end of the night will not break the bank!"

I would definitely recommend going on a Sunday when their lazy sumday offer is on: \u00a321.50 all you can eat (excluding a couple of areas of the menu). As ping pong is a dim sum restaurant, this offer definitely pays off, especially when in a group as you can all sample a large amount of dishes for far cheaper than you could ordinarily. \nThe cocktail (though excluded from the lazy sumday offer) are absolutely delicious as are the non alcoholic drinks. I would definitely recommend the Hong Kong Colada as well as the Passionfruit lemonade.\nAs far as food goes the dim sum is expertly made and really delicious. If you are unsure of what to order, go for anything in the Ping Pong selection but, as I said, I would recommend going on a sunday so you can experience many different types of dumpling. \nDefinitely recommend this spot for dinner/drinks in the city."

    "review": "Quick, tasty food, which doesn't cost the earth - it's just a shame that I don't like dumplings!\nAfter my third visit to a dim sum joint I've finally realised that I don't particularly like much of the food.  When I say much, I'm really referring to the dumplings, those steaming piles of slimy stuff delivered in towering stacks of bamboo baskets.  They're just not for me.  I really enjoyed everything else that we had, the edamame, duck rolls, honey chicken and rice.\nThe service was really efficient, although our waitress was either stoned or just extremely disengaged with the planet.  The beer was too expensive (\u00a36.95 for a 640ml bottle) although this seems to have become standard at most chain restaurants these days.  If you can get a seat at the bar I'd recommend it - it looked much more comfortable and spacious up there.\n4 stars overall - a chain place like this can never really get 5 stars so to get 4 is doing very well indeed."

I met a group of friends at the restaurant, great location, just a short walk from Oxford Circus underground station & perfect for a group of girls. The service was spot on, the staff were friendly and welcoming, the restaurant has a great feel to it with gorgeous interior decorating and warm lighting. After viewing the menu for a second time I was so excited about ordering food. We decided to go with the set menu, extremely cheap for central London and looked amazing. I think we paid \u00a315 for a 3 servings including dumplings. When the food came out it looked great but was cold and unfortunately not all that tasty. Rice dishes weren't fresh, dumplings slightly over done. I would give this restaurant a second shot but I wouldn't go for the set menu. They also have gluten free options available which is great!!"

We have specifically ordered one menu because of one dish which they didn't have. Which would not be a big problem if someone would actually tell us that they don't have it.

    "review": "Not your traditional dim sum! All the classic dishes are on the menu - but with little twists, like using fragrant jasmine rice instead of glutinuous sticky rice, and prawn toast using french garlic baguette instead of normal toast.\n The menu is extensive and all the food, especially the seafood ones, were bursting with flavour and extremely fresh. You must try some of their more unusual dumplings - the seabass dumpling is a delight to the eyes, with a dunpling skin dyed purple using red cabbage juice.\n What sets Ping Pong apart from other dim sum restaurants in London is that its not a boring and stiff place - there's a lounge area, and their cocktail menu is quite extensive. You would go to Royal China for example if you had a business meal or a proper Sunday brunch with family. But you go to Ping Pong for a fun night out with friends.\n Pricewise, its more expensive than your usual dim sum in Chinatown, and probably the same price as other great dim sum places like Pearl Liang and Royal China.\n Reviewed by The London Insider\nlondon-insider.co.uk/201\u2026"

In fact, I often come here with a Chinese friend who agrees with all of the above.\nSo, what is it that I don't like? Well, it comes down to the interior design and the customer service, which this place is kind of lacking. Inter-design-wise, I am sure that lots of people would disagree with me, but for me this is too slick, too stylish and too wanna-be funky. As for the customer service, the people here seem to be lacking a great deal of motivation - no smile, no sign of personal acknowledgement whatsoever...and this just doesn't go well with me.\nPlus, it's also not a cheap meal, unless you come on a Sunday, when you can do Lazy Sum Day, which is an all-you-can-eat-kind-of-deal for GBP 18.99...still not cheap though.\nWhat this place is lacking is the authentic Chinese experience of push cards being rolled around in the restaurant, the steam baskets piling up in the trolleys and also the fact that you can order in a more leisurely style. Along the lines of: I still could eat one more, let's see what the next lady is having in her trolley...\nWell, if you want this experience in London, I suggest you go to New World in Chinatown..."

There was special effort put into creating a modern ambiance for enjoying dim sum.  Regardless, I thought the food fell short.  \nI ordered the vegetarian special menu.  It's a great value because I was extremely full for only about 12-13 pounds.  However, I wasn't in love with any of the 6-7 items I received.  Everything seemed to lack flavor or have an oddly mushy exterior.  Nothing tasted bad, but it there were no moments of culinary interest.  Also, things felt a little too commercialized with the open demonstration of pulling pre-made items out of a fridge and plopping them on the steamer.  Efficient, yes.  Appealing to showcase, no.\nI think this place is great for a social gathering, where the focus is more on the company and less on the food."

We were trying to ditch the impending rain and fill our slightly soured hangover bellies when we waltzed in. \nLittle did my friends and I realise we had arrived for \"Lazy Sumdays\", possibly the best invention ever! On Sundays and on weekdays in most of the City locations, Ping Pong has an all you can eat special for just over \u00a318 a head.  If you've never had dim sum, which many in my party had not, and you are superhero hungry then this is the deal for you! Most of the menu is available for this deal but the only trick is everyone in your party has to order this deal.  This was not a problem for my friends.\nWe basically ordered at least one of everything on the menu and if we came across anything we didn't like (which was rare) we simply moved on to the next thing.  We could barely waddle our fat rumps out of the door by the end. It definitely sorted our hangovers out and sent us off as lil happy dumplings.\nSign-up for the loyalty card for more deals and make sure you get one of their yummy cocktails or one of their beautiful gourmet teas."

We're great fans of Yauatcha - Alan Yau's (creator of Wagamama) fantastic all day dim sum place and we'd heard that Ping Pong was just as good but cheaper.\n Well was it?\n Certainly on entering it looked great. We were taken downstairs and there were a number of huge round tables with a subdued light in the centre. We sat on one of the squarer tables but this had a great view of huge ornamental Japanese style courtyard, with trendy projections playing against and enormous wall.\n The food and cocktails were certainly cheaper than Yauatcha (not that Yauatcha's expensive) the cocktails were only six or seven pounds each, which was terrific value as they were very long, full of fresh fruit like kumquats, lychees, blueberries and grapes. Mine in particular had tons of fresh mint and was very alcoholic - so much so I managed to knock a third of it over - D'OH!\n We chose about ten dim sum dishes between the three of us and they averaged at about \u00a33 each. Ping Pong provided a handy menu that we could tick to keep track of our order and make it simpler to give our order to the waiter.\n Onto the food. If I hadn't already been to Yauatcha's several times, I would have thought the food was brilliant. It was certainly very, very good. Some dishes such as the chive dumplings stood out. The sticky rice in parcels was also tasty. The puffy buns were light and filling at the same time. The chilli sauce that was served with most dishes blew my head off - so handle with care.\n My friend had an amazing jasmine tea to finish - boiling water poured onto the head of jasmine flower. It looked like something out of Alien as it grew tendrils in the heat and eventually a white flower wound its way through the water looking like a sea anenome.\n Like all of the new dim sum places in London the toilets were highly trendy too. Black granite everywhere and sensitive taps which turn on as if by magic."

The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, but the ordering and delivery of food was confusing, in part because it is all small dishes, and in a group it was difficult to figure out how much to order and sharing some of the dishes proved awkward.  Some of the deep fried stuff was great, but some of the others - meh.  Also, the bill escalated quickly, as all these little dishes add up very quickly.

This is usually enough for two people and me and my friend always eat them in a particular order as well.\nI like the dark decor as well, its very masculine and the seating is generally good.

It's nothing authentic, but a fairly swish operation, with decent quality ingredients and drinks abound.\n The ordering process is more than a little bewildering, and though the waiting staff do offer to help out with choosing and so on (a la Wahaca), I got the feeling they wouldn't put themselves out too much. Pah, maybe they're just busy.\n We had cocktails to start off with, which possibly wasn't the smartest move, but we had to wait for a table. They were worth it though, unusual and very well made. However it meant that tastebuds were somewhat dulled when we were seated and the tea came along. The teas are great and quite well sum up the whole experience - far from authentic but snazzy. The flowering teas open up when they are poured. Nice touch.\n Anyway, back to the food. Ordering is done by ticking boxes on your own lottery-esque ticket. Pretty standard stuff on display. In addition to a large array of dumplings, we tried a few pork buns, soft shelled crab and a chef special chilli prawn concoction. All the food was tasty, yes. Didn't set my world alight, but it was tasty, arrived quickly and made me happy.\n Ping Pong do a Dim Sumday on Sundays, eat all you can / like for \u00a317. It's not a bad deal for Ping Pong, as it's not a cheap place to go on a regular day, but the formula works. Fresh, quick, accessible. People leave happy."

As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that this restaurant has going for it is the ambience. The portions were small and the food was bland at best. Definitely not up to the standard of restaurants found in Chinatown even the not-as-nicely-decorated ones. The dishes were rather pricey too.\n While I did not try the drinks here, I'm told by an alcohol-loving friend that this place has some incredible cocktails."

Well, Ping Pong's baked 'Pork Puff' that's what's not to like. This was the first dish to arrive to our table and it was essentially a mini sausage roll that someone had poured honey onto. Sickly sweet and unpleasant, it did not fill me with high hopes about the rest of the meal.\nFortunately, this was as bad as it got and although the Soft Shell Crab was greasy, all three of the steamed dim sum we chose were delicious. The service was very quick and efficient but I resented the waitress encouraging us to over order. Three to four dim sum each seemed a bit over the top and these dishes weren't cheap. In fact, being a big fan of dim sum I noticed that these prices were at least a pound more than anything you would pay in China town. Ok, you get to sit in sleek surroundings and sip cocktails but frankly I prefer my dim sum with a little more character and would rather sit in some weird Chinese back room restaurant than have another watery 'Lychee and roses' cocktail for \u00a36!"

There are lots of Ping Pong's in different areas in London, therefore a safe option to find one in your part of town.\nIn my opinion this place is perfect for visitors who like to put little bits and bobs together. The choice is extensive and for those who have a hard time making up their mind, there are set menus.\nYou get a pencil to tick the right menu box for the dim sum chosen. Ping Pong recommends 4-6 dishes each, which mean a table for two will be covered by all sorts of dim sum baskets in every shape and form. 'Surprise' is the right word to describe the dumplings you choose, as you do not know what it tastes like before you have tried each of them.\nI little tip, ask the waiters to not bring everything at once - it is a shame when food gets cold. The place is an experience, it not only holds surprises for you but also engages with the customer interactively. You will not get bored and you need to be skilled in eating the dim sum with chopsticks."

I wanted this to be a nice surprise for the birthday girl. They looked at me in a total state of confusion as to why I would want to do this. I eventually paid up and returned to the table.\n The champagne took 20 mins in getting to us, meanwhile I was trying to put everyone off ordering drinks so as not to spoil the surprise.\n The drinks eventually arrived and we ordered the food. The waitress was rude and uninterested. It took ages for her to take our ordering slip which we had promptly filled out. We each expected to make 2 or 3 rounds of orders but in the end it took 2 and a half hours for them to serve us just 2 dishes each, we gave up and I asked that the cake be bought out. Someone said they would deal with it. A few minutes later the rude waitress returned and asked loudly right infront of the birthday girl \"should I bring the cake out now?\" it was meant to have been a surprise.\n 20 mins later and the cake hadn't arrived, I asked her again, but still no cake arrived. Eventually I asked the manager who said he would deal with it which he did. However, as soon as 10 members of our party (including the birthday girl) left for a cigarette, he bought out the cake... To an empty table!!\n Eventually we complained and only paid a fraction of the bill. But this wasn't the point. It took 3 hours from start to finish and we received very little food. It totally ruined the evening and we were all still so hungry that we ended up getting noodles on the way home.\n If I could, I would only give one star. Thoroughly disappointed, will never visit again.\n Also, food that DID arrive was average."

(No offense, Sea-Town, I got nothin' but love for ya, baby.)\nA local friend of ours recommended Joy King Lau and he did not lead us wrong. I had planned on going to Yuatcha, but its format of serving dim sum sounded... un dim sum-like.\nI wanted a huge variety of well-executed dishes to choose from. Price, location, or the level of service made no difference to me. \nOutside their door, I read the stickers plastered all over the window, 'Best of this' and 'Best of that.' Upon entry inside, the door is opened for us. And... and... they SMILED at us. \nWhat kind of dim sum parallel universe have I fallen into?? I touch my chest and legs to make sure I'm not dead. \nWe are the first people in the restaurant, and promptly served Oolong tea. The menu is so expansive, I forgot what I read by the time I got to the end of the menu. You'll want to write your choices down; trust me.\n- Rice noodle roll filled with shrimp covered in fried bean curd sheet. PERFECT.\n- Roast duck with bok choy served over rice. Standard dish and solid here\n- Tong Choi - stir fried greens in garlic. They did an awesome job of cooking these; they weren't slimy from overcooking and had the right amount of salt and broth\n- Curry octopus: the octopus are so teeny and adorable you may feel bad about eating them. But then you take a bite of the tender body and all bets are off\n- Sticky glutinous rice - my date loves this dish. Sticky rice steamed in leaves; I don't think he counts it as dim sum unless he orders this. What was DIFFERENT about this one was the filling. Huge chunks of meats are inside! One inch+ chunks of pork, fat cuts of Chinese sausages (not the teensy eensy cubes) \nDishes are cleared quickly, without feeling like they're rushing you. Teacups are continuously topped off, and all around, the service was far above what I'm used to.\nAll these dishes were under 38.00 GBP. Wicked deal plus the quality (and service!) means I'll be heading back here."

Most dim sum restaurants had lines but we were seated almost immediately at Joy King Lau. The restaurant is multi-storied and we were directed to the second floor upon entering.\nMenus were already at our tables when we sat down. You'll see two menus - the dim sum one is laminated and has pictures of all the dim sum they serve, making it really easy to order. If you wanted other Chinese food, you could also refer to the full menu. \nMy friend and I ended up getting thai style chicken feet (cold), shu mai, dough stick cheung fun (jar luen), yam croquette, char siu croquette, and preserved egg and pork congee. The food came shortly after we ordered, and they were delicious and in my opinion, closer to HK standards compared to other dim sum I've had. The yam croquette and char siu croquette are fried dim sum but they were not greasy at all. The shu mai and jar luen were flavorful!\nOverall, Joy King Lau is a fantastic place for delicious dim sum.

The shu mai was completely different (a much better different) than anything I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was made with pork but it was perfectly flavored and had great elasticity (many people don't get what I mean by that). But the most breathtaking item on the menu had to be the DEEP FRIED CUSTARD BUNS. These custard buns went from 0-100 real quick in the fryer.

    "review": "I've heard frequently that Joy King Lau has the BEST dim sum in Chinatown. This is not true. They do decent dim sum that is better than a lot of Chinatown, but still not the best. Where Joy King Lau really shines is the cooked noodles/rice dishes they do, which have a great fresh flavour, aren't too oily and are good sized portions for the price. \nWe came here as a large group and booked a table which was a pleasant surprise in itself, and were pleased with not only how quickly the food came, but how polite the service is. Friendly waiters are not generally the main aim for when you go to Chinatown, but it's good to know that it isn't entirely gone from the restaurants here! \nI'll definitely be coming back here as the food is pretty good and cheap, plus the service + reservations means extra high points from me. It's not my first choice for dim sum in Chinatown, but the chefs change regularly at all the establishments so it's hard to keep up!"

I wasn't really impressed by the food that they served. For some reason, I felt that it was lacking flavor to it and it was true for all the dishes that I had. \nWe had two different waiters that waited on us. The older gentleman was very nice and polite and helpful when ordering food , but the older lady that was there at the same time tends to ignore you. I've asked her for extra rice and salt and was ignored and she never brought it to the table. Weird. Be aware that they automatically include the service charge. Sneaky \nWe ordered a Chinese watercress cooked with shrimp paste which was above average , it lacks a little salt in it which I probably wouldn't have mind if I could have gotten my waiter to bring me some salt. Per the waiter's recommendation, we ordered a tofu with seafood plate which had a decent serving with a lot of seafood in it. \nThe food was a little cold. I don't know why. It's not freezing cold but just luke warm. I prefer my food to be hot , straight off from the wok. Maybe it sat on the dummy waiter for a while before the brought it to the table."

The interior is generic Chinese restaurant, a little bit dirty and rusty.

I almost never get to that, so I when I do, it's always super exciting.\nWe got to Joy King Lau through Yelp reviews. Here are the points worth noting for other lovers of the genre:\n1. Get there on time minus 10 minutes. They start letting people in at ~11:50.\n2. There are no dim sum carts. You get a special menu and order from that. The menu includes most of the solid favorites. \n3. The crowd in this restaurant is mostly Asian, but not only.\n4. Prices are average. For 2 semi-hungry people we paid \u00a337, 10% service is included here. \n5. Food taste is okay. It's not bad and it's nothing you'll remember later/think to come back for. \nPersonally I would have wanted to have a better tasting meal at Dim Sum. Apparently there are 2 other good spots in London's Chinatown area: Wan Chai and Beijing Dumpling that are similar as well."

    "review": "If you're looking for the best(!) and freshest(!) Dim Sum in Soho - look no further! Joy King Lau on Leicester Street (adjacent to Lisle Street) offers a fairly large menu of steamed & fried dim sum, including some more exotic varieties - and a selection of cheung fun, of course.\nJust returned from London, where I always have dim sum several times during my stays. So far, I mostly frequented the Wan Chai Corner (on Gerrard Street) for its broad selection and solid quality, or Beijing Dumpling (on Lisle Street) for its absolutely freshly made dumplings. The two I will still recommend strongly - but Joy King Lau is different. All the dim sum are made freshly and have a better (firmer, more al dente usually) bite to them than those of the competition. Also, they're about 15% cheaper in comparison to the other Soho establishments, which also makes this restaurant great value! The regular dim sum are just UKP 2.80 per dish.\nThree times I had lunch at Joy King Lau in early to mid-August of 2015 - three times I chose 5 or 6 different dim sum each. This might seem too much for the average single traveler, but I wanted to sample as many different dim sum from this place as possible, having read some rave reviews on the Internet (the reviews here are mixed, which I don't quite understand). Expect 3 or 4 dim sum per person for a tummy-filling meal. They made only 1 mistake, as they served me the regular salty fried squid instead of the squid cakes I had ordered.\nThe atmosphere is quite typical for a Soho Chinese. It's always rush-rush-rush - this is no place to linger with friends for a party, or with a large family on a get-together. OTOH, for a quick lunch or early dinner with a friend or wife, it's great. You can always hang out for chit chat at one of the many pubs in the neighborhood (there's a good Fuller's pub a stone's throw away on the same street). Having said that, the waiters *never* forced the bill on me after I'd finished my meals - I had to ask for it!\nThe fact that Joy King Lau is also a small(!) restaurant tends to add to the atmosphere of slight chaos and rush.\nWhat's less typical is that the service is very attentive - they're always around to fill up your cup of Chinese tea (which you'll get automatically once you've been seated - so pay attention if you don't want tea!). Sometimes too attentive - there are so many waiters and waitresses around it can happen that one hands you the menu, then turns away, then another one steps up to ask for your order - 30 seconds after you've been seated! It may sound like pushiness - but it is not. The waiters just don't pay attention to what the others are doing.\nIf a little chaos does not deter you, the traveler looking for first class dim sum, then you shouldn't hesitate and include Joy King Lau in your Soho roster of Chinese joints. See the photos for the variety of steamed and fried dim sum I had (not a fan of cheung fun, so I can't comment on those). Particularly recommendable are: the pork & prawn dumplings with Chinese mushroom, the fried skin of chicken filled with four delicacies (just called \"Chicken with Four Kinds\" on the menu!), the beef with spring onion and ginger, the spicy beef tripe (not quite so spicy, actually - it's made with ginger), the siu mai (a standard dim sum, but of higher quality here than elsewhere!) and the chicken with Chinese dumpling (Warning: the chicken here is on the bones!). But ALL of the 17 ones I had were of superior to excellent quality.\nThe bill includes a \"mandatory\" 10% service charge. With 6 dim sum + chinese tea + service I ended up with a UKP 20-21 bill. Very reasonable considering the quality.\nDim sum can be ordered up until 5 p.m. (17.00), which is customary in Soho.\nAlmost all of the other guests during my three visits to Joy King Lau were Asian - I always consider that a good sign. Make sure that when you want to have lunch there with 3 or even 2 people that you show up at 12 noon when they open on weekdays, because the small restaurant will fill up quickly.\nPlease have a look at my photos, which also includes snapshots of the menus."

While we were waiting for our table on the 2nd floor landing (yes it looked like a landing :) I had to let people in and out of nearby toilet.\nThe venue itself looks elegant but it's not a kind of in-your-face decor.

The room is a little more spacious here however and the staff extremely attentive. Ensuring items get to your table in as few visits as possible. There were only 2 main visits to our table and we had all 8 dishes we'd ordered.\nNothing was stand out delicious, and whilst the chicken's feet were very nice and meaty, the sauce left me disappointed. And this was a case for quite a few dishes. Portion wise fantastic, but taste wise, extremely lacking. However this this instance you can normally expect the chilli oil to save the day, and save it indeed. It was excellent.\nSo I have no quibbles recommending this place if you're after good value dim sum. However just don't expect anything to surprise or tantalise your tastebuds. This place has a large number of regulars so they must be doing something right in terms of consistency, but sometimes that is at a price and for my it was the lack of that any one unique dish that you absolutely must go back for."

    "review": "Went there yesterday craving for dim sum with my friend... well it was quite disappointing! I do not understand the good reviews here. We are back from a trip to Asia missing it, and I am from asian background, but being served defrosted poor quality dim sum when you crave and dream about yummy original ones is really frustrating!! \nWe ordered classic things, such as Har gao, Xiaolongpao, cheung fun... really bad sorry. Nothing tasted like original homemade. The cheung fun was made of three poorly defrosted old prawns stuck into an insipid dough sheet. It was not even cut into pieces, did not even have the onion, and the prawns inside were disgusting. The har gao strongly felt like a poor quality ready made from the freezer with weird dodgy mushy shrimp, and the appaling xiaolongpao was made of a disgusting dough, if I don't mention the inside! Please bring Din tai fung here! Aside those, we also had vegetable dumplings, with veg inside tasting almost like they were not good to eat anymore...\nI understand it can be difficult to manage offering such a huge choice of dim sum on the menu, so that not everything can be homemade and fresh, but I am shocked that none of the things we ordered seemed homemade. Especially coming to standard choices.\nOn top of that, staff is really cold and not welcoming like it can be the case in some asian restaurants, but still if only they were serving good food!"

After reading some of the other reviews some of the criticisms are justified so in recognition of that, perhaps 4 is more conservatively just - that said some of the criticisms are the very paragon of asinine ignorance (mainly those complaining about yum cha only being served until 4.30).\nIve been eating at this place for almost 20 years (since i was around 15). So it's fair to say it has a special place in my heart. That said i wouldnt have kept coming back if the food was sh*te. Not that it's always mind-blowing, but it is consistently tasty, well prepared and of an authentic high standard. Also due to it's location in chinatown the prices are competitive. Over the years i have brought hundreds of friends here, all of whom have been converted to adopting it as their regular yum cha place in central.\nThese days i mainly go here for yum cha (dim sum). I truly believe that along with Yi Ban (docklands) and Lotus (Canary Wharf) it is one of the best \"dim sum\" places in London - head and shoulders above the overpriced and often underwhelming and sometimes rubbish Royal China, or Phoenix Palace.\nBy way of exemplifying the caliber of this joint - a close friend of mine, whose old man who owns a couple of chinese restaurants in Chinatown, eats here with his family."

    "review": "Finally came here for dim sum. It is one of those multi-floor monstrosities that Chinatowns are known for. Where the guy at the bottom (at primetime on a weekend) manages the queue via his cohorts upstairs on walkie talkies. From there, they send you to a floor and tell you a table number.\nYou get to your designated floor, and flag down a waitress running around who then barks at you (in a way oh so familar and even sort of cherished part of Chinese customer service at places like this) to just wait. Who cares about the table number, they never asked for ours. We waiting another several minutes at our floor level (always feeling in the way between the staircase and the women's loo), then when a table finally left, were seated. I think you have to be a little bit assertive (like, stand visibly in the hall), or they might forget about you. \nThere aren't any rolling carts or pieces of paper to write your dim sum order on... you just order like at a standard restaurant. The menus appear in both Chinese characters and an English 'translation', i.e. 'roast pork bun' or 'shrimp lasagne' and you just have to sort of guess to figure out what you want if you know it by romanized Chinese (i.e. Char Siu Bao). \nThat said, the Char Siu Bao were good, as were the 'mixed croquettes', and the 'egg custard tarts'. Once we ordered, the service was prompt and really, really solid. Tons of food for two ended up around \u00a328.\nOh, also, we were pretty sure they added on a service charge without telling us. Sneaky. Easy to do since the bills are in Chinese."

I can't really compare this to other dim sum places in London, for some reason this is the only place I've been too but from what others have told me it's really authentic \"chinese\" dim sum (I don't know that either since I've never been to China).\nI can't really be helpful to tell you what to order either as I don't know the names of most of the food I ate but the shrimp dumplings were divine and they have this kind of noodle \"lasagne\" that is out of this world.  We had the shrimp one and one with some fried bread in the middle and really really I could have eaten 3 of those it was so tasty.  So I can't be really helpful to you here except that you can take my word that it's delicious and you need to try it yourself!!! ;)\nOnly down side I can think of is this place on the weekend gets really crowded and not only is it a hard time for the host to get people to form a line outside (their entrance are is very small), you constantly need to remind him where you are in the line because people are constantly ignoring the line and just walking in trying to get a table (clearly I'd say there's a reason people are waiting in line but that's just my logic).

The chee cheong fun (with pork) came sitting in a puddle of sauce that I was worried would overwhelm the flavor of the pork. Nope! Instead, the sauce added a nice counterbalance to the blandness of the noodles, while the pork flavor still came through. \nThe prawn and pork dumplings and seafood dumplings were also nice, as were the minced pork and mushroom dumplings. The last of these looked really pretty repulsive sitting in the basket, with the mushroom sitting like a lump on top of a ball of pork, but the flavor more than compensated for the crazy appearance.\nMy favorites, though, were the char siu bao and the veggie dumplings. The roasted pork flavor was not too overwhelmingly sweet (as can often happen), and there was the perfect amount of pork in the bun. The veggie dumplings were so subtle and so nice - I'm not even sure what every vegetable was in there because we wolfed them down so quickly. \nThe service bordered on surly, but wasn't bad - the dishes came quickly, the tea pot was always full, and the check arrived right when we wanted it - so I can handle a little surly in exchange for this kind of dim sum!"

Probably helps being in the center of London's Chinatown. \nWe ordered several dishes- XLB's, peking duck w/ pancake and bbq pork over rice. They were all fantastic, wish I could say the same about the bill but 40% of the cost is for picking a place in the center of London lol.\n(This is a late review from November 2017 btw)"

    "review": "Let me preface this review by saying that Xiao Long Bao is my LIFE so I have extremely high standards for it. I'm not entirely sure about the standards of XLB in London so I'm definitely surprised to hear that Dumplings' Legend offers some of the best in London after my meal.\nI haven't tried other XLB to compare but I'm sure this city must have more amazing XLB to show! Overall - 4 stars because the XLB were great, don't get me wrong, but they weren't out of this world and this city definitely deserves better!\n~ Atmosphere:\nIncredibly hectic. The place was packed FULL, overall not too pleasant of an atmosphere to eat in.\n~ Customer Service:\nI've had a different experience to other reviewers - the customer service here is great. Very attentive and quick with their service. The food came out at the speed of light.\n~ Food:\nWe ordered both pork and pork and crab XLB - both of them were really great and juicy, but the broth inside was just OK. I much preferred the pork and crab to the pork-only because the crab added an extra dimension of flavour that took their XLB to the next level. Overall, I liked their Xiao Long Bao but if you're a self-proclaimed XLB connoisseur like me you should keep searching.\nDownsides: Ordered their custard buns, it wasn't custard but salted duck yolk (which I like, but definitely not custard so I don't know why they advertised it as such). Also, they don't offer Chinese hot oil at all unfortunately, only soy sauce and vinegar. Not too great if you're into hot oil like I am.\n---\nI like Dumplings Legend. I would say that they're more of a 3.5 stars, but I'm happy to bump it up to a 4 because I don't think it's quite there to justify a 3. The food was great and I'd definitely come back here again, but the search for the best XLB in London continues on."

In fact, most of them were stuck to the paper on the bottom so it was impossible to actually get any of the soup from the soup dumpling. The bottom would rip, the soup would come out, and we'd be left with just some filling and ripped dumpling dough.\nOn the flipside, the staff was friendly.\nThe hot and sour soup was okay, a bit too sweet.\nIf you're in a pinch, don't feel like waiting, and want some Chinese food, this place will do the trick, but I can't really recommend it beyond that."

    "review": "What a mess! When I sat down, a gentleman at the table next to me (and you know how those tables are inches apart!) kept complaining to his friend about how their dim sum hadn't arrive. They were American (I am American). A French mother and daughter two tables away from us as well as this table of American men repeatedly flagged down the waiters for waiting a long time for food.  I thought they was just unfamiliar in the ways of Chinese service, nope!\nOur food began arriving because I ordered all over the menu. However, it became apparent that the complaints of my fellow patrons were true. First off, the runners couldn't even tell us what they were dropping off and argued that a dish on the table was tripe. Tripe is my religion. My boyfriend knows tripe--he's basically a butcher. That wasn't even the same color or texture as tripe. I returned from the bathroom and my boyfriend tells me the two guys next to us left and it was a huge drama because they refused to pay for any of their food or drinks because they waiting over an hour and their dim sum never came. Around this point, the mother and daughter received theirs, they waited more than an hour and unfortunately only ordered one type of dim sum.\n2 hours into our experience, 4 dishes hadn't arrived. But! This new server came out of nowhere. He was so lively and friendly compared to the woman who took our drink order and actively avoided everyone in the dining room despite being the only server on our floor. I asked him if the plate in front of me (we tried to eat it but it was so dry and cold), was tripe. He laughed and said no! And very quickly and efficiently took that and our missing food items off the bill. THEY STILL HADN'T EVEN MADE THEM--otherwise we would've boxed them. He saved our entire experience. He even said not to worry about the service charge. No man, you deserve all the service charges. That second star is just for him. And we will probably give this place another shot because he was so great."

If you want something special and you know the name but you cannot find it on the menu just ask and probable they will just bring it. It would actually help if you know a bit  what you want or otherwise just try to be seated next to some (Chinese) locals and copy ;-)\nI was graving for dumplings so only had a nice variety of the fresh dumplings but I will definitely come back soon to try the dumpling soups and the steamed filled buns which looked amazing at our neighbours tables."

I recommend scooping them out with a spoon then attacking them with chopsticks, unless you are really good with chopsticks - which I am not.  We also ordered one of the specials prawn toast, this has to be the best prawn toast I've ever had! It had full prawns with tails layerd on top of toast with sesame seeds.

The crayfish ones are really good, but you can't go wrong with their classic pork. Just remember, all in one bite! Don't try and do it in halves because then you'll get precious bao juice all over yourself you messy pup! \nService is fast, efficient though not particularly happy or friendly.

I particularly liked the prawn dumplings. If you, like myself, like to eat a lot, I would suggest getting a couple of the mains to share with your group as well.\nThe only drawbacks were that they did forget to bring one of the dishes and we eventually canceled it and also that the music was on repeat (there's only so many times I can listen to Let it Go in one sitting).

I usually get the crystal prawn, and their broth infused dumplings in the spicy pork. Beware though! When eating the broth infused ones you have to gobble it down in one bite otherwise you will get it all over yourself! I also like to get the crispy duck and pancakes, and I'll admit that this dish isn't the best you'll find in Chinatown but its still lovely. The chinese broccoli is also a top dish for me, as well as the pumpkin and prawn dish which is totally different from anything you would find at other places.\nThe venue is so clean its virtually spotless. Everything is white and clean and the glass partition where the dim sum makers work is wiped down several times a day and is always looking great. This is such a nice change from the other places in Chinatown, which seem a bit moldy with old sticky carpet floors. This place is also huge and I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to be seated.\nThe service could be better, but its not any worse than the other places in Chinatown which aren't exactly known for their exceptional service. You do have to hail down your waitor, and be very clear when you order otherwise you will get the wrong thing. But all in all this is totally worth it as the dim sum, dumplings, and everything else there is incredible.\nTip: Order the fresh squeezed apple juice, they literally squash an entire apple into the cup and it comes out all foamy and fresh."

The staff speak passable English (and while this is really not a great sign for an authentic Chinese dining experience, it is, after all, located in the heart of London so it is necessary), the menu has a fair amount of interesting dishes including a list of about 120 dim sum items and noodle soups. I had prawn and chive dumplings and a clay pot rice with minced pork and salted fish. The food is tasty but a bit more expensive than some of the other dim sum places in the area and the real reason I am not as enthusiastic about this place as I should be is that they did not have steamed tripe on their dim sum list. I love that dish and use it as a baseline to measure dim sum joints around the world. It is a very basic, readily available \"famine food\" (offal made delicious so poor people would eat it during tough times) dim sum dish and this is he only dim sum spot I have ever been to where it is not available.

Xiao long bao (steamed dumplings with soup and meat inside), assorted meat with vegetables, spicy salted prawns, and beef with rice noodles with sauce. Dumpling Legend had an advertisement where if you ordered more than 25\u00a3, you can select a small dish for an additional few pounds. Our selected dish was the spicy salted prawns. \nThe XLB is no where near what you can get at Joe's Shanghai in New York, but we were not expecting that. They were about average. Not the best nor the worst.  The assorted meat and vegetables had a good variety of chicken, prawns, and scallops. The beef and rice noodles were comparable to the US and the table next to us ordered the same dish based on staring at ours! The spicy salted prawns wee nicely salted and a great deal(about 8-10 prawns) for only 2\u00a3 more! \nThe price here was a bit high at 35\u00a3, but after being exhausted from a long day of sightseeing, it was ok."

When you have a steady stream of willing tourist victims, oops I mean customers, the urgency  for top class cuisine and value for money isn't the highest\nTo be fair, they do live up to their restaurant name. Perhaps to call their dumplings legendary is stretching it a bit but they were definitely the best part of our meal. The xiao loong bao had thin skin encasing the soup, which was flavoursome\nSadly, this was the highlight of our meal. The Peking duck promised much as it was carved tableside in the traditional way. The skin was served with pancakes, cucumber, spring onion and hoisin sauce. The meat was fried up but there was only a tiny amount to share between us\nThe main dishes were forgettable but the real kick came when the bill arrived. \u00a345 for Peking duck and the extortionate amount we were charged for rice means this tourist trap only scores 2 stars"

This restaurant specialises in dim sum and other types of dumplings (I love the cheung fun type) but also offers some decent mains. \nThe place is popular with Londoners and tourists alike, and there's loads of Chinese people eating there, which must be a good sign.\nThe only downside of Dumplings' Legend is the chaotic service. Be prepared to get your order mixed up, reorder, ask where your food is several times. We got the bill before getting what we had ordered: they thought we'd already finished, they thanked us for our visit and asked if we wanted to pay cash or credit card. I said: I want my dim sums first! LOL"

This is important. \nThe only thing I had ordered so far that has been 'challenging' was the duck balls found under 'dumplings'. For the adventurist eater only ( I was a fan).

The whole concept of the store reminds me about Din Tai Fung with a show-kitchen where you can see people filling your dumplings...this is really cool.\nLike I said: soup dumplings have been very good both times. In fact, they're actually quite soupy and the flavour is also very good. As for the rest of the dishes...let's put it this way: they should stick with making dumplings!\nWhat is really off-putting as well is the amount of tourists that come into this place...it just feels like a factory more than a true local place. The whiteness of the clientele is then only exasperated by the awful white interior. In fact, I was here with two Asian architects, who simply could not help but complain about the awful design!\nSo, let me recap: do go here for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao)...and maybe also have a couple of appetizers, but I cannot really recommend any main dishes..."

I know, you might be thinking why bother with them, but if you're with a veggie that wants to see what the fuss is about, this won't really demonstrate anything other than a mild disappointment.

I think we came in this establishment because we were starving and saw a lot of people sitting by the windows (READ: they purposely seat as much people as possible by the windows to make it seem like they are busy, smart and cunning!). \nCONS - RUDE service! I asked a waitress what the other table was having and she pointed to an item on the menu and I ordered it (it was an entirely different item by the way). When it came, I told another waitress that was not what we ordered, she kinda just shrugged it off and walked away (we were later charged for the wrongful recommendation). We asked another waitress (third different waitress now if you are keeping track) for extra sauce and she gave us attitude (come on woman, it is just sauce!). Prices were average (as compared to the other dim sum joints around Chinatown that we should have went to instead). The Xiao Long Bao (what they were apparently were known for) was also average. They had a spicy Xiao Long Bao version -- BAD. They basically shoved a spoonful of hot Szechuan peppers (including the numbing spice) with their usual filling and it tasted just spicy with no depth of flavor! \nCONCLUSION - The scallop rice rolls and quail egg shu mai were decent (but I'm sure I will find better ones in the other dim sum restaurants) but the snotty service will keep me from coming back. Oh, the bathrooms don't have soap so think of all the employees handling your food - RED FLAG!"

Just remember that you have to have light fingers and a spoon in hand when handling the XLB without breaking it! And break the dumpling skin just a bit, so you can slurp out the soup - otherwise you will probably sear the skin off the roof of your mouth.  No, I'm serious. \nAnyway, their XLB - sure, decent, delicious, soupy and not dry.  But anything else on the menu?  Just don't bother.  Its way overpriced for what you get, and I don't think there were any dinner dishes that were decent.  The service was quite shoddy as well.  I don't know how many times we had to flag someone down, only to be ignored.. but when we were able to get our orders in, we had to repeatedly remind them that we were still waiting on something.  \nThis is my first time having Peking Duck in London, and it was \u00a345.  I nearly had a heart attack.  I'm not sure if this is the standard, but seriously... ?????  I couldn't.. i just couldn't wrap my head around that.  It better have been some fantastic duck, but it wasn't. \nThere should have been some fresh hand made roti-style pancake to wrap the duck.  Instead, we were given WON TON wrappers.  Again. WTF?????  They are trying to pull one over you if they are giving you wonton wrappers.  I know others didn't see it as being a big deal.  Its like ordering an expensive burger, to be given some meat sandwiched in between 2 slices of white bread.  Or given cheese whiz instead of real cheese.  Yes, its a big deal.\nI get that essentially its supposed to be 2 dishes - the second is a lettuce duck wrap.  Which was so small, that there were only enough for 5-6 people.  Complete rip off. \nWe also ordered a bucket of rice, should have been the equivelent of around 6'ish packed bowls of rice.  We had to ask 3 times, then it finally came at the END of dinner, in a large sized soup bowl.  We ended up being charged \u00a326 for that. 26 !!!!!!!!  around 2.50 per person, and we had 11 people.  But I know for a fact, there's no way there were 11 bowls of rice in that bowl.  \nTotal kick in the face.  I'd rather go elsewhere for food, and for XLB for that matter."

We ordered 6 orders of XLB, 1 eggplant dish, 1 rice dish, and our total came out to $104!!!! In LA, the same order would cost less than $60.  Each order of XLB averaged 6.60 - 8.5 eur. CRAZY. This place is posh and modern, and you can watch a billion chinese dumpling chefs wrap dumplings while you're eagerly waiting, but it's hard for me to give them a superb review bc LA is so much cheaper. It is what it is.\nOne thing I didn't like was the staff. We told them that we had a party of 4, thinking that a baby doesn't count. When we finally got called to our table, we asked them for a high chair. \n\"Oh, 3 adults and 1 baby?\" \n\"No, 4 adults and 1 baby.\" \nThe skinny bartender got involved (don't ask me why....) and yelled angrily, \"is it 4 or 5? 4 is different from 5 and 5 is different from 4!

The sauce on the food, especially on the peking spare ribs was very sugary, and personally found the dumplings tastless! There are many great chinese places in london and unfortuanely this place doesnt live up the rest! The price doesnt warrent the qulity of the food either!"

    "review": "I can't believe I'm \"celebrating\" my 200th Qype review with one of my worst dining experiences in London in my 6 years here.\n Dumpling's Legend is a new restaurant just opened in Chinatown, specialising in a type of Shanghainese dumpling called Xiao Long Bao. The interior is sleek and modern, very neutrally white but feeling a bit soulless.\n We of course ordered a basket of 8 xiao long baos, and were not disappointed - they were good, although nothing extremely special. Having dined at Leong's Legends round the corner, I think the xiao long bao there are better - with a richer filling and thinner dumpling skin.\n We also ordered beef noodles and pork chop noodles to go with the dumplings, and were really disappointed with them. When the noodles came they looked pathetic - a big bowl of tasteless broth, with some noodles and limp stalks of vegetables swimming inside. The pork chops were average (again, Leong's Legend was better). The beef soup came in a separate bowl to be poured over the noodles - the bowl was way too hot to lift to pour, so we had to resort to using the spoon to slowly transfer the soup and beef over.\n Overall, a very disappointing experience, and we shall definitely not be going back again. The noodles gets a 1 star from us - the xiao long bao a 3 star rating - averaging out to two stars.\n Reviewed by The London Insider\nlondon-insider.co.uk"

    "review": "Been here about 4 years ago not long after they opened. Great dim sum and good quality soup dumplings. Not Ding Tai Fun quality but decent for London.\nWent there few nights ago on a rainy, cold London night trying to decide a new place or going back to this place. It's safe to say that my decision turned out to be the wrong one.\nOrdered the crab soup dumping. I can tell the dumpling is not freshly made. Given this is 9 pm, I gave they a pass since it still tasted OK. Then the horror begins. Hot and sour soup looked like a bowl of thickened dark vinegar. The string bean with minced pork was way too oily and salty. The only decent dish is the tofu with minced pork.\nIn addition to the bad food, the service was just horrible. I know what to expect from an Asian restaurant, but this is even below par. Don't let the picture of HRH at the entrance fool you. What does a white person know about good Chinese food??"

    "review": "Siu Loong Bau was good, had the pork and the vegetarian.  Stick with these if there, the cantonese related options we had were not good at all, fukushima sized har gau were terrible.  the Ja Jiang Mien was mediocre at best, veggies were overcooked, come on, veggies??  Huge disappointment given we liked Leong's Legand in the past, beyond their horrid attitude and service."

    "review": "I read a yelp review on how this was better than the Ding Tai Fung in L.A. and I was ready to put on my shoes and head straight over to try their dumplings (shao lung bao)!...\nWe ordered the crab and pork dumplings, the salted egg prawns, and egg fried rice.\nCrab and pork dumplings: Taste-wise, they were not bad.  But, I'm not sure I would say that they were good though...  The first one I picked up stayed intact and tasted...ok.  The rest of them thereafter burst and the lovely soup leaked out on to the bamboo steamer....what a disappointment.  This did not happen to the Ding Tai Fung dumplings...\nSalted Egg Prawns:  Ok, I admit that I do not remember the exact name of this dish but it is basically prawns tossed in salted egg yolk and deep fried with the shell and head of the prawns on.  This was mighty yummy.  The fried this so nice and crispy, you could eat the shell and all.  The salted egg yolk gave it a nice taste.  I just loved it!\nEgg fried rice:  Well, it is as it sounds.  Nothing special.  Actually, quite mundane.  I was disappointed in the portion size.  For 4 pounds, I expect more than a small chinese bowl size.  But I'm jaded with my large American portions.  But come on!!  4 pounds for a bowl of rice?"
