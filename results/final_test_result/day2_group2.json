The salmon sashimi was actually my first time eating sashimi and it was pretty good, though I have no reference points so I can't say much about this.

The interior is beautiful, high ceilings, they have two entrances making life a lot easier, beaming with light, nice black tables with comfy seating, and eyes staring at you from the walls. The menu once presented immaculate, the waiters and waitresses are a joy, they give you the best advice and what to choose. The food is presented really well too. \r\nNothing is amissed. The spicy edamame is the best I have had!! It's so modish, juicy packed with an abundance of flavour. For drink I opted for the rhubarb fizz as it was only 12 noon when I had arrives. \r\nFor sushi I think I played it a bit safe, I didn't want to overeat and have food left, I don't like leftovers. So I opted for the hand rolls, veggie and crunchy. I'm not usually a fan because of the seaweed but wow these ones are beautiful, the seaweed is not even noticed, packed with loads of flavour and sauce inside till the end. Matched with the Wasabi, soya and pickled ginger I could eat that all day. Only little hitch is that it does make your mouth dry, the seaweed I mean once it gets caught on your lips. But that is so minor!!\r\nThen I opted for sticks, a variety of mixed yasai yakitori, chicken wing, tsukune and grilled oyster mushroom. I loved them all apart from the wing, even though the skin was nice and crispy, the whole thing lacked flavour. It was just a wing, nothing special which was a let down. However the tsukune (chicken meatball) was delicious, cooked to perfection and could taste all the spices and less of the chicken which is what you want. The vegetables accompanied the meat very well and the sauces of yakitori and teriyaki was perfect and the extra lemon slice goes a long way. \r\nService was very attentive, always making sure I was ok and the food was up to scratch.

Now I eat a lot of sushi and sashimi and I am beyond impressed with the food I had at S&S.\r\nFirst of all we had a very nice server by the name of Sebastian who was from Denmark, my friend let him know it was my Birthday and he wished me a happy birthday.  He walked us through both menus, took our drink orders and gave us some time to look through the menu.  I could have ordered everything, it all sounded delicious and their menus are mini booklets with a photograph of each option next to the bite and description.  I've never seen a menu like that before, it's a great idea as it makes everything look and sound more appetizing.  We picked out several things we wanted and out of that Sebastian gave us his recommendations and I'm glad we listened.\r\nWe started with edamame, you can never go wrong with that, we had the plain but they offer a spicy option.  Next we had the tuna tartare which was my favorite bite out of everything we had on this day, it had pine nuts, avocado, was full of flavor and truly was to die for.  Next we went for rolls, I chose the salmon rice paper roll which was a very neat concept and something I've never had before.  It was more of a wrap, it had lettuce, carrots, cucumber and shrimp tempura (light on the batter side) all wrapped up in rice paper and then sliced into 6 pieces.  I personally avoid to many rolls with rice so this was a perfect option for me.  We also had the gipsy big roll which was very good then we had one of the small tuna chilli rolls.\r\nI wanted more and if I come back I really would like to try their mini sides of vegtables.  From looking at the pictures the oyster mushrooms looked good along with the cauliflower, broccoli and mini corn on the cobs.\r\nWe didn't have cocktails as we had a busy day ahead but they have a variety of cocktails, beers and non-alcoholic beverages. \r\nI highly recommend Sticks and sushi for their service, atmosphere, food and my favorite part...looking through their cool menu booklet with the pictures!", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "For me it's one of the best sushi chains in London and it didn't even open up its first restaurant in London but Denmark. \r\nEven during the busy Christmas season for our annual Christmas lunch, high quality of food and service delivers. \r\nWe started with some soy cured salmon with minced shiitake mushrooms. The salmon was beautiful and rich in flavour. The texture was smooth and the minced mushroom was a lovely companion adding more depth and silkiness. An excellent start. \r\nNext was the Japanese potato salad, a lovely simple potato mash contrasted nicely with the crunchy vegetables of carrots, cucumber and onions. Tasty light and healthy.\r\nThe salmon and avocado maki were perfect. The rice cooked well and held perfectly when you held it. The flavour of the silky rich salmon shone straight through the roll. Quality right there.\r\nThe only dish that didn't tickle my tastebuds was the green salad. It was too dry for my liking, too crunchy with the softer quinoa being lost in there. More softer leaves would have been preferred for a more equal texture so the avocado could be enjoyed and played its role.\r\nAmongst us all we also ordered a  sharing platter from the set menu. We chose the Upgrade platter that came with a variety of rolls and meat on sticks. Beautiful glistening sushi, all so incredibly fresh and the rolls were paired so well with the ingredients it came with too, all perfectly balanced in texture and flavour. So much creativity. \r\nThe sticks consisted of fresh tender flakey pieces of tuna, flavoursome, herby chicken meatballs and succulent juicy lamb chops. All delightful.\r\nLast to arrive in the savouries were the scallops in a light kataifi pastry. The texture was amazing. A light crispy pastry incasing a fresh and bouncy scallop with burst of saltiness from the trout roe for that little extra bit of joy!\r\nDessert could have been the steal of the show itself. All presented beautifully and made with such creative flavours, fusing Japanese and Western flavours together. We had the coconut cake, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, dark chocolate fondant, dark chocolate and sesame balls and vanilla icecream.

The constant yelling of Irasshaimase in a very un-Japanese restaurant grated on me even more as I put another mouthful of soulless food in my mouth. \r\nI get that it's Japanese with a Danish touch, and the food isn't bad - neither the sushi nor the teriyaki were bad, a notch above Yo Sushi or Wasabi.  But I'm not going to be conned by the great decor here.  \r\nFish quality was distinctly average and seasoning was all over the place, often meat would not be seasoned enough and batter would be over-seasoned.  But it's ok the distinctly average fish and seafood would be smothered in a spicy mayo so any semblance of natural sweet ocean freshness was gone, scallops tasted like shrimp etc. etc. Perhaps the most underrated part of sushi is the rice.  I'm sorry but if the rice is not fluffy and bouncy or even seasoned correctly then you shouldn't be charging these prices. \r\nAnd this is my biggest grief with Sticks and Sushi.  I feel like I've been conned with the beautiful decor and menu.

The black cod dragon roll was my favourite and it's worth its \u00a312. Flavours are well put together and it's melting in your mouth. The shake daikon is an interesting concept. It's a maki roll but they replaced the rice and the seaweed with a sort of radish (the daikon).

The sushi board consisted of salmon carpaccio, cucumber and crab meat roll, duck roll, as well as the usual nigiri sushi. This board was served with a slightly spicy mayo-based dip sauce. \r\nOverall, the food was delicious and presented beautifully.

So,  I was totally excited to dine.afterall I'm such a Japanese food freak, I was all set for this dinner! \r\nMy husband and I arrived first,  he said that Zuma finally got our reservation in and they had us booked in a private room. That was really cool.  But since the rest of the party didn't get in yet, we decided to hang out at the bar. The place looked like any other modern Japanese Fusion restaurant you'd find in Vegas & New York, w/ an open kitchen concept to the diners the tables were set lower but it's inter-mingled with the bar.. making it look packed. To me, its more a mess.\r\nOthers may perceive it as cozy, & bustling. To me,  its just crowded & a total cluster! If you're claustrophobic,  avoid the place at peak hours. I got myself a non - alcoholic cocktail drink called Norisan, made of fresh mint, passion fruit,  pineapple, shaken w/ orange. But honestly, it's just orange juice w/ some crushed ice mixed w/ some crushed mint leaves. Lol. That's how it tasted to me. \r\nA couple of photo shoots here & there, our friends started arriving. The bars main focal point was the impressive display of different saki bottles.  You'd think that was the only alcoholic drink they serve. Lol.\r\nWhen everybody finally assembled together,  we asked our host if our table was ready. They told us they'd check on it. 5mins passed, nothing.  15mins.nothing. So my husband decided to ask again.Now we are all thinking maybe they made a mistake in giving away our room to someone else. \r\n2 minutes after the second time my husband checked, we were lead to our private room. It had a nice wooden table. They handed each of us our own menus & we all decided to order & share it w/ everyone. We got Edamame, Miso Soup, Wagyu Beef, a Sashimi, Sushi & Maki Roll assortment, soft shelled crabs, eggplant salad, etc. Photos attached.\r\nTo me, the edamame, salad & miso soup should've been served first as they seem to be a first course dish & the rest would've been best served all at once.  But instead, they served them one at a time. With a crowd of 6, it was a bit awkward. Not for nothing,  it would've been ok if their servings were enough for 6, but when a dish comes out good for 1 or 2 people,  a restaurant should be thoughtful enough to think ahead.  But not Zuma I guess. The plates went from one side of the table back & forth. All of you can request them to do that next time you dine to avoid this. \r\nThey offer you two types of water, still or gas.  We got both. My preference was still.The server was in a rush to kick us out towards the end of our meal that he poured seltzer into my glass which totally ruined my water. Extremely a huge faux pax!\r\nMy miso soup was ok. It tasted like a regular. Nothing exceptional.The Edamame were just medium sized. We get plumper Edamames in the US. The Wagyu Beef, I was excited to try,  but they were tasteless.  I'm wondering if they didn't season them for a reason except drizzled peppers on top of them? So not impressive.  I'm very particular w/ my steak. The only steak so far that impressed me the most came from Ruth's Chris & John Howies. Other than that, I make my own & my kids rather eat the steak I make than to eat outside at a restaurant. This steak was a fail. As for the Sushis & Makis, we are from the Pacific Northwest & we've traveled to far & wide where Sushis almost a staple.. conveyor belts of Sushis graze airports & restaurants like a fast food joint. I've tasted the best sushis in Washington & Japan. This one was just mediocre. But I can say the seafood they used was of exceptional quality.  That is commendable. But that does not say much of its flavors. Likewise, the eggplant salad, it was ok, but nothing memorable. It didn't leave anything in my palate wanting for more.  You have to put a zinger!\r\nBut there is one dish Zuma did right & tasted wonderful! That's the Soft shelled crab! It was perfectly fried, cut, soft, crusted & seasoned,  perfectly presented w/a side of lemon as it should be for every seafood, & a dipping sauce.  It reminded me of the flavors of the ocean w/ a hint of garlic & a touch of citrus,  totally satisfying in every bite. I would totally get just 2 orders of that & a bowl of rice & I'd be happy at Zuma. \r\nFor what could've been $100 worth of a dinner in the US or at any Sushi place, we spent \u20ac350 w/c is equivalent to $485.

Though, the service still leaves an incredible amount to be desired, considering the price point.\r\nLet's start with the sushi.  At best, it's \"not bad.\"  Typically, the sushi rice should be about room temperature to warm -- mine was cold, as if it had been in the fridge.  The fish should be chilled to cool, but mine was room temperature, as if it had been taken in and out of a cold area too many times in the evening that it was no longer cool or firm.  The botan ebi was mushy.  The toro was not marbled at all, and I'm confident at most places, they would simply call it tuna.  The sake (salmon) was ribbed and stringy. \r\nI also ordered soft shell crab.  It was good. Honestly, probably the best part of the meal, but the bar here is low. If you've had one fried softshell crab with a wasabi mayo, you've had them all.  They did not mess this up, and it was good. \r\nNow let's switch to the service -- three complaints -- \r\n1) The sushi bar was not full, is claimed to be first-come, first-serve, but they refused to seat me without making me wait for 30 minutes.  When they did seat me, they put us in two seats that had been empty the entire time I was at the cocktail bar.  I have no idea who they were saving them for since again, it's first-come, first-serve at the sushi bar. \r\n2) The waitress was very nice and took my order promptly, and the food came promptly, but it took multiple requests and a lot of waiting to get a bottle of still water. We were mostly through our softshell crab by the time a bottle of water finally arrived. I stopped short of going up to the cocktail bar to order my own.\r\n3) At the end, the waitress brought the check, and had tacked on a ton of food and drinks I didn't order.  It was our check, but like it had been merged with someone else's.  When I pointed this out, she basically made me review my own check again, instead of realizing I hadn't ordered half the things on the bill.\r\nIn the end, go to Nobu if you want sushi.

I was young(er) back then, but I knew amazing food when I tasted it. My opinion of Zuma has changed only slightly in the past decade, swayed by occasional visits here and there. Either the food has become even better, or my adult senses have developed more attuned receptors.\r\nThe restaurant bills itself as serving 'contemporary Japanese cuisine', but for some odd reason the place itself always reminds me of Africa. A weirdly jolting contrast to make, but for me that's a positive. The tables and chairs are all chunky light-coloured wood, the walls bear matching panels, there are green potted plants peppering the dining area and the base of the bar is formed from uncut stone, like an organic boulder of granite that grew naturally at the heart of Raphael Street. These rustic elements are juxtaposed with a lot of glass and the suave cosmopolitan clientele. It is hard to find a table here in the evenings, booking is definitely recommended, while at lunch time you may be asked to wait on busy days.\r\nThis was the case the other day, but we made it back to find the largest table in the place ready for the three of us. We weren't positioned in the main dining area, but from my seat I had a clear view of the kitchen, aromas and all.\r\nWe ordered the Crispy Fried Squid with Green Chili and Salt - hands down the best crispy fried squid I've ever had. Not only in taste and texture, but also in its consistent excellence (I always order it). The batter is light enough to taste the squid underneath and fine enough to form an irresistible crunch. The seasoning is sublime. It tasted so good but I was unsure about exactly which ingredient was doing all the flavoursome work. Upon asking the waiter, I was told that the fried squid is tossed with shichimi pepper, a Japanese mix of anything from red chilli pepper, Sichuan pepper, ground ginger, black and white sesame seeds and even roasted orange or Yuzu peel. A juicy squeeze of lime and I'm telling you it's perfect (we ordered a second round).\r\nWe also ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi in Ponzu Sauce with Crispy Garlic. The fish is soft and supple, while the flavours are strong and refreshing.\r\nThe Thinly Sliced Seabass with Yuzu, Truffle Oil and Salmon Roe was equally fantastic, with that distinctly appetising scent of truffle emanating from the plate as soon as it arrives to your table. Again, the fish is of the highest quality and so each piece melts in your mouth. Each slice is so delicate and dainty but altogether the dishes accumulate to ensure you are full in the nicest of ways.\r\nAn absolute favourite of mine is the Aubergine with Miso Paste, which probably pips Chutney Mary to the crown for best aubergine small dish in London. I will also definitely be re-ordering the new-ish Mackerel Roll wrapped in thin slices of cucumber for the delicacy and freshness of its ingredients. It's a roll without rice, which makes it lighter and more refined to taste, so that you really enjoy the soft mackerel meat and the contrasting crunch of the cucumber. It is served marinating in a dish of pickle juice, which adds a subtle tangy flavour. Such a fine and enjoyable dish.\r\nTwo other delicious rolls are the Dynamite Spider Roll and the Salmon and Avacado inside out roll. The former comes stuffed with tempura soft-shell crab and a dab of chilli mayonnaise on top, adding a luxury hint of creamy spice to the crispy interior - another must-have dish.\r\nI haven't really come across a non must-have here, and I look forward to returning again and again over the next decade to sample even more of their dishes and try something from the Robata grill. Presentation, service, decor, food - it's all cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Zuma is the place to go to for exquisite food and a buzzing ambiance.

That's not to say that the food wasn't good here - it was definitely above average - but given the exorbitant cost of food here in the UK, you have to live up to some pretty high standards to make the cut...and I've been to places in NYC that cost less than half of what I paid tonight that was a better overall epicurean experience than this was.\r\nWe did the omakase because...well, you figure you're going to get the best the restaurant has to offer. Courses often came out two at a time, which was nice because it meant we weren't waiting for the food to come out. The first two courses were very delicious - tuna tartare on a rice cracker and the sea bass in truffle oil. The former is something that is very simple but works well, as most of the tuna tartare I have had is plain. This was lightly seasoned and had very thin cuts of scallion with it, adding a nice little twist. The truffle oil on the sea bass was a revelation (it's not something I've had anywhere else); the mushroom-infused marinade worked very well on the sea bass, and the side of ikura worked well to add a touch of saltiness to the platter. The other fantastic dish was the tempura-style langoustine with a vinegar-based dipping sauce. Regular tempura is akin to beer battered fried food, but this was done very lightly instead, with the crispiness looking more like fuzzy threads coming off of it...but it works because it doesn't dominate the dish and allows for the langoustine's flavor to come through. The black cod wrapped in banana leaves (or was it lotus?) was done well for a fairly standard Asian dish; I liked the accompanying citrus dip that took the edge off the heavily baked-in miso marinade.\r\nThat said, I took issue with a couple of the main dishes that were served: the wagyu beef and (very unfortunately, since this is crucial to a good restaurant) the sushi/sashimi combo. I've had amazing beef at shabu-shabu and cooked over a stone, and that is delicious. This beef was clearly cooked as a full filet and then subsequently cut up...as such, instead of all of the pieces being a tender medium-rare, a quarter of them (towards the ends, and even some in the middle) were closer to medium-well and well-done - definitely not the aspired result. The accompanying sauces were banal - a standard sesame-soy dipping sauce and a mayo-based dipping sauce that didn't have that needed kick. The sushi was disappointing because we got all of 2(!) pieces, and one of them (the yellowtail) was probably the worst quality I've had at a high-end Japanese shop. The other (a piece of aburi sushi) was absolutely delicious, which makes me wonder why there's so much inconsistency. The sashimi was equally inconsistent: the semi-fatty tuna was very good, and the mackarel was on the better end of what I usually get in this fish, but the rest was unmemorable: the sea bass was way too chewy, the salmon didn't have that fresh buttery taste or deep flavor you get from the truly fresh stuff, and the grouper (with some kind of vinegar jam on top) was bland. Bland ain't grand; it's forgettable.\r\nDessert was a bit on the large side (six dishes served in a huge bowl of ice; Zuma does like serving lots of its dishes on ice) and was a microcosm of the inconsistency of the main course. The best was the chocolate lava cake filled with chocolate caramel; this was absolutely delicious, with the caramel adding a nice layer of flavor to a dish that is usually chocolate on top of (and inside of chocolate). The banana cake with regular caramel was also quite tasty, although it tasted a little too much like banana bread with caramel syrup added to it. The coconut pudding with fresh fruit was tasty, but the problem here is that the consistency of the pudding was different: it was quite thin (almost liquid-like) at the top, but quite a bit more viscous at the bottom. As for the ice creams served, the vanilla was bland (I think someone forgot to add sugar or anything that would make it sweet), the green tea was green tea (i.e. unexciting without being paired with anything else, like red beans), and the coconut was the best, but the flavor of the fruit was muted (probably the same deal as with the vanilla).\r\nService was pretty decent, but for 96 pounds a person + 20%(!) tax + 15% 'optional' gratuity (why is it called optional when every place I've been to adds it automatically?) + 4 pounds for edamame (the most expensive edamame I've had, and not noticeably different at all) + 4.50 pounds for flat water(!!!), I could've spent the money better elsewhere. The food was alright, but if I did come back, I would save money by picking individual dishes instead of going with the tasting menu.

Sipping my Saffron and Poppy Seed Martini (10.50) I was waiting to be spoiled.\r\n I really liked Zuma, in fact I liked it about 1 million times more than the only other posh Japanese restaurant I have been to in London, Nobu Berkley Square.\r\n LIKE\r\n 1. Lovely staff: Even though we didn't have a reservation the lovely people at the counter found us a place at the sushi bar within 10 minutes. Friendly and forthcoming they had nothing in common with the pretentious waiters at Nobu.\r\n2. The menu: I liked the fact that in addition to some astronomically priced dishes they do have a good selection of dishes costing less than 10 pounds.\r\n3. The wine: There are also quite some wines for under 20 pounds, which allows you to maybe order a couple of dishes more\r\n4. The food (see below) was sublime. I loved the fresh and exquisite ingredients, the exotic and well-balanced sauces and the inventive take on Japanese food without losing the traditional touch.\r\n DISLIKE\r\n 1. I really wanted some cold sake to go with my Japanese delicacies, but they were out of the two cheapest sakes! (19\u00a3 and 29\u00a3 respectively for 300 ml). We did not go with the next expensive one (40\u00a3) but had wine instead. Wanted sake though!\r\n 2. The Sushi Counter: the person who designed this should lose his/her licence really. The broad stone surface gives you plenty of space for all your plates but underneath  this is a completely different story. Even I with my 5.3 ft had no idea what to do with my legs. Not only was there absolutely no space, the inside surface of the counter was ragged, which not only destroys stockings but also hurts! This reminded me of the story that I once heard about McDonalds, where they intentionally use tilted chairs so that the customer does not feel to comfortable and doesn't want to linger. I wonder if similar incentives were in the mind also of the people behind the Zuma interior design?\r\n3. Why don't they put prices on their website? I really don't like this, people should know what they are in for. And while I'm at it, did I mention that I HATE websites with music?\r\n Anyway, the most important thing is the food, here we go:\r\n Suzuki no osashimi (12.60)  thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, salmon roe and truffle oil  one of my favourite dishes\r\n Tokodai wafu asperagasu (5.80)  beautiful fresh and with delicious wafu sauce and sesame on top.\r\n Shitaki Mushrooms (4.80)  tender and garlicky this was a rather generous portion for not quite 5 pounds.\r\n Chicken Yakitori (5.80)\r\n Yellow Tail sashimi (8.00)  boring compared to the other dishes.\r\n Unagi Nigri (8.80) however, was all the better.\r\n Aubergine (8.60) something\r\n Inaniwa Langustine Noodles (14.80)  this was one of the specials, the chilled noodles with the sweet langoustine and the ripe mango were very pleasant indeed.\r\n Wagyu Beef Sushi with Black Truffle (27.50)  loved the raw beef melting in my mouth together with the subtle truffle flavour. Expensive but worth it :)\r\n Banana and Green Tea Cake with Peanut Toffee Sauce and coconut ice cream (8.80)  weird combination but worked somehow. While I didn't pick up the green tea flavour, the soft and juice banana cake was all the better with the sweet and salty peanuts.", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "One of my top 5 restaurants in London. \r\nThe food, atmosphere and people are perfectly aligned.

The dishes are very small (our server recommended ordering 4-5 dishes per person). For example, the chicken and spring onion dish only includes two skewers. Our table of 4 ordered too many dishes to count and we ended up leaving about 3 dishes total at the table. I think a better recommendation would be to order 3 dishes per person and then order more if you are still hungry.

Serving utinels are not provided with the dishes, so you are forced to use your chopsticks or cutlery to cut off pieces or scrape pieces off skewers (e.g. asparagus). My husband and I met his friend and her husband for dinner and it was a bit strange to have everyone's cutlery touching all the food, especially since this was the first time I had met them.\r\n2. There is not enough room on the table for all the dishes, so staff was constantly moving plates around to make more room for the additional dishes as they were coming out of the kitchen. Perhaps it is just me but they always seemed to move my water glass or another dish near my right forearm, so my arm was either always almost knocking over my water or rubbing in one of the dishes. They need to invest in some sort of tiered structure in the middle of the table that can swivel.

I can get CHEAP and YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD and BE FULL and NOT BROKE!!! That is pretty much all you need to know. \r\nBut if you want to know more, they have quite an extensive menu and everything is considerably cheaper than other establishments considering how expensive London is! Like, this place is cheaper than McDonald's, LOL. I have a relatively big appetite and I'll admit, even though I finish all of my food here, I could still definitely eat more. But the important thing is that I won't be hungry here, I don't get bloated but I am full! At a great cost! The place is quite \"hidden\" but it's worth the search! It's along the right side of entering Chinatown from Shaftesbury. Food comes out super quick and even though there's a mandatory 10% service charge, it's still well worth it. I have had their Zaru Soba, Tori Karaage Rice, Tori Teriyaki Rice, and Tonkatsu Curry Rice! Curry Katsu is more expensive, it's like \u00a36.50 but it's still way cheaper than elsewhere. Also, all of the rice comes with a side salad which is AWESOME and wow...their cherry tomatoes? Only one, but so refreshing and awesome from all of the heavy comfort food. Nice touch. \r\nOkay, so you definitely can't beat value. Taste wise, it is also super good. Their wasabi is really weak though, which surprised me. But, that's pretty minor. I probably wouldn't recommend ordering the Zaru Soba (\u00a35.00) since it isn't really filling but it's a solid tasting dish (dipping sauce could be better). Tori Teriyaki Rice was REALLY good though, their chicken is crisp on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. They cook their chicken really well! The teriyaki sauce was also fantastic, just enough sauce and subtly sweet. Same goes for the Tori Karaage, which was battered perfectly! Outside had a nice crunch and was crisp while the inside still remained juicy and succulent. The rice is also amazing too, like it's nice and sticky and short grained!!! Great texture and taste, it is seriously some good rice. Tonkatsu Curry was  pretty good, but the meat itself was lean at parts. But when you eat the fatty parts...YUM. It was nicely battered and crisp with your standard curry, which was pretty good. I wish they gave you more curry though, since portions are massive LOL. Food tastes essentially like japanese comfort food, and everything is really well cooked! You really can't beat the price and the quality of the food.\r\nPortions are bigger than a human head and you will definitely be full and happy here! They don't skimp on ingredients and the food is really well cooked, despite how constantly busy this place is! There's always lines at your standard dinner/lunch time so if you're not looking to wait, try to come a little later or earlier than the typical meal time. However, the wait wouldn't be really long and they're super efficient and quick. Their take out is also fantastic, great packaging (they use plastic tupperwares and it pleases me greatly) and portions still!!! Anytime I'm in London and hungry, this is the place I ALWAYS go to. I brought my friend from Nagoya to eat here and she loved it and I quote, \"it tastes like I'm eating real Japanese food back in Japan!\".

My Kalamansi Smash was a fantastic fusion of lime and vodka with this Filipino fruit. Once we were ready to be seated, our servers took us to our table and explained how ordering would work. They recommended that we each order a curry of some sort, some naan, and perhaps some chicken and lamb for the table. \r\nWe did just that and my goodness, everything that we tasted was delicious! The curries were definitely hearty enough to fill one person and the lamb kebabs were fire. I wish that we received more naan for the price but it was still good for what it's worth.\r\nOverall, we had a great time dining at Dishoom and would come back here in a heartbeat.

It just tastes substantially better, with bursts of flavor. \r\nDishoom is no different. It is a very popular restaurant in London with multiple locations. There is always a queue and the best possible way to get in without waiting is to make a reservation.\r\nI made a res at the King's Cross location. The space is bustling, with an amazing bar downstairs and seating both floor level and upstairs. Upon arrival, there was already a queue and I had made res for a lunch hour (although I did hear that their breakfast is pretty darn good). The menu is a little extensive, but innovative than the typical Indian food you would get in LA. The table was just big enough to accommodate all the food we had ordered, so we were lucky. \r\n \r\nOKRA FRIES (\u00a34.20). Fine Lady's Fingers for the Fingers. I wasn't the biggest fan of these. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I'm just not a fan of okra. Though the slimey layer was almost non-transparent, I could still taste it. But, if you like okra, you'll love this.  \r\nVEGETABLE SAMOSAS (\u00a33.50). Fine Filo Pastry, Pea and Potato Filling Warmly Spiced with Cinnamon and Cloves. These were delicious. It was light and airy and wasn't heavy. I'm always a fan of samosas and they're one of my favorite appetizers. If you want something on the lighter end that isn't too heavy, get these!  \r\nHOUSE BLACK DAAL (\u00a35.90). A Dishoom Signature Dish-Dark, Rich, Deeply Flavoured. It is Cooked Over 24 hours for Extra Harmony. This was absolutely delicious. I didn't know what to expect. We ordered a medium spice level which was perfect. It went so well with the biryani. I definitely recommend getting this dish.  \r\n \r\nJACKFRUIT BIRYANI (\u00a38.90). Delicious, Savoury Jackfruit and Delicately Saffron'd Rice, Patted and Cooked with Mint, Coriander, and Sultanas. I loved this dish. It's different than the usual biryani you get at other restaurants. There was so much flavor and surprisingly, the jackfruit tasted like there was meat in it. It's a great dish for the vegetarian and awesome with curry.  \r\nGUNPOWDER POTATOES (\u00a36.50). The seduction is in the Tumble. Potatoes with Brown Skins, Smoky-Grilled, Broken Apart, Tossed with Butter, Crushed Aromatic Seeds and Green Herbs. This is one of the most popular dishes at Dishoom. I thought it was good but not amazing. I mean, they're potatoes and I'd actually rather eat something that consists of curry. If you love potatoes though, you would enjoy these.  \r\nMY FAVORITE DISH. CHICKEN RUBY (\u00a39.50). A Good and Proper Curry Redolent with Spice and Flavour, Tender Chicken in a rich silky 'makhani'sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. I love freakin curry and this is by far, one of the best ones. It's similar to a tikka masala but better than what you would get anywhere in the States. It's rich and creamy and if you love tikka masala, you definitely should get this.  \r\nSPICY LAMB CHOPS (\u00a311.90). They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice and jiggery, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. Blackened by the Grill, but Juicy inside. I thought these were good but I've had better at Tayyabs. The chops had a lot of flavor, and it was grilled nicely, but it wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. Regardless though, I would still order it.  \r\nHOUSE CHAI (\u00a32.50). All things nice: warming comfort and satisfying spice. Made in the proper way. All who have tried it are swearing by it. This was delicious. It was creamy, smooth and had all the right spices. If you're a chai drinker, you'd love this warm drink.  \r\nOverall, I loved Dishoom. For Indian food with a twist, this is the place to go. It's not super traditional, but they do have traditional dishes. The space is amazing and the service was pretty good. The waiter was insisting I visit again the next morning, but I couldn't. I wish I did since their breakfast menu looked amazing and interesting.

You'll get a ton of curry sauce so help yourself to some slow cooked and aromatic biryani. I recommend either the Awadhi Lamb Biryani or the Jackfruit Biryani. I'm a huge fan of both and it's great for sharing. For sides, I like the Gunpowder Potatoes - they're smokey and aromatic with a slight kick to your taste buds. For those who can't pass on paneer at an Indian restaurant, the Mattar Paneer is the way to go. It's rich and flavorful, you can't go wrong with this.

I ordered the Bhel to start which was soggy and missing the \"chatpatta\" flavour of a good Bhel. The pommegranet seeds were a great addition though. For my main I got the mattar paneer and Naan. The curry was great - no complaints. However my naan was not warm when it arrived. This sucks because we all know that a good naan is best consumed hot!\r\nMy dining partners were surprised that the Ruby Chicken was packed with a spicy punch while the Lamb Biryani wasn't too spicy though it was marked as such on the menu. It's frustrating because you should be able to trust the spice levels on the menu. They were very happy with their roomali roti which was great! \r\nMy theory is that since we were seated in the basement the food was sitting in the kitchens for a bit before it got brought down. This sucks because it lessens the food experience. \r\nNow overall upto this point I would have given this experience a 4 star review. However - when the check came the waiter had added an \"optional 12.5% tip\" onto our bill. When I asked him about it he said it was \"optional\" and there as a recommendation but it had been added into our total which made no sense. So either the waiter was backtracking after being caught in a lie or Dishoom writes their bills where they give the big bold total with an optional tip added in. \r\nRegardless of which it is - I really disliked the lack of honesty with the process. I'm from Canada so tipping is actually a very normal thing.

The garlic naan paired nicely with the chicken tikka because it balanced out the spiciness of the chicken (which, in all fairness, was not that spicy). Finally, the dessert was fantastic as well.

Easily the best Indian food I've had in my life and possibly the best meals I've eaten in London. I adored every bite of every item we ordered. You must try the black daal. It's spectacular. Rich and savory and outstanding. The calamari was definitely a stand out (in a sweet and sour fruity sauce). The lamb kebab and chicken tikka were juicy and delicious and perfectly spiced. The lamb samosas were crispy and well flavored (though I wish there were more than 2 in an order). The gunpowder potatoes are tasty and savory and a cheap side dish to go with all of the other more flavorsome dishes. The house special lamb stew was outstanding. Like my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. Oh my god. Also the naan (we tried all four kinds) are all fabulous. \r\nThe cocktails and even the nonalcoholic drinks all looked incredibly tempting. My friend and I split a pitcher of Bombay pimms and it was fabulous and refreshing.\r\nThe one caveat of this place is its crazy business. Make sure you book a table if you can or be prepared to wait. But really. It's like so worth it. I am heartbroken to have moved so far away from this magical restaurant. Please go there for me.

The overly heavy Guju Shrikhand & Chocolate Mouse, and the Ghola Ice is divisive among friends. Best opt for a simple kulfi. Pudding wine isn't much to talk about, don't bother with it.

You can either opt for the fire toast or go for an egg roll (similar to the bacon roll) without the egg. This, by far was the biggest disappointment. The other big factor was the congestion.

I would be remiss if I did not note that there were a few initial red flags, however.\r\nFirst: it's both huge and nicely decorated. This, perversely, worried me. Gilgamesh in Camden is huge; it's been years since I've been, but it was a hot mess of a restaurant, with orders mixed up, confusing portion sizes, swarms of confused staff, and cryptic pricing. The money had all gone on the decor and a very decent bar staff, but eating felt like you'd done very badly in an exam you expected to ace. \r\nSecond: when we were seated, the waiter asked if I'd been to Dishoom before, and then explained the 'concept' to me. This worried me too. In a culinary context I am rarely keen on concepts that require explanation. But in this instance the concept was that we were expected to share, that it was a small-plates kind of deal, and that things would arrive when they were ready and not as part of a traditional starter/main framework; so, fine. This isn't Gilgamesh, where the concept was that they did expensive food very averagely from a bewildering variety of Asian cultures, so that's fine. (I'm still bitter about it, yes.)\r\nThe worries melted away when the food came. Lamb samosas and some calamari - a signature dish, according to the waiter - came first. The samosas were pretty good; the calamari was excellent, with a light salty batter and a sweet, acidic sauce - tamarind? Pomegranate? Something like that. I would come back for the calamari alone. \r\nSeekh kebabs and mahi tikka were next, with some excellent cucumber raita and crispy, fresh naan bread.  Everything is really interestingly spiced; nothing's overpowering, or even very hot, but it's complex. The signature black dahl is brilliant, but there's equal attention to detail in the complimentary relishes (mint and coriander, red and green chilli, and something I missed because I'm a bit deaf.) I don't know what they put in the 'Gunpowder potatoes' - I assume it wasn't gunpowder - but they were delicious and fragrant.\r\nThis all felt like pretty good value for thirty quid a head (including an OK cocktail and a nice bottle of pale ale.) I've eaten at pricier Indian restaurants like Tamarind and the Cinnamon Club and not had nearly as nice a time. \r\nThe one drawback really is that it's very popular. When we arrived at lunchtime on a Saturday it was packed, and people (ourselves included) were queuing outside for quite some time. Inside it's noisy and occasionally hard to catch the waiters' eyes when they're running around making sure the food gets out to the tables hot off the stove (which they do brilliantly, but it's difficult to make sure this works in an it-comes-as-it's-ready environment.

We were also told that we couldnt order drinks whilst wiating for room at the bar 'because by the time the drinks are made your table would be ready ...' Not sure what that said about the waiting time for either. \r\nSo we stood by the doors gazing upon the restaurant, a bar, people sitting eating and drinking ... for what felt like a thirsty 10 mins or more until we were able to go down to the bar that we would be waiting in. \r\nDuring that time we were able to appreciate 2 things : the visuals were awesome, the noise sucked. But the interior was lovely. i actually started to feel pangs of longing to be back in the asian subcontinent, such was the nostalgic attention to detail in every part of the sprawling comfortable 3 floor (? 4 floor ?) building.  And somehow , despite the dodgy soundtrack (a few guitar band indie-pub tunes) , all the vocal clamour and people noise added to the bustling-India ambience. In the event we 'only' had to wait for an hour and a quarter for a table, by which time I had kind of lost my appetite. \r\nCocktails were good, as they should have been; pre -made, which mate be contentious or perhaps marketed as a plus point. The Gimlet was awesome, other nice mixes. Served on a hand-cut shard of ice which was definitely the epitome of cool.\r\nFood :  I was looking forward to their signature Black House Daal, and when it came it was good, but i wasn't too bothered about paying too much attention to it because I fell in love with the Roomali roti, soft, delicate, big, warm. Likewise with the Gunpowder potatoes  and Biryani and Mutter Paneerm which my three friends loved.  I felt the tastes were comfortable and pleasant, not quite as complex as I would have liked, but I was brought up on a Sri Lankan palate and perhaps we are notoriously exacting when it come to food ....\r\nThe service was great, and the ambience in the restaurant was also awesome, i preferred it to the subterranean bar. The restaurant was a really great combination of relaxing, chilled, intimate, but feeling as though you are in the thick of things and able to gaze on some activity. Looking around, it felt like this would probably be the case from every table, and it was here that I felt that I could almost be in India. By that time the tunes had changed to seem more congruous. \r\nSo, my friend said that the website says no need to book : I would come back, but I would not wanna be faced with that wait again, I would love to check out their other locations, im hooked on the interiors and i would definitely bring friends.

I won't lie, it's got amazing atmosphere and ambiance. The decor is fabulous, the building is wonderful (love converted warehouses), and it is tres stylish. I sat at the bar because I was a single, though it was not very busy and would have appreciated a booth. I decided to go with the flow and trust them.\r\nI think dining has a lot to do with trust when you're not sure on a place or you've never tried it. Yelp reviews and other people's recommendations can only go so far - in the end, it's what your tastebuds want, what your mind thinks is a good value for time and money. I think that for me, I will not be back because of the following:\r\n1. When I was seated at the bar, I noticed how blaring loud the music was. Because of the open structure of the warehouse, the two levels in the restaurant allow for the music and chatter from the upstairs to melt in with the downstairs. So when the bartender tried to talk to me, I could not hear over his heavily accented murmurs.\r\n2. While gorgeous, the bartenders can't be heard, at least by me. And they returned the favor. So I had to point out my items on a menu so I could be understood.\r\n3. I decided on the spicy lamb rice dish with a side of raita. The raita is first rate but the rice dish... well, the meat bits were good, but the rice overall was bland. The side sauces worked temporarily (by the way, who doesn't have salt and pepper out if you're going with the logic of bland rice?) but I felt near the end overwhelmed by the spice, and not enough flavor. The raita was tastier than the entree. Bad sign.\r\n4. I didn't want to finish the entree or the raita at the end. I was getting full, but remember my review for Salvation In Noodles when I talked about wanting to have a bigger stomach so I could eat more? I didn't feel that way at all for this place, these dishes, or the service. I think the bartender was disappointed that I wasn't ordering a drink and was confused why I would sit at the bar if I was just going to eat. Look buddy, I was just being polite and following the host's recommendation.\r\n5. At the host bar, there's easily four or five employees just standing around talking to each other. Which kind of upset me just because no one bothered to walk over to the bar and at least set things up. The menu was set in front of me after I sat down, thirty seconds later. I know that's a picky thing to complain about and it normally wouldn't be a big deal, but personal touch is really missing from this place, which unlike SIN, doesn't have the food to make up for it.\r\nReasons to go? I dunno, I guess I can tell the bartenders put effort into their cocktails, they have a full bar, it may have been a dud dish I got, it may have been a bad seat, it also may have been the heat of the day that got me a little frustrated since Dishoom wasn't my first choice to eat at.

Their lamb and chicken is succulent, their prawns are sweet and their salad is fresh. My only criticisms of their food are that they have not allowed the Naan and Roti bread to rise much but instead enabled them to become a little dry with less flavour and whenever they have grilled the food the exteriors have been somewhat burnt and blackened. Both the drinks and desserts hold pleasant surprises and tasteful combinations. The waiter said I was brave to try the Kala Khatta Sharbat which contains kokum fruit juice, chilli, citrus and black salt but actually far from being a decision I would live to regret, as with most of their ventures, they succeed in achieving the combination of interesting yet pleasant.

I was lucky and found something but just barely. Even with reservations we still waited for 15 minutes. \r\nWe had the Karahi and Spinach Paneer with a billion orders of Naan. It's difficult to mess up Naan, but this was some of the best I've had. Also, whatever yogurt dip they brought, please bottle this and ship it to the U.S. so I can eat it on everything.

By the time we finally got our last dish it was like 10 pm and we've been starving since 8. \r\nAlso some warning, the restaurant doesn't have a good vent system and everyone's ordering the grilled lamb, so expect to walk out smelling like a BBQ.", "score": -1.0}, {"text": "What an adventure!\r\nOkay, here's the deal. This is the place to hit for amazing kebabs and grilled meat. Interestingly, these are all items you will find in their appetizer section.

The seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, and lamb chops were all great!\r\nSo, the food really hits the spot and there's no argument there. The prices are also very reasonable for London. \r\nAs for the service/seating experience, that's where it hurts. You can make reservations online through their website. However, if you arrive on a weekend night like we did, you will be greeted by an unhappy mob of people overflowing out the entry room of the restaurant into the street. There is one guy from the restaurant running around trying to get people to form into a serpentine line and manage the flow. When you inform him about your reservation, he will simply say, \"Online reservation, no reservation. Only phone reservation.\" When you show him your confirmation of the reservation, he basically will tell you a bunch of rude stuff that doesn't make any sense and tell you to get in line with all the people who don't have a reservation. As you may have noted from other reviews, they basically don't honor reservations. I got the idea that there was a mild chance they might honor a phone reservation, though even that was somewhat doubtful. From all appearances, the wait even at off times on a weekend evening could run into the 1-2 hour range. When we arrived, it was definitely around two hours wait. \r\nWe saw many other people arrive and have the exact same issue. This restaurant basically lures people in with seemingly available reservations and then blindsides them with a huge 2 hour wait on arrival. They had no apologies and seemed to imply that everyone who made a reservation had done something wrong.\r\nPart of the popularity is that they don't serve alcohol, but they allow you to bring your own. Given the cost savings, it is a hugely popular destination among the drinking crowd. This is what we gathered while we waited. \r\nWe had little children in our party, it was already 9:30pm when we arrived, everyone was starving, we had cabbed all the way across from the other side of London only because of this reservation and not wanting to wait at something closer, and this bait and switch with the reservation was not something we were going to let slide. After intermittently hassling the front man for about 45 minutes, he somehow squeezed us into a small table downstairs and allowed us to skip out on what appeared to be at least another 60-90 minute wait otherwise. \r\nEnd note: Grilled food is solid if you can get in there somehow. Just be prepared for 3rd world shenanigans! Again, for a 30 minute wait or if they actually honor your reservation, probably worth it.

It felt like it had been simmering for ages from the complex savouries and spices I was getting.

Didn't waste a single bit of sauce and enjoyed it greatly with rice.\r\nMethi Aloo Gajar. \r\nDescribed as fenugreek, potatoes and carrots we were only given one piece of carrot. Nevertheless it was amazing stuff. Delicious chargrilled aromas throughout the whole dish being cooked in the karahi (small wok). The potatoes were incredibly fluffy, taking in the lovely array of spices and the fenugreek flavour which gave it a lovely rounded sweetness with a slight bitterness undertone.\r\nSaag meat. \r\nSadly the lamb fails to remain juicy and bouncy inside. It became dry and rough on the tongue but it was still soft and tooth tender. It was more about the simmering process of all the spices, lamb and spinach coming together. The lovely creaminess created as a result of the overly wilted spinach, wrapping round each piece of meat, aiding it in moisture. They achieve something that usually requires cream but this was obviously lighter. Not overly spicy but enough herbs in there to keep your tongue buzzing in its complexity\r\nPilau rice \r\nThis was lovely and cooked al dente.

Made of a soft cheese it was incredibly light and crumbly and gave it the ability to soak and release the sweet spice milk once devoured. The milk itself was delicious, beautiful aromas of cardamom, rose water and a sweet nuttiness from the pistachios.\r\nGreat meal although things could have been better. Firstly they were quite sly in selling us the poppadoms by just placing it on our table. It's also a very loud place to make conservation. To keep things cheap they don't use the highest quality of meats which means some can be tough or dry. However there was nothing that couldn't be chewed through, just requires a bit of bite and patience. The quality of this restaurant lies in the rich marinates and flavours produced.

The tables were very close together and I could literally rub elbows with the person next to me, so I felt a little boxed in. \r\nWe opted for paneer tikka, chicken tikka, lamb chops,masala fish, baby chicken masala and a garlic naan and a Coke. Let's just say, we were hungry. The person who took our order didn't write any of it down. \r\nWhen the drinks arrived it was a Diet Coke, not a normal Coke, despite having specified normal Coke. After asking three different people, they changed the Coke over so that was slightly annoying. \r\nThe paneer came first and I was excited about it as paneer is one of my favourite foods. However I was really disappointed. The paneer was rubbery and hard and bland. Paneer is not supposed to be like that, it's supposed to have a slight rubbery texture but this was hard - I found it difficult to cut through with my knife and fork! \r\nThe chicken tikka and the lamb chops slightly redeemed Tayyabs. They were both delicately spiced and cooked really well. The meat was really succulent and tender. Really tasty. \r\nThe masala fish was really not my thing. I didn't like it at all however my dinner companion did so it wasn't all bad. \r\nWhen the naan came, we looked at it but didn't realise until we tasted it and realised that it wasn't garlic naan. However the two of us just couldn't be bothered to send it back as the last time we tried to send the Coke back, they took forever. \r\nThe baby chicken masala was very tender and cooked really well but I wasn't overly keen on the sauce - it was a bit bland. Maybe it just wasn't to my taste. \r\nOverall my opinion of Tayyabs wasn't great.

It is definitely close quarters but okay.\r\nThe menu is quite short, and as our guest didn't know what any of it was, really, I just went ahead and ordered - a lamb dish, a chicken tikka masala, sag aloo, rice and garlic naan, along with some paneer tikka, lamb chops, and samosas to start. Our guest had brought a beer, so I asked for a bottle opener, and we ordered Coke.\r\nThe food came out pretty much all at once, except for the paneer which was first.

Their use of spices is generally tasted in every dish. \r\nWhen seeking Tayyabs, the closest tube stops are either Aldgate East or Whitechapel. It is definitely a bit hidden in an alleyway, but as soon as you see the bright blue lights and the crowd of people standing in the queue, you know you found the right place. \r\nAn array of desserts is displayed upon entering the door.

Tayyabs is a BYOB eatery, so walk over to the nearest off-license or Tesco as soon as you get off the tube stop. And....don't forget to make a reservation for this place! Trust me on this one. It can be done online in less than 2 minutes.\r\nPappadums as well as a salad were provided, along with three different sauces complimentary to the start of the meal. The sauces range from spicy, to a sweet chutney and a cooling creamy sauce. All delicious!\r\nLAMB CHOPS ( \u00a36.50 FOR 4 PIECES): My favorite dish. The chops are delivered in 4 pieces, topped with a tomato and served on a bed of grilled onions. This dish could easily be ordered for each individual. The chops were succulent, rubbed with their own spices and provided with enough heat as to not overwhelm the palate. Is it the best chops I've ever had in my life? I wouldn't say so, but it definitely is ranked high up there and worth a try! \r\nKEEMA NAAN (\u00a32.75): A definite must order. The naan was so fresh and stuffed with minced meat, onions, green chili, and garlic. The bread glistened under the light, waiting to be engulfed by the hungry individuals. \r\nCHICKEN TIKKA MASALA (\u00a37.75): The dish is definitely not your normal chicken tikka masala you would find in the States. It contains karahi masala, coriander aka cilantro, onions and chilis. It definitely has a kick so utilize the sauces and the naan. The dish definitely goes well over basmati rice and you can bet your buttons that the chicken was not overcooked or dry! \r\nKARAHI GOSHT LAMB (\u00a37.00 SMALL): This is my favorite of the two curries. Why? The lamb just melts in your mouth and provides enough heat from the chilis and spices for the dish. Again, naan and basmati rice are a must with this dish. \r\nGARLIC NAAN (\u00a32.00): Order this if you feel like having bread without the stuffing. It is pillowy, soft, and oh so delicious with just the right amount of garlic!\r\nPISTA KULFI AND MANGO KULFI (\u00a32.75 EACH): And just when you thought you were done, you're not. This is a must to finish off the meal. It's ice cream with the creamiest texture in popsicle form. Don't mind the wrapping or the shape of the popsicle. You won't care once you want to cool off your tongue and sink your teeth into these. There are other varieties, but we chose these flavors.

We heard their conversation with the manager (as the restaurant does put you in quite close quarters) and apparently, though the waiter had been informed, they were brought numerous dishes with onions, which they kept having to send back.

It was hard to communicate with our waiter to get recommendations on what to order, we asked for 1 bottle of sparkling water and he seemed annoyed when we asked to send the 2nd bottle back, my main arrived and we had to remind him after 10 minutes that he forgot to deliver my wife's dish (appeared he forgot to tell kitchen), at this point i sent back my spicy dish as there was no spice.

Having previously lived in London, I always make a special point to come back to Tayyab when I am in town. Tayyab is by far the best Pakistani/Indian food I have had and comes with a very only-locals-know-about-this-place vibe. Tayyab is BYOB (there are numerous Off-License stores along the walk from the Whitechapel station) and unless you call and make reservations the day before or early the day of, you will likely have to cue for a table (reservations are highly recommended). Poppadums with the three classic mango, mint, and chutney sauces begin the meal. The chicken tikka for an appetizer is wonderful and served on the hot plate with peppers and onions. The main dishes are all great (thought not diet friendly given the amount of oil used to prepare them), though I would recommend anything with lamb in it. Make sure to get a homemade naan to accompany the sauces of the main dishes. While I typically do not get dessert, there is a counter on the way out that has the classic desserts of the region.\r\nThe prices are one of the key sellers of this place. Appetizers like chicken tikka are around \u00a33.50, mains are around \u00a37-12, and sides like rice and naan around \u00a32.50-3. Even at my most hungry times, an appetizer, main, and one order of naan are overfilling. A full meal can easily be under \u00a315 each. Just remember to pick up wine and beer on the way to the restaurant. \r\nThe atmosphere has changed considerably from when I first came to Tayyab years ago. In the past, small rooms to the left and right of the entrance on the ground floor were the only spaces available for dinner. Now, a full upstairs is also available. The decor has also become significantly nicer. Unfortunately, this means a large number of diners are eating simultaneously, meaning that service is slower and sometimes inaccurate. While the staff always try to correct the errors, it is challenging to gain their attention most of the time (we had to get up a few times to grab a bottle opener or waiter for more water). The atmosphere of years ago had better service, but the quality of the food still outweighs the poorer service to keep me coming back.\r\nThe dining atmosphere is quite packed and it can become difficult to hear your companions if not sitting close to one another (this is a side-effect of the upstairs expansion as well).

I love my favorite Indian place in Glendale that does a great job on Northern Indian Thalis, so I had to see if this one stood up to it. \r\nI went with the The Grand Thali, which is equal to a starter and main course combined.

If you're like me and like to actually taste some spice in your food, medium should be good. Anywho, as noted on their website, the etiquette of eating a Thali is to spoon a small portion of food from an individual dish into the area next to the rice, and then combine it with the rice. Repeat this process in sequence. This enables the flavour of each dish to be appreciated individually. Do not either mix more than one dish simultaneously with the rice, or mix the rice in the individual bowls. Chapattis are eaten with the food by using a piece of chapatti to scoop the food from one of the dishes.\r\nFor a chain restaurant, the Thali was great and a good portion. It's not \"home made\" Indian food, but it's food that's tasty and you can try different combos. After walking an entire day around London, this did the job for a casual sit down.

Chicken tends to be a little dry and tired; lamb tends to be only ok. The veggie offerings are really quite nice, with a good range of starches and pulses and some solid paneer-based offerings.\r\nThalis are a good size.\r\nSo why the three stars? Primarily it comes down to price. Yeah, you can come in, get just a veg thali (\u00a311.15) and their cheapest drink (tea or filter coffee, I believe, at \u00a31.80) and have lunch for \u00a314.57 when you add in gratuity. But that's an expensive lunch for Soho when you can get a solid, fresh falafel wrap etc for under \u00a37 with a drink around the corner. And let's be real, you don't want just the thali: you want to try the appetisers (all sadly overpriced and not good value for the size, also generally underwhelming in terms of taste) and have a drink (also expensive), and maybe tack on a second curry to pad out your thali (\u00a33.50). \r\nThe last time we went (yesterday, actually), we dropped just under \u00a360--ouch!--for lunch: lassi, iced tea, thali with extra curry, a curry main, two appetisers, two desserts (both of which were awful), a tea, and a coffee.\r\nWhat gets my (roast) goat here is that the pricing always feels vaguely like a scam about to happen. It's always a little different; this time it was \"If you order a main and a drink, it's 20% off!\" Hey, that sounds really good-- no, wait. \"The 20% off is already reflected in the menu. If you want the full-price menu, we can offer it.\" What even is this? Seriously, guys. It's not classy, and your poor servers have to keep explaining it like it's reasonable. Don't do it. Just admit your food is grossly overpriced and then offer a discount from the price you want to charge, if that's what you're after.\r\nFood also does take forever to come out. Granted, yeah, things are being made mostly to order, but let's be real, the kitchen doesn't hustle, and there's no excuse for dessert (pre-made sweets and a lump of ice cream) taking 15 minutes to appear.

The chapati was a large round pita/ naan without substance rather than a traditional chapati, so I was a little disappointed as I expected well, a chapati.  Personal bugbear of highly spiced poppadom was here and the daal tasted like Chinese red bean (aduki bean) soup without the sugar, underspiced and under salted (total failure in my point of view).  Aloo gobi was ok and the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced.

If you're ever unfortunate to walk into one of these places, might I suggest negotiating 10% off the menu price first. They usually oblige and you might feel a bit better knowing you salvaged something to go with that slab of ghee swimming in your belly.\r\nMasala Zone have thrived in part due to any lack of alternative choices but also through innovation (or modernisation), if I can call it that: Big, illustrated and descriptive menus; a bright interior; spacious seating; and well trained waiting staff that don't wear waistcoats. Most importantly of course is the food which I found to be a commendable effort. Previous visits with friends have taken in their renowned Thalis - a complete meal on a tray made up of several small dishes - and they've kinda dissapointed. The meat curry dishes aren't swimming in oil but at the detriment of any real flavours. Same with the vegetable dishes which were slightly on the cold side. At \u00a311 for a thali, I'd also question the value - sure the variety seems impressive but an espresso cupful of rice, some shredded onions with green bits and a pot of minty yoghurt does not fool the tummy.\r\nThis recent visit with my buddy Nige saw us share: he, his lamb madras and I, my chicken mangalore. Supplemented with rice, chapatis and garlic spinach. For little more than a couple of thalis I'd say that it was a more fulfilling eating experience.\r\nThe madras was delicious - heavy on the chilli and tempered by tamarind. Lamb seemed a tad overcooked but it could've been a bit too lean. The Mangalore chicken was just right in it's combination of spice and coconut, with ginger being most prominent. The chicken was a bit dry though and I'm finding this to be a common occurence in all their meat dishes.\r\nWe decided on the Rasmalai for a sweet thing but other choices are standards - Golub Jamun, falouda (a sweet drink with colourful noodles) and kulfi almond ice cream. Rasmalai was a great choice - light, spongey, milky patties soaked in a saffron flavoured milk sauce and topped with pistachios went down a treat with the chai teas.\r\nMasala Zone is a pretty good Indian that provides a more contempory experience to the traditional restaurant and if they figured out a way of serving meat that isn't overcooked to a high turnover of customers then I'd say it'd be excellent.\r\nThis was my second visit and it was a more positive experience than the first one.\r\n\u00a340 for the two of us which includes 2 mains, rice, chapatis, sides, drinks, desserts and chais.", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "I really liked this place.

Braised tender lamb in a rich and deeply savory sauce that's topped with crunchy crisp chips.

Of course we got some garlic na'an on the side to dip in all the delicious gravies. \r\nThe chicken ruby was spot on. Just the right amount of sweetness and heat. The chicken could be cut with a spoon it was so tender. Probably my favorite dish of our order.\r\nThe sali boti definitely had some kick (spicy) and came with a side of the roomali roti which was paper thin. The lamb in the dish was similar to the chicken ruby, so tender! I used the roti to basically wipe the dish completely clean. Very very tasty!\r\nWhat prevented the fifth star was the lamb chop. While the flavor was still there and the marinade was delicious, the lamb was just not cooked that well. It was medium well, boarding on well.

Dishoom is a trendy, hipster place, but it does not lose out on flavor and quality of each individual dish. The space is much larger than expected, and even has a \"garden\" room under a skylight.

Our server advised 2-3 plates per person and we gladly took that to heart because it was hard narrowing down all the dishes we wanted to try. We loved Dishoom so much that the next day, we stopped by Cinnamon Soho and turned around to head straight back to Dishoom just a block and half away. I was sad to have to fly back to NY the next day, otherwise I certainly would have fit in a third visit before leaving. \r\nHere's what we ordered and we loved everything!\r\n- Lamb samosa (4.90): Like the description says, they use phyllo dough instead of the Punjabi shortcrust version. I actually prefer the phyllo dough because it's crispier and lighter, making it a perfect appetizer without filling you up with dough. The minced lamb is spiced well with cumin and shines through. Eat it with the mint, tomato, and tamarind chutney!\r\n- Pau bhaji (4.50): Mashed vegetables, mostly tomato, beans, and potatoes. Slather it on the hot buttered homemade buns and you have a little veggie Indian slider snack. We had extra leftover so we scooped it up with the naan, which I actually prefer over the buns.\r\n- Chicken tikka (7.90): Delicious, flavorful, and a good char. I love chicken tikka and this was by far one of the best ones that I've had. The chicken remained moist and tender, which is usually not the case at most restaurants.\r\n- Masala prawns (11.20): If you prefer seafood to chicken and lamb, then this IS definitely the dish for you. It's marinaded in a green chutney thick sauce and grilled to absolute perfection. The shrimps are plump and succulent. I love love loved this dish. I wish this is how my shrimp come out every time I cook it over the barbecue.\r\n- Lamb biryani (9.90): Could use more lamb, but the rice is spot on, like seriously spot on. The rice is cooked in stock and spices and it really is just absorbed in the rice. When it comes to biryani, I always order lamb over chicken because the deep, rich flavor of lamb fills the rice more than chicken could ever. \r\n- Chicken ruby (8.50): You need a curry dish to go with naan... Dishoom only offers a chicken or paneer one. It's really like the iconic British chicken tikka masala, sweet, tomato-y, creamy, and buttery. About three pieces of chicken and the rest is curry... which isn't bad considering how much food we ordered!\r\n- Garlic naan: (2.50): Standard naan, but not say it's a bad thing! \r\n- Roomali roti\r\nOverall, the food is to die for. This is by far one of  the best Indian restaurants that I've been to in NY and London. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long for a table during the late lunch hour. First day was only 15 minutes around 2pm on Sunday and the second was 30-45 mins on May Day. Service is hit or miss.

They say a connected team works best right?\r\nLocated walking distance of the Oxford Circle tube station, it's just the right location. You walk over and stand in a line outside to put your name in for a table. If it's raining, they have complementary umbrellas; luckily we had one from the hotel (see review for the Landmark Hotel). While you're in line, they will bring you chai or Sherry (so much yes). \r\nAfter our wait ended, we were able to then go inside and wait at the bar. With three of us, we each ordered different drinks. I opted for the Bollybelini first, Jake had an old fashion, and Liz had a twist on the whiskey sour. Yes, my girly drink wasn't exactly strong but o wanted to try something different than my norm. We ordered a second round of drinks and I had the Velvette Fog which consisted of chai ice cream, coffee liqueur, and vodka. So, it was dessert before the meal. For my last round (yes we ordered three before being seated) I had a big girl drink which was equally delicious. Each drink was 7\u00a3-8\u00a3.\r\nOn to the food: it's family style and sooooo inexpensive. Go for the vegetable samosa - you will not be disappointed. That's what I picked and we agreed on garlic naan. I can't remember anything else because I let them do the selecting but it was ALL delicious. The food costed 50\u00a3 total and we had PLENTY of food. It also came out within 3-4 minutes of ordering which was good because we were starved by the time we sat down. \r\nI would absolutely recommend this to others and already have.

When everyone says you can't go to London without getting curry, I can see why; London's Indian food scene is no joke. \r\nMy boyfriend and I have never eaten at an Indian restaurant before, so we were a little hesitant. With a quick Yelp search, Dishoom came up as the best Indian restaurant in London, so we just had to come here on our last day. Tip - I read how the waits at Covenant Garden are excruciating long; there was no wait and ample seating at this location, so do come here instead! \r\nInformed by our waiter that every dish is meant to be shared, so order 2 dishes per person, my boyfriend and I shared the lamb samosas, the carnaby special, and the chicken ruby with 2 orders of garlic naan (we originally order 1 order of garlic naan, but it was so good that we had to have another order. It tastes better piping hot when it's super fresh and so worth the hand burns!). Everything was absolutely delicious! I legit died and couldn't stop saying how good the food was with every bite! The lamb samosas wasn't oily / greasy and felt light; it was also flavorful on its own, but tasted even better with the red pepper sauce provided. The carnaby special is great for those who want to sample lamb / love lamb as the lamb was tender and didn't have that gamey aftertaste that lamb tends to have sometimes. This dish was my boyfriends favorite with the thinner naan that the dish came with. My favorite was the chicken ruby as the curry was slightly spicy, but most importantly, the chicken was SO tender and juicy. You can honestly taste how complex this dish is and how much hard work went into making this curry. Ughhhhhh, I wish I had more as I'm writing this review. And yes, I mopped up the entire bowl with the garlic naan without shame. The menu suggests the thinner naan for this dish, but DON'T DO IT.

Sometimes it's because of authenticity, sometimes it's expertise in one style of dish, but then there are some restaurants are constantly pleasurable, no matter what the dish or what time of day. Dishoom exemplifies this perfectly- their take on Indian cuisine is contemporary, hybrid and fun. Purists might sneer, but what comes out of the kitchen is fresh, vibrant and flavoursome. And although their brunch naan rolls are genuinely worth trekking across town for, their standard menu is just as satisfying. The food speaks for itself, but the environs and service at Dishoom truly never disappoint- and this is true across all of their London branches. \r\nThe newest addition to the Dishoom franchise recently opened in Carnaby, offering a fuel stop that straddles Oxford Street and Soho. I visited with a group and we squeezed in just before the 11:45 brunch cut-off time on a Saturday morning. Staff greeted me immediately with friendly banter and I was taken through the bar to our cozy booth. The restaurant is spread across two levels- the main floor is open, spacious and there's ample seating that spills out into a veranda area. Here, diners sit an airy space, underneath a skylight and encircled by retro fittings. Electric fireplace, mahogany touches and that brown/orange colour combination that was hallmark of the 60s, this level of attention to detail is perhaps Dishoom's most endearing element.\r\nThe entire restaurant is designed to emulate a Bombay caf\u00e9 circa 1968 and this is achieved right down to the minutia- it's so seamlessly accomplished that it doesn't feel kitschy. Everything is casual and the continuous din of other tables makes Dishoom a buzzy hotspot- and then you get to the menu. My staple is the egg naan roll and masala beans, which I immediately settled upon given our time constraint. \r\nAs always, it was perfectly rendered: a warm, pillowy naan bread made to order in the open kitchen downstairs- it came filled with two oozing fried eggs, freshly chopped coriander and an indulgent lashing of soft, creamy cheese. It's paired with a tomato chili jam- which is a worthy of its own praise- balancing savoury with sweetness and singing with a fistful of chewy naan. The masala beans are always stewed to perfection, a tangy and complex side to mop up with gummy fingers after naan has been dunked into the sticky jam. This is the apex of brunch and has never disappointed.\r\nEvery dish ordered in our group seemed to provoke envy- from the house granola, an aesthetic feat with wholesome oats, chopped nuts and bursting with ripe fruit, a hearty dollop of yogurt and a fat drizzle of golden honey- to the Big Bombay, a smorgasbord of breakfast fare with an Indian twist. One diner was compelled to order a second dish after eyeing up my naan roll, which was cheerfully organised despite the fact that the kitchen had moved on to the standard menu. \r\nThe food at Dishoom Carnaby won't disappoint those who frequent other Dishoom branches. The service was in line with what I've come to expect and the d\u00e9cor, ambiance and experience also lived up to my lofty expectations. Servers are occasionally bouncing between tables and need to be flagged down, but their good humour never wanes.\r\nProvided that Dishoom can continue to replicate this winning formula, I'm happy to see more of the franchise around London.

The staff were really friendly and knowledgeable when I asked about spice level. Despite the Chicken Ruby sounding seriously awesome, I wimped out and went for the Murgh Malai as it was marked (M) for mild. I have no regrets about this whatsoever though, as the Murgh Malai was amazing. Loads of flavours going on, the chicken was seriously tender and I had to slow myself down eating it cause I was stuffing it in my face! Mr Debs let me try his lamb kebab and it was tasty as well. The basmati rice and roti we shared were a nice accompaniment, the three chutneys we got were tasty as well, although the chilli one was pretty hot!

I ordered the chocolate pudding after being advised by our server that they could swap the chilli ice cream for cinnamon (smart move, Dishoom) and it was lovely.

While I am not always the biggest fan of lamb, this dish was a triumph. The meat was tasty and tender, the sauce was a beautifully rich gravy and there were also different textures that made the plate more interesting to eat. The pancake-thin buttered roomali roti bread on the side was perfect to finish off the sauce. \r\nI decided to add a rose and cardamom lassi and also a tap water. The lassi was surprisingly nice and great to balance the slightly spicy food.\r\nThis was a brilliant and delicious dinner, and I did not have to think much about what I wanted, as all the plates and drinks were recommended by the funny and knowledgeable waiter. \r\nFor dessert, I treated myself go the Dishroom Chocolate Pudding. I must admit, I thought it was an absurdly spicy warm chocolate, but it was also absolutely delicious. The strong chocolate taste in combination with the spicyness confused me a little bit, but I did indulge in it and the ice cream also complemented the chocolate well.\r\nTo sum it up, my dinner was quick and very tasty.

Very attentive waiters and waitresses and no mistake done.  We are not locals and we could see quite a few tables with foreigners here but everyone was treated with respect and with no attitude.  This is what makes a good restaurant.  \r\nThe wine list is extensive.  We asked the sommelier to recommend wines that go well with our courses and all of them were perfectly paired.  If you want to pair it with your 7 courses, it is usually about \u00a3100 per person but you may have less and pay less so it really is up to you. \r\nI am not going to go into details on each of the dishes that I have tried.  I had the seasonal tasting menu and my friend had the prestige tasting menu.  The pictures that I have posted speaks for itself and what you will be expecting from the dishes.  We also tried a bit of each other's food so that we know how the food was compared to other Michelin star restaurants.  \r\nUnfortunately for us, the food I have to say is not up to a 3 Michelin star quality.  Maybe we went in expecting too much from this restaurant but I have been to some 1 & 2 starred restaurants and the flavour and taste of their food did surpass Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.  I believe that the quality and taste of the food is more geared towards a 1 star quality especially for the price that I am paying.  The Prestige menu was priced at \u00a3145 and the Seasonal menu was priced at \u00a3175.  Of course, the Seasonal menu tasted better than the Prestige menu since it is more expensive.  \r\nI think this is a one in a lifetime experience which I agree as it is after all a 3 Michelin star restaurant from Gordon Ramsay.  However, I don't think I will come back as we came here to give a 3 star a try.  Just not value for money and definitely not a 3 Michelin star I was expecting food wise.

The sommelier, instinctively telling that we were college students, gave my friends (I don't drink) a cheap but wonderful wine recommendation, which they eagerly accepted. The matire'd, apparently renowned in London for his welcoming nature, greeted us, asked where we were from, and genuinely seemed interested in a trio of kids that didn't seem to belong. \r\nAll three of us got the tasting menu, The food was stunning. Everything was prepared incredibly carefully, and the presentation was a visual masterpiece. We couldn't help but to take pictures of the food, which I feared would make us stand out in a room of the mature and sophisticated. \r\nIt started with a small collection of starters that included scotch eggs. Next camethe pressed Foie Gras, which had a smooth texture and sweet tartness to it due to the green apples.Then we moved onto the Isle of Gigha Halibut, which was presented with this ras el hanout infused broth. The flowers that laid atop the delicate fish were a delightful surprise, both visually and in flavor.\r\nThe Ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon is undeniably the star of the show, being one of the signature dishes.

The transparent sauce that aligned the plate was especially delicious. \r\nAfter our meal, the matire'd actually invited us into the kitchen.

The key points about my experience:\r\n1.  The food was phenomenal\r\n2.

You can't exactly walk in off the street or stumble into a reservation...  Anyway, the first weird thing was that we requested the wine pairings.  The pairing isn't like a typical tasting menu where there is a published price, they give you a range because they claim to select wines on a case by case basis after discussing likes and dislikes with you.  That's fine.  The weird thing was that when my husband told a server that we were interested in pairings, she asked us who was hosting the dinner.  We were perplexed, never having been asked that question before, there were only two of us (married couple).  After a painful few moments we discerned that she was asking who would be paying for dinner and then verified that we were okay with the range of prices that had been printed on the menu that we had *just* been perusing.  Yes, we ordered the pairings, we are prepared to pay within the listed price range.  The second weird thing was when we selected our chosen main course.  I ordered the pigeon (or squab as we yanks call it) and the server (I think the GM?) asked if I was fine with it being cooked med. rare.  I said yes, that is fine with me, that is how I prefer it.  It seemed as if he didn't quite believe me and then basically proceeded to try to talk me out of going with the chef's recommendation.  He said \"I don't know, are you sure?  It is served *quite pink*, we can cook it more for you if you prefer...\"  I'm not sure what this was about, perhaps they've been burned by too many stupid Americans sending back a beautifully cooked dish to be cooked more?  Or I was just being profiled as a dumb woman who doesn't know anything?  I can't be sure.  Regardless, the squab was perfection and I ate every bite.  Perhaps this gentleman recognized that he'd misjudged us, he gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal, presumably to compensate for his somewhat poor behavior earlier in the meal.\r\nUltimately, the meal was fantastic, the food was fabulous and the weirdness didn't ruin it, but I thought it was notable, I've never been treated this way in such a highly regarded restaurant before.\r\nHopefully someone from the restaurant reads this so that they can take the feedback, but I have a feeling that management at establishments such as R GR don't give a hoot about yelp reviews...", "score": -1.0}, {"text": "So we made reservations for two people six months ahead of time as that was how far out they were booked \r\nI had the Menu Prestige (\u00a3145) and my date had the Season Inspiration Menu (\u00a3195)- both choices were terrific in their own right.

Others imagine the cabbies, fashion, and pub scene. \r\nBut hardly anyone can attest that London is known for delicious food. The statement itself is an oxymoron.\r\nUntil you try Gordon Ramsay's in Chelsea.\r\nI have been a huge GR fan since the first season of Hell's Kitchen. Attending a live dinner service is on my bucket list just to try a dollop of his award-winning sauces. And even though Gordon may have his anger management issues on the show, the man can cook. Then I realized, what am I waiting for?? I should just come to him! So I did...\r\nBut don't take my word for it. Ask Michelin. Gordon Ramsay is a recipient of three prestigious Michelin Stars, the highest accolade one can receive by the Michelin brothers. \r\nThe Michelin guide began in 1900 as a handy-dandy manual for those traveling within Europe for reliable gas stations, eateries, and service tips. In 1933, it launched its Red Guide that inspected restaurants all around Europe under the highest caliber of secrecy and standards. The inspectors to this day are anonymous (even the parents don't know their line of work), and the secret diners are funded by the Michelin company, not the restaurant. \r\nThe grading scale is 1 to 3 stars: One being good in its category, two being excellent and worth a detour, and three being exceptional and worth a journey in itself. The Michelin grading system has received worldwide respect and to date, less than 100 restaurants around the globe have been bequeathed with the 3-star honor.\r\nWith that said, I was beyond excited to try this place. I had booked my reservation at least four months before I set foot in London. Service was spot-on with our waiter epitomizing the perfect blend of cordialness and humor. He grew up in Dijon (France) and was extremely passionate about the menu. My bf and I ordered the Prestige Menu and the Seasonal Inspirations Course. \r\nEach seven-course dish was impeccably crafted and presented. The poached lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli held remarkable flavor. My foie gras was embedded with the sweet juice of duck confit and pickled pears. The next protein courses were the halibut and suckling pig with crispy skin that I could have nibbled on the entire evening. After the soup, cheese and fruit course, we were pretty stuffed. But lo and behold, the desserts shined brightest for us. \r\nOne was a Milk Chocolate Truffle Tree. This literally was a silver tree stand with truffle-infused chocolates awaiting our degustation delights. Like Ancient Romans plucking grapes off one-by-one, we fed each other these signatures confections with smiles and laughs. The second dessert was a White Chocolate and Strawberry Ice Cream platter on dry ice. As if that wasn't enough, the best was yet to come.\r\nThe most memorable part of this experience was being secretly escorted \"behind the scenes\" to the kitchen where all the magic happens. When the manager found out that we had visited all the way from Hawaii, they asked if we'd like to see the chefs at work. Unfortunately, Chef Gordon himself was in New York but Chef Patron Clare Smyth (Chef of the Year winner by UK Food Guide and the only female UK Chef to win 3 Michelin Stars) was leading the team, mastering the finishing touches on every dish sent out. Their kitchen was absolutely spotless, and every member of the kitchen was working harmoniously like instruments perfecting the tunes before it hit the audience's ears.\r\nI still remember the tray of mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup about to be served to the dining room, poised in a champagne flute and glass straw. Chef Clare stopped the waiter and placed a drop of sugar water on the end of each straw to ensure it was perfectly presented in taste and vision. \r\nThis experience took my breath away and we talk about it every so often when we relive our European getaways.

And this is his flagship restaurant. Here you do not dine out, this is a food experience, this is a culinary trip. You don't get here by chance, and every single dish, every single instant will be stuck in your mind for a long time. But yet, small imperfections caused the lack of the \"top quality seal\" approval (yes we have a seal!) from me and my lovely lady.\r\nAs soon as we entered here we got the feeling this was a place like no others. The cure for details is maniacal, from the door to the tables. But here we also started to notice the first issues: the place is quite small, as it should be, but it's rather busy: we were lucky in receiving a table on the wall, but a couple in front of us (really, at less than 1 m with the corridor for waiters in between) was right in the middle of the hall, something completely uncomfortable giving the amount of tables on the wall. It seemed to me they really pushed their capacity over the limit, and that's a serious error.\r\nBut as we said, the decor both of the place and on the wall is incredibly refined and classy. Quite minimalistic in the style, it has several little classy touches both me and my lady love. Incredible.\r\nThe waiters were nice and warming, very accommodating (even too much perhaps, given that we were on a romantic dinner) and they spoke to us in several languages. But from the other side, some of the waiters lacked in appearance, with a wrong make up messed-up hairs. Something you don't want to find in a three stars restaurant.\r\nBut then, let's speak about the main reason we get there, the food! First time we came here, we wanted to try all the classical dishes the restaurant is acclaimed for, so here we go with the tasting menu. We chose a half bottle in order to get something a little bit more special, and we received the service we expected considering the age and the caliber of the wine, candle, decanter and so on.\r\nAt first I prepared an awesome review with every single dish carefully described, but the maximum size of 5000 words on yelp is really too much for me. Hence, I just want to speak to you about two dishes, my personal favourite ones.\r\nThe first one is a dish I waited for years: \"Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon\". Wow. Already the name is something to blow up your mind, putting together the sweetness of the lobster, the delicacy of the langoustine and the heavy and powerful taste of salmon. And the result is so good it can't be described, you need to taste it. Served with a delicious bisque with sorrel giving that extra citric needle, it's just one of the best things I ever tasted in my life. A dish so delicious they should name a star with its name.\r\nThe second one is another famous masterpiece for Gordon Ramsay restaurant: Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth.\r\nNow, let's start from the beginning: presentation is ridiculously perfect: the dish comes with the halibut and the crab on top, and they proceed to serve the broth (at room temperature) all around the halibut (like they do with the bisque and the ravioli). The difference is that the broth is liquid, transparent and with flower petals and the composition of the dish rapidly becomes a painting. A wonderful painting, relaxing and intriguing. And the broth, oh my the broth. Incredible, powerful, with 4 thousands flavor all balanced between each other, it's like a Kandinsky frame on your mouth (yes keep going with art paragons!), you can always feel something different and something new, evolving and moving, but the big picture, the big screen is always appealing and entertaining. This dish alone deserves a dinner here. Full stop. If you don't like such a perfect combination of taste, smell, sight I don't even want to be a friend of yours on yelp. And I'm serious.\r\nIt's painful not to speak about every other dish, as every single plate on our table was a piece of art, even the ones we didn't like, but each one had a history and was perfectly concepted and realized. It's amazing.\r\nUnfortunately, as every adventure, we had to end our trip. We started good, we had some initial issues, we had some awesome surprise and we reached home safely.

It was surprisingly unassuming, filled with soft beiges and mauves. Throughout the meal the servers were warm, helpful and professional--the only hiccup came when my sister's turbot arrived a bit too early and had to make a brief retreat.\r\nNow for the food. The meal began with three tiny, unexpected hors d'oeuvres: a fluffy little parmesan dumpling (good), a cheesy, crunchy ball topped with salty iberico ham (excellent) and a seaweed-wrapped, sashimi-like cured salmon (excellent). The next surprise item was a bright green ricotta dish, beautifully plated with fresh vegetables (tangy and salty, every bite slightly different).\r\nThen the appetizers: I was a served a single giant lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli, surrounded with a wood sorrel sauce (also bright green). It had a balanced, hearty seafood flavor, and the savory wood sorrel was oddly addictive. My dining partners both had the scallops--I'm not normally a fan, but these were probably the best I've tasted. They came with two sauces: a nice sweet apple-based one and another (even better) that was concentrated with walnut flavor.\r\nEntrees: My sister had the turbot with greens and an unidentified vegetable (sea beet?)--nicely seasoned and meaty, but not really a standout. My mom and I had pork five ways. The chou farci (stuffed cabbage) was my least favorite, salty but otherwise unexciting. (There was also a smidge of applesauce that I tried but mostly avoided.) The sausage was also slightly disappointing, but still well-spiced and quite decent. The loin was elevated by some slightly acidic potatoes and bite of thin, perfectly crisp bacon. The suckling pig was tender and flavorful, accented by sweet bit of pineapple...\r\n...And then there was pork belly. Oh, the pork belly. This razor-thin rectangle of salty, fatty goodness was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The brilliance of it was the contrast in textures: immaculately crispy on the top layer, melt-in-your-mouth tender on the bottom. It came with two preparations of apple--one baked, one fresh and thin-sliced. It was good with them, it was good without them. It was just good.\r\nAnother intermission: a sweet, brightly flavored mango-passion fruit beverage that was a lovely pre-dessert palate cleanser. We split our three desserts evenly between us. The peppermint souffle was immensely fluffy--so much so that it was essentially a minty egg foam. A bit strange, but better with the chocolate sorbet (which there should've been more of). The chocolate, praline mousse and granola dish was very nice, possibly the best of the three and a nice mix of sweet and pleasantly bitter. The lemonade parfait was easily the most interesting one, jam-packed with sweet and sour flavor. It came with a beautifully spun honey tuile ring, a creamy sheep's milk sorbet and a tangy bergamot gel.\r\nFinally, three more mini-surprises. The elderflower Turkish delight was an appropriately floral gelatin treat. The thin wafers of chocolate peanut brittle were nothing very unusual, but delicious with a balanced sweet-saltiness. The white-chocolate-dipped morsels of strawberry ice cream, immersed in dry ice fog for maximum effect, were a memorable end to a spectacular dinner.\r\nMy meal here was delicious and inventive, with several hits and only a couple of partial misses.

My father and stepmother treated me to a lunch I will remember for the rest of my life.\r\nThe petite dining room features a mere 14 tables, yet it packs enough charm and splendor to fill a big box store. Never attempt to eat here sans a reservation. Secure a spot at least one week in advance just to be safe. My sister, who lives in London, placed a call almost a month prior to our visit.\r\nGordon Ramsay's posh flagship on Royal Hospital Road employs enough wait staff to allow each member to serve a specific course. Another paramount consideration: This is not a fast-food, dash-in and dash-out establishment. A leisurely, glacial pace of food consumption is essential if you want to appreciate the myriad flavors married by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.\r\nWe ordered from the lunch menu and elected for the three-course option, which costs 55 pounds per head. As the five-star rating should indicate, not one pound of the exorbitant bill was wasted.\r\nThe extravagant cuisine adventure commenced with a complimentary consomme. The made-from-rich-flavored stock was drinkable, with baby radishes, heirloom tomatoes and chives delicately assembled in the center of the bowl. I did not leave a trace of this delightful opener on the plate.\r\nI opted to start with the roasted quail with soy honey, togorashi, pickled vegetables and herbs. The house-made soy sauce and dijon mustard rim delivered a perfect accompaniment for the two wing cuts of soft roasted bird. I cannot remember enjoying another quail dish more than this.\r\nNext, I selected the roasted rabbit loin with Bayonne ham, salted baked turnips, toasted hazelnuts and pickled mustard seed. The exquisite presentation of this and every other dish served at the restaurant merits museum enshrinement. The many components at work on the wide plate bonded beautifully. The mustard seed and savory sauce enhanced the wonders of each diminutive bite.\r\nThroughout the afternoon, one wait staff member offered three different breads paired with finely sculpted salted and unsalted butter towers. The onion bacon brioche ranked as my favorite.\r\nFor my last official course, dessert, I chose the chocolate bars with toasted milk mousse and tonka bean ice cream. As much as I love caramel popcorn, I would not have pictured it as a sinful ally in a gourmet dessert dish. Each bite of popcorn with a splash of the milk mousse was even better than the previous one. The caramel, dark and milk chocolate bars melted in my mouth. You can't buy candy this delectable at a convenience store.\r\nPatrons also receive a complimentary dessert tray with four ice cream balls served in a bowl of steaming dry ice plus two lemon Turkish delights and two chocolate ganache squares.\r\nThe championship clincher of this five-star experience: Waiters had eavesdropped on our table during an earlier birthday toast and brought me a sixth course, a miniature but wicked chocolate-hazelnut cake complete with a candle. That they nailed my favorite sweet combination, most often referred to as Nutella or Bacio, has to be the greatest instance of dumb luck ever. Wow!\r\nWait at least one minute after receiving each dish because servers tend to return in a few moments with extra goodies and garnishes for your selected item.\r\nThis extraordinary day also included the British Museum, the London Eye and Coldplay at the Royal Albert Hall.

Beleaguered by some due to its namesake's antics but every bit worth its celebrated status suffice it to say that whether Chef Ramsay himself has cooked on Hospital Road recently is irrelevant, the kitchen remains in good hands while the front of house flows with an effortless affability far too infrequently seen amongst Europe's mostly highly ranked.", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "Absolutely astounding.\r\nMy wife and I visited this restaurant as our last stop on our 2 week vacation to London.\r\nAmazing service and amazing food.

The coffee arrived, I drank it, and time passed.  Other tables were continuing to be served.  Eventually my empty cup was taken away and I declined further coffee.  Perplexingly, my husband than received a clean plate in front of him (I did not).  We sat.  More time passed.  We started to think this was a bit awkward but continued to wait and enjoy each other's company.  \r\nEventually (after about half an hour from when coffee was served) we were offered to see the kitchen, which we accepted.

Adjacent diners finished their meals, left, and the tables had new people seated at them. After another 15 minutes of being ignored entirely by staff we decided it was getting ridiculous.  We actually had to flag down a server and ask what was going on. (!)  \r\nThe gentleman who I assume is the front of house came to our table and said that we hadn't pushed our plates away and therefore it was assumed we wanted more coffee?  Which was quite odd, given that we had both explicitly turned down more coffee, and in any case if the plates were coding this no one actually ever came by to offer it to us.  Not to mention the fact that my husband never actually HAD any coffee in the first place.  \r\nWe asked about the chocolates he had mentioned earlier, and he said, yes, the white chocolate course.  Pause.  We said we hadn't had it.  He said, \"Yes, with the liquid nitrogen?  The strawberries and white chocolate?\"  (As if we would have perhaps forgotten a course with a centerpiece of dry ice?)

Two months and various confirmation e-mails and phone calls later, we arrived at this lovely little restaurant on Royal Hospital Road, ready for a treat.\r\nWe were the first to arrive and were promptly seated at a little table set in crisp white with a centerpiece of white roses in a silver vase.  The space is small and charming, with good light and an aura that evokes mellow wine in gently clinked glasses.\r\nThe service throughout the meal was phenomenal.  The staff:patron ratio was around 1:1, and various polite and friendly gentlemen attended to our table to welcome us, check on us, clear our crumbs, perfume our feet...okay, that last bit didn't happen, but maybe only because we went with the cheapest menu option?  Our primary waiter was wonderful, charismatic and helpful.  He deserved a blue ribbon for unobtrusive small talk.\r\nThere were at least five bread options, and we sampled the olive, the baked potato honey, and the rosemary potato.  The best was the rosemary potato, but they were all fresh and yummy with knived dabs from the swirly beehive of yellow butter.  Incidentally, you get a choice of salted and unsalted butter, which I was surprised to note as unusual.\r\nThe amuse bouche was a tomato consomme with a cute baby-shrimp-sized curl of langoustine accompanied by peas, fava beans, olive oil, and a teeny black cluster of osetra caviar.  It was mild and refreshing.\r\nWe went with the daily lunch menu priced at \u00a345 a head, with three options for appetizers and entrees, and four for dessert including the cheese plate (with a \u00a33 supplement).  Our waiter indicated that should either of us have any dietary restrictions, the kitchen would be more than happy to accommodate us.\r\nI started with the salt cod brandade with Noir de Bigorre ham, poached quail eggs, chargrilled red pepper, olives, and rocket salad.  My mom got the saffron risotto with clams, mussels, langoustines, and tomato, \"paella\" style.  (It was meant to come with chorizo as well, but my mother doesn't eat pork - I know, crazy.)  The brandade was a pleasant blend of pureed cod and potato with a smooth texture enhanced by the meatiness of the fish, great for spreading on the accompanying toasted rosemary crostinis.  The brandade was wrapped in a strip of ham and topped with the quail egg with the veggies and olives nestled on the side.  The olives were excellent on their own and as an accompaniment.  The risotto was beautifully cooked and pretty flavorful, and I imagine it would've been better with chorizo.\r\nFor our mains, I opted for the roasted saddle of rabbit with sage, Bayonne ham, trompette de la mort, and stuffed Provencal vegetables, and my mom got the fillet of daurade royale with navet, carrot, radish, baby gem lettuce, and artichokes baurigole.  The rabbit was nice, herb-stuffed and wrapped like my starter in yummy fatty pig.  It came with teeny little rabbit kidneys looking all cute and un-organ-like on the side, along with a wonderful stuffed shallot and a wonderful stuffed cherry tomato.  The sublimely juicy vegetables were the elevating component on this plate.  The daurade royale, a simply cooked sea bream in a light creamy sauce, was elegant if unexciting.\r\nFor dessert we went halfsies on the banana parfait with passion fruit and salted caramel ice cream and the lemon meringue and almond tart with fromage frais sorbet.  The parfait was a block of dry icy reconstituted banana coated with dark chocolate, topped with unmemorable ice cream and sitting atop a meager drizzle of passion fruit.  On the whole, it wasn't awful, but I would've preferred a good commercial dessert.  In fact, the texture wasn't too far off from a very frozen Klondike bar.  The tart was much better, a thing of beauty - circular crust topped with gorgeous layers of lemon curd and nestlike meringue stuck with almond slivers, with narrow strands of caramel sauce leading out from the tart base to a perfect ball of sorbet - and quite delicious to boot, a perfect blend of sweet and sour.\r\nAfter dessert came two splendid extras.  First was a silver tree of spherical silver chocolate truffles.  They were fun to pick off and eat.  The meal ended with strawberry ice cream balls coated with white chocolate, served in a pot smoking with liquid ice.  The ice cream itself was pretty mediocre, but the presentation was so delightful I didn't really care.\r\nOverall, I was happy with my experience at Gordon Ramsay, though I wasn't quite wowed.  Other than the banana parfait, everything was great, but nothing was mind-blowing.  Since the place does have the three stars I suppose I was expecting more, but I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.

My girlfriend and I were the first ones in on a Monday night, so it was a bit quiet - but the restaurant (all of the 15 tables or so there) filled up pretty quickly. The service is much better than most of the upscale restaurants in NY - you get attention from virtually every waiter, and they all are quite knowledgeable about the items on the menu. A note - I am not sure what goes for 'dressy' in the UK, but the website (at least when I visited it), strongly implied that a jacket was a good choice for men to wear. And every other guy there was wearing one when we went...so better to be overdressed than underdressed, right?\r\nWe both got the 7-course tasting menu (unless you feel strongly about ordering your own dishes or don't want to shell , do this), which was absolutely delicious. First was a roll with lobster, langoustine, and avocado - absolutely a perfect match of a slightly heavier veggie with small, fresh pieces of tender seafood. Also served on the house were soft-boiled quail eggs that were lightly fried on the outside (they have a richer flavor than the regular eggs from the grocery store) and a cracker with salami inside (tasty!). The amuse bouche was langoustine in a tomato consumme, which was probably one of the more unremarkable dishes of the night (but was still very delicious).\r\nThe main course - fantastic. You get started off with pressed foie gras topped with jelly. I've had foie gras pate before that I was not a fan of, but this was out of this world. The combination with the peach had all the flavors working amazingly together...wow. Second course was seafood ravioli (lobster and langoustine). As with all of the dishes, they aren't large, but you savor each bite, and this tasted great, particularly with the sauce that was added by the waiters (note: the waiters added some kind of sauce, for both food presentation and taste, for almost every dish). The turbot, a fish I don't think I've had before (at least by this name) was delicious - a meatier fish that had 'chicken juice' poured on top that really accentuated the texture of the plate. My only mistake of the meal was ordering the pigeon (hopefully not the ones frequenting the city streets) instead of the lamb, which my girlfriend got. The pigeon was good - very smoky flavor - but the meat was a bit tougher than I would have liked. The lamb was outstanding from the bites I had, and I would recommend it if you're going to do the menu. The cheese selection (I don't know much about cheese, so I let the waiter pick a selection of 5) was delicious but a bit big if you're parsimonious on the cracker-to-cheese ratio: the waiters came around and asked me a few times if i was done. The creme brulee (my girlfriend's selection) was very light, but the highlight is the shot of apple juice (or smoothie, perhaps more appropriately) that adds a blast of fruitiness to the dessert. The mango/passion fruit with whip cream is a nice refresher, but is a little small to warrant being an entire course. The last dessert was delicious, but since I was too far in food heaven by this point, I forget right off what it was (aside from having delicious fruit sorbet in it).\r\nSince it was my girlfriend's birthday, we also got 3 more desserts - a box with pieces of pure chocolate ganache (so rich and so freakin' good...blows away the chocolate shops that sell individual pieces), pieces of Turkish Delight (the weakest link of the extra desserts, but still very good), and pieces of strawberry ice cream covered with frozen chocolate (like a bite-sized ice cream bar, except way better) that was frozen with dry ice...freakin' awesome.\r\nThis put a hurtin' on the wallet (the US conversion came out to $500), but you have to have a food experience like this at least once in your life.

It seems to me that they only book one per table a night, but you get to choose the time.  My friend and I were in the first time slot at 6:30, but many guests were already seated when we arrived.  The entire experience takes a good 2+ hours so plan for that.  There are about ten or twelve tables in a room that was much smaller than I thought.  The decor is really nice.  Not overwhelming and inviting.\r\nThe staff is pretty ridiculous.  I think we sifted through at LEAST 12 different people while we were there.  Not a single dedicated waiter, and everyone took turns refilling water.  (you will be lucky if you get past a couple centimeters without a refill.

He seemed like a French pretentious high class hipster or something, but in a funny way.  Another staff member looked like the muscle straight out of Russia in case anything went awry, he was cool.  Overall, very friendly and courteous staff.\r\nThe food... without a doubt the best I've ever had.  Three stars isn't kidding around.  I had a three course meal.  Scallops, lamb, and souffle.  We were given two separate starters, some sort of hors d'oeuvre finger foods that were amazing, followed by some sort of tomato based soup, but not like you think.  The broth was clear and served with some baby vegetables and prawns I believe.  Very small, just a taste.  The scallops were so good, I could eat that as my meal.  Best I've ever had.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing.  I had a bite of my friend's beef, and I thought it was better than the lamb, but now I'm being picky.  Both were delicious.  Before dessert we were given these mango coolies of some kind with glass straws.  Very refreshing.  The souffle I had, the only one I ever had, was of the banana variety and INCREDIBLE.  I'm not a dessert man at all, but it was freaking GOOD!  Then some finger sweets like Turkish delights and chocolates at the end.  So if I'm not forgetting anything, it's basically seven \"courses\" ... the portions may seem small upon appearance, but when you are finished with everything you leave perfectly satisfied.\r\nI'd recommend this to everyone, but the price tag is no joke.  90 quid each for the a la carte.

Lobster, salmon and langoustine ravioli (this was my daughter's appetizer, so she got an extra large version and it was one of my 7 courses, so I got a slightly smaller version)\r\n6.

The third course was a seared scallop and was lovely but suffered by comparison to our crab.  The fourth course was a chicken and leek gyoza that was excellent in a tasty broth.  The foie gras course came next and was excellent with fresh cherries.  We then moved onto the black cod that was good but set the stage for our main, the lamb.  The lamb was excellent and flavorful.

The vegetable broth was amazingly flavorful, the fish was steamed cooked to perfects, and the ravioli cover gave it a nice touch.\r\nSPECIAL OF THE DAY, PORK FLANK - This isn't on the menu, but it was most definitely the best dish we ordered. The pork was tender and juicy and packed full of flavor. It was one of those dishes that with every bite you take, you roll your eyes back and savor each bite.

I volunteered to organize. Knowing the nature of the people at dinner, I knew I needed to look at the top end of the range - Hakkasan, Galvin Bistrot, sketch, L'Atelier de JR. Amazingly, sketch and this place had seats available - the bosses preferred good food over funky atmosphere, so we settled on L'Atelier. \r\nFree team dinner at Michelin restaurant - yes, please! But oh no, I have some medical restrictions for a few months on alcohol, raw food and delicacies like caviar and foie gras - oh so sad (What a strictly upper middle class first world problem :P)\r\nWe were seated upstairs in a dark gallery with dimmed lighting, stylish decor and a view of the kitchen. We provided plenty of logistical challenges to the restaurant between my dietary constraints and one of the party arriving 45mins late, which upset some of the rhythm of the multi-course menu.\r\nAfter some confusion, we finally placed our orders. The tasting menu comes in 5-/8-courses with two different types of wine pairings (Sommelier's choice vs. French pairings) - we decided to brave the 5-course menu with Sommelier's choice(not for me!)...but as I started reading through the details of the menu, I realised I could have almost none of the courses without replacements, so despite the \"strict\" rules about the entire table ordering the menu, I was allowed by the chef to order off the 'small tasting dishes' menu. The other alternative was to order off the vegetarian tasting menu but frankly, what's the point? \r\nAfter running into foie gras in the most unlikely places, I finally picked 4 small dishes (with dessert to follow!) to keep pace with my colleagues' 5-course menu. A nice balance of veggie, pasta, fish and meat with non-alcoholic drinks.\r\nVerdict:\r\n1) Spiced Carrot Juice - excellent. Light, gingery, quenches thirst perfectly without overwhelming the palate or weighing me down.\r\n2) The amuse bouche with port reduction, egg etc- hmm, oh yes, readied the palate very nicely for a grand meal afterwards\r\n3) Slightly smoked aubergine caviar with vegetables and spicy tomato coulis - Tangy and sour from the tomato coulis, just the way I like it, the aubergine was of a smooth texture with crunchy veggies to balance out the creaminess. I like.\r\n4) Capellini with tomatoes and a m\u00e9li-m\u00e9lo of crunchy Spring vegetables - a cold dish of stringy pasta in tomato sauce presented pleasingly with a range of veggies. This was certainly the most underwhelming dish of the evening for me. It made me wish I had gone for the lamb, cod or crabmeat instead.\r\n5) The Apple Mint Soda took a while to materialise, some chasing was required - I liked the first few sips but soon, it was ghastly in its sweetness and it overpowered my palate and appetite so much that I had to drink water to wash out its flavour before eating\r\n6) John Dory fillet on a tomato reduction with avocado vierge sauce - I hadn't had a dory in a long time, so I enjoyed the dish. It was a bit more-ish which is perfectly fine as I was starting to get a bit full. I would venture to say that a tomato reduction is a fairly strong flavour, not always ideal with fish, but this worked. In the future, I'll keep in mind not to order two dishes (aubergine caviar and this) in the same range of flavours - both dominated by the sourness of tomato\r\n7) Gyoza of braised veal shank with spinach and harissa - This definitely felt like a 'main'. For one, there are 4 substantially sized gyozas where one might expect 2 or 3. Also, the meat is bursting with flavour and tender, so you can't just inhale it without noticing the quantity. The gyoza was made perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. \r\n8) The bread basket was fabulous!\r\nAha, dessert. While the rest had to go with their menu-dictated choice (something boring with raspberry), I could pick from a wide range, and I decided to go for the Warm Guanaja chocolate souffl\u00e9 and Sicilian pistachio ice cream, despite their warnings that it could take 15-20mins. It didn't take that long and oh my gosh, definitely the highlight of the meal! The souffle was the BEST I have had in life. It was light as air, the chocolate was dark and intense, the texture was flawless...I almost didn't notice the pistachio icecream because I couldn't get over the souffle, ooh la la.\r\nI noticed my colleagues enjoyed a wide range of wines from various regions, including an unusual Riesling from Luxembourg. \r\nSo. Why the 4 stars, and not 5? Well, when my dinner costs a small fortune (over 700quid for 4 of us, and I wasn't even drinking), I would like to not feel like I'm inconveniencing the chef through my dietary constraints.

We called a month in advance and still could only get a 9:30 seating. We got there early and were seated in the upstairs lounge drinking very pricey cocktails until our table was ready around 9:45. \r\nA quick note on the lounge as it was quite lovely.  There is an outdoor area with the walls covered in ivy.  Inside are several grouped seating areas- one around a large fireplace with leather sofas and chairs.  We grabbed a corner table relaxing in the club chairs that surrounded it.  Another nice touch?  They put down black napkins for your drinks and adorn them with a red rose petal.  Very classy.\r\nOnce our reservation was called, because there were 4 of us- we were not seated around the kitchen which is the norm (allows patrons to interact with the chefs)- but got one of the very few tables in the place. This place is small. It gives the illusion of being bigger than it is with mirrors on every wall but I think there may have only been 4 or 5 tables in the whole place. Most of the seating is at the counter where you can see the food being prepared sort of Japanese style. \r\nService was SLOW- slow even by European standards (I get that everyone thinks we Americans are always in a rush but we were hungry!) And our server kept commenting on our choices as if we should be ordering something else. \r\nThe menu is broken down into two areas- smal tastings on the left facing page and entree sized portions on the right. But don't think you can share the tastings.. These are little tastes. If you want to share- you need to order more than one- and at these prices . . .it adds up fast. \r\nWe ordered a variety of the tastes: soup, john dory, squid, mini burgers, the salmon (which never came) and the egg cocette. We also ordered the beef tartar from the entree side of the page. While most were good (forget the egg cocette if you want my opinion and order more of the john dory- now that was good!) this was not food I was going to rave to people about. Nor would you be full. Four people split the above and if not for the bread- we would have walked out hungry. \r\nBut since one in our party had been there before- we had a special treat for dessert.

At your table- they then pour hot liquid chocolate over it which causes the shell to break apart and reveal what is inside. This was the highlight of my entire dining experience and truly unique. \r\nI would have a hard time recommending this place to friends as I think for the money there are better places to eat in London.

Even upon entering the interior of the sleek restaurant with Asian-inspired decor, I still had no clue. Let's face it, I googled it just before I began this review. According to the free dictionary (yes, had to use the free one because it turns out places with apostrophes in the name are as expensive as they sound), L'atelier means \"A workshop or studio, especially for an artist or designer.\" It all fell into place when I read that... \r\nWords to describe our experience and the food at L'Atelier: Superb, fabulous, wonderful, delicious, beautiful, surprising, gorgeous, yes-I'll-have-a-dessert-even-though-I'm-full-and-will-be-late-to-my-west-end-show-licious. First off, the service was wonderful. Not stuffy or overly formal, but friendly and extremely professional. I do think the Frenchman delivering our food may have amped up his accent just a bit to play the part of the French waiter, or it could be that in contrast to my ridiculously English boyfriend, it stood out. Disclaimer: The sommelier was also helpful and accommodating with regard to the price range we felt comfortable with. \r\nThe food...scratch that. The Food (yes, it has to be considered a proper noun - it's that good) was spectacular. We began with a rich amuse bouche and a basket of 3 types of wonderful bread - traditional baguette, savoury olive bread and a sweet fig bread. If I could have bought a loaf of each to take home, I would have. We opted for 4 courses. I went a little egg crazy and got a cheese souffl\u00e9, followed by a crispy poached egg served atop parmesan mousse. A CRISPY poached egg! How does that even happen? I was sitting there while they made it in the open kitchen and I still have no idea what frankenstein science was used! All I know is that I want it to happen over and over again. I had duck for the main and it was every bit as delicious as I could have hoped. This is where my only criticism comes though - the orange sauce that came with the duck was far too sweet for my taste and reminded me of a melted down hard candy. I just ate around it and enjoyed the duck in a slightly purer form. I was, however, reminded of the time when my dad was making a \"new recipe\" which was \"orange chicken\" and when we didn't have real orange juice, he used Sunny Delight instead. We ended up eating pizza that night. \r\nMy boyfriend was equally as happy with his dishes - a lobster salad with a very generous portion of lobster, a shitake chicken broth and a 'spit roast of the day,' which happened to be lamb and (surprise) happened to be delicious! We were also given a complimentary pot of the smoothest, creamiest mashed potatoes either of us had ever had. Despite running short of time, we decided to squeeze in dessert because, well, we are greedy, disgusting gluttons but it somehow seems more acceptable when it's not burgers and nachos...

The textures and the sweetness offset the sourness of the apple cocktail beautifully. It was so clean and refreshing on the palate and very well mixed so there wasn't such an alcoholic back draft after each sip.\r\n The Rooftop bar too made all the difference especially in this hot, sultry weather. It was tranquil up there as well as nice and cool. L'Atelier is seriously one sexy place in terms of decor as well as everything else.\r\n If you want to take someone here to impress them then this would be a sure fire way. From the moment you enter the doors to the moment you are seated, the place seems to do a good job in seducing you in every single way.\r\n The food is a great concept too. We opted not to have the tasting menu on account that there was a bit too much Foie Gras in it (3 dishes had it in there) and we wanted to sample the other things a little more.\r\n My only criticism is that I felt that the tasting menu lacked imagination to provide 3 dishes with Foie Gras and before anyone states the obvious, I know it is a French restaurant in essence!\r\n That aside I felt between us we all chose well. We had a crab guacamole which was delicate and very beautifully presented, scallops and squid that were cooked to absolute perfection - I have never had squid melt so gently in my mouth. If this was to be a food erotica gastronomical moment then I would have sent my taste buds to Coco De Mer to be whipped, teased and tingled to a culinary orgasmic afterglow.\r\n There was another scallop dish too which had a baby leek, caviar, gently seasoned seared scallop and a lovely buttery lemon sauce that was like eating a slightly savory equivalent of something like lemon curd. It was delicate and gentle but gently cleansed the palate against the salty caviar. I could have eaten that dish a million times over.\r\n We tried the little hamburgers that had some foie gras and to go with that we had a lovely bottle of Pomerol. It is my absolute favorite red wine ever and it was so smooth it would have given James Bond a run for his money. For our mains we had Black Cod that was divine, some Veal that was beaten and topped with a salad and the veal was so good and so vegetarian friendly that it was more than suitable as a veggie option for one of our open minded members of our party.\r\n We were also served a delightful pot of mash that was so velvety and rich we literally found ourselves licking the pot clean. The french really know how to make potatoes taste good!\r\n We also had cheese, which was nicely ordered and slightly strong that was accompanied by some rather divine walnut bread.\r\n But for me the Chocolate Profiterole with vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell was the most amazing dessert ever. They poured chocolate over a chocolate shell which made the sauce that covered the profiterole and to say it was fantastic would be a complete understatement of the century. I rarely eat chocolate desserts either but this is going down as the best one I have eaten ever!\r\n There was also a yuzu mousse that was zingy and that was accompanied by a raspberry sorbet as well as a rum baba and meringue sphere that was accompanied by a 'multivitamin' sorbet which I suppose was there to make the diner feel a sense of some health after consuming the delicious calories offered.\r\n But saying that when you go for a dining experience like that it is about the food and the calorie counts will go out of the window.\r\n I would definitely go back again and it was certainly a graduation to remember!", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "Jo\u00ebl Robuchon is kind of a big deal, as he's pretty much the most well-respected chef of his generation and was named \"Chef of the Century.\" He's got restaurants all over the world, most of which have one or two Michelin stars. The two-starred London location is right by Piccadilly Circus, and upon arriving for my 1:30 pm seating, I took a seat at the bar, which is set right in front of the open kitchen. After placing my orders for the \u00a328, three-course lunch prix fixe menu, I was served an amuse bouche, which is another thing about fine dining that appeals to my inner cheapass (more food!). Consisting of a spoonful of a potato-fish pur\u00e9e, the amuse bouche tasted very much like a white fish spread, and it was a tasty first bite. Served a bread basket consisting of white, wheat, and olive breads, I found myself going back for the olive bread again and again. I must have gone through four or five pieces of the olive bread before my meal was done; that's how good it was. And also because, well, unlimited bread!\r\nFor my first course, I went with what the waitress described as one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Described as \"Egg cocotte topped with light wild mushrooms cream,\" this dish was mind-blowingly good, and it's no wonder that it is a signature dish. A soft-poached egg nestled in a bath of creamy soup along with mushrooms and asparagus slivers, this was the highlight of the meal and had me using bread to sop up every last drop of soup.\r\nMy entr\u00e9e, described as \"Razor clams fricassee with confit tomatoes, sweet onion, and macaroni,\" (pictured at top) was like a refined version of a pasta dish that you'd find at The Cheesecake Factory. I don't say that to slight the dish, but it just wasn't as creative or elaborate as the other courses I enjoyed. The creamy sauce actually tasted very similar to a vodka sauce, and the razor clams were cooked nicely. While I usually am not a huge fan of cilantro, I found the cilantro-bread crumb mixture on the razor clam shell to be quite refreshing.\r\nFor dessert, I ordered the \"Fresh strawberry and pistachio cream cake with mascarpone ice cream.\" The beautifully-presented dish was just as appealing to the taste buds as to the eyes, as the moist interior of pistachio cake was really quite tasty, especially when paired with the fresh strawberries and sweet ice cream. I wasn't particularly crazy about the outer pastry layer, which I found to be a bit tough, but everything else about the dessert was superb.\r\nWalking away from my meal at L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, I can say that I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and service, which was friendly and helpful throughout the lunch. Okay, so perhaps the restaurant would be better served by not applying foam to nearly every dish, and \u00a328, or about $45, is definitely close to the maximum amount for how much I'd be willing to pay for a three-course lunch prix fixe, but all in all, I was quite pleased with my lunch. Whereas Restaurant Week prix fixes tend to be disappointing and underwhelming, year-round prix fixe deals at restaurants like L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon mean that there's no need to fight the crowds and muck your way through mediocre food.

We went to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon back in March when we were first getting our feet wet in the London food scene.  Of course, I've been writing and rewriting the review, and it's been sitting unfinished in my account for nearly a year now--what can I say, I have an amazing talent for procrastination.  I wasn't sure (am still not sure) that I can do our experience the justice it deserves.  So, without further ado... my best London food experience of 2010.\r\nThe hubs and I made a pact that our time in London is going to be one of great experiences.  Chalk the first one up for Mr. Robuchon, one of the greatest culinary minds in the world.  We went to London's L'Atelier for my birthday in March. My husand has been to the one in Tokyo several times, and absolutely adores it.  We were seated near the far end of the sleek and sexy bar on the ground floor.  I was a little perturbed that we hadn't been seated in the empty seats smack in the middle of all the action.  My mind was quickly changed.\r\nNearly every seat at the bar has an amazing view into the kitchen.  Sitting to my right was a very well dressed Frenchman chatting it up with the sommelier.  Next came another European couple that took the two seats next to my husband.  Both impeccably dressed... the girl about twenty and the man somewhere in his late-40's.  Of course, I suspected the worst.  But after a couple glasses of champagne, we discovered that they were actually father and daughter, and the guy was Robuchon's business partner.  At which point, Robuchon made an appearance from the rear of the kitchen. He chatted with us for a few minutes. We mainly discussed the amazingness of the Chicago dining scene (he's tried repeatedly to open a place in Chicago to no avail--please keep trying! is all I have to say to that).\r\nAt this point, the evening becomes a fairly booze-fueled, and rather surreal experience.  We started the meal with the menu decouverte with the wine pairings.  This, however, was derailed after a few courses, because having made friends with the Monegasque father-daughter pair and the impeccably dressed Frenchman, who turned out to be one of Robuchon's most regular customers on the face of the planet--hey, if I could afford it, I'd make this place my own personal Cheers, too!--suggestions on what to try were made.  And wow, best, recommendations, ever! \r\nWe ate rounds of butter-laden mashed potatoes and wondefully divine truffle dishes. The Frenchman was our ticket into samples of amazing, 20-year-old, first-growths served by the awesome Bulgarian sommelier. Of course, then he introduced me to \"Francois' Yuzu Souffle\". There really is nothing sexier than a Frenchman talking about souffles. And of course, Robuchon's pastry chef, Francois is a super crazy diva--a man diva, but a diva nonetheless. The man wears sunglasses in the restaurant and hits on the gorgeous women sitting at the bar in his spare time. Like I said, man diva. Anyway, it was one of the best things I have ever consumed. Done so perfectly, it was absolutely incredible. I cannot even do it justice talking about it. You'll just have to try it for yourself. \r\nBy the end of the evening we had an open invitation to hang out in Monaco; a Polaroid with Joel Robuchon, that my husband proudly displays on his desk at work; and a bill that could have been far worse than it was (it was still the most expensive meal I've ever eaten). It was hands-down the best dining experience I've had in London so far. And while I can't promise anyone else the same experience, it is still my favorite fine dining restaurant in London, and my first recommendation to out-of-towners looking for a great experience.

How else would one be able to regularly dine at Michelin starred restaurants in London without for instance being a stock broker (before the credit crunch) or a professional footballer? One of these restaurants is L'Atelier de Joel Robouchon in the middle of the theatre district in Covent Garden just next to The Ivy which offers a 2 course set menu for 22 pounds, 3 courses for 27 pounds. The French chef Joel Robouchon who has achieved more Michelin stars than any other chef (25 if Wikipedia is to be believed) has restaurants all over the globe. Two of these stars are held by the London joint of L'Atelier Joel Robouchon. So believe me  my expectations were higher than high and I was looking forward to a stunning meal.\r\n The restaurant is impressively beautiful. The elegant and stylish dining area is dimly lit and decorated in a red and black theme (I was not so sure about the apples in the big bowl (see below) but what do I know about interior decoration?). There are high tables and bar stools and, around the central kitchen area, patrons are seated at the counter and can watch the chefs preparing their dishes.\r\n Sometimes the service in high end restaurants can be a bit patronizing but the service at L'Atelier Joel Robouchon was absolutely perfect. Obliging and polite and, when they brought as the wrong main course, three people came one after the other to apologise (which was maybe slightly over the top). Also a very nice touch was that, when the wine we had ordered was not available, the somelier exchanged it with a (very delicious) cheaper one. Even though we 'only' had the pre-theater menu, they did not rush us at all to leave after we had finished.\r\n Unfortunately the food was not as enjoyable and exceptional as I had expected. Of the 3 starters and 3 mains to choose from a very autumn-style, mushroom-based menu we commenced our meal with Egg Cocotte Topped with Wild Mushroom Cream. The soft-boiled egg was at the bottom of the glass topped with a very tasty mushroom cream. It was nice but did not blow me away and I did not like the consistency too much.\r\n The second starter also embraced the autumn theme: Wild mushrooms served with Puff Pastry consisted of perfectly cooked, delectable wild mushrooms on light pastry. This was rather enjoyable dish but again not terribly special.\r\n We choose two different mains: RS really liked The Razor Clams served with White Wine Emulsion and Leek Fondue. I only had a small taste of it, far too much dill for my liking.\r\n The Crunchy chicken breast with Curry Sauce and Pilaw Rice was rather mediocre. The nicely cooked chicken was too salty and the combination of elements of chicken katsu curry and the Indian influences of the Pilaw rice were not convincing, especially for a 2 star restaurant.\r\n Now the question is  if you have a pre-theatre/ good value set menu in a Michelin star restaurant, would you expect the set menu to be of the same quality as the a la carte? I do, and L'Atelier Joel Robouchon did not deliver. Does this mean now I have to save and go back to try the a la carte (assuming that the Michelin inspectors know their job)? Or do I just give up on old Joel?", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was the best thing that happened to my fiance and I on our recent visit to London. The best thing that happened in our dining experience, that is. Being the foodies that we are, we did alot of research before we embarked on our trip and part of the process involved making reservations at must-eat places before we left Chicago for London. Needless to say, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was in our must-eat places.\r\nWe were seated at the bar. Actually, it's not really a bar either since you're not sitting in front of the bartender, but it's a high top counter that allows you to see all the action going on in the kitchen. What a fantastic experience seeing the kitchen crew prepping appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had baked clams with minced garlic and mushrooms and the clams were served on a thick bed of sea salt. I ordered an entree of spaghetti which will make you think, \"What?! You ordered spaghetti in a 2-Michelin star restaurant? How boring!\" But wait til you hear what the spaghetti came with: sea urchin! Sea urchin and spaghetti = divine. I've only had sea urchin sashimi-style in sushi restaurants and have always loved it. And now having sea urchin Joel Robuchon-style tops it all. The sea urchin was used to make the creamy and there were also bite-size pieces of sea urchin hidden in the sauce. When I bit into it, the texture reminded me of foie gras. I think they don't always have sea urchin on the menu because it seems like they constantly change what goes into the spaghetti. My fiance had fried langoustine, duck liver pate, and octopus salad which he all loved very much. For dessert, we shared the Rum Baba which was absolutely divine. The sponge cake was soaked with rum that you can actually taste very well. in fact, the rum was pretty strong. This was what stood out for me because it's not one of those desserts that claim to have liqueur in it although you can't really taste it. We also got Irish coffee to go with dessert. They have several types of alcoholic coffee drinks, depending on the several countries of origin of whiskeys they offer.\r\nThe service was excellent.

I have to say that it was the best flat iron steak I've ever had EVER!  It was tender, juicy, and well flavored.  I could tell that they used very simple ingredients to season the meat because the natural taste of the steak was preserved and didn't get over overpowered by the seasonings they used.  The potato gratin was very delicious as well.  It was very creamy and cheesy, yummy!  At last, they served this chocolate mousse/ice cream thing for dessert.

Hands down. \r\nSketch was worth every single penny. During my recent trip to London, me and my girls knew that we had to have high tea. It was almost my birthday and my friend had recently just gotten a promotion, so we were in the mood to spend $$ and celebrate. Enter Sketch. \r\nSketch has 5 different dining rooms, each with their own \"special\" experience and theme. Room 1: The Glade - Enchanted forest themed, specializing in lunch and cocktails. Room 2: The Gallery - Brasserie/All Pink Everything, specializing in afternoon high tea and dinner. Room 3: The Parlour, specializing in all day dining + live music and cocktails, Room 4: The Lecture Room - a Michelin star restaurant, specializing in lunch and dinner menus. Room 5: The East Bar/Pods/Bathrooms - a small modern space themed bar, also the bathrooms. \r\nWe dined in Room 2: The Gallery for high tea. Immediately upon walking in you're taken aback by the beautiful pink decor and cute watercolour art on the walls. There are servers walking around in different uniforms, each with their own specific duty - \"caviar man\", \"tea expert\", and \"champagne lady\" to name a few. \r\nOur tea lady/main server came by and explained the menu to us. She asked if we wanted to upgrade our teas to a champagne tasting, and at that point, we said \"sure, why not?\". And so we upgraded. \r\nFor teas, they had a large selection of delicious teas from around the globe. Along with the champage, we each got our own pot of tea. I sampled two different ones: a Sri Lankan Earl Grey and an Indian Chai. To be honest, I can't pick between the two. Both were the best teas I've ever tried. No joke. Added a little bit of milk and sugar to them and was truly blown away. And to think this was just the teas. \r\nOn to my favourite part: the food. First, we had an appetizer: sea salt and butter breadsticks with caviar and quail eggs. I have never had caviar before, but I have to say, I was impressed. I see why people eat this stuff all the time. Paired with the creamy quail egg and breadsticks, I was in foodie heaven. Second, the mains: unlimited finger sandwiches, cakes, and treats. I can't even remember everything that was there, but I do know that I love everything that I tried. My two favourites: the curried chicken sandwich and the salmon and cream cheese roll. I had to get more of these because I loved them so much. I have much more of a savoury palette than sweet, so I preferred all the sandwiches to the cakes. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the cakes. The blueberry cake was my favourite! At this point we were so full and we had completely forgotten that we had a third course: scones and more cakes. We all opted for the plain scones, paired with butter and your choice of strawberry or plum jam. I'm not the biggest fan of jam, so I just stuck to the good ol' butter. I wish I had more room for this because it was SO good. \r\nOne of my favourite parts about this experience? The bathrooms. You go through a pair of doors and up the stairs. When you look up the ceiling is covered in neon-coloured square lights. The bathrooms itself... are eggs pods. With each egg pod being one bathroom stall. Truly one of the best (and fanciest) peeing experiences I've had to date. \r\nAll in all, I loved every single minute of dining at Sketch.

The four sandwiches were a mix of devil's egg, smoke salmon, cucumber, and curry. The small plate was filled with delicate creativity and the taste blended well.

We were in The Gallery (so I can only really speak for that), which is the most famous room of theirs (they have four main rooms). There's pink furniture and decor everywhere, and interesting/cool art on the walls. It's also very clean and pristine. I love it. Also, the iconic bathroom is super cool. So if you don't know about it, check it out if you go because it is an experience -- egg-shaped toilet stalls, colorful lights -- take an iconic mirror picture. So yeah, the atmosphere is definitely supreme. 4/5\r\nSELECTION: So we went during dinner time when they serve their \"a la Carte\" menu, and not their famous afternoon tea menu. So the menu is fairly small, but I do appreciate the few labeled vegan options. However, I wish there was more, or at least a better/more unique variety, rather than a salad, a soup-type dish, and a tofu dish. Also, I was going to order the salad, but was told that I couldn't unless at least one other person ordered it too, I guess? That was a bit of a disappointment, but I dealt with the soup-type dish -- more on that below. 3/5\r\nWHAT I GOT: I got their \"Green Le Puy lentils, button mushrooms, snow peas\" dish. It was basically like a soup. It comes out as a shallow bowl of lentils, mushrooms, and peas, but then they pour some sort of broth thing over it right in front of you. It was alright overall, but definitely not anything worth raving about. I liked that it wasn't oily or salt. And, the ingredients tasted fresh and good quality. But, it was very small and not filling. They make it seem like a bigger portion by serving it in a larger looking bowl, but it's actually super shallow, so it's literally like half a cup's worth. I know it's a nice, fancy dining establishment, but it's a ripoff to pay \u00a320 for no more than like half of cup of veggies. They should at least put like some grains in it or use a deeper bowl to make it more sustaining. That's my opinion on the dish. 3/5\r\nSERVICE: The staff seemed nice, but their service was kind of awkward. First off, when I went to the front desk to say that I had a reservation, the man said to wait five minutes and then come back to ask again. I came back five minutes later and still had to wait a bit, but then we were finally seated a few minutes later. Ok, so that wasn't too bad, but then it's confusing when you're seated because you have a waiter/waitress, and then a drink person to take drink orders. But, they don't really explain that. Anyways, after figuring that out, the waitress we had would either hover around our table or disappear throughout our dinner, which was strange. Or we'd be talking about the menu and she'd keep coming over, like asking if we had questions and whatnot a bunch. On to the drinks guy: one person I was with with ordered a Pimm's. Normally, you'd expect that when you order a Pimm's, you get the drink with the Pimm's, lemonade, and fruits. However, a glass of straight Pimm's, the straight liquor, came out. We tried Googling it, and found that the only thing it could be called was a Pimm's Cup, so we looked for someone who looked like they maybe knew about drinks better, and found a young guy. After explaining the situation and the different names and all that, he seemed to understand what we were expecting because about 5-10 minutes later it finally came out as expected ... I mean, whenever I've been to pubs and whatnot in the city, there were no questions asked, and a Pimm's comes out properly, with the lemonade and fruits mixed in. Maybe we're missing something and at nicer places you have to call them Pimm's Cups? Anyways, that was our experience with the staff/service.

We only had a few days in London and we searched all over months in advance to make reservations at spots that seemed worthwhile to us. We thought it would be fun to dine in an art gallery after visiting the Tate Modern, and in that regard we were right. \r\nThe gallery atmosphere of sketch is absolutely mesmerizing, with not a single detail ignored. It features the witty and comical art of David Shrigley on the walls and within the dining fixtures themselves, brightly-colored pink chairs, and the famous toilet pods (which I'm convinced are a large reason for many of their visitors' 5-star reviews). The atmosphere is incredible and warranted at least 2 stars.

That's fine, but based on the dramatic price increase we didn't realize that.

The three tiers of savories and sweets for the tea *looked* absolutely beautiful, but there were only a couple of items that actually wowed us with their flavor while the others seemed like whimsical placeholders that tasted dull and unimpressive. \r\nService was questionably slow and disjointed, which made no sense because we often saw wait staff just hanging around chatting with one another. We placed our tea order about an hour before we received it...long after our 3-tier snacks were consumed. This was frustrating. Flagging someone down was nearly impossible even though it was a Tuesday and the place was relatively empty. There was a live strings trio playing music that did NOT fit the vibe of the establishment at all. And that kind of helps to sum up our whole experience...I couldn't decide what vibe or what identity sketch was serving up to me, and I think somewhere with such a unique image should have a well-defined concept with background music that matches, service that is at least satisfactory, and food that blows you away. \r\n\u00a3300 later we were still hungry and largely unimpressed by the food and tea we had consumed.

They referred us to an independent consultant. That consultant asked what else we had eaten and if we had been to a doctor. As we noted earlier, both people had eaten other things, but not together, so it is extremely unlikely that it was anything but Sketch that made them sick. We made this point to the consultant.

If you're wanting to add a little extra you can pay a 20\u00a3 (ish) extra per person and get champagne added to the experience.

We asked to have a drink at the bar because we were early for our reservation. I had the Cable Car (I think that's what it was called) and it was delicious. It smelt strange because of the egg, but it was quite tasty and very flavorful. \r\nAfter I finished my drink, we went back out into the main hallway and were escorted through a roped off set of stairs up to the restaurant. The door was opened for us and our chairs pushed in at the table. We were seated in the room closest to the street. The chairs were incredibly comfortable and the ambiance was nice. It was quiet and nobody was ever very loud. I did feel like I had to speak more softly than normal, despite the distance across from my boyfriend being rather wide. \r\nI ordered the vegetarian tasting menu, while my boyfriend ordered the regular tasting menu. Both had the same amount of courses and the same timing, although mine was about 20-30 pounds cheaper. We were offered champagne but we declined. This was our first ever Michelin experience and we were very excited to start trying the food. \r\nEach course was mostly timed well. It gave us time to digest in between, although toward the end we were so full it became hard to finish the courses. Rather than go through every course we had, I'll just speak in generalities. \r\nBefore eating, I had expected that this would be one of the most flavorful and best meals of my life.  While the courses were indeed flavorful, none of them blew my mind. I hardly do fine dining, but I can still recognize amazing flavors and great taste.

We waited quite a long time between the last course, the desserts, and the petit fours. \r\nAlso, after we were clearly finished with the final petit fours, we sat around and waited for 30-40 minutes to get our check. That really was the worst part of the evening, as it was nearing midnight and we were ready to leave. It's like everyone just checked out and forgot about us.

Any additional cocktails or champagne is outside of the set price.\r\nDon't under estimate the sandwiches and desserts! It's all very filling! The pesto panini is the only warm sandwich on the menu, so it's suggested that you eat it first. Service is oddly quick. The scones are wonderfully crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The earl grey macarons are great too. My favorite sandwiches were the panini and the salmon with cream. If you happen to like more than the rest, you can ask for more! We sure did with the panini sandwiches. \r\nFor anyone booking late in the afternoon, tables have to be returned by 18:00.

I actually had to do a double-take as she stood even taller than me, wearing 4-inch platform heels, cropped trousers, statement necklace, bright lips and a completely bald head. I had to stifle an embarrassing gasp as she stepped out of nowhere, almost android-like, and referred to her iPad. I was simultaneously relieved I'd made an effort with my own outfit and excited about seeing the rest of the place after this start.\r\nIt didn't let me down - we were seated in the outer garden-themed room by the bar, which was open and airy thanks to the skylight and decorated with leafy vines and greenery.

The sandwiches were fine but over quickly and it's two tiers of sweet tooth heaven from then on. The key component to impress me on is always the scones, which arrived separately and were fabulously soft-not-crumbly here and nicely warmed through, with generous amounts of clotted cream (always a must). After that, the third dessert chapter was also delicious, but - and I can't believe I'm saying this - possibly too much?! There's 2 full tiers of little cakes and dessert pots which are all so incredibly sweet that it's difficult for even a seasoned after tea-er like myself to finish everything they offer you, let alone any refills.\r\nThe service was attentive and friendly throughout, and I was glad we were seated in the light garden room, particularly when I walked through the larger inner room which had a different feel completely - more cave-like and much dimmer. That walk led me to the now-legendary toilets here, which reminded me of that scene in Godzilla when Matthew Broderick finds the eggs in Madison Square Garden. Only with multi-coloured lights on the ceiling and very bright white 'eggs'. In fact each pod is a toilet cubicle complete with its own sound system - mine seemed to be playing an old radio broadcast whilst my sister's played animal noises. It's a little confusing (still not sure whether there's separate guy/girl pods) but makes going to the loo an adventure in itself!\r\nIt all added to the slightly wacky arty vibe that shows they have a sense of humour behind all the serious art on the walls, and meant we were very happy to while away a few hours sipping tea refills, people-watching the very well put together crowd, and trying to find more dessert stomach space.

We dined for afternoon tea in the Gallery in September 2015.\r\nI originally intended to have dinner at the Gahban O'Keeffee-designed, two-Michelin-Star rated Lecture Room & Library, menu devised by the renowned Chef Pierre Gagnaire, yet an evening reservation with Dinner by Heston Blumenthal overruled. Nevertheless, I am ecstatic with my decision to have afternoon tea in the ethereal Gallery.\r\nThe pastel-pink color scheme and eclectic wall art made for great conversation. The prix-fixe afternoon tea menu featured a nice selection of tea choices, along with assorted finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries. This is an ideal venue to relax and catch up with friends over the course of an afternoon. See below for a more complete review.\r\nReservations:\r\nHaving originally held a booking for dinner in the Lecture Room and Library, we decided an afternoon affair would better suit our schedule; I made a booking for late afternoon tea. \r\nD\u00e9cor:\r\nSketch is located on the lovely Conduit Street. Upon noticing the oversized menu and illuminated red Sketch sign, we made our way inside and walked on a hopscotch board outlined on the floor-- I knew the afternoon would be filled with fun and good food. The soign\u00e9 hostesses greeted us with exceedingly pleasant vibes and lead us to the Gallery.\r\nOur eyes immediately met the vibrant pastel pink walls and couches. The walls are also covered in art by David Shrigley-- examining each would take quite a while, but I encourage you to look closely and carefully-- some are more interesting and risqu\u00e9 than others. This overall nouveau style created a chic setting for an enjoyable afternoon.\r\nTea Selections:\r\nThere are opportunities to order and sample a variety of teas. As with most afternoon teas, selections include green, black, white, oolong, herbal, and puerh. The teapots and cups feature intriguing thoughts and words.\r\nFinger Sandwiches, Scones, and Pastries:\r\nSome of my favorites include the cucumber and ricotta sandwich, sultana scone with traditional clotted cream or strawberry and fig jam, and chocolate mint cake. By the end of the afternoon, you'll hardly be able to finish the selections, even though the staff will continually bring more of whichever item you desire.\r\nService:\r\nThe staff was pleasant, yet in typical British fashion, maintain an overall hands-off approach, which allowed us to enjoy the afternoon with minimal interruptions.\r\nSummary:\r\nWe had a fantastic time enjoying Afternoon Tea at Sketch. From the splendid, unique d\u00e9cor to the delicious selection of finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, Sketch provides an enjoyable afternoon outing. While most likely no longer a secret, you must visit the bathroom or, as they referred to in the UK, the toilet or water closet-- the egg-shaped pods and psychedelic rainbow roof elevate the overall Sketch experience. \r\nMy Recommendation:\r\nGo. While Afternoon Tea at Claridge's is still the ultimate afternoon tea experience in my opinion (see my review on Claridge's London), Sketch offers a great selection of afternoon treats and teas amidst an intriguing atmosphere. I will certainly return for tea in the Gallery; I also hope to return for dinner in the Lecture Room & Library. 4 Stars\r\nMichelin Stars: Two (2015)", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "Sketch is a collection of fancy toilets conveniently located nearby a restaurant.\r\nFor anyone who is not familiar with sarcasm, it's a restaurant with fancy toilets.\r\nSketch is definitely an experience.

Of course you've got the tea to choose from.  Lots of tea choices. All good.  You've also got a variety of cakes they bring out... probably had my week's worth of sugar in that meal but all worth trying out.  Their finger sandwiches are very unique - for example their egg sandwich had a very small sunny side up egg on each sandwich. Nice attention to detail.  The scones were available afterwards (not much space on the table as there were 3 of us) and they came out warm with jam and clotted cream. Very tasty and above average for the food tasted.\r\nI would expect paying close to 30 quid for tea the service would be exceptional.  If I compare to other Afternoon Tea establishments for at other luxury hotels for roughly the same price the service is sub-par.  For example, tea was provided but not poured.

This one is worth a visit.

The tea (\u00a339 a head) is in a room that is head-to-toe pink - it feels overwhelmingly like you're sitting in a blancmange prison. Everyone mentions the toilets, which are startling and apparently modelled on a Hollywood version of a celestial waiting room (or an Austin Powers set) with wall-to-wall white, individual egg shaped pods (mine didn't seem to quite seal itself, meaning I had to keep a paranoid grip on the door handle for fear of becoming a victim of latrinus interruptus) and the inexplicable inclusion of loo attendants in full French maid kit. \r\nThe sandwiches are petite and with the exception of the salmon and caviar offering (whose caviar topping offers a welcome burst of intense flavour), sadly rather tame in the flavour department. The asparagus in the cucumber sandwich lacked any seasoning whatsoever, and the mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur was surprisingly greasy and tasteless.\r\nThe scones and cream were probably the best thing about the whole meal - the scones are large and came to the table still warm, albeit with not quite enough clotted cream to go round. The fig jam was also delicious (and I say that as someone with a long time antipathy towards jam in general). \r\nThe cake selection is disappointingly free of British flavours and the cakes themselves are horrifyingly small - the coffee eclair was about the size of my little finger (and I have relatively slim digits) and the raspberry meringue...let's just say I've seen bigger engagement rings.

We were led past the velvet rope, up the stair case and went past a few heavy curtains to arrive at The Lecture Room where our table was waiting.\r\nTheir surroundings are just what I want to see in this kind of restaurant.  Rich, colourful carpets and decorations flowing with luxury.  Comfy seats.  Dining here is an experience. The service was friendly and efficient, not stuffy. They made some jokes with us, which makes a nice difference.  We also got a mini menu to take home with us.  Another nice touch.\r\nWe opted for the 7 course tasting menu. There was a vegetarian tasting menu and a la carte options available too.\r\nBreads. Served in a bowl, warm and crusty, but there was only one type of bread. There were two butters: citrus and a regular one.  The citrus one didn't quite sit right, it tasted like you were eating a lemon creme biscuit.\r\nAmuse bouches.  A mini macaron with blue cheese cream, a disc of goat cheese and a mini roll which tasted like melon.  There was also a little bowl of crunchy parmesan bites.\r\nEarth and sea 3. Great contrasts of flavours and textures. Looked like a raviolo, but it was a blanket of cuttlefish over the other ingredients (squid, pineapple and crunchy fennel). I liked the look of the mini lettuce filled with crab meat.\r\nCrayfish served with onion and turmeric jus. Came with spelt which gave the disk a nice texture.  The crayfish was obviously the hero of the dish and were tasty morsels.\r\nPascaline.  I'm not sure what pascaline is (!) but this dish was firmly based around scallops, which I love.  We had fried scallops and fresh (raw) mushrooms on top of a scallop mousse and a mushroom sauce.  It tasted just as it sounds. I liked the scallop mousse the most.\r\nHake, Savoy cabbage and razor clams. Nicely cooked fish and cabbage, I liked the clams. They were like prizes. The crumb coating on the fish tasted like lawn, which is not a bad thing.\r\nJellied sardine, fois gras, celeriac, frozen raspberries. This was the most interesting looking dish of the night, with the huge cubes of jelly and the star-shaped dish.  Unfortunately, it was not entirely my cup of tea, but it had solid flavours.  It felt like a lot of sardine jelly to get through.  I would have preferred simply fried sardines, but I could see how this may have been too close in nature to the previous course.\r\nHereford beef fillet, with turnip gratin and crispy aubergine.  The beef was cooked nicely, but for me the most interesting part was the cripsy vegetable chip on top.\r\nPierre Gagnaire's Grand Dessert.

The opulent townhome has served as the headquarters for the Royal Society of British Architects, the atelier of Christian Dior, and is currently home to the 2 star Michelin-rated French restaurant run by Executive Chef, Pierre Gagnaire.\r\nEven if French food isn't your cup of tea, if your pockets are deep enough, I suggest that you at least pay a visit to check out the unique ambiance. The d\u00e9cor is parallel to none; with each room in the space taking you on a journey that is evocative of trippy dream. There are three different dining rooms--each one offering a different menu and price point--as well as two ultra posh cocktail lounges. The whole venue is a riot of color and an onslaught to the senses. But the loud and quirky design makes this Michelin restaurant feel, dare I say, comfortable?!\r\nAfter studying all of the menus, I chose to dine at the Gallery, which is the more informal restaurant space with more reasonably priced menu items. British artist, Martin Creed, has transformed the space into a serviceable museum of modern art with eclectic chairs and one-of-a-kind dinnerware.\r\nTo start, I ordered the Chestnut Velout\u00e9 with white truffle oil, and pan-fried squid saut\u00e9ed with garlic and cherry tomatoes (\u00a315). It was velvety, rich, and every bit delicious. I cleared the bottom of my bowl with the trio of freshly baked breads that were brought to the table (\u00a34).\r\nThe second appetizer that I tried was the Dublin bay prawn tempura with haricot beans and aubergine, accompanied by an Osframpi sauce (\u00a325). The prawns were delicious but sadly, there were only three of them--typical French portions! I didn't expect the vegetables would also be deep fried, and I found them a bit bourgeois in contrast to the otherwise haute cuisine. The osframpi sauce was magical, however, due in part to the fact that I've never tasted one before. Essentially, it is a puree of wild berries balanced with some sort of lemon acidity to cut the sweetness. I did not use it for the prawns, but rather as a spread for the breadbasket.\r\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Cannon of lamb roasted en cr\u00e9pine, Ni\u00e7oise socca, swiss chard pomponette (\u00a328). The lamb was cooked to perfection and the sauce dressing the plate was to die for, but I have had better cuts of meat before. I cleared the plate none-the-less, which easy to do at a French restaurant--oftentimes in just two bites!\r\nThere was little hesitation when it came to choosing a dessert; naturally, I opted for the chocolate one: Sketch Chocolat, which is a dark chocolate box filled with vanilla cream, nougatine, dried fruits, caramel syrup and coffee genoise. On the side, of the box was a little shooter filled with pistachio ice cream with pineapple and mango coulis (\u00a310). I also got the suggested after-dinner drink, The Whisk Away, made with Laphroaig Whisky and Kalua (\u00a37). The coffee notes in the dessert and cocktail complimented one another beautifully.\r\nAll in all, Sketch is about the experience: the art, the atmosphere, the service, the exotic bathrooms!

There's the Parlour where I believe they have afternoon tea, the Gallery, in which we sat and ate and gawked and marveled, upstairs is the Lecture Room which boasts a Michelin star.  There are also a couple smaller bar areas, one of which looks like you stepped into a fairy tale forest, and another which I unfortunately didn't discover!\r\nThe decor in the Gallery is everything I could ever aspire to dream of in a future home.

It's a feast for the eyes.\r\nNo complaints about the food or drink either.  I had the Chantilly Lace as a starter which is basically lobster bisque with a tiny tower of tri-colored rice in the middle which was black rice (squid ink), red pepper rice, and regular basmati rice.  It was fantastically delicious.  Roast leg of lamb main, which was basically tiny chunks of lamb with bean and a gorgeous broth, and the \"Lemon\" for dessert.  It's just called \"Lemon.\"  And it delivers on the name.  Again, every plate is a carefully constructed work of art.  I wish I could shake the hand of that pastry chef because man, was that Lemon something to see.\r\nAs we were leaving, a gentleman caught me and a friend gawking at the art (which we found it is commissioned specifically for Sketch), and quickly started telling us how he'd worked there for years and Sketch was his passion and he very nicely showed us around to the rest of the building!  He snuck us upstairs to the Lecture Room and let us peek in, told us the history of the building (it used to be the House of Dior), and told us more about the art and showed us the equally spectacular bathrooms on the upper floor which are meant to be the inside of a jewelry box.  Quite the contrast from the crazy insane egg-pod bathrooms near the Gallery (all bathrooms attended by ladies in stereotypical \"french maid\" outfits, bee tee dubs).\r\nMy only complaint is that they were completely out of their famed hot chocolate!

It was close to \u00a350 for an old fashioned, and while it was with really rare bourbon, it seemed a bit too expensive. So the other half asked if he could order a drink from downstairs. He was told no. He was told he could go downstairs and get one, but they wouldn't make one upstairs nor bring it up for him. (Annoying). He went downstairs. The maitre d' saw him going downstairs. He was with other people, but eventually caught up and told him that they would take the drink to him upstairs. And they comped him because he should never have been told to go downstairs and get it. The comp was nice, but it was annoying he had to go down and ask for it in the first place.\r\nAt the table, we were told we couldn't use both the voucher and the promo code. Which made no sense.

Really two-Michelin star restaurant? Plastic? I also had a bone or plastic in my fish as well. Two courses in a row? It's annoying (and puzzling). The chicken curry was fantastic. They really enjoy giving you two or three dishes at once. (Or in the case of dessert, SIX. Yes we had six different tiny plates surrounding each of us. My other half was overwhelmed and felt rushed to eat it because it was all there at once.) And they liked to whisk the plates away at random times. I'm used to dining in the UK where they take plates away all at once, but the constant whisking away of plates was a bit unnerving. The hot chocolate was good, very good. Not the best I've ever had to be honest. Given that good chocolate is fairly new to the UK, I can understand why people would think it's the best. I'd have it again to be sure, but I've had far better in the States. The seaweed butter was to die for though. I've never had it, and I kind of fell in love with it. We ran out early, and had to ask for more. Irritatingly. We were almost out of butter and they kept bringing us bread. It's not hard to notice that more butter was required.\r\nThe wine. It was really good. So good we do what we often do and see if we can find it to have at home (because wine at home is usually about half the price. There's a markup, I get it, I don't mind paying double for a bottle when you're at a restaurant). We couldn't find it anywhere in the UK, but they were about \u20ac15 a bottle on the mainland. Now I'm pretty good at math, but you don't really need to be great to figure out prices. I know it's more expensive for booze in the UK (thank you taxes), so \u20ac15 a bottle equates to about \u00a325-30 a bottle in shops in the UK. Now double that, it's pretty standard at a restaurant. That's about \u00a350-60 a bottle if you're out. Now these wines were about \u00a375-90 a bottle. That's a triple markup. I shouldn't be surprised since they were selling glasses of Balfour sparkling wine for \u00a330 a glass. I can get it at home for about \u00a340 a bottle. Do the math. Six times \u00a340 is \u00a3240 pounds. That's way more than a triple markup. Triple markups are a bit too much for my liking.\r\nThe decor is pretty fab though. All the rooms are decorated differently and you can tell they spent a lot of work making it look the way it does. The big cushy seats in the Lecture room were also great for eating dinner in!\r\nSo overall, I had a good time, the food was good. The service needed a lot of work (so very surprised with the two-Michelin star rating). It seemed the servers needed a lot more training to understand what Michelin star service should entail.

What finally got me here was it being the 1st stop of the Mayfair chocolate tour as Sketch is reputed to have the best hot chocolate in London.\r\nVerdict? Yep definitely some of the best hot chocolate I've ever had, and by far the best in London. It's rich, creamy, full of deep chocolate flavour, but light enough not to weigh you down. It comes in posh porcelain tea cups which is a little odd as I consider hot chocolate best served in a mug with little marshmellows but then again that's usually when made at home or around a fire.\r\nThe bathrooms are just hilarious, and fittingly odd for the place. To put into context, you first walk up a short flight of stairs and in front of you is a beam of light which changes colour periodically. Cool but nothing special until you turn your head away from it and a word flashes out at you from the corner of your eye. It's almost as if you are seeing things but it is just a strange optical illusion definitely sets the scene. \r\nThe sculputures around the restaurant, cafe, and club areas are a bit disturbing and what I imagine the artwork of Chucky to be like.

Needless to say I didn't linger in this room and rushed to the bathrooms just next door. \r\nThe bathroom area is actually above a sunken spherical bar and boys go left while girls go right but a curving white staircase.

The main comment I got from my friends is that they felt like they were in Alice In Wonderland (good thing the Mad Hatter's Tea at the Sanderson was booked up).  As soon as I got there there was a doorman with tophat and I got a little nervous because of my attire (its summer and I had \"stylish\" flipflops on) but I trucked on in anyway.  My friends were waiting from me and I was immediately pleasantly surprised by my surroundings.  I passed the cafe - for the sorry sods that weren't smart enough to book - and walked into can only described as a tea room in a red forest.  the lighting was soft red and I passed some truly artistic trays of edible art.  Our party each decided to have the Afternoon Tea \u00a325 but I decided on the champagne tea which came with 1 glass of champagne (Pommery Ampanage) along with unlimited tea at \u00a346.  I don't think that is particularly worth it but the presentation of the glass of champagne was definitely something to see.  We all chose different teas so we could sample each others. Mine was jasmine, but the ladies ordered berry hibiscus, vanilla, and rose hip tea.  I liked all but the rose tea.  Now for the sweet and savoury goodies... WONDERFUL. Anyone who thinks they won't be full is terribly misguided.  We had servings for 5 people and we left with 2 beautiful takeaway boxes because we couldn't finish it all.  The Assorted finger sandwiches were smoked salmon and Jacob's cream cucumber, ricotta and asparagus, MY FAVORITE mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur, and egg and mayonnaise, quail egg, caviar were seriously tasty and is NOT your everyday egg salad sandwich.

We ordered the cheese course to start the evening (i was treating one of my best friends to a Birthday dinner), and the normal thought process would be that the restaurant brings out a cheese board with a variety of breads and spreadable flavors.  Sketch takes it to the stratosphere by rolling out 4 separate mobile cutting boards and presenting the diner with a cheese entourage from around the world.  We probably had over 40 different types of cheese to select from, and Sebastien took his time to review everyone of them. We took his suggestions (all of them) and he cut very generous pieces from each selection, and then suggested the order in which to appreciate them.  This in itself was over an hour, and the whole process was fascinating.

First, I'll say the one bad spot regarding Sketch ... the service is a little erratic, and sometimes takes a while to get noticed if you're drink is needing replacing or you need extra attention to your meal.  That being said, let me move onto what I can describe as the magic of Sketch!\r\nWe got seated proper at 8.30 on a busy Saturday evening in the Gallery Room, and the maitre-d was an incredibly charming French gentleman who said everything with a insouciant flourish of his well-manicured hands and his impeccable smile. A giant lamp made out of children's toys and action-figures and dolls painted entirely white is by the entrance. Near the coat-check is a porcelain statue of two mating greyhounds. In the entrance is a hopscotch painting in the floor, and one of the doors off to the left appears to be melting, cascading thick red resin down a petite flight of stairs. Outside is a merry-go-round of \"out of work\" ashtrays that spins and empties themselves into a urn. Cathy and I were seated next to a softly lit wall set in the centre of the room that was impaled with chairs, pieces of antique tables and chandeliers, and one of the first things we noticed was the projections of the Paris skyline rotating slowly on the upper parts of the walls. A DJ was spinning some wicked house music with a lot of bass, and everybody was beautiful.\r\nWe ordered a bottle of Veuve Cliqot, which arrived quickly, and received two little shot glasses of a vegetable puree which was then poured over a little shaving of raw tuna with something that resemble lentils. Cathy's entree was a little radicchio salad with slices of Chilean Sea Bass and a balsamic vinaigrette, I went for more of the tuna!\r\nMain courses came a bit later. I dropped a knife once and a server caught it as it bounced off the floor, and immediately replaced it. Good reflexes! I had a rib-eye steak bloody with dauphinois potatoes and leeks, whilst Cathy had a fish dish I can't remember.\r\nAfter we had this blowout piece of lovely hot chocolate cake, I took off to the toilets. All I can say is ... WOW. You go through a door in the back and you see in the centre of this massive room a small dugout bar surrounded by two semi-spiraling staircases that envelope the bar as they go to the next level. One is back-lit blue for the boy's toilets, and the other one is pink. You ascend the staircase, and come across these pods that look like escape pods mated with the transportation pods from \"The Fly\" and the eggs from \"Alien\". The door opens with a gentle hiss, and closes behind you. Everything is bathed in a soft blue (or pink if you're a girl) light, and gentle soaring sounds surround you as you complete your business.\r\nI recommend saving some space in your evening for a last glass of champagne in the little dugout bar when you've finished with your meal.  It's rather small, and looks like something out of \"Star Wars\".

The French chef, who is originally from Lyon in the Rhone River valley, became famous in New York after moving there in the early 80s.  Boulud's centerpiece - three Michelin star restaurant DANIEL is located in NYC - but his empire spans the globe with locations in Florida, Singapore, Beijing, Montreal, Toronto and London. Bar Boulud sits in the ground floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park hotel, one of the poshest addresses in London's Knightsbridge area.\r\nThe Boulud American-inspired French bistro concept is a majorly relaxed and welcoming environment. And unlike many other restaurants in this price range, it attracts people who aren't dressed to the nine's and just want a chilled out, but very nice meal.  The slightly-underground Bar Boulud is designed to feel like a French wine cellar with vaulted ceilings and recessed, red-leather booths.  It's open kitchen does make things more lively than your average wine cellar.\r\nI, of course, had the burger.  Bar Boulud features four delicious burgers on their regular menu, priced between \u00a317 and \u00a324. Now, this is pricey - it's prohibitively pricey.  And considering just a few short years back, the Boulud burgers were priced between \u00a313-19, Boulud has realized that there is money to be made in a delicious hamburger.  \r\nHowever, I do say that these burgers are worth it - considering the Hawksmoor burger for \u00a315 without fries; Bar Boulud includes the pommes frites, and it's on par with Hawksmoor.  Boulud's beef comes from the Castle of Mey; aged Aberdeen Angus Cross chuck steak (grass and silage fed from the North of Scotland).\r\nTheir burgers include: the Yankee (\u00a317) - a classic beef burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle on the homemade glazed brioche bun.  The Frenchie (\u00a319) is topped with confit pork belly, tomato, and dijon on a morbier peppered homemade bun.  The Piggie (\u00a319) piles bbq pork on top of the beef patty and then includes jalapeno mayo and cabbage on a cheddar bun.  And finally, the pi\u00e9ce de r\u00e9sistance is Boulud's \u00a324 BB: a beef burger with foie gras, short rib meat, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes on a black onion seed bun.  \r\nThey also serve up a sampler of three burgers, cut in halves so you and some select friends can divide your attention amongst these four 8oz. burger delights.  The beef absolutely melts in your mouth and remains the focal point of the experience.  Even though the house-made buns are exquisite, they are purely a bit-player to the beef.  Even the toppings, though fresh and wonderful, are purely there for slight variation, not to overpower the burger patty.\r\nYou can read my full review here: \r\nbeeffanatic.com/2015/12/\u2026", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "Bar Boloud is just amazing.

Senior maitre d' Paulo de Tarso, which eventually turned our evening into a special one, told us the origins of the London version from its humble basement beginnings at the swanky Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge\r\nTo be honest, the evening didn't start well. The first 4 of our party of 10 Yelpers arrived to find that they had split us up into tables of 4,4 and 2 and that they were unable to sit us close together. Having now spent an evening in the buzzing and impressively full dining rooms, I'm still not sure why our tables couldn't be placed closer together\r\nThe other unfortunate policy at the restaurant is that no photo taking is allowed, especially of the food. At the end of the evening, we all agreed that it was a real shame that they didn't allow us to take photos of the food, which was beautifully plated and presented. A little bizarrely, they did offer to let us return to photograph the food with professional photographers and they would set up the food professionally, which rather goes against the spontaneous joy of Yelp. I really hope that they re-consider this policy as I, in common with a lot of others I'm sure, have chosen to eat somewhere when we've seen the beautiful photos of the food\r\nHowever, once Mr de Tarso worked out that we were serious foodies, he did put in a lot of time with us to share his obvious passion for the food and to make sure that we had an enjyable evening. He was the perfect host\r\nWe had some nice cocktails to sip on - my non alcoholic 'Exotic Breeze' was a nice combination of lychee juice, fresh berries and tonic - as we perused the menu\r\nVery generously, Mr de Tarso sent over some complimentary charcuterie boards as he wanted us to try the terrines, which reflects Daniel Boulud's rustic origin and style of cooking though elevating it to perfect execution and appearance. Despite it having a bistro air in the dining room, they don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients or cooking\r\nThe many terrines and hams on the board weren't shy on flavour, which was nice. The mustards served alongside added some lovely bite but the pickled veggies could have had a little more zing\r\nBeing Burger Quest, we all went for burgers. I had already decided beforehand on their signature BB burger which is a beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, fris\u00e9e, horseradish mayonnaise and confit tomato all on a sesame black onion seed bun, costing a reasonable \u00a319.50 considering the top class ingredients. Yinnie C bucked the trend on our table by having the Piggie burger, which was personally recommended by Mr de Tarso\r\nSo, the BB. It was very good but just a couple of notches from perfection. The beef patty is made in-house with a carefully measured ratio of fat to meat and this results in a wonderfully light patty. The foie gras and short ribs were nice too but as all these main filling ingredients are of the same consistency and flavour, everything just merged into an amorphous mouthful, nice though it tasted. I felt the foie gras was wasted in this mix and extracted it to be eaten separately. Similarly, the truffle was a bit lost in the meat feast. Linzi M had requested no horseradish in her burger and I did wonder if they leff it off mine as well as it did lack a little bit of different texture or a a little kick, which would have elevated it into the great division\r\nHowever, Yinnie's Piggie burger was a little star. With the addition of barbecued pulled pork and chilli mayo, it had interesting contrasts on the palate\r\nHappily, the truffle in the truffle mash was more obvious and was my favourite side. The fries, mushroom fricasee and cauliflower cheese gratin were good fillers but not in the same class\r\nSomehow, we found space for a dessert each. These were yummy. We had a nice range with pineapple souffle, chocolate tart, peppermint chocolate sponge and mango with orange mousse\r\nMr de Tarso had a last surprise for us with a batch of mini madelaines fresh from the oven.

He was truly a delight, highly knowledgable and treated us like family. We discovered Paulo is a more than a bit of a respected  celebrity in restaurant circles so it was lovely of him to spend so much time with us describing his ethos for the restaurant and how much attention goes into each dish. \r\nWe started with the charcuterie board and were won over by the flavours of the terrines from lamb terrine to coarse country foie gras. As always cured meats are my favourite, I couldn't get enough of the different flavours and textures of this board. Try them all! \r\nAs was the theme of the evening, everyone ordered the burgers, 3 BBs and a Piggie. We had to go for all the sides, truffled mash, mushroom fricassee, cauliflower gratin and of course, fries! The burger was a revelation, the most moist, tender patty you could ever bite into. I wasn't relishing enough enjoyment from the foie gras in the burger, so I began spreading it on the bread provided and that was divine! Back to the burger to really taste each part then, the highlight of the BB is the combination of the braised short rib with the foie gras sitting on an unusual black sesame seed bun.  \r\nSides are almost always my favourite, maybe because I used to be a vegetarian. But I could have eaten that truffled mash all day long. It was decadent! Same for the gratin. \r\nOf course, we were a greedy table and ordered a round of desserts. At a place like Boulud, how can you not?! Coconut crusted pineapple souffl\u00e9 with coconut ice cream, this was like eating a fluffy delicious cloud of air. Andrew had the coffee and bittersweet chocolate tart - this was decadent and divine.

It's a posh place (located below the Mandarin Oriental Hotel) with a suitably luxurious d\u00e9cor. It's burgers are no less fancy with all four offerings being based on a bespoke beef patty. But is it any good? The short answer is yes, yes it is. From the Yankee to the Frenchie and of course the BB, the burgers are very tasty with one of the best patties in London and a solid set of buns to support them.\r\nTwo important things we learned are 1) groups of more than 4 need to book several weeks in advance to have a chance of sitting near let along with each other, and 2) NO PICTURES!\r\nAnyways, we eventually got seated and the night properly began. Our waiter was pretty cool and, despite being fairly new, really put in a lot of effort to make sure we had everything we needed and also answer all the questions we threw at him. Mr. de Tarso also spent quite a lot of time with us over the course of the night to discuss his vision for Bar Boulud and also a bit of his personal history. He's worked with some of the top names in London and is a fairly impressive chef in his own right. \r\nAt this point, I need to disclose that we didn't have a completely typical experience as Mr. de Tarso was kind enough to send some free charcuterie plates (as they say, you really know a chef by how he puts together a plate of meat) and some fresh madelines for dessert. Now I'd love to think it's because we demonstrated an obvious passion for food and thus inspired Mr. de Tarso to ensure we tried the best Bar Boulud had to offer. But, the smart money is on the fact that we let slip at the start that we were all Yelpers. If the latter is the cause, I attribute it to Alex S's (Yelp London Community Manager) efforts to really put Yelp out there above its competition. Regardless, there was free food, and it was good.\r\nThe BB burger is average sized with a fluffy soft white bun, the aforementioned patty, seared foie gras, and red-wine braised short rib. It's a bit tall and may prove a challenge for those who can't unhinge their jaw, but each bite is full of tasty meat and soaked bun. I give extra points as the bun actually holds together for the entire burger despite the copious amount of juice running out with each bite. The foie gras was delicious on its own but was lost in the taste of the combined burger. At best, it added a bit more richness to the whole thing but it was a poor value-add. The braised short rib was likewise a bit lost in the overall combination although it did add more textures to the burger which was sorely needed. I could have eaten it as a side dish alone though, absolutely brilliant flavours and tender shredded meat. Overall, a pretty good burger but not quite worth the nearly \u00a320 price tag. At \u00a312-15, I'd be quite happy and perhaps if they took off the foie gras they could do just that.\r\nFinally desserts! We started with the mini-madelines as ordered by Mr. de Tarso which were brilliant. Light and airy with a slight lemony flavour, they are very moreish and incredibly hard to put down. And when you dip them in hot chocolate sauce then you pretty much won't bother stopping until they are all gone (I know that's what I did). The chocolate tart was my next favourite with a  deep bitter chocolate although the chocolate sauce soaked sponge was a close second (or third rather). Finally, for a bit of freshness, we managed to take down a pineapple souffl\u00e9 and a mango mouse. Both were light and refreshing and a great option if you feel stuffed from your meal but still want dessert.\r\nOverall, an excellent experience and a definite burger win.

Batiste, my waiter, introduced the special (the lamb burger) right after handing me the menu and helped me choose a nice wine to go with it.

I'll just say that the burger didn't look that big, but I had to take a break midway because I was getting really full!

Bar Boulud has been written up to death (e.g. MarinaMetro, AA Gil, Jay Rayner, and a myriad of bloggers) so I will keep myself short.\r\n The owner and chef, Daniel Boulud, is a successful restaurateur in New York where he doesn't only have a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars ('Daniel') but is also famous for his up-market burgers .\r\n For me  coming from Austria  burgers did not exist until I moved to England apart from in the form of McDonalds hamburgers. It took me quite a while to get my head around the fact that a burger should be taken seriously and can be truly delicious. So the burger slowly made its way from being my favourite hangover food to actually being eaten for real enjoyment even without prior alcohol exposure.\r\n Anyway, what I want to say is that my burger experience is limited and I am far from being a burger expert  so I approached Bar Boulud and its famous burgers (which I of course had to try) with a relatively unbiased attitude but with high expectations.\r\n For Knightsbridge and for being in the Mandarin Oriental I thought the atmosphere at Bar Boulud was rather pleasant and it was frequented by a mixed crowd. It was Wednesday evening and very busy  we only got a table in the bar area (with stylish but hugely uncomfortable chairs). In fact it was so busy that we were more or less ignored by the waiters for the first part of the evening. Later on service picked up however and the waiters were friendly and seemed to be doing their best.\r\n I started with the beetroot salad with goat's cheese and walnut (8). I was not terribly impressed actually. Everything, even though tasty, was slightly underseasoned and especially the salad leaves could have done with some kind of dressing.\r\n Then of course the DBGB Yankee burger (12 + 1 for cheese). Maybe I expected something like an orgasmic burger experience (which might be too much to ask from pour Daniel Boulud) but somehow the burger failed to induce any culinary arousal.

That was four courses (Prix Fixe plus an extra charcuterie course)\r\n This was the week that we got news of another American import, Keith McNally, bringing a feted and famous New York brasserie to London (Balthazar, in partnership with Richard Caring's Caprice Holdings). Both McNally and Daniel Boulud, at whose new London outpost we were dining, are considered by many to be American chefs, and both made their large reputations there however both were born in Europe, Keith McNally a few miles up the road from his planned new home.\r\n I came to praise Daniel Boulud, but instead walk away strangely unsatisfied. As a dining experience overall, it wasn't one that will live long in the memory. \r\nIt wasn't the staff. They were as well drilled, knowledgable and friendly a brigade as I've seen... \r\nIt wasn't the decor. The light, well proportioned space is a graceful place for the well heeled to dine... Admittedly I was less sure about the arty splashes on the wall. The blot art of famous red wine vintages intrigued but were only vaguely reminicent of blood stained rorchach drawings. \r\nSadly, and more fundamentally, it was the food.\r\n We went for a so-so Corbier, fair enough, but a little too earthy for both of us. It came from a large and excellent winelist priced squarely for the Four Seasons clientele. There are only a handful below \u00a350, the rest quickly hit hedge fund levels.\r\n The relatively long and involved menu presented a thrill as it was knowledgeably announced by our gallic host. There were certainly sparks of excellence here. Themes of charcuterie, sausage, p\u00e2t\u00e9s and burger were highlighted and so we decided to go for the Prix Fixe with an additional charcuterie course (supplied by expert Parisian charcuterie supplier Gilles Verot). The small plate was more than ample and made a very good pre-starter paired with a moreish (light in texture but richly flavoured) boudin blanc sausage and its accompanying garlic mash. A very good salami made up for the dry and too subtle ham. P\u00e2t\u00e9s (particularly the tagine dagneau, a heavily spiced Maroc influenced lamb and aubergine mix and a superb p\u00e2t\u00e9 grand-m\u00e8re) really excelled and the portions of the small plate were the ideal way to sample.\r\n The chilled pea soup was simple elegance and one dish I'll remember for a long time. Fresh, creamy and with an occasional snap of tiny rosemary flavoured cruton, it hit the spot perfectly.\r\n Sadly it went a little down hill from here. The Masticator's burger was initially dry, tasteless, unseasoned and lukewarm with a shredded lettuce, 'special sauce' and thin, limp tomato combination eeriely remenicent of a certain golden arched chain. Only a tasty brioche bun saved it. The team were swift to offer a replacement due to the temperature but this arrived in the same state (albeit warmer). The chips were inedibly saline.\r\n My roasted chicken breast had a rich rustic and flavoursome taste of pure perfect poultry and arrived, in comparison, piping hot. Slightly dry too though sadly, it was helped by a rich (if salty) gravy but badly let down by rather floury fingerling potatoes and overcooked artichokes.\r\n The Masticator had further problems with his desert (though this time arguably of his own making). A pervading scent of lavender that put him off his two (small) scoops of mint and coconut ices was tracked down to the overpowering handwash in the Mandarin Oriental bathroom. That aside, a powder dry hazelnut cookie didn't add to the experience. My exotic fruit sundae was preceded by a long spoon hightening childish anticipation before it arrived in a Martini glass. A pleasant but not earth-shattering m\u00e9lange of passion fruit pur\u00e9e and cream came with nuggets of an excellent coconut macroon to give some needed bite.\r\n Will I come again? Absolutely. It's a great space for a business lunch in the area, a safe menu overall with some excellent notes and very good charcuterie. It isn't somewhere I'll be rushing back to though.

He can lay claim to being the chef patron of many an acclaimed restaurant and his 3 Michelin starred Daniel in New York (a darling of The New York Times - it has received 4 stars from 3 successive critics no less than 5 times since 1986) was recently ranked 8th in San Pelligrino's World's 50th best restaurants. (The Greedy Diva had a solid but slightly less dazzling experience there in 2008 - which I'm sure has The New York Times thinking twice.) And now Monsieur Boulud has pitched his flag in the heart of London. I had my table booked before you could say \"steak fri...\".\r\n While M. Boulud was born in Lyon, which plays a heavy influence on the food at hand, Bar Boulud has a swanky, New York feel (the music on it's website says it all).\r\n Sister to New York's Bar Boulud, the London bistro decor is intended to be a modern interpretation of a wine bar. Elegant, sleek and sexy, there's a zinc bar, oak panelling and wooden floors (intended to be reminiscent of wine barrels), chandeliers, and swathes of red leather (intended to \"conjure the warm depths of a delicious Burgundy\" - the hint was lost on me at the time, but I suppose I get it in hindsight). Overall, the decor is fairly understated - it's not going to bowl you over before you taste anything.\r\n The classic French bistro menu holds much to allure. We took longer than usual deliberating over so many appealing options - the Boudin Blanc truffled white sausage with mashed potato is calling me, but so is the beetroot with horseradish and hazelnut, the fish soup and the coq au vin. But then what about the signature charcuterie plates from renowned charcutier, Gilles Verot - such as the Lapin de Garrigue - Provencal pulled rabbit, carrot, courgette and herbs terrine? Tempting.\r\n In the end, we opt for the \u00a320 menu prix fixe (we'll come back again if we like it), before my deliciously oaky Marsanne steals the last shred of my decision making ability (Andre Perret, Marsanne, Vin De Pays Des Collines Rhodaniennes 2007 - \u00a36.50 - absolutely lovely).\r\n I start with the luxurious rabbit terrine with cornichons and cocktail onions, toasted bread and a hearty mustard. Elegant and wantonly good, the 2 Frenchmen on the table next door have a serve each, then order another to share. Oui.\r\n The Peanut Gallery starts light, with the Salade de Roquette - rocket salad, garlic confit toast, stewed tomato, tapenade and buffalo mozzarella. Each element is nice enough, although, not surprisingly, there's nothing here to showcase the kitchen's real strengths. TPG is pacing himself. I'm still in some shock over his choice here, but if we're looking for that silver lining, it certainly gives us just one extra excuse to come back for a face to face with the Boudin Blanc. (Can you tell that it's still playing on my mind?).\r\n It's hard to go past the chance to devour a New York style burger - it's been a while. We both order the DBGB Yankee Burger - a grilled beef patty, iceberg lettuce, tomato, sweet onion, sesame brioche bun, cheese pickle and fries (\u00a313 with cheese on the a la carte menu). In this price bracket, it's got to compete with my beloved burgers at Hawksmoor and Goodman. It does.\r\n It might be the messiest thing I've eaten for some time (think shredded lettuce in a train wreck), but this baby is the closest thing I've had to that much sought after, but highly elusive, US style burger in London. It's reminiscent of Shake Shake (and this, for me, is a mighty accomplishment). But it's loftier, even if there's a little too much foliage. The meat is loosely packed, moist and sumptuously flavourful and mine at least was perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. Surprisingly, TPG's patty was a little more well done than mine. (But I still didn't share). The accompanying thin cut fries were are good as they looked.\r\n On the a la carte menu, the Frenchie Burger comes with confit pork belly as well as the beef patty and there's a Piggy Burger with a beef patty and BBQ pulled pork. While these other combos sound tempting, the flavour of the beef can really sing in the classic DBGB Yankee burger.\r\n Quite satisfied, I could eat no more than 2 scoops of refreshing mint ice-cream and a decadent chocolate sorbet. More could be made of the sugary biscuit in between if they're going to bother at all.\r\n TPG finished with the Gateau Basque - custard cake with brandied cherries (\u00a36). The cherries packed a strong punch, but the custard cake itself was boring and dry with a hint of orange that didn't succeed in lifting it out of the doldrums. Disappointing.\r\n Next time, I'll be trying the freshly baked madeleines (\u00a34 - if they're the same ones we had at Daniel, they're divine) or the macaroons (\u00a35) - among other things.\r\n We finish with a sweet Domain De Trapadis, Rasteau 2007 (\u00a39) (rich, grape juice", "score": 1.0}, {"text": "The food was only average.

I had anticipated that the place would have the same menu as in New York (a yelp review being the reason for the expectation) but sadly the London establishment didn't have a brunch menu at all. So my friend and i had to settle for a French lunch.\r\nThe place is classy ... you feel the elegance everywhere. One thing i noticed was the extraordinarily high staff to table ratio. We had a reservation for 12 noon when most of the tables were empty. So we did see dozens of staff members just whiling away with apparently nothing to do.\r\nWe went for the set menus ... the two course version costs \u00a316 while its \u00a320 for three courses. For the first course both of us had terrine made of leg of lamb. The dish was borderline raw meat, and i am not a big fan of meat that is not well cooked. But this one was great. Minced lamb has always been one of my favourite foods and to have a brilliantly made meat loaf made of it was a great experience.\r\nFor the main course i had a tagliatelle pasta with lamb bolognese. I was surprised as i was under the impression that bolognese sauce was invariably made from beef. However this variation proved to be a very good choice. The pasta was excellent. My friend had a dish of chicken breast. The chicken looked dry but was actually quite juicy, and it was served with cubical pieces of bacon. Every dish had been interesting so far ... i was beginning to love this place :)\r\nI had a glass of Greek white wine (my little contribution towards helping them tide over their debt crisis) while my friend was \"persuaded\" to order an expensive red worth \u00a314 per glass (he asked for suggestions ... he deserved what he got). The red was thick, with a strong odour. The white was milder. For dessert, i had a Muscat de Rivesaltes, which was quite good, while my friend went for the chocolate ice-cream (a safe option ... you can't screw up chocolate, can you ?).\r\nInitially i had thought that the portion sizes were small ... but i was wrong, proven by the fact that i was full at the end of the meal.\r\nThe service was excellent, right from taking my jacket to returning it. We did finish our lunch quickly, in less than one hour and a half, but unlike some of the other reviewers here, i never felt rushed. With drinks and service, we paid about \u00a337 per head. Based on the location and ambience, i am sure they can charge much more. We did save by going for the set menus, but even a-la-carte wouldn't have cost much more as many of the main courses were priced in the teens.\r\nAnother interesting aspect of Bar Boulud was the many options that i found in chicken and lamb. This is a French restaurant which even my parents would like (they don' t eat pork or beef).\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed my visit here.

Reading comments on my post about LL's excellent Siu Loung Bao (or Xiao Long Bao) brought on cravings. It was time to investigate the newbie's offerings.\r On the site of the former Golden Harvest, the downstairs room is large and airy with white walls and minimalistic touches. It's fresher looking than some of its neighbours - quite like an Asian St John's in terms of decor. We were lucky to be seated at the front, where the whole wall is a window and the sunshine flitted in over our lunch as we watched the characters of Chinatown amble by. Upstairs is more poky, but does the job.\r We arrived about 2pm - prime time it seems. The dining room was packed and a small queue was growing rapidly. However, 3 dumpling makers were at work behind a glass panel at the entrance, rolling, folding and stuffing delicate dumpling wrappers. It's mesmerising to watch while you wait - although I do wonder how long it takes before RSI sets in.\r \"Whatever\", you say. To the food, the food...\r Our knobbly cheung-fun arrive first - three generous, slinky, slug-like noodles stuffed with ample slices of sea bass and picked vegetables. A fair price at \u00e5\u00a33.30. The next table orders the spicy stir fried cheung-fun which looks good and appears to be a popular choice around the room.\r Steamed sticky rice in a bamboo tube is delicious but so thick it borders on congealed - a decent set of biceps is required to scoop it out (\u00e5\u00a34.50).\r Barbecued pork buns are excellent - fluffy and filled with big, juicy splashes of sweet, red barbecued meat (3 for \u00e5\u00a32.50).\r Crystal prawn dumplings are small, pretty things, sweet and plump - but nothing which stands out above the norm here (\u00e5\u00a32.50). Chicken wrapped in banana leaf with Chinese is a highlight - deliciously moist, with satisfying chunks of chicken and Chinese sausage (\u00e5\u00a32.20).\r Finally, out come the pork Siu Loung Bao, for which Leong's Legends are renowed (\u00e5\u00a36.00). At Dumplings' Legend, they're also fantastic - the little smurf's hut shaped wrapper is quite delicate and so you have to be careful not to pierce it, spilling broth onto the table. It snuggles a parcel of meat within as well as a warm soupy broth which explodes into your mouth on first bite. These should be an essential part of your dim sum order here. The accompanying soy sauce contains thick slithers of shredded ginger - a lovely touch.\r We finish with a serve of 3 tiny egg tarts (\u00e5\u00a32.20) - these are TPG's thing more than mine. They're nothing special, but I quite like the fact they don't taste overly eggy,\r Service is efficient and friendlier than you might experience at some Chinatown restaurants.

This evening turned out to be not only a feast of some delicious and some not so great food, but was also hugely educational as I learned a lot from Mr. Noodles about Chinese culture, food and restaurants. Dumpling Legend which is located in the heart of Chinatown has opened some time last year and specialises, as the name promises, in dumplings. To experience the extensive dim sum menu, you have to come before 5 pm (dim sum are traditionally eaten for breakfast and lunch). I refer you to this mouth-watering review by Greedy Diva for more information about eating dim sum at Dumpling Legend. The restaurant is extremely brightly lit. This is good for taking pictures but not that flattering for teint and wrinkles (not that I have any of course!), so I would not necessarily recommend it for the first or second date to be honest. The menu depicts a happy Chinese dumpling with a little crown. Without wanting to be mean, if I had a restaurant I would not entrust my marketing campaign to the people who created this cheerful ball reminiscent of an onion As Mr. Noodles and I are both working hard in our non-blogging related day jobs to be able to afford eating out all the time, we only managed to meet up in the evening and therefore had to choose from the evening menu with a limited dim sum selection. Mr. Noodles pointed out that Dumpling Legend does not appear to specialise in a speficic Chinese cuisine, as the dishes on the menu stemmed from Canton, Sichuan, Malaysia and Taiwan. Mr. Noodles chose the dishes. He ordered a very interesting mix of starters and mains, however, we got them served all at the same time. I didn't like this at all. Firstly, you expect dishes to be served one after the other when they are stated as 'starter' and 'main' in the menu (otherwise why bother doing this?) and secondly, we really had to rush to eat everything while it was still hot/warm. The meal therefore started with a huge minus for Dumpling Legend In summary, the dishes were a rather mixed bag of delicious, OK and not very good. The supposed starters: I rather enjoyed the Cucumber in Chilli Oil (\u00e5\u00a34) which is a typical Sichuan dish. The fresh and cold cucumber and the hotness of the sauce provided an interesting contrast. The Sweet Potato Fried with Salted Egg Yolk (\u00e5\u00a34.50) did not taste very Chinese in my opinion and was strangely addictive. Somehow reminded me of the zucca fritta at Zucca. Very successful were the Sichuan-style Spicy Won-ton (\u00e5\u00a34.50). The delicious savoury filling was wrapped into light won ton skin and came with plenty of mouth-tingling chili sauce. We did fight a little over those A real Chinese specialty are the Pork Crab Meat Siu Loung Bao (\u00e5\u00a36.50). When I ate Siu Long Baos for the first time at Leong's Legend I burnt my mouth terribly as this type of dim sum contains not only solid fillings but also hot soup. The version at Dumpling Legends did not look very pretty but tasted heavenly. Mr. Noodles taught me how to eat them and I want to share this knowledge with you to save you from injury. You grab one of the dumplings with your chopsticks and bite into it holding it over one of the big Chinese spoons. Then you can enjoy the dumpling and afterward savour the soup collected in the spoon. A real disappointment were the Steamed Prawn Dumplings (\u00e5\u00a36). Again they did not look very appealing but in this case this also applied to the taste. The skin was too thick and the filling tasteless. Stay away from these! The dishes we had wanted as mains:I have never eaten Taiwanese Three-cup Chicken (with soy sauce, sesame oil & rice wine) (\u00e5\u00a39.50) so I did not have much comparison but for Mr Noodles this was the most disappointing part of the meal. According to him, this dish, if done well, is extraordinarily delicious. This one clearly wasn't. The chicken was kind of slimy, the sauce tasted only of soy sauce and I could not pick up any sesame oil. Overall this dish lacked any redeeming qualities. You wouldn't think that something as delicious as the Seabass Fillet Steamed with Soy Sauce (\u00e5\u00a317.50) can come from the same kitchen as the unsuccessful 3 Cup Chicken: Wonderfully tender sea bass with Chinese spring onions and ginger in a light and tasty soy broth was my favourite dish of the evening. I had a similarly delectable Chinese sea bass at Goldfish City close to Bank. The other two mains clearly did not rock my boat. The Stir-fried Choi-sum with Garlic (\u00e5\u00a37.80) was not too bad but did not leave any lasting impression. Celebrating the Chinese New Year you have to eat noodles as noodles represent longevity. Also when you go out with Mr Noodles you have to eat noodles, but I think you would have guessed that much :) . The Fried Wide Rice Noodles with Beef (\u00e5\u00a37.50) were boring and insipid.

It was so refreshing, loved the crunchy texture and marinated perfectly. The frankfurters actually worked well adding some meaty sweetest to the dish, to balance out the sourness.\rChicken sour spicy la-mian noodles. \rI didn't expect the broth to be so umami and flavoursome. It had depth and a nice balance sourness as well as a good punch of spice from the chilli without being numbing.

Sadly the noodles weren't as satisfying for me being short and doughy. It felt I spent more time chewing on the noodles than the enjoying the broth with it. Next time I might have it with the La Mian as the beef was spot on being incredibly tender and fragrant, with strong notes of the sweet soy braising marinating sauce. Nice addition of pak choi for a refreshing green taste and crunch.\rSteamed pork and chive dumplings \rThese were poorly made. The dough was too thick and chewy masking all the flavours of the meatball and the broth inside it. The meatball itself was nice and sweet, well marinated and juicy.\rFish ball BBQ skewer and lamb BBQ skewer \rThese were lovely and fragrant. It had a nice kick to it from the spice. The lamb was meaty and lean which was nice compared to all the fatty ones we've had. Fish balls were soft and bouncy with good umami flavours. It was great not to have a minimum order on them too like most places that sell skewers.\rChive and egg pie\rThis was very moreish. I love the doughy thin pastry, pan fried for a little bit of crisp around the edges. It was a bit greasy too but that kept it moist. Inside was a delicious filling of peppery chives mixed with silky eggs.\rI left so satisfied with Lanzhou Noodle Bar.

Initially I was really excited to have found this place but the customer service has always been awful.

The only difference is that she wanted the thin noodles and I wanted the thicker noodles. We also ordered pig ears with cucumber and some fried dumplings. When they brought the noodles my flatmate's order was correct but mine was wrong. Instead of a noodle soup they gave me greasy fried noodles. I wasn't upset at all, I used to work as a waitress and I totally understand that mistakes can be made. I informed the waitress that it wasn't what I had ordered. She started yelling the name of the order at me and insisted it was what I ordered. She eventually took the plate of noodles and carried it around the restaurant looking for the waitress I had ordered with. In a bit the waitress who brought my noodles and the waitress who I ordered with came to speak to me together and insisted that I had ordered the fried noodles. I told them over and over again I had ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup, not fried noodles. I'd eaten at this restaurant at least 5 times at this point and I always order the same thing so I know I didn't order incorrectly. At this point they started to yell and roll their eyes at me. When they turned around and started going up the stairs the waitress I ordered with began to talk badly about me and scream profanities in Chinese as she walked up the stairs. I don't think she realized I speak Chinese because I have a perfect American accent. \rAt this point my flatmate and I were kind of upset that she had rudely screamed about me in another language just 2 feet away from our table. I was debating whether or not to leave or go but I really didn't want to start any drama so I decided to wait and see if she would bring me the correct order. She came back really quickly (maybe 2 minutes tops) with a bowl of noodle soup. I was so relieved when I first saw it because I thought the drama would be over. When I looked down I was really confused because the broth was extremely dark and the noodles were brown as well. I realized that what the restaurant had done was pour hot water over the fried noodles to make it into \"noodle soup.\" It was really gross. I turned to her and asked her if they had just poured hot water over the fried noodles. She looked at me and said no that's just beef broth. Beef broth is not that dark. I pointed to my flatmate's bowl (which is the same exact order as mine) and I said that her broth was clear. I also said I had eaten here many times before and I know what the soup and noodles are supposed to look like. She continued to lie to me and insisted that they had used beef broth for my soup and that's why it was a darker color. At this point I realized arguing was futile. I told her my flatmate and I were going to leave but I would still pay for her soup and the appetizer we ordered (even though we had barely touched them.) When we got to the cashier he didn't charge us for my soup but he tried to charge us for the dumplings that we never received. I didn't even really care about the money, I was just upset with the consistent lies and scheming. I told him we had never received them and asked him to take it off the bill. He eventually did after arguing with us and the total for food we barely touched was 18\u00e5\u00a3. I paid that and even tipped too.\rThe food in this restaurant is decent but the service is not.

Dim Sum in Soho - look no further! Joy King Lau on Leicester Street (adjacent to Lisle Street) offers a fairly large menu of steamed & fried dim sum, including some more exotic varieties - and a selection of cheung fun, of course.\rJust returned from London, where I always have dim sum several times during my stays. So far, I mostly frequented the Wan Chai Corner (on Gerrard Street) for its broad selection and solid quality, or Beijing Dumpling (on Lisle Street) for its absolutely freshly made dumplings. The two I will still recommend strongly - but Joy King Lau is different. All the dim sum are made freshly and have a better (firmer, more al dente usually) bite to them than those of the competition. Also, they're about 15% cheaper in comparison to the other Soho establishments, which also makes this restaurant great value! The regular dim sum are just UKP 2.80 per dish.\rThree times I had lunch at Joy King Lau in early to mid-August of 2015 - three times I chose 5 or 6 different dim sum each. This might seem too much for the average single traveler, but I wanted to sample as many different dim sum from this place as possible, having read some rave reviews on the Internet (the reviews here are mixed, which I don't quite understand). Expect 3 or 4 dim sum per person for a tummy-filling meal. They made only 1 mistake, as they served me the regular salty fried squid instead of the squid cakes I had ordered.\rThe atmosphere is quite typical for a Soho Chinese. It's always rush-rush-rush - this is no place to linger with friends for a party, or with a large family on a get-together. OTOH, for a quick lunch or early dinner with a friend or wife, it's great. You can always hang out for chit chat at one of the many pubs in the neighborhood (there's a good Fuller's pub a stone's throw away on the same street). Having said that, the waiters *never* forced the bill on me after I'd finished my meals - I had to ask for it!\rThe fact that Joy King Lau is also a small(!) restaurant tends to add to the atmosphere of slight chaos and rush.\rWhat's less typical is that the service is very attentive - they're always around to fill up your cup of Chinese tea (which you'll get automatically once you've been seated - so pay attention if you don't want tea!). Sometimes too attentive - there are so many waiters and waitresses around it can happen that one hands you the menu, then turns away, then another one steps up to ask for your order - 30 seconds after you've been seated! It may sound like pushiness - but it is not. The waiters just don't pay attention to what the others are doing.\rIf a little chaos does not deter you, the traveler looking for first class dim sum, then you shouldn't hesitate and include Joy King Lau in your Soho roster of Chinese joints. See the photos for the variety of steamed and fried dim sum I had (not a fan of cheung fun, so I can't comment on those). Particularly recommendable are: the pork & prawn dumplings with Chinese mushroom, the fried skin of chicken filled with four delicacies (just called \"Chicken with Four Kinds\" on the menu!), the beef with spring onion and ginger, the spicy beef tripe (not quite so spicy, actually - it's made with ginger), the siu mai (a standard dim sum, but of higher quality here than elsewhere!) and the chicken with Chinese dumpling (Warning: the chicken here is on the bones!). But ALL of the 17 ones I had were of superior to excellent quality.\rThe bill includes a \"mandatory\" 10% service charge. With 6 dim sum + chinese tea + service I ended up with a UKP 20-21 bill. Very reasonable considering the quality.\rDim sum can be ordered up until 5 p.m. (17.00), which is customary in Soho.\rAlmost all of the other guests during my three visits to Joy King Lau were Asian - I always consider that a good sign.
