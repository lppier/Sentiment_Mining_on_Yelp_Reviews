0,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I loved this place. It's conveniently located right behind Kings Cross station. I went alone so I was able to get seated right away, else there's a bit of a wait. The restaurant is huge and always packed! The bar tender recommended the food for me to pick and they were all great minus the fried okra. The romali roti and paneer masala is delicious and a good combination. The waiter also recommended one of their house cocktails which was really good and refreshing. It was a gin cocktail with a variety of spices and lemon juice or something. It was amazing. Go to this place if you're in London!",1,1,1,,
1,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Really wonderful evening spent at Dishoom in kings cross.The lamb biryani and black lentils were the standout dishes.Service was slick and friendly.Whilst I very rarely stand in line for 45 minutes for a restaurant, it was just about worth the wait. Only real negative are the prices are on the high side.",1,1,1,,
2,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Food is legendary as ever, great value for money and to be quite honest, I don't mind waiting a while for a table, whilst having a drink but I think it's probably time for Dishoom to incorporate a booking system for couples and small groups for dinner reservations after 545pm, in my opinion.We (Group of 3) waited almost 90 Minutes for a table.  Saying that, the restaurant in Kings Cross was heaving on a Monday evening at 7pm, indicating how popular the food is.Service was good, bar service is also good and the atmosphere is buzzy and noisy in a good way.My advice is to get a bunch of friends together, book a table and go as a group.",1,1,1,,
3,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I've been in London for only a week and I've already been here twice. And now that my flat is right around the corner, I think I'll be coming here pretty often Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. I'm a big fan of the Keema per eedu, which is basically chicken liver under two fried eggs. The naan roll is the most popular menu item and and sure does look delicious. Lassi is good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.For lunch I ordered the Ruby Chicken and gunpowder potatoes. The Ruby Chicken is best enjoyed with some rice. The potatoes are the real deal! So much flavor with all the herbs and spices. Check back with me in 2 months and I think I'll have the whole menu sampled by then ;)",1,1,1,,
4,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"When in London, do what the desis do, right?! Cannot rave enough about this place! In the 4 days we spent in London, we made it here 3 times. Sadly never for the bottomless chai brunch, but mostly late night dinners. The Kings cross location is way bigger than the downtown location (which we went to, but didn't eat at given the insane wait). This location has several different nooks and crannies, differnt seating styles - very reminiscent of  1980's Kolkatta in my opinion. The place is a warehouse turned into a restaurant and there is a cool little story on their menu. I loved everything about the decor - the office style chairs, the loungers, quirky hand wash sink, family pictures up on the walls - very very cool.Now for the food. Both Anurag and I had our favorites. For me, it was the vada pao, which I ate every time I made it here. The bread to filling ratio was just perfect, the sauce on the side was delicious. Any one who knows me, knows I cannot handle spice - but I kid you not, I poured ALL the ghati masala (super spicy) on my vada pao, along with the spicy sauce and devoured it all. I had tears in my eyes along the way and my tongue was numb, but it was just amazingly delicious, washed down with a generous swig of king fisher. Anurag tried the keema pao and deemed it delicious too. His all time favorite though - the butter chicken (murgh malai) - succulent pieces of chicken, velvety smooth gravy, sopped up with traditional roomali roti. He was so in love with the dish, you could see his eyes light up every time he took a bite, haha!The chicken biryani was another delicious dish - it made for an excellent jet lagged yet hung over meal for my husband :) We also tried the bhel - it was okay, but not at the same level as the dishes above. The paneer kathi roll was also delish -  made for a great back ""open the boot and chill"" kinda snack as we drove down to Dorset the next day. Perfect balance of spices - excellent road side snack :)|Definitely recommend coming here - there is a bit of something for everyone!",1,1,1,,
5,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Walked in on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated immediately! Although, we were told we got the last table so I would definitely recommend calling ahead to check for wait times. This place only takes reservations for parties of 6 or more.It was our first time at Dishoom and we were quite overwhelmed with their extensive menu. The menu was explained to us twice, and they were really patient with our confused selves lol. After explaining that each person should order 2-3 dishes, we opted for the bhel and prawn kaliwada for starters. For the main dishes, we got the murgh malai (chicken thighs) and lamb kebab to share with their signature black daal. We also ordered the garlic naan and I got the kala khatta sharbat drink. This may seem like a lot of food but the portion sizes are pretty small.The drink had hints of chili but was still incredibly refreshing and sweet! We didn't realize the garlic naan was only 2 half pieces, so we ordered a bowl of basmati rice to share. Next time, I'd rather skip the naan and order just rice. There isn't enough naan to last the meal and the amount you're getting isn't worth the price. One bowl of rice was plenty to share for 2 people.The prawn kaliwada was good - it came with a sweet dipping sauce which I wasn't a fan of. The shrimp itself was flavorful and spicy. The bhel was so complex in flavor and texture. And the colors were pretty too! Definitely my favorite appetizer - it was light, refreshing and delicious!The grilled dishes each came with about 6-7 pieces of meat about the size of ping pong balls. They were dressed with cilantro and a side cup of onions, cucumbers and more cilantro! The lamb kebab was very good and extremely flavorful - it was my boyfriend's favorite but it was a little too dry for me. The murgh malai was THE BOMB. Extremely tender and flavorful, and the green cilantro dipping sauce made it even better! The black daal was delicious, I understand why it's a house favorite. Everything here seems very affordable but keep in mind, the dishes are small. Each person is meant to order multiple dishes for sharing, which can add up.Definitely will be coming back to try the rest of their menu!Note: super cool ambience! The restaurant used to be an old rail yard for shipping and packing goods. The restaurant has a unique variety of furniture and there are incense everywhere! They also sell their own vinyl...",1,1,1,,
6,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I've been here numerous times but oddly have never penned a review.  I was most recently in because I needed to do work in the vicinity of Saint Pancras and this, in Granary Square, is really nearby.  They let me sit in a corner, sip chai, and grind away on my laptop for hours without fussing once.  That said, when I've come, it's almost always been for breakfast, and everything about this place is just *proper.*  They have incense burning, very friendly staff, an accessible menu, and delicious food.  Do not miss this place if you're even remotely close by.",1,1,1,,
7,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,I was told this was one of THE best Indian food restaurants in the world. I was not disappointed. We arrived at King's Cross from Amsterdam late and wanted to experience this place. Even without a reservation we were seated fairly quickly. The staff was wonderful and the cocktails - oh my god. We received our food quickly and it was heaven on earth I swear. So many flavors and spices. Do yourself a favor and stop in to this place if you're in London. You will be thankful you did.,1,1,1,,
8,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Magnificence achieved! From walking in to walking all around and reluctantly leaving this establishment happy and satiated, this place is a joy. The restaurant is huge inside with 4 floors of service! No joke!!! And every nook & cranny is lovingly decorated and designed to stay true to the fusion of elevated vintage ""travel/goods exchange station"" and India (like an authentic washing station, photos, coloring, etc.) with written signage in both English and Hindi. I've been lucky enough to have visited India and this felt so familiar and comforting. The service was impeccable and our server Falhid (spelling?) was so accommodating and informative. We were dressed super casual and obviously not locals but were treated like royalty. The food was insanely authentic and delicious with quality infused into each dish and bite. We arrived just after breakfast service but they brought us a serving of Bun Maska upon seeing our disappointment and we were so grateful. The bread was so fresh and the chai warmed the soul. We also had some colorful Indian snacks brought complimentary, and we ordered Muttar Paneer (wife's favorite!), Chicken Tikka Roll (like kathi roll), and bowl of greens with plain biryani. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. Lucky and unsurprisingly they have 5 more locations!!!!PS: check out the bar downstairs and the restrooms! Even they are an experience. So special!",1,1,1,,
9,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishoom was a fantastic choice for us on our one night layover in London.While it's definitely not as cheap as the likes of Brick Lane, Dishoom offers up a more upscale dining experience with great ambience and delicious Indian. You're definitely paying for quality here.On a Monday night, the restaurant was extremely packed so we had to wait about 45 minutes for our table. As we were waiting to get inside, the hosts graciously offered some chai that really warmed us up. LOVED THIS! It's the small things that really make the experience even when we hadn't sat down to eat yet.Before being seated, we hung out at their bar downstairs and ordered drinks while waiting. My Kalamansi Smash was a fantastic fusion of lime and vodka with this Filipino fruit. Once we were ready to be seated, our servers took us to our table and explained how ordering would work. They recommended that we each order a curry of some sort, some naan, and perhaps some chicken and lamb for the table. We did just that and my goodness, everything that we tasted was delicious! The curries were definitely hearty enough to fill one person and the lamb kebabs were fire. I wish that we received more naan for the price but it was still good for what it's worth.Overall, we had a great time dining at Dishoom and would come back here in a heartbeat. Note that they add an ""optional"" 12.5% service charge which is awkward to refuse, but completely up to you if you choose to opt out. Be sure to make it clear at the beginning.",1,1,1,,
10,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,3,"Really nice looking 3-story restaurant that would look like a good place to take a date. I visited for breakfast so there wasn't much of a crowd like the lines I saw at the more touristy Covent Garden location. The bar area had a lounge where you can enjoy a coffee or a stiff drink along with your breakfast. I just sat at the bar which had a lot of hustle and bustle with the  busy staff. My server was really nice.The vibe and menu reminded me of Pondicheri's in Houston and NYC. Prices were not too high given the upscale nature of the place. I ordered the Kejriwal which were two eggs over chile cheese toast. It was good and the colours were striking with the orange egg yolks but the bread was stiff and hard to cut with a butter knife. I was also surprised to find not a hint of spice given the chile in the toast. My breakfast lassi was also surprisingly less sweet than I expected with the dominant taste of oats and cardamom in the drink. Overall, the flavours of the food and drink were more subtle than something I can get at Pondicheri and may reflect British palates. I would come here again to explore the lunch/dinner menu though.",-1,1,1,,
11,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"We went to four countries in three weeks and ate a lot of good food. Dishoom was our unanimous pick for best meal of the trip. It's rare that a restaurant impresses everyone in my family of four equally, but this place definitely did.They accept reservations before 5:00, so we booked a table at 2:00 (or 14:00 for the rest of the world) to have a late lunch. It was busy, but we were seating immediately upon arrival.  We ordered several plates, but the two standouts for us were the cheese naan and the pau bhaji. The service was great. Our waiter even tracked us down after the meal to give us the bags we'd accidentally left under the table. We were all in food comas and not thinking clearly.I usually skip the mid-day beer, but we were on vacation and they had an IPA that was brewed specially for Dishoom. When in Rome (or a hipster Indian restaurant in London at 2:00 on a weekday).",1,1,1,,
12,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I've only been here once for breakfast and it was a spontaneous decision based solely on a recommendation.  But it was a 5 star meal nonetheless.  Despite its size (Dishoom has three levels), everyone was very welcoming and the atmosphere made it feel like cozy.  And then there was the breakfast food itself.  I'd never consider an Indian restaurant for breakfast, it's just not something that ever crossed my mind.  Dishoom's breakfast menu offered several delicious options though that proved to me that not only is it possible but also fabulous as well.  I ordered the bacon and egg naan sandwich and their house made chai.  The chai was out of this world and included free refills.  And the flavor combination with that sandwich was unbeatable.  Service was attentive.What I had might be considered a simple breakfast, but that sandwich and tea were one of the highlights of my trip to London hands down.  It might sound crazy considering all the options for breakfast, but I would go out of my way to go back there.",1,1,1,,
13,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"First, the space is awesome.  Tons of interesting nooks and crannies.  Location is also fun, especially on a summer weekend.  I really like the community tables as well.  Big enough to fit a lot of parties without overhearing everyone's conversations.However, the place needs to seriously invest in some kind of cooling or ventilation system.  I mean, goodness, it was probably 95 F in there last night.  That just doesn't work.On to the food:- The ruby chicken was creamy, tender, and had a nice pop to it.  Probably my favorite dish - The mattar paneer was fantastic.  The combined flavors of the paneer, curry, and peas was something I won't soon forget- The chicken tikka was below average.  Chicken tikka shouldn't taste like boiled chicken.  Very disappointed- The black daal was rich and had a very nice smoke flavor- The pau bhaji was above average.  It definitely did its job of whetting my appetite",1,1,1,,
14,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"We were lucky...arrived at about 5:30 on a Thursday and were seated right away.  By the time we left the line was going around the block.  We walked along the canal to granary sq..a fun way to get to the restaurant.  This was our first time.  All our food was delicious!  We ordered the black dal, stewed lamb shank, paneer curry, appetizers and lots of nan to sop up every delicious flavor.  My favorite was the fall off the bone lamb in a slightly spicy rich aromatic sauce. The seasoning of all the dishes was so sophisticated.  Also our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and could guide us in our selections.  This was one of our best meals from our London vacation.",1,1,1,,
15,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I freakin love Indian food in London. There's no place like it other than possibly India itself. It just tastes substantially better, with bursts of flavor. Dishoom is no different. It is a very popular restaurant in London with multiple locations. There is always a queue and the best possible way to get in without waiting is to make a reservation.I made a res at the King's Cross location. The space is bustling, with an amazing bar downstairs and seating both floor level and upstairs. Upon arrival, there was already a queue and I had made res for a lunch hour (although I did hear that their breakfast is pretty darn good). The menu is a little extensive, but innovative than the typical Indian food you would get in LA. The table was just big enough to accommodate all the food we had ordered, so we were lucky.  OKRA FRIES (å£4.20). Fine Lady's Fingers for the Fingers. I wasn't the biggest fan of these. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I'm just not a fan of okra. Though the slimey layer was almost non-transparent, I could still taste it. But, if you like okra, you'll love this.  VEGETABLE SAMOSAS (å£3.50). Fine Filo Pastry, Pea and Potato Filling Warmly Spiced with Cinnamon and Cloves. These were delicious. It was light and airy and wasn't heavy. I'm always a fan of samosas and they're one of my favorite appetizers. If you want something on the lighter end that isn't too heavy, get these!  HOUSE BLACK DAAL (å£5.90). A Dishoom Signature Dish-Dark, Rich, Deeply Flavoured. It is Cooked Over 24 hours for Extra Harmony. This was absolutely delicious. I didn't know what to expect. We ordered a medium spice level which was perfect. It went so well with the biryani. I definitely recommend getting this dish.   JACKFRUIT BIRYANI (å£8.90). Delicious, Savoury Jackfruit and Delicately Saffron'd Rice, Patted and Cooked with Mint, Coriander, and Sultanas. I loved this dish. It's different than the usual biryani you get at other restaurants. There was so much flavor and surprisingly, the jackfruit tasted like there was meat in it. It's a great dish for the vegetarian and awesome with curry.  GUNPOWDER POTATOES (å£6.50). The seduction is in the Tumble. Potatoes with Brown Skins, Smoky-Grilled, Broken Apart, Tossed with Butter, Crushed Aromatic Seeds and Green Herbs. This is one of the most popular dishes at Dishoom. I thought it was good but not amazing. I mean, they're potatoes and I'd actually rather eat something that consists of curry. If you love potatoes though, you would enjoy these.  MY FAVORITE DISH. CHICKEN RUBY (å£9.50). A Good and Proper Curry Redolent with Spice and Flavour, Tender Chicken in a rich silky 'makhani'sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. I love freakin curry and this is by far, one of the best ones. It's similar to a tikka masala but better than what you would get anywhere in the States. It's rich and creamy and if you love tikka masala, you definitely should get this.  SPICY LAMB CHOPS (å£11.90). They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice and jiggery, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. Blackened by the Grill, but Juicy inside. I thought these were good but I've had better at Tayyabs. The chops had a lot of flavor, and it was grilled nicely, but it wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. Regardless though, I would still order it.  HOUSE CHAI (å£2.50). All things nice: warming comfort and satisfying spice. Made in the proper way. All who have tried it are swearing by it. This was delicious. It was creamy, smooth and had all the right spices. If you're a chai drinker, you'd love this warm drink.  Overall, I loved Dishoom. For Indian food with a twist, this is the place to go. It's not super traditional, but they do have traditional dishes. The space is amazing and the service was pretty good. The waiter was insisting I visit again the next morning, but I couldn't. I wish I did since their breakfast menu looked amazing and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes and it's a great place for a get together. If you're ever in London, hit up this spot. for other reviews, check out thefoodseeker dot com",1,1,1,,
16,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"You can't go to London and not go to Dishoom. It's a fundamental rule of visiting London, in my opinion. If you haven't yet, you should consider trying out their breakfast options, because they really are delicious. The bacon and egg naan possibly changed my life. Plus, free refills on chai to wash down that spice.",1,1,1,,
17,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"We need Dishoom on the UWS in NYC. This was my second visit to a Dishoom, with the first three years ago in Covent Garden. The food was very good to excellent. The service was friendly, attentive, and thoughtful. I liked my gin gimlet. This is accessible Indian food at fair prices in a comfortable, contemporary setting. (12 May 18)TIP: Ground floor seating was very good to fair because a change to the bar seating was underway. The seating on -1, the lower level, appeared cozy and desirable, especially the high tops near the bar. The lower level bar had no seating of its own.",1,1,1,,
18,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"This plane is fabulous! You can't throw rock in London without hitting an Indian restaurant, but most of them are suitable for takeaway when you don't want to cook dinner, but not much more. Dishoom actually has chai and it's excellent. The lamb boti kabab and gunpowder potatoes were both delicious and unlike anything we'd had in other Indian restaurants.",1,1,1,,
19,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Dishoom was definitely good, but in not bought into the hype that it is ""the best Indian food"" in London.  I think maybe my expectation was wrong, but the place where I thought this restaurant did best was the more modern interpretation of Indian food which at times bordered more on fusion.  Definitely worth a visit (prepare to stand in line!!!) but check out the menu first to set your expectations around what you're getting.All that being said I enjoyed our meal here.  Service was super friendly and helpful.",1,1,1,,
20,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Whether you're a local or a tourist, there's no way you wouldn't have heard of Dishoom - because it's one of the best places to have Indian food in London. Dishoom is widely known for the thoughtfully curated modern Indian cuisine and the interior design of its restaurants.Unfortunately they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 people and the wait can be long but not to fret, all locations have a bar area inside for those who are waiting for a table to grab some drinks first. Try the Calaba Colada, it's like a pina colada with a Bombay twist and trust me, the 45 minute wait won't feel long at all.Shortly after being seated, you'll get a pretty extensive menu printed on a double sided A3 paper. I'll make this easy for you - for a classic curry, what you should try is the Chicken Ruby. This is rich and flavorful, and the chicken is incredibly tender. You'll get a ton of curry sauce so help yourself to some slow cooked and aromatic biryani. I recommend either the Awadhi Lamb Biryani or the Jackfruit Biryani. I'm a huge fan of both and it's great for sharing. For sides, I like the Gunpowder Potatoes - they're smokey and aromatic with a slight kick to your taste buds. For those who can't pass on paneer at an Indian restaurant, the Mattar Paneer is the way to go. It's rich and flavorful, you can't go wrong with this. And if you find that you have a ton of extra sauce left, a garlic naan or the handkerchief-thin roti is great for this.  On their menu, you'll also find the specials which are seasonal and usually great for big groups. I got to try the pulled lamb shank on the bone once and it was super tender, spicey and delicious! I highly recommend checking out Dishoom, it definitely lives up to the hype. And don't forget to ask for some of their complimentary chutney!",1,1,1,,
21,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Came here based on a recommendation from one of the GF's college friends. We waited about 15 minutes outside, but they give you complimentary house chai for you to sip on. Very delicious and I wish I had taken more than 1 cup of the chai. Once inside, we were handed a buzzer/pager ushered downstairs to the bar where we waited another 30-40 minutes for a table. There the GF and I shared a beer. After waiting we were again ushered upstairs to a table where we ate. We ordered 5 things for å£41, and the thing I liked the most was the Dishoom Calamari and the Black House Daal.This is by far one of the better spots in London. People in NYC recommend it. While not the MOST AUTHENTIC, it the food does live up to the hype.",1,1,1,,
22,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Among the top things I recommend when friends go to London. Loved this place so much that we had to go multiple times when we visited. The housemade chai is delicious. And they also have their own IPA, brewed by Mondo Brewing. It's served bottled though. For starters, the vada pau was great. Even for a soft bun item, it had great texture because of the fried pea sprinkles and I slathered it with the cilantro chutney. More buns came via pau bhaji, which didn't seem to be much at first but it was dense, creamy, savory. Excellent savory app. As for some main dishes, I loved the awani lamb biryani, especially with the spices in it. The chicken ruby, another excellent dish. Creamy, buttery, melt in the mouth chicken. the garlic naan went perfectly with the whole meal.As for breakfast, we had chai and coffee and the big bombay breakfast, which had masala baked beans, half roasted tomato & mushrooms - both tangy. There was bacon and sausages. There was akuri, a type of scrambled egg. More buns came with this. The breakfast naan rolls were filling too. We had a sausage & egg one. Much saucier than I anticipated.",1,1,1,,
23,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Went for a friend's birthday lunch, and everything was great. We had the set menu, which included an assortment of nibbles and mains and sides, all of which were served in turn and in generous portions. Unfortunately, they ran out of one of the desserts, so we had only the three flavours of Indian style popsicle to choose from. Nonetheless, all was good and I quite enjoyed my mango popsicle. Service was excellent. They brought everything out promptly and went out of their way to assist us in various things, ranging extra drinks for select ones of us to helping charge my mobile in their office. The staff were friendly through to the end. A great different nice staff can make, especially for a part of c20 people. Ambience was also fab. Typical Dishoom style interior, but I appreciated how they paid attention to the details of maintaining the ""old"" and the history, amidst the modern infrastructure.",1,1,1,,
24,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishooooom!!!!!! If you've ever passed by one, you've probably noticed this is the place to go in London. While the wait does take up a bit of time (and reservations aren't accepted) the staff are available with complimentary glasses of the house chai to sip on while you wait until you get to the bar. Everything we had was delicious. The star for me was definitely the black daal. Everyone who works there is also extremely friendly!  While this may not be the most authentic Indian food, I can definitely appreciate the cuisine they are producing at a very reasonable price. It lives up to the hype!",1,1,1,,
25,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"This was our first great meal in London. The restaurant is in old factory but whoever redesigned the whole thing deserves a medal - super stylish and somehow all the elements of the old, new, and foreign mix perfectly together.We had a wait a tiny bit but the place was packed on a Sunday lunch. My buddy and I ordered the following:vegetarian samosachicken ricegarlic naanlamb kabobEverything was top notch but the lamb kabob was outrageously delicious. Super moist and tender and full of spices that popped.The have a few of these place in London but it's hard to see the other spots topping this place. Highly recommended.",1,1,1,,
26,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Easily the best Indian restaurant in existence insofar as Ive had.  I thought id had indian food before i came here.  The cocktails were great.  I ordered off the menu twice and they did it right.  The black daal is really yummy.  Try it, even if you are there for a drink itd be well worth it as a snack.Lamb stew, cooked greens and tikka mahi are all good.  Their red chutney which goes with the fried things as an appetizer is out of the world good.The place has a cool 1800s indian railway theme going jn the decor department.Absolutely a wonderful place.  Well worth a planned night out.  Go here and prepare to be impressed.",1,1,1,,
27,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I've been to India. I've eaten real Indian food. The spices here were incredible.

Insanely delicious",1,1,1,,

This is the best Indian food I had in my life ( outside of India of course) if you like indian food this place is a must. You will regret going somewhere else !!!,1,1,1,,
29,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,This is my new favorite breakfast place! I am a big breakfast girl and between the decor and the tasty originality of the food here I give this place 5 stars. We made a reservation for 4 at 11 am on Sunday and was seated right away. The server was lovely and kept refilling my house chai which was delicious! I will make sure I come back here every time I am in town!,1,1,1,,
30,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I dare you to walk by a Dishoom and not go in after you've eaten here once. Go on, give it a try; I'll wait.This place is beyond wonderful. I can't think of a single thing wrong with Dishoom. The service is grand, this particular location is stunning, and the flavors are everything that I crave.Be warned: the queue can be quite long. Two times I was in, we came right before the rush but alas, the third time, the line seemed to go on forever and didn't make it in. (They serve drinks outside for you, as a little teaser to the excellence inside.)During dinner, we sat at the bar on the main level and felt right where I needed to be. This place is beautiful and though I haven't been to Mumbai, I'd like to think that this is how it must look. Sigh. I started with their take on an Old Fashioned. Don't know why I'm drinking these, they're a little sweet for my taste, but the presentation here is sure delightful: served in a small apothecary-like bottle with the ice on the side, it wasn't very strong but that was fine by me.The dinner menu looked incredible but we didn't want to overdo it. We had the Murgh Malai, chicken marinated overnight in garlic and other tastiness. Yum! The roti is thin and made a great spoon to sup the House Black Daal (black lentils) and wooosh it was delicious! To keep things light, we also had the Paneer and Mango salad. The crispy shallot crumbs elevated the salad. Breakfast at Dishoom. Oh dear. I didn't want to leave. This time we sat on the top floor. It was early so it was slower than usual. My guy ordered the chai while I opted for the fresh-squeezed Pineapple, lime, and black pepper juice. It was so very good and not as acidic as it sounds. We also enjoyed the Bun Maska, which was like a toasted sweet roll with a thick layer of BUTTER inside. Its sole purpose in life is to be dunked into the side of Chai tea that came with it. Ooooooh The Bombay Omelet was beautiful, but was a little underwhelmed by the flavor. I ended up using the ketchup served on the side. So while you can pass on the omelet, do not miss the Kejriwal. Two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. Eggs in London are gorgeous, bright orange, and everywhere I eat, they're cooked to flowing yolk perfection. Theirs is no exception. For this dish, I laughed the ketchup right off the plate. Ugh. I want to go back. We don't have anything remotely like this at home. For a great atmosphere, service, food, and overall vibe, make Dishoom your next stop.",1,1,1,,
31,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I got this recommendation from a graduate student friend originally from India but living in the UK. Like his other recommendations as a foodie and a native it did not disappoint. Everything was amazing except the chicken biryani, which was just ok. I went back two days later for lunch to try a few more things. Order the lamb samosa, pau bhaji, chicken tikka roll, and the choli poori. Be prepared to queue for an hour. They will serve you free chai, mint tea, and sherry while in line, which can be out of the door. Once you get inside you can order a nice cocktail at the bar.",1,1,1,,
32,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"One of the better spots in London. This is authentic Indian cuisine with an amazingly beautiful and cozy interior and stellar customer service. Their menu is tapas style so everything is meant to be shared. You also eat in a magnificent order where the appetizers, main course/meat, and sides are built to complement each other in a stunning way.  I had the samosas, potatoes, fried okra, and garlic naan and they were good. The samosas were flavorful but I would have preferred a bit more spice (they were heavy on cinnamon and nutmeg). The okra was amazing and I typically hate okra. The garlic naan left a lot to be desired. It would have been better paired with a more flavorful rita. The service was the best part. Our server went out of her way to be accommodating and sweet. We went later in the evening after he dinner rush and she never made us feel like we had to hurry and she still had People sing happy birthday to me at the end of our meal. My recommendation is to call and determine how long the wait is before going. You'll wait for hours if you aren't prepared.",1,1,1,,
33,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Love this place! Came here a few times over the summer. Don't be intimidated by the long line outside - they are extremely efficient at moving people into tables and serving drinks (even complimentary tea) while you wait. If you're desperate not to wait, you'll have to come early (before 6pm).The cocktails are a real treat - take a look through the book. As far as food goes, here are my (veg) highlights:Okra friesBlack daalChole bhatura (amazing)The price point is great, and they're very accommodating about food allergies - I brought a gluten free person here and the staff was very helpful. In general the service is excellent.",1,1,1,,
34,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"This is the restaurant that has the following properties:1/ Everyone in New York suggested that I go here.2/ Is basically the only restaurant in London that people recommended I go to as I was deciding to move to London.And today...exactly one month into my time here in London - I've done it! I've gone! I would like to say a few things:1/ The food was very good. Like high quality stuff.2/ If you gave to me in a blindfold, tbh I'm not sure how to tell the difference between good and pretty good indian food and so I'm developing a palette which is why we're not at 5 stars yet.3/ There's always a massive line, but i think* you can make a reservation so I'm not sure why anyone waits in the line?4/ Favorite dish was the lentil dal on top of a bit of rice.5/ They also have really cute drinks like the chai punch. Comes in a cute 'peg' (glass bottle) which you pour out onto some solid ice cubes which gives it a look of whiskey (which is part of it).",1,1,1,,
35,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Thank you taking care of us last night with great food and even better drinks.  We ordered cocktails and beers.  Ambience is great.  Worth the one hour wait anytime.  Servers were professional and the tab was reasonable.   3 entrees, 1 garlic nan,  2 beers, and 2 cocktails came out to about 75 pounds.",1,1,1,,
36,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"We saw a bustling crowd here on Friday evening where the wait time was approximately 2 hours. Given the enthusiastic crowd, I knew that I must eat here! I made a reservation online for Sunday at 5pm. Tip - they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 after 5:45 PM! Sunday came and my gosh, this was some of the best Indian food I've eaten around the world! I've been to India and this food was amazing. Get the vegetable samosas, okra fries, naan and the chicken tikka were great. Looking forward to the next visit to London!",1,1,1,,
37,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Phenomenal! Our favorites were lamb chops, daal, curry Ruby chicken, gunpowder potatoes and Pau Bhaji. Absolutely worth the wait. They said 45min and we were seated in 20. If you're visiting London, don't miss it!",1,1,1,,
38,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Based on suggestions from our fellow Yelpers across the pond...we made a pointto try this place out.Although I was really pumped up to try their Breakfast naan, we didn't make iton time to try their breakfast menu.This location at Kings Cross is a pretty spiffy place. We really liked the waythe place is all laid out. Outdoor seating options are also available, but wastoo cold for our March visit to try. Note that this place can really get busy,so it's better if you have a reservation.As for our lunch visit here's what we tried:-- Far Far for starters. A crunchy, salty type of cracklings...really good!-- Dishoom Chicken Tikka...this is pure awesomeness-- Adwahi Lamb (Biryani)...flavorful and very tender-- Garlic Naan...soft and tasty-- Gadbad Mitha...its like mixed bowl of sugar goodnessThis place is a MUST visit if ever in the area. Would definitely be back.",1,1,1,,
39,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"It had been nearly four years since we'd enjoyed a Dishoom breakfast -- far too long. Thankfully, little had changed. The porridge and chai remain bottomless, the space vast, the lighting low, the service attentive, the Big Bombay delicious, the intention to read the Guardian we grabbed at the entrance outstripping the time we spent with the paper. It remains my favorite way to start a London day.",1,1,1,,
40,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"We had a little trouble locating the street but once we found it, we were delighted that the restaurant lived up to our expectations. We enjoyed some rose and cardamom lassi to cool down the spicy chicken ruby, house black daal, and the Dishoom take on the legendary Irani CafÌ© special chicken berry biryani with cranberries.",1,1,1,,
41,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Absolutely worth the hype! We got the Ruby Chicken, Mahi Tikka, Garlic naan, bowl of greens, and basmati rice. Not only is the food unbelievably good, but the atmosphere is SO cool - I felt transported to Bombay just walking through the doors. There's always a long wait, but my husband and I arrived at 5:30pm and got seated within 10 minutes - so if you want to get in quickly, go a bit early! Definitely recommend!!",1,1,1,,
42,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"""Two of us first tried coming for dinner on a Friday night, but the wait for 2 hours! We went online and made reservations for lunch the next day. They do not take dinner reservations under a certain amount of people (I think 6 people). When we were finally seated, the menu was a bit overwhelming because everything sounded so good! We opted for the lamb samosa, chicken tikka masala, veggie biryani, braised lamb that came with naan, and a side of roti. Oh my goodness, we ordered way too much food for 2 people! The tikka masala was juicy! The braised lamb was AMAZING, and by far my favorite dish. The meat fell off the bone. The sauce was so flavorful. All I wanted to do is soak my naan in the sauce!! Overall, if we had to wait an hour, it was definitely worth it. Just plan ahead and make reservations if you can't wait. I'm not sure if the lamb was a special dish for the night or not, but if it's on the menu, order it! You won't regret it. """,1,1,1,,
43,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I've had my fair share of Indian food and they really aren't kidding when they say get Indian food when you visit London! The spices, the flavor, the cook of everything was fantastic. My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after having to wait over an hour at another location and couldn't pass up this opportunity. They send you inside to wait at the bar, which is nice. When we were ordering, they explained the menu. It was suggested that we get 3-4 dishes per person since it's quite small. We got 1 order of garlic naan, 1 order of rice, chicken ruby, mahi tikka, house black daal, dishoom calamari, roomali roti. (I don't/can't eat spicy foods so none of these dishes are spicy!) We didn't order a single thing that we disliked. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The only thing I wish they could do it tailor things to people's spice levels, but there were plenty of delicious dishes I had anyway! I highly suggest coming and waiting because it's worth the wait!!!PS: get the house black daal, it'll change your life :)",1,1,1,,
44,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,Awadhi lamb has a settle but good flavor of Indian spices. The lamb was super tender and good flavor. Also the Chicken Ruby has a sweeter sauce and the chicken is tender as it compliments the sauce. The food here is great and the service is excellent.,1,1,1,,
45,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"This is probably one of the best Indian restaurants that I have ever been to. It is obvious Dishoom makes everything fresh and they make a conscious effort to make every dish different from typical Indian restaurants.  Some of the most memorable dishes were the mahi tikka, spicy lamb chops and gunpowder potatoes. We felt the grills were a bit better than the mains. We also tried their breakfast which was decent. The house chai is amazing and the best I have ever had.",1,1,1,,
46,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"I visited this restaurant twice in summer 2016 and 2017 with friends. In both occasions we had to queue for around an hour till seated. However the staff didn't spare any effort in making us comfortable while we waited. They offered us traditional Indian tea drinks all the time till we were directed to our table. I find myself obligated to mention the kindness of the staff and there willingness to help. The smile didn't depart their faces.There are two bars offering wide range of alcoholic drinks. Kingfisher beer is a very popular choice here. My friends liked the wine.The food is good but not excellent as some reviewers commented. I find it lacking a pinch of salt to kick out all those spices.I recommend this restaurants for groups of adults and those who want to enjoy a different atmosphere in London.",1,1,1,,
47,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Come in for dinner with a group of friends around 7pm. There was a line around the corner and we decided to join it. A very nice hostess walked down the line letting everyone know it would be about a 45 minute wait (I appreciated the honestly and prepared myself for the wait). Another very nice host walked down offering lemonade and chai to waiting guests. Once a table freed up at the bar area we were offered to come sit and order drinks while we waited for our table. A few minutes later, we were escorted to our table were the menu was explained. We ordered an assortment of dishes a total of 11 for a table of 4. The flavors were rich and went well together. We finished our meal with popsicles (I had the mango one and my husband had the pistachio) Best way to finish our meal. My hubby said the Chicken Tikka was the best he's ever had. The wait is worth it.

49,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,I'm glad we came here. The best Indian food I have ever had outside of India. Got their daal and murg chicken.,1,1,1,,
50,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"I had the ""Kejrwall"" (fried eggs on cheese bread) and the Bacon Naan Roll. Both very well done and tasty. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly.Definitely a good place where to have a (heavy) breakfast.",1,1,1,,

52,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,1,"Amazes me that people can say this is the best indian food in London. Surely what a travesty. stood in line for 1.5 hours, with about half outdoor while half indoor where they kept you downstairs and wanted you to partake in their cocktails offered. This was surely inauthentic indian food and overpriced for the portion. Their signature dish is daal which is basically lentils and costs very little to make. Everything is significantly overpriced and made to suit westerners. You don't see any actual Indians eating here, of course they are the smart ones and the Brits that do eat here are either gullible or patsys. The lamb chops we got were burnt to a crisp and the naan and roti we got was horribly overpriced was neither crispy, flavorful, nor appropriately portioned.",-1,-1,1,,

Wanted a second order of it but I was stuffed. Make sure to order naan or rice because these dishes don't come with either. I opted for the garlic naan and it was great!Black house daal (4/5): now although this is the ""house special"" I didn't think it was particularly good. It's mostly lentils in there and the sauce wasn't really my favorite.Overall, nice ambiance and good service. Worth a try!",1,1,1,,
56,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,Omg!!this is the best food ever!!! I will never have anything like this unless I go here. We waited in line to enter the place which they gave us little shot of drinks/alcohol. Then after that line your brought into a room where you can order appetizers which we did and it was great. We finally get seated for dinner and man that dinner was the most amazing dinner I have ever eaten. I can't remember what we ordered because a friend ordered it for us. I tell everyone if you go to London you have to go here if you like foods from India and the experience alone should get you here. The place is a really cool atmosphere too so a plus all the way. I can't say enough about this place,1,1,1,,
57,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I freaking loved this restaurant. Hands down a five star meal. Having a lot of Indian friends has pushed me to try Indian food a lot and this was by far one of my favorite meals. We ordered the vegetable samosas to start, the house special daal, the dishoom chicken tikka masala, the naan and garlic naan, and the murgh malai. The murgh malai and the daal were probably my favorite dishes but I honestly enjoyed everything I ordered. The samosas were hot and flavorful, the daal was perfect, and the naan tasted almost like homemade naan. Be warned that they charge å£3.50 for water so you might as well order their chai tea. Definitely give this a try if you're in the area! Not only was the food good but the ambience was perfect as well.",1,1,1,,

59,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"This was my first time trying Indian food, and I'm so glad it was at Dishoom.I was visiting from Boston and Dishoom was recommended by colleagues who are from the area. I've heard Indian food is great in London, so I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed.We went at around 6:30 on a Thursday and waited for an hour for a table. We didn't mind because they have a great bar downstairs that they bring everyone who is waiting to be seated. The atmosphere is very cool at the bar and in the restaurant in general. Waiting for an hour didn't seem too bad because of the great cocktail list they have.We had heard that a lot of people usually split plates, but since we all had different preferences, we got our own. I had the lamb with the bowl of greens and garlic naan. All of it was fantastic. Others at the table got the cheesy naan and they said that was also great.It wouldn't be a place that I was a regular at since it's always so busy, but it's a really fun place to go with a group, and the food is very good.",1,1,1,,

It is one of the most gorgeous restaurants in London (specifically this location) and staffed with the loveliest people. The food is out of this world. I wish I had two stomachs so I could've tried more things. We started with the lamb samosas which were amazing: crispy, not greasy, and spiced to perfection. There were three sauces that went from mild, medium to spicy and I preferred the slightly sweet mild sauce. Next was the house chai. This is the best chai I've ever had so far. It was so good I forgot to take a picture until it was just a few drops at the bottom of the glass. For our mains we had mattar paneer and mahi tikka with garlic naan. The vegetarian curry was the perfect level of spiciness for me (mild) and I inhaled it quite quickly. The garlic naan was perfect to mop it up with. The mahi was so good. It was clearly very fresh and done perfectly.I also tried the mango and fennel lassi and the pistachio kulfi. A kulfi is pretty much a lassi in popsicle form. It was a lovely way to cool things down and satisfy my sweet tooth.I dare say we had a perfect dinner.",1,1,1,,

They have an excellent selection of cocktail. The staff is friendly, attentive, yet casual.  The environment is stylish without trying too hard.  Expect a wait, no matter what time of day you go.

You can grab a meal or get afternoon drinks or even work away on your laptop (lots of outlets and free wifi too!). A real communal place.I came for their Indian style breakfasts. Hubby and I split The Big Bombay - an Indian take on the classic English breakfast - and on a whim I ordered the bacon naan roll to boot.* The Big Bombay (scrambled eggs, 4 slices streaky bacon, 2 sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushrooms, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns å£11.50) - sounded terrific but wasn't quite as good in person. The bacon and sausage were good though I liked the bacon more than the sausage. The scrambled eggs, baked beans and pau buns were okay. The grilled field mushrooms were really good. It didn't really add up to anything memorable though. Just bits and pieces of good and okay food. 3.5 stars* bacon naan roll (4 pieces of naan bread wrapped about slices of streaky bacon smeared with tomato chili jam å£5.50) - simply the BEST naan I've ever had. Reminded me a lot of the pizza crusts that come out of those fancy brick ovens. The bread was chewy and charred deliciousness. I would come back simply to get an order of those to gnaw on. The bacon and tomato chili jam were a great addition. 5 starsHubby and I both agreed the bacon naan roll was the star of the show. It's so good that if I ever came back I'd probably just order it again and ignore the rest of the menu.",1,1,1,,

You wait in line (because it's really crowded), however they serve you drinks while you're waiting. Once you actually get inside the building they take you downstairs to the bar area, which reminds me of a Disneyland themed dark, old school, yet modern dungeon.

The interior itself is beautiful, with a short description of the history of the building at the bottom of the menu. There are a ton of options and the menu is labeled with spicy, vegetarian, and other descriptors (our waiter even offered us vegan or gluten free menus upon request)! Everyone was very happy with their meals- I had the chicken ruby (the flavor was nice but the meat was a little darker/fatty than I had expected) but after seeing what my friends ate I would try the biryani next time! Overall a great experience with naan and roti flowing, made even better by friendly, quick, and accommodating service in a lovely atmosphere.",1,1,1,,
73,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Still the best modern Indian food place in London. We come here every single time we come to London.  This time we got the naali nihari, the naan,the roti, the lamb samosas, and the dishoom calamari.  The lamb samosas were small but tasty. The calamari was a tad bit salty.  However, the Star was totally the nali nihari. Spicy, rich sauce with a tender lamb.The roti was so soft and thin... it was perfect to sop up the sauce to he nihari.  Only bad point was the service; slow and aloof.  Can't wait to go back to London for our next visit to dishoom",1,1,1,,
74,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"I still find Dishoom's portion sizes to be rather small, but my brunch experience was pleasantly good. The waiter comped all of us bottomless chai and a virgin bloody Mary, and gave each of us a voucher for a free tipper and breakfast.I like food from the dinner menu more, but it's a nice place to chill for brunch.",1,1,1,,
75,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Amazing Amazing place!! It is modeled after old Irani cafes and Railway canteens in Mumbai during the British Raj. The attention to detail in the decor is stunning! Even more stunning is the authenticity of the food! We got the Chili cheese toast, Keema Pav, Chole Puri with halwa and the Paneer Rolls along with Kala Katta sherbet and Mango lassi. Each and every item was brilliant - the mango lassi was light and refreshing- just like what we get in India!",1,1,1,,
76,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,Vegetable samosa's and gunpowder potatoes were fantastic. Definitely one of the best Indian places that I've been to in London. Great service and location as well! Good place to go to whether you're eating out with your family or hosting an event.,1,1,1,,
77,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"We waited an hour in line, but they were so hospitable and served hot chai and sherry to those waiting, and it was a cold night, and they came back several more times with more warming drinks, what a great way to start. Once inside, the place is very spacious and cozy, three levels of dining and drinking, all buzzing with happy customers. Everything we ordered lived up to my dreams of having a great Indian meal while in London. The service is great, drinks also good, and the whole experience felt like a party. I'd definitely recommend this place and wish they would open an outpost in San Francisco!",1,1,1,,
78,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"My favorite Dishoom! (Also the first one we'd been to!) We had a wonderful server who upon hearing we were vegetarians recommended the Pau Bhaji as it was his favorite dish on the menu. It was perfectly delicious! Tried it at a different Dishoom later and it was not the same! We paired it with a rose lassi and a mango lassi. And shared the Mattar Paneer with rice. The rose lassi was surprisingly great, we wish we could recreate it at home. Everything was delicious, the service was nice + friendly and the ambient was lovely. We would definitely come back.",1,1,1,,
79,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Being use to Indian food, I wonder if this place would give me the taste I like. First you enter and the place is huge. You can't tell who are the waiter compared to the customers but you get nicely welcome and invited to wait in some comfy seat with a buzzer to let you know when you table is ready. Once seated, the lady explained and advice on the menu. And we are ready to share Indian food and have a nice time. Everything we tried except the fish where tasty.The drink especially the lassy was excellent. I am not disappointed at all by this place and would highly recommend it. Some people might say it's not as spicy as in India but still the taste is there and we love it!",1,1,-1,,
80,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Went there for dinner when on a trip to London. Easily one of the best Indian meals I've had, from the fluffy slightly charred naan bread to the fragrant rich curry. I cannot understand how they can make food taste like this. Everything was so good. We had the chicken ruby, sheekh kebab (lamb), paneer tikka (charred cheese) and of course naan. Way too much for two people but they're so good.The wait gets a bit insane unless you come here at odd hours.",1,1,1,,
81,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"A delight to the eyes, stomach but not the wallet.What an amazing looking place! Sure we had to queue for an hour to get in but they served us mint tea and sherry while we waited out in the cold October air. I just couldn't get myself to hate such a nice deed..  after all it was our decision to stay!Getting in we were told that we had to wait a bit longer until the electronic buzzer on the caller went off and someone came and collected us. So we waited and helped ourselves to the exotically named cocktails. Mine was a ""Bombay"" Colada.. whis is an Indian spiced pina Colada. I did ask for a Mai tai first but learned that the whole idea of Dhishooms was about Bombay and the food and drinks from there.When we were taken to the seats we were told that its best to order food to share so we did:Lamb chops: these were exquisitely grilled with a coating of spice but the gamey taste of the lamb was somewhat retained. I am not a big fan of the lamb being gamey but this was acceptable. The pieces were thicker than I expected and biting into it I tasted the fat which was delicious. I was thinking initially that I have tasted better but in reality I had tasted different as this was unique and as equally as good as I have tasted on commercial road. Black Dhal: wow! Tasted amazing and a great accompaniment to my butter narn. The Dhal reminded me of a black bean but the sauce was thick and rich like a vindaloo without the heat. Paneer: sadly disappointing as I felt it was under done but maybe it's the way they do it in Bombay. Chicken: sadly it was so average I forget what it exactly was called. Vegetables: again some spiced boiled vegetables. Nothing to shout about.The place by the way is huge and is styled like an indian resthouse with everything relating to a Mumbai from the 1950s. A sheer joy to be in and with lots of atmosphere. My only question  is if they have a Hindi menu which might be more special.",1,-1,1,,
82,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Great Bombay food. Exotic. Portion size is not very Bombay-like though. But not complaining as quality more than made up for it. More here: bengalibiped.blogspot.co‰Û_",1,-1,1,,
83,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Such a great Indian spot. We came here with a large party for a company dinner and we had such great food. There was a great variety of food options for vegetarians and people with dietary restrictions. They had a great, diverse drink menu.",1,1,1,,
84,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,This place is huge and very cool design.  The food is really put together with care and quality ingredients. The cheese and garlic Naan were both tasty. The okra fries were crunchy and light. The paneer was my favorite! The curries were good also. The lamb biryani was flavorful. Everything we ate had a lot of flavor.  I also loved the pistachio kulfi... so creamy!! Get the kulfi!,1,1,1,,
85,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"The area behind Kings Cross is changing with food choices now expanding beyond Caravan and the Grain Store on Granary Square.  Exciting stuff, where will it all end?!I've been to a couple of the other branches of Dishoom across London and really like the concept which, according to the blurb, is based on the old Iranian coffee shops around Bombay.  This translates into a great selection of interesting drinks and nibbles to be enjoyed throughout the day.I came here for a casual business meeting and we found a quiet lower table in the corner.  Free chai-fi :-)Only snacks on this occasion.  Ordering a chicken tikka sandwich sounds like a bit of a cop-out but the filling was truly delicious and very different from the generic flavouring prevalent in shop bought versions.  The chicken wasn't died red and beautifully spiced.  It came in a chappati which didn't really work that well for a wrap, especially as I tried to combat it with cutlery (this was a business meeting after all) - too tough and tha chappati won in that I didn't eat most of it.  The okkra fries are amazing and I know I'll find an excuse to order them with everything on future visits.Staff were very friendly but overly keen to clear empties.  I suppose Dishoom strives on a quick turnover and we may have overstayed our welcome a bit?",1,1,1,,
86,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"If you don't mind not being able to book & probably having to queue, Dishoom is really worthwhile.  Slick informal but very efficient & friendly service,  a young crowd, excellent food and interesting and delicious cocktails.  Food is not your average High St Indian, it's subtle but very tasty, portions smallish but it's not expensive so easy to order a variety.  A bit noisy but that's part of the general buzzy atmosphere. But the main attraction is authentic spicy Indian food unlike almost anything else you'll find, and well worth the wait/queue Unless it's raining - this is London, after all, so take an umbrella, though I was pleased to be offered one by the restaurant as I waited in the rain!",1,1,1,,
87,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Waited in line for two hours to eat here. Not sure if all location are this busy during weekday dinner time. We ordered a variety of dishes including the okra fries, bhel, chicken ruby, awadi lamb biryani, nalli nihari with bheja, roti, and garlic naan. My favorite was the chefs special nalli nihari with added bheja. The meat was so tender and flavorful. Also, I loved the okra fries. I wanted to order more fries at the end but I was just too full from all this food. Everything tasted great. Best Indian meal I ever had. I recommend coming here and getting that chefs special !",1,1,1,,
88,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,This was absolutely one of the best overall food experiences that we have ever had. A great introduction to Indian cuisine. The ambiance was perfect. Every single dish was flavorful and delicious. The service was exceptional as well. The waitress provided excellent recommendations based on our palette.,1,1,1,,
89,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"This place is totally cool! I went to the King's Cross location. It's so sceney and hip! You've gotta try it just for the hip London atmosphere! Never mind that the food is out of this world delicious!!We didn't have to wait for our table as long as we thought we would and when we got there, the service was great, friendly and informative, and the food was to die! It's what eating delicious Indian food in a super cool, impressively designed atmosphere should be! Everyone on the staff was incredible! They even gave us brunch coupons when we left, encouraging us to return. We were tourists, but the next time we are in London, we will definitely be back! Don't sleep on this place!",1,1,1,,
90,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,3,"This review is for BRUNCH! I have had dinner at dishoom and it has made me fall in LOVE with the whole Bombay cafe aesthetic. As always, the atmosphere that dishoom provides is unparalleled. You truly feel like you have stepped into another time and place. The music that they play can actually be purchased too, great for all those dishoom hardcore fans.I ordered seasonal fruits with yoghurt, along with an egg naan 'sandwich' of sorts. The yoghurt was both creamy and flavoursome, with hints of vanilla coming through. The naan was good, but not the amazing I have come to expect at a restaurant like this. The naan was a little on the hard side, and the chutney along with the egg did not offer tastes that were new or unique. Maybe dishoom is just too good for their own sake. I would vote this place as a top 10 London dining experience. Though if you can, go at a later time. Dinner time.",-1,1,1,,
91,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Fantastic food.We ordered a bunch of dishes to share between 4 adults and 1 child and I loved every bite.My favorites were the Grilled Masala Prawns, the Mahi Tikka, the Chole Frankie, the Gunpowder Potatoes and the buttered naan bread. So yummy!That red spicy dip on the table was also incredibly good.I can't award 5 stars though cause they made several mistakes on our bill that needed to be corrected.",1,1,1,,
92,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Best Indian food ever.... lamb chops - tender... kheema pav - must try. Awadi biryani cooked in the pot. I don't drink, but tried Bombay colada and sugar cane juice... yum. Unique desserts- chocolate pudding w Kashmiri chillie ice-cream.. goes in sweet and then the spice hits you... very addictive. Also, try pineapple crumble w crushed pepper.. a taste to remember... All of this w a great ambiance!!!",1,1,1,,
93,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I had been meaning to try Dishoom for quite some time but had always been too impatient to wait in line. They don't take reservations for the evening but by chance we found that it was possible to make a lunchtime booking. One of our friends was visiting from the States and it seemed like the ideal opportunity to check out Dishoom. The venue was a large open space spread over many levels and the smell of Indian food hits you as you walk through the door more than whetting the appetite. Our server was good at explaining the menu and gave good suggestions on what to order. It seemed like Indian tapas so we ordered a wide range of dishes which we all shared. The highlights were the vegetable samosas, gunpowder potatoes, the Black House Daal and the chicken ruby. There was also a good fish curry which I can't remember the name of. Everything we ordered was eaten.It lives up to the hype, definitely worth the wait although I would book a lunch slot if I ever went again!",1,1,1,,
94,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Excellent choice for Indian - love the authentic, traditional Chai served in a glass.  Tried a few basic dishes, everything was great.  Restaurant is in an old renovated warehouse space, very cool spot.  Blazing fast free ""ChaiFi"" which is nice.  I'll definitely be back...",1,1,1,,
95,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,3,"I was pretty disappointed with my visit to Dishoom King's Cross. I have been to the Soho location and had a great experience so I was looking forward to my friday night Dishoom plans with eager anticipation. We arrived at around 6:15 and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we headed down to the bar. I ordered a mango lassi at the bar and was underwhelmed by the drink. It was too sour and weak on the mango taste. We were seated in the basement space which is quite dark but the booths are quite charming and comfortable. I ordered the Bhel to start which was soggy and missing the ""chatpatta"" flavour of a good Bhel. The pommegranet seeds were a great addition though. For my main I got the mattar paneer and Naan. The curry was great - no complaints. However my naan was not warm when it arrived. This sucks because we all know that a good naan is best consumed hot!My dining partners were surprised that the Ruby Chicken was packed with a spicy punch while the Lamb Biryani wasn't too spicy though it was marked as such on the menu. It's frustrating because you should be able to trust the spice levels on the menu. They were very happy with their roomali roti which was great! My theory is that since we were seated in the basement the food was sitting in the kitchens for a bit before it got brought down. This sucks because it lessens the food experience. Now overall upto this point I would have given this experience a 4 star review. However - when the check came the waiter had added an ""optional 12.5% tip"" onto our bill. When I asked him about it he said it was ""optional"" and there as a recommendation but it had been added into our total which made no sense. So either the waiter was backtracking after being caught in a lie or Dishoom writes their bills where they give the big bold total with an optional tip added in. Regardless of which it is - I really disliked the lack of honesty with the process. I'm from Canada so tipping is actually a very normal thing. However, it shouldn't be added to the bill without being told! Will probably be back for the food and will definitely be checking the bill!",-1,1,1,,
96,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"First trip to london. On a rainy evening, we headed drenched in rain towards dishoom. There was a long wait outside but we were greeted with chai and umbrella. we were initially taken down to the bar area but our table was soon ready. the food was probably the best indian food i have eaten outside of india. highly recommend this place",1,1,1,,
97,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Their Indian brunch game is pretty off the rails at Dishoom. This leads me to think that all of the food here is great. They are putting a modern spin on Indian cuisine, like putting spices and flavors into things that you wouldn't normally associate with Indian. Their cocktail game is pretty tight also, same concept. It's modern, hip, and decorated in English-influenced colonial Indian style, so it's pretty interesting inside. And, it's only about a 10 minute walk to the train station, so if you have some extra time... pop over for at least a cocktail.",1,1,1,,
98,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I'm really enjoying my trip to Europe so far because there are a lot of additions to my 5 star list of restaurants. This was the only 5 star (in my opinion) restaurant that I ate at in London and I have to say that this place is actually incredible. If you want any indicator that this place is great, almost every day there are scores of people lined up outside waiting to get in and get a taste of this delicious meal. We got there at around 5pm and didn't have to wait (we had to head to a show afterwards) so that was fortunate for us! I personally ordered the calamari, Dishoom chicken tikka, garlic naan, and one of their mango ice cream desserts. The calamari was one of my top five calamaris that I've ever had because the flavors and spices gave it a little kick that made the dish perfect. It also had a nice crispiness to it which I loved. The garlic naan paired nicely with the chicken tikka because it balanced out the spiciness of the chicken (which, in all fairness, was not that spicy). Finally, the dessert was fantastic as well. The prices were also pretty decent for a place this good so you should either come early and eat delicious food or wait in line and then eat delicious food. Either way, you have to eat at this place.",1,1,1,,
99,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,Probably my favorite place to eat in London. Had to go there more than one time during my trip. The first time I went I got the lamb with rice. The second time I went I got some brunch. Both times the food was excellent. Definitely a must go place when in London.,1,1,1,,

101,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,1,"i propa hate eating desi food in this country. Nothing is spiced accordingly and they do some blasphemous things to a beautiful and rich cuisine. honestly if you're indian don't eat Indian food in england, especially in Central London. i prefer restaurants in the West end and in East London. Even though they're mostly bengali owned at least they know how to SPICE THE DAMN FOOD NOT EVERYTHING TASTES LIKE ITS MADE OF MALAI....ALSO WHY THE EFF DO U THINK BACON AND EGG NAAN IS A GOOD IDEA???

102,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,The food was outstanding! I tell people that I don't like Indian food but this place completely changed that story. Had no idea how good it really could be.,1,1,1,,
103,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"We waited 1 1/2 hours on line outside in the cold to get into the bar area and another 1/2 hour to get into the restaurant and it was worth it! Incredibly delicious food and warm and welcoming service from everyone we encountered. They even served warm chai and mint water to people waiting in line outside while thanking us for our patience and loyalty to the restaurant. My friend Meredith was so kind for sharing one of her favorite places with me! It's near the Kings Cross station.  Had vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, chili cheese toast, garlic naan, bowl of greens, matter paneer and basmati rice.",1,1,1,,
104,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"I'm going to give them 4, only because of their sneaky 12,5% service charge pre added to the bill. More and more places are doing this now and I'm not okay with it. Put a suggestion, but already added to the bill? No-no. 4å£ tip for a 25å£ breakfast is HUGE! The food was delicious, I had the sausage and egg naan which was everything I expected, with a freshly squeezed orange juice. This dish is my new FAVE and will be my first stop the second I step off the Eurostar. My partner had the big Bombay breakfast which for him, needed slightly more on the plate to be a real big breakfast, but hey. The chocolate chai tea latte wasn't balanced so you couldn't taste the chai at all, unfortunate. The decor and mood is amazing, and (surprisingly!) they take breakfast reservations, although arriving at 9 and leaving at 10.30, there was definitely no need for them. Service overall was efficient and friendly enough, not enough to warrant me giving them a 4å£ tip though. A definite keeper and I look forward to returning.",1,1,1,,

We rolled by around 11am on a Saturday and got right in which was magical. Fantastic place as usual - great service (also really fast!), excellent food (those okra fries - yum!) and excellent ambiance. Not too loud for London so it was nice to actually have a conversation. I'm happy I live so close - I'll be back!",1,1,1,,
107,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I love Dishoom more than life itself. More than my two younger siblings and the woman that gave birth to me (and they really are the best). More than watching a Keith Moon, Slash, Bowie, Bruce Foxton, Mick Gallagher supergroup gig (oooh that was tough!). More than how my lil heart keeps me alive (I'd swap an egg naan roll for a portion of heart any day of the week). More than....well everything. Honest. Ok, so the service isn't always the quickest but strangely that only seems to be the case when the restaurant is quiet, during peak times it works like clockwork. And yep sometimes it can be quicker to run the London marathon, twice, rather than queue and wait for a table but whats an hour or two in a queue right in return for a Dishoom chip butty!? ('Vada Pau' if you were wondering). The food, in particular the breakfast menu, is amazing. Great quality, and tasty. Don't expect your usual local curry house menu. The portions for dinner aren't overly huge so you may want to order a side or two to go with them. I've eaten here for breakfast about 15 or so times now and it's definitely a favourite if not THE place to find me of a morning (oh hello there stalkerface). There's lots of choice for the lunch/dinner menu too. This particular Dishoom is a really airy building spread out on different floors, go and take a wander if you have time. I love all of the pictures of India on the walls. Its great for big groups here too. There's an awesome bar 'The Permit Room' on the lower floor where the toilets are that I haven't tried yet but looks great.My favourite dishes are: the infamous breakfast naan rolls (egg please), the breakfast Akuri (spicey scrambled eggs), the chai is good and unlimited (although I think that's only at breakfast time, anyone know?) The wraps are great for lunch too and pretty much any of the curries and naan breads for dinner are winners as well. Oh what the hell, just stay for the whole day with a good book and eat your way through all the menus. Ask for a breakfast loyalty card if you're not offered one, 5 breakfast visits and a stamp each time earns you a little thank you and a naan roll and some chai on your next visit. I was there last Tuesday, oh and Friday and will most probably be there on Monday. My face, coming to a Dishoom near you soon.",1,1,1,,
108,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"My husband and I have been waiting anxiously to eat here! I booked lunch reservations over a month ago, I really wanted to eat here for dinner but everything had been booked weeks in advance! We came all the way from the U.S (for sightseeing obviously) but I researched quite a bit about Indian restaurants and dishoom outbid the rest by bloggers and reviews. We were blown away by the ambiance, the vibe, the smells and sights of small gestures every where that will remind you of Bombay or India in general. The food is outstanding! You can't go wrong with ordering, we enjoyed the lamb samosas and chili cheese toasts for apps, my husband and I shared the paneer tikka, and we got a side order for cheese naan and basmati rice. Honestly everything was just perfect. Everything everyone else ordered looked perfect. The only downside is I wish we had saved room for dessert but were too stuffed to go any further. We will recommend this restaurant to all our family and friends who come to visit London. High five to the brains of this restaurant and compliments to the chef!",1,1,1,,
109,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Excellent place to eat Indian food in London. In general the food is not greasy and has a lot of flavor. Started with the okra fingers which were fried but not greasy, and a nice vegetarian starter. The chili cheese toast was a nice appetizer and came with 4 pieces of toast. The chicken tikka was grilled after being marinated as was the paneer tikka. The black daal was excellent as were the spicy lamb chops. No meal is complete without some rice and some naan, both of which were very good. Although a chain restaurant, this was one of the best Indian meals I've had in a long time.",1,1,1,,
110,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Tucked behind King's Cross, an amazing first dining experience in London for us.The two of us came for Sunday dinner, told that the wait was ~45min but we could wait downstairs at the bar. The downstairs area had a cool, lively atmosphere. There is no cell service, but they have free wifi to counter that problem. We ordered a Bombay Colada and an Edwina's Affair, the former being sweet and tangy, the latter being quite minty and refreshing. It wasn't even 30 min and we were already called for our table. We were seated on the main floor towards the back. With such a big menu - we got the Murg Malai and the Mahi Tikka (both Grill dishes). These were both very delicious and though the portions seemed small, they were very filling. We also got the Black House Daal signature, which wasn't that flavorful to our surprise. Overall, very price friendly and delicious flavors. We got 1 rice & 1 naan, but the naan was only 1 full piece so we had to order another. It was such a great meal, we came back a few days later. The second time coming, there was no wait as we came during a weekday for lunch around 11am. We got the Chicken Tikka (grill dish) and the Mattar Paneer (a curry). We loved both. We also ordered the masala chai, which comes with 5 refills. It was a drink packed with a strong, spicy flavour. It was delicious. The service was very good the first time we came - we were impressed since it was very busy but they did well in coming by frequently to check on us and the hosts at the door were great. For some reason during our second visit, they sat us at the very back with no other tables, even though there was a handful of tables available towards the front upstairs where everyone else was. We asked to be moved, which they did so kindly. They were not as attentive to getting us water refills and checking on us, though we still enjoyed our time.We didn't have the chance to come here for breakfast but would love to in the future. Highly recommended for anyone who wants some great Indian cuisine in a modern setting.",1,1,1,,

This type of buzz is certainly something I've never seen where I'm from (Bruxelles). Food is definitely 5-stars-worthy: I've rarely eaten such tender and tasteful pieces of chicken (Murgh Malai), their Dal is a classic, and I totally got why, same story goes for their special : a lamb stew slowly cooked for months, well maybe not but surely tasted like it. So YES, Food = delicious. But...What I'm not sure is if this very good indian food is worth the 1h30min wait (30min outside, 1 hour in their Permit Room). To be honest, I've heard such good things about London Indian's restaurants even before Dishoom existed...in a few words, I'm pretty sure I can find about the same quality in a more well, ""normal"" indian place I guess...not sure if their strategy will pay off in the long run.Anyway, the place looks like a Museum, team is lovely, and they even offer chai tea while you're waiting in the cold. Nice right ? PS : Trying their breakfast/brunch might be the best tip if you'd kill to go there, without the waiting the waiting part.",1,1,1,,
113,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Holy cow! Who would have thought you could have bacon and egg naan for breakfast! This is my first time having Indian for brekky and let me tell you, it was AWESOME! I had looked up Dishoom before I got to London and saw great reviews. I gotta agree with everyone that it was really good! Let me start with the chai - order once and get free top ups! But it was soo good! You could really taste the spices!! The way it should be!Now to the food!! Simply a really good twist to fusing Indian and western brekky. Think of it as instead of a sausage mcmuffin, you get a sausage naan!! Same with a bacon and egg naan!!Any ways, all in all great experience. The restaurant itself is really nice as well!",1,1,1,,
114,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Cool.Dishoom is one of those really hot restaurants (with multiple locations) in London currently that I didn't think I'd end up going to, but actually ended up going to. Service was mostly disingenuously friendly at first, especially after some initial confusion of whether or not it was permissible to order food at the bar. (The hostess had suggested it wasn't.) The bartender seemed cheerfully annoyed when we were not ready to order within 5 seconds of sitting down, as if he expected us to fire away our order despite lack of introduction to anything on the menu, which took some time to sift through. Not even halfway through our meal, where the dude had spent most of his energy avoiding eye-contact and chatting with other servers, he decided it was finally acceptable to desert us all-together, which was most fortunate because a better server took over. Enough about service, let's cut to the food --There were some good things at Dishoom. The standout was the ""ruby chicken,"" with a silky red sauce that you just want to leave nothing behind of by burying a piece of naan into, again and again. And then there were some forgettable things, like how a lassi is still just a lassi, which leaves no surprises. Overall, I thought the fare at Dishoom had some nice spices and flavoring going on. It was also fun to have the chance to taste many different, interesting sauces. Harsher criticism includes a mild irritation against servers who seem to have gotten caught up in their own personal aesthetics, putting on glassy smiles that match the shiny restaurant interior, which lest we forget, is still an imitation of the real thing at best. Aw look, I can be a douchebag for fun too.",1,-1,1,,
115,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Great brunch, tons of food for the price as well. The egg naan was great, and bun maska comes with a chai tea for dipping. The Bombay breakfast is enormous and the porridge is bottomless. And the best part is that it all tastes great and is only a  5 minute walk from Kings Cross!Food comes out working minutes due to electronic order taking, some outdoor seats available as well.",1,1,1,,
116,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Had heard a lot about Dishoom which tries to replicate quintessential Mumbai Cafe's and was surprised when we found one Tucked away behind Granary Square, Kings Cross. We decided to try it out and it was indeed a new one which had just opened.The Decor - from the moment you enter has a Indian touch, or rather a Mumbai (Bombay) feel to it with Hindi Scripts and Indian artefacts and humour. The music is retro Bollywood and the menu is local Mumbai. I found the dishes reasonably priced. I ordered a Dishum Chicken Tikka(å£7.50) and a portion of Cheense Nan (å£2.50). My fried decided to go light and ordered from the light bites - he ordered a Bhel (Street food made with Puffed Rice), Vada Pav (Check out my review of Sree Krishna Vada Pav) and a glass of Sugarcane Juice. We decided to share a portion of Gunpowder Potato(å£5.20) (Roasted Potatoes with hot chilli and spices). The food quickly arrived and literally blew me away! It had the heat and spiciness, the kind we get in an Indian restaurant in India! It was refreshing and there was no attempt made to tailor it to local palate. I looked around me and saw the majority of clientele were non-Indians and were obviously enjoying the food, a big change from the standard curry joints.The menu has only two curry dishes and all other stuff are authentic Indian stuff. The waiters are extremely friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.It was a bombardment of senses - I closed my eyes for an instant and The Decor, food, the smells of incense sticks and the old Bollywood songs transported me to my favourite Mumbai cafe. Highly recommended.PS :  Dishum are giving away å£10 vouchers to every visitor which can be redeemed between Jan and Mar at their Kings Cross Branch, minimum spend of å£40 required to claim.",1,1,1,,
117,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"So far I have loved every single Dishoom that has opened and if I may dare say it, it might be my favourite chain restaurant.Like their sisters the venue is massive consisting of three floors, up stairs for the formal restaurant, ground floor for the lounge and downstairs for the bar area. All children friendly though as I saw families with children  in every section. As we made a reservation and I highly recommend it if you want to be seated immediately, we were seated upstairs.With views over to the ground floor the place felt big and airy maximised by its high ceilings. Although I was quite confused to why the ceiling fans were still turned in the middle of Winter wasting electricity and not helping the place keep warm. The wooden decor was lovely though, dark mahogany with its spiral staircase and simple dangling lamp shades. Noise levels drown out and the seating layout allow you to wind down happily with your companions.As this was a breakfast date was my partner we went crazy and ordered the following:Sausage and egg naan roll. The dough had a lovely bite to it being stretchy and warm. The flavour almost creamy with a nice smokiness to it from the browning. It was filled with sausages that could have been cooked slightly less to have kept its lovely juices and bounce being quite dense. But the flavours and spices redeem itself and paired with the two delicious runny sunny side up and a good kick from the chilli jam I still enjoyed it very much.Chilli cheese toast with two fried egg. I found the cheese toast slightly on the overcooked side. But that's because I prefer my cheese more stretchy but the flavours were rich, well spiced and plentiful of herbs creating an extreme mix of flavours in one bite. Delicious. The runny yolk help add that beautiful moisture and earthiness that added to the tasty experience.Bombay omelette So much flavour! The minced meat was so beautifully spiced my tongue was trying to keep up with all the taste. I noticed a pattern here is that they like their things well done. The egg itself was slightly overcooked for me I found it lost its silkiness and became crisp. But once given all can be forgiven by the flavours and together eaten with the soft buttered toast, washed down with my chai tea it was totally awesome. Keema per eedu. A very rich spicy dish of minced chicken and liver pieces topped with potato chips and a runny egg. The only dish where I'm not complaining that something is overcooked. The tender pieces of chicken went really well against the softer smoother kidney pieces. Together with the crunches from the potato chips and soft runny egg the sensation in my mouth was amazing. The spices used was also incredibly fragrant and not just there for the kick. It was also served with soft fluffy buttered toasted buns which were helpful in reducing the heat. Delicious and very filling and wholesome.Although this is a brunch review I have also been for dinner and it was just as mind blowing and expressive. Whether it's for a date, casual dining or special celebration I'm sure Dishoom caters for everything. It's in such a location too, near Granary Square right beside the lovely canal. Service has been friendly every time I visit. Did I mention that if you order Chai Tea it comes unlimited? So awesome.",1,1,1,,
118,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"This Dishoom is a little bit less crowded than the Central London ones. I recommend going for brunch around 11AM and you may avoid the queue.

119,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,3,"I ordered the bacon naan for a quick breakfast take away and honestly I was quite disappointed. The naan bread was dry and there was barely any bacon. The bacon was good but also quite dry but not crispy.The only highlight was the tomato chutney which was amazing and I could have eaten it with a spoon.",-1,-1,-1,,

122,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"THIS. BRUNCH. Open at 9am weekends, Dishoom's expansive space is the holy grail of brunch in Kings Cross.  Our group of 3 tried almost all offerings on the menu, I can heartily vouch for: KEEMA PER EEDU: A Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicatemorsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs andsali crisp-chips. Served with pau. å£7.90. (SO RICH and delicious)HOUSE GRANOLA: A Dishoom recipe, handmade with oats, seeds, cashews, almonds, pistachios and cinnamon, toasted in butter and honey. Served with fresh fruits,Kerala-vanilla yoghurt and Buckinghamshire honey. å£5.20 (Your friends will say they'll share but they won't, everyone get their own granola -- you'll thank me!) The service was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. Flawless. It was an exceptional brunch, so much so that I've convinced my friends to go back next weekend. Pro tip: if you think you've had real chai...wait til you've tasted the glory of Dishoom's offering. It is comfort in a glass. I order a single espresso with it for a little kick, but they keep the chai coming (free of charge!) after you finished a glass. Pair with the Musaka bun (buttered bun) for dipping, and holy wow you've got yourself a winning breakfast treat.",1,1,1,,
123,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Is it weird when I give 5 stars but the daal makhani was the best dish on the menu? Yeah, sorta. But that's ok! The daal is really just that good. We also got tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, the lamb dish (similar to lamb jalfrezi) veggie korma, chicken biriyani, and samosas. Of all of them, I would recommend any, though the veg korma was not as mindblowing.Also they make great cocktails. Luckily (or semi-unluckily) the line (queue) was so long you'll have a chance to try a few before your meal. The first part of the line takes place outside. In the late fall chill, this kind of sucks but they do ply you with free sherry, mint tea and chai. The second part of the line is in the downstairs bar where you'll be temporarily seated and can order drinks and two snack options. Of the two, get the banana chips. The various chutneys are excellent.Once you're actually seated the good comes out quick too. It almost seems like a wonder the line is so long, given how fast they actually work, and the size of the place, but that just speaks to it's well earned popularity.",1,1,1,,
124,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Best Indian I have had in years. Eye for detail, great quality and meaningful decor. Def worth the 20mins wait.

125,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"We have been hearing phenomenal reviews about Dishoom from friends, and locals while visiting London, and decided to give it a go on Wednesday night.  Since we are staying near St. Pancras Station, we opted for the location in Kings Cross.  No reservations could be made for small parties so we just ventured out around 8 hoping to avoid any huge lines.  Unfortunately, this was not the case and we were promptly greeted with a line with a queue time of  1 hour.  This did not phase us or persuade us to leave due to the fact that these people were gathered here for a reason and we were ready to find out what that was.  As we waited in line, we were offered a water, hot mint tea or a sherry.  Since it was a little chilly, I opted for the hot mint tea.  After our complimentary drink in line, we had the option presented to us to sit at the bar and eat which we gladly accepted.  The atmosphere is a cozy, dim lit, Mombay-style setting.  Our bartender/waitress (Adele) was more than helpful when deciding on items to choose from very friendly during our visit. We ordered the Calamari and some vegetable samosas to start off with and they were instantly devoured.  Some of the best Calamari I have had while visiting London.  For the main course, we ordered the following: Mattar Paneer, Gunpowder Potatoes, Cheese Naan, Dishoom Slaw, and a side of rice.  EVERYTHING was superb.  It was hard not to keep ordering but this much food between 2 people was more than enough.  The food comes out quickly after placing the order so if I were to switch it up next time, I would stagger my orders a few more minutes in between dishes.  I can't wait to try the breakfast menu on my next visit.  It looks just as good and the Bloody Mary's look insane.",1,1,1,,
126,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"This is a revival of the Irani cafes of Bombay. Probably one of my favourite restaurant spots in London this year. No wonder they have expanded to include many other locations across the city. It was a somewhat lengthy, but fun experience. They have worked out the waiting experience pretty well. You will be served complimentary drinks while you queue to get in. My aunt is from a Zoroastrian family and told me that Dishoom is nostalgically accurate, right down to details like the chairs and the bathrooms. There are some fusions like the Indian Pimms cup, which uses ginger beer and is studded with pomegranate seeds. VERY tasty cuisine and a lively scene. Highly recommended.",1,1,1,,
127,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"The food here is absolutely amazing. Every time I have come here the staff have been so helpful and accommodating, especially with food restrictions (gluten, dairy). Last time we were there for a company lunch and they were able to serve us very quickly and we ordered a bunch of small plates which were easy to share and everyone had something they liked (actually we liked everything..). Have yet to try something there that I haven't liked. There is a great variety if you don't like spicy food, or are a picky eater..there is really something there for everybody. the restaurant itself is decorated really well and you can tell the owner and staff really put their heart into running the company and it is very authentic. Would definitely recommend for any kind of event (family dinner, date, company lunch, etc.). I would suggest making a reservation if possible since it does book up!!",1,1,1,,
128,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishoom is special...like...really special. Sorry for the novel of a review but it's worth every word. Dishoom is so special that I came here twice in the last week that I lived in London...it's so special that eating a very early lunch here was the very last thing I did before getting on the tube to Heathrow. I'm gonna attempt to break down what makes this place so spectacular. First of all, the vibe of this space is very special. It's large and light with high ceilings and comfortable seating on the entry level. Both times I have visited we stayed on the ground level, but I poked my head upstairs and it's beautiful. Downstairs they have a little lounge-ey bar. The owners have done a masterful job, updating this building while still hanging on to the old school industrial feel to it. The service on my first visit was flawless. The waitress broke down the menu for us and helped us to figure out exactly what to order to suit out preferences. She was very thorough in asking about food allergies and preferred spice levels. Also, she was clearly passionate and informed about the food. It didn't feel like she was trying to up sell us, but instead to make sure we were getting the right items that would be ideal for sharing. On my second visit, the staff was less amazing but I chalked that up to our early visit and the fact that we were in a bit of a hurry and didn't ask for a menu walk through. Again, I found out waiter to be helpful, though somewhat less attentive. The food here is show stopping. Easily the best Indian food I've had in my life and possibly the best meals I've eaten in London. I adored every bite of every item we ordered. You must try the black daal. It's spectacular. Rich and savory and outstanding. The calamari was definitely a stand out (in a sweet and sour fruity sauce). The lamb kebab and chicken tikka were juicy and delicious and perfectly spiced. The lamb samosas were crispy and well flavored (though I wish there were more than 2 in an order). The gunpowder potatoes are tasty and savory and a cheap side dish to go with all of the other more flavorsome dishes. The house special lamb stew was outstanding. Like my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. Oh my god. Also the naan (we tried all four kinds) are all fabulous. The cocktails and even the nonalcoholic drinks all looked incredibly tempting. My friend and I split a pitcher of Bombay pimms and it was fabulous and refreshing.The one caveat of this place is its crazy business. Make sure you book a table if you can or be prepared to wait. But really. It's like so worth it. I am heartbroken to have moved so far away from this magical restaurant. Please go there for me. Show me the pictures. I will cry from jealousy but it will be worth it. Go. Now. Right now.",1,1,1,,
129,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Amazing !!!! The best Indian food I've ever had and the place is so cool. I guess it's a converted factory and that plays really well in this location . The service was a bit slow but acceptable . It's is a large space and that makes it harder for the staff to get around . Love the look and feel of the main floor . Downstairs is more lounge like and the upstairs is open and perfect for a lunch break .The food is the star here and I can't wait to go back on my next trip to London . I wish they had one here in NYC as well.",1,1,1,,
130,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"I've always cycled past their Covent Garden branch and marvelled at the long queue outside, wondering if it was really worth it. Turning up to their Kings Cross branch and seeing a line of fewer than 5 people, we decided to wait in line. We got the customary ""It might take 30min, but we doubt it"" and fewer than 10 minutes later we were seated. The decor is amazing; if I could buy a home like it, I would. It does however feel quite colonial. But has a great charm to it (if you get a chance, check out the toilets!) The food was also awesome, and kudos to them for having both a gluten free, and a dairy free version of their menu. Will definitely be back.",1,1,1,,
131,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"We went due to the reviews on yelp. We waited in the lower 'permit' room for 40minutes until we could be seated, party of 2.  The drinks were wonderful as were the chips, albeit a small bowl of the chips.  The food was average.... no better than any other good Indian restaurant.  Portions were slightly smaller but the cost was reasonable.  We had 5 dishes we shared and all were ok. Nothing spectacular.  The service was good and fast.  The restaurant decor and ambiance was also very nice. I would go back but I would not wait to get a seat.  It's not worth that especially in a city known for amazing Indian food.",1,-1,-1,,

Unassuming from the outside, inside you're transported back in time to British colonial Bombay. The interior is fantastically done and feels rich and opulent, yet cozy and warm. We were seated upstairs and ordered two cappuccinos. They arrived in what looked like small  milkshake glasses, topped with a bit of chocolate. To be fair, they tasted good, but needed to be much hotter. I prefer my coffee in mugs that tend to keep them warmer, but that's just me. My girlfriend ordered the bacon & egg naan (noms!) and I ordered the Kejriwal -- two gloriously orange-yolked fried eggs atop chilli cheese toast with spring onions/scallions/green onions/whatever you call them here and coriander. They aren't afraid of flavor and it showed. It. Was. Perfect. Perfect size (though I could've eaten way more), perfectly cooked, perfect price at only å£4.90. Seriously, i can't get breakfast at the crappy takeaway down the street for å£4.90! The service was super fast, friendly and attentive, which pushes it to five stars for me.

I'm still thinking about this food a month later.",1,1,1,,
134,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"SO GOOD. SO WORTH IT. Service could be a little better hence the 4 stars.We had heard a couple great things about this restaurant before we took our trip to England and decided to pop in for dinner on our last night in London. Since I had read Yelp reviews about the long waits during peak hours, we came in around 9pm on a Wednesday evening and were sat within minutes. Dishoom is in a beautiful old building (it's a huge place) and the decor is simply stunning. I had already perused the menu (thanks Yelp you always got my back) so I had somewhat of an idea of what we were going to order but were happy to hear our waiter's recommendations before we made our final decisions. We definitely ordered more food than we needed but have nooo regrets. Our dinner at Dishoom was definitely the best meal we had during our 4 day stay in London.Drinks: I ordered the Bombay Colada (NOM) and my partner had the Viceroy's Old Fashioned (also NOM). My partner has had many an Old Fashioned and thought Dishoom's version was absolutely fantastic so that's sayin' somethin'. Appetizer: Dishoom Calamari which was uniquely spiced, just the right about of oily, and perfectly cooked!Entrees: Chicken Ruby, Black House Daal, Vegetable Biryani, Lamb Boti Kebab, and Garlic Naan. All of it was absolutely delicious. That's all you need to know.Dessert: House Chai (wonderfully spiced and delicious) and the Pineapple & Black Pepper Crumble which was subtly sweet, a good size, and the perfect ending to a great meal.My only complaint would be the service. While good overall, it could be improved considering how great everything else is. The biggest issue for us was that one of the servers spilled a bowl of their Raita right behind us which splattered all over my partner's jacket and shoes as well as my shoes. While they quickly cleaned everything up and gave my partner a cloth to clean himself off, nothing was done after that and our server never mentioned it. Considering how pricey Dishoom is, I would have at least expected an apology or an offer for a free dessert. We were just at Mowgli in Manchester days before and our server told us that she took our naan off the bill for us because it came a little late. In terms of our server, he never refilled our water and it took him about 20 minutes to bring our check to us after we had finished our meal. We noticed other tables around us who were served by him waiting a while for their checks as well.Overall, I LOVE Dishoom and will definitely be back when I'm back in London.",1,1,1,,

I would say that it could be served hotter but it tasted so good I don't really care that much.

136,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Loved this place! The atmosphere is incredible and detailed and the food is delicious and original. The restaurant is styled after an old Social or Gentlemen's club in colonial India. The decor and furniture is incredibly detailed and makes you feel as though you have travelled back in time. The menus include a wide variety of food and include charming history and anecdotes for certain dishes. We tried the naan bacon breakfast sandwich as well as the porridge. The breakfast sandwich was amazing the bacon was cured and cooked in a unique sweet chili sauce which was ask so served with the plate. To say the bacon was delicious is a vast understatement. The whole sandwich worked well together. The porridge was tasty and I mostly ordered it because I had never eaten porridge before. It was simple with bananas and dried dates and very satisfying. That porridge is all you can eat. We also ordered the red grape and lemon juice which was a bit expensive at å£5 a glass but a thrilling combination. The drink was sour and sweet, and a nice new experience. Dishoom blew away my expectations and my wife and I still talk about how happy we were with the whole experience. We can't speak for the dinner menu and have heard there is quite a line but will definitely make this a London MUST.",1,1,1,,

It is situated in a ancient English railway warehouse. The place was abuzzing on our arrival.The Bombay Big Breakfast at an expensive å£11.50 was very disappointing, compared to  Big Breakfast size meals in other London cafes and restaurants (which charged at even half the price). There was bugger-all ingredients on the plate, hardly any grilled streaky bacon or grilled mushrooms to  be seen , and the fried tomato was quite small in size. Only the two sausages were of normal size. The massala flavour baked beans tasted kinda odd too. Their Chai tea at an expensive å£2.50 per small glass although tasty was served only luke warm. I hate luke warm tea!!Also their old wooden styled chairs weren't very comfortable, and the whole place felt very old and cramped. However our waitress was friendly enough. A restaurant is only as good as its last meal. And for that reason alone, I would not return here again in a hurry. It's expensive and the food is nothing really special. Though for many I guess, the Dishoom is good for its authentic old Indian styled restaurant novelty value.. But sorry......... thats not good enough for me!!",-1,-1,-1,,
140,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Truly excellent Indian food experience. Based on the old Bombay cafes, Dishoom at kings cross invites you to drink and dine in a unique old railway warehouse. The atmosphere with the dimmed lights is exceptional. In the lower level you will find the ""Permit Room"" bar which creates unbelievable drinks - most of them with an Indian touch to it.The food itself is very tasty - from the naans over the paneer tikka to the daal and the various curries. You can't go wrong with anything. It's a good place to come with friends and share a variety of food. The only problem with this place is the door personnel that often tries to scare you away with an extremely unfriendly attitude and exaggerated waiting times (that actually are never true)",1,1,1,,

Other guests enjoyed the paneer!Service made this a less than fabulous dining experience. Our waiter was condescending and disappeared halfway through our meal. Another waiter picked us up (he was much friendlier), but our last order took forever and it took multiple asks to get our check.Would I come back? Yes? If I was really craving the food...",-1,1,1,,
142,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Amazing food! Service could be better.. There is a big difference between the waiters and the service they provide. I've been here before and had help how much and what we should order. That was great, now went there others who did not go before and it was all not clear for them. But the food was amazing! Also the puddings! Strawberry merengue was to die for and the chocolate pudding EVEN better! Looking forward to next visit.",1,1,1,,
143,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"My no. 1 dining experience in London! Dishoom serves modern Indian food out of a renovated railway shed built baaaaack in the day. The place is huge, cavernous in fact, and the decor incredible.  It's like being transported back in time to a first class cabins in the 19 century... lots of dark wood, patterned tiled floors, marble countertops and metal finishings. Anyway, enough about the dÌ©cor.  The food... well, it's darn delicious. Every dish we tried was packed full of flavour w beautifully balanced spice and lots of fresh herbs. We got a smorgasboard of dishes and all were to die for but the surprise standout dish for me was their daal, which they simmer for over 24hours so it's absorbed all the delicious liquid.  Unfortunately this time we didn't have room for dessert but next time I am back in London this week be my first stop.Oh and  make sure that you go downstairs to the Permit Bar for a drink either before or after dinner. It's got a bit of a speakeasy vibe and the service and drinks are impeccable.  Try one of their signature cocktails or tipples, as they call them. I'm a negroni fan so couldn't go past Sonia's take on the classic - Hayman's Dry gin, Campari & Dishoom vermouth served with hand carved ice.One last thing... Dishoom doesn't take bookings so I'd recommend getting there early, putting your name on the list and then heading downstairs for a tipple (or two).  We got there around 6pm and were seated well before 7pm, but apparently the wait can be up to 3 hours during peak times.",1,1,1,,

We were told that it would take about an hour to be seated. After about 15 minutes, we were let into the bar area. The drinks were unique and delicious, and the ambiance was great. We were in the bar for about 30 minutes before we were seated, and the food was totally worth the wait. We shared about 5 plates (one of which was at the recommendation of our waitress) between 2 people. We loved every dish. Highly recommend!!!",1,1,1,,

Sort of like a hipster version of Soda Bottle Openerwala.Will make a point to come here every time I am in London",1,1,1,,

It has become our number one choice for business lunches and our guests always leave very happy.If I had to choose a few favorites, they would be: okra fries, awadhi lamb, chicken ruby, and roomali roti. I always have a tough time choosing between the sugarcane juice and the house chai though. Both are SO delicious.As far as the restaurant itself, there is such a nice vibe at Dishoom. It's big, well decorated, and the staff is very attentive. I just love the interior! It really is a perfect place to have a meal.",1,1,1,,

I've heard praises from here to Timbuktu about their bacon naan roll, and finally woke up early enough to try it.  Decor: Feels much more vibey and well put-together than its costs (95% of the dishes are under å£10).  Way ahead of the game when it comes to affordable franchises having a certain ""oomph"" to its ambiance.  Would make for a great date spot.Food: After a complimentary (and delicious!) hot chai tea, they brought me two folded bacon naan rolls.  I never had a naan serving on its own, but Dishoom's version is quite different, fusing the British bap concept with Indian influences.  So how was it? Chewy, spicy, sweet, smoky, tangy, savory...absolutely delicious. Go, go, go!",1,1,1,,
149,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,1,"Disappointingly all style rather than substance, and we won't be back. We wanted an early dinner in the area, and read the reviews about the long waits, so made a booking for 5:45pm thinking it would be empty, because who really eats at that hour? We probably could have walked in at that point, but it was pretty full, and there was a wait by 6:30. We arrived and were seated by a friendly host, but then didn't see a server for more than 15 minutes. People walked past with water jugs, but didn't offer us any, and I had to catch someone's eye to make our order, which seemed pretty silly. There were tons of staff around, so no idea why we had to wait so long to order. Ordered a number of dishes to share based on other reviews, and there were a couple dishes that I would be happy to eat again. The black dal was delicious, and felt like it was reasonably priced. The bhel starter was very good, although inconsistently spiced (it felt like it wasn't stirred together properly), but I would recommend it. I don't get the love for the okra fries, which are a spicy version of something you can get at any BBQ place or TGI-Fridays style place in the US. Nothing special. The roti was obviously not cooked to order as it claimed, since the top was hard and stale. The grilled greens were OK but nothing amazing. The gunpowder potatoes were actually inedible. The spicing was decent, but the potatoes themselves were undercooked, which is never a good thing in a potato. When I asked for the bill, the server noticed we'd only eaten a bite of the potato and asked what was wrong. I said they were undercooked and not good, and he apologised. But of course, he didn't take it off the bill, so I kind of felt like he shouldn't have bothered asking if he wasn't going to do anything about it. The physical space is beautiful, I have to admit. I love the area, and enjoyed walking around the warehouses behind King's Cross. Oh, if I wasn't already disappointed, my visit to the bathrooms sealed the deal. Down in the basement, the whole bar is smoky with incense, which is odd in a restaurant. In the bathroom itself, the smoke from incense was insanely thick, and my clothes ended up smelling like a dirty hippy shop for the rest of the evening. I agree with whoever said that the toilets remind them of an outhouse, weirdly out of place. Basically, it was an interesting experience, and I had one good dish. But I won't be back-- service was slow and not especially professional, food was more expensive than I felt it was worth, and drinks were astronomically expensive. Next time I want Indian food, I'll head for Drummond St instead.",-1,-1,-1,,

My husband highly recommended Dishoom in Kings Cross•_Îso I decided to give it a try.  They only take reservation for 6ppl+, so we decided to arrive a bit early at 6:30.  The place was packed, but the lineup was better than expected, we got seated in less than half an hour. They offered us free cocktails while waiting.  We had the fried octopus as appetiser and it was so good that we order a second round.  All dishes were delicious and up to expectation.  Recommended to get a seat on the inside if you are having dinner, as the outside area get pretty windy and cold after sunset.",1,1,1,,

Consistently good food in an amazingly themed Bombay cafÌ©. I particularly love this location because it's an old warehouse with big ceilings and space. To avoid the ca. 1 hour waiting times for a table, I'd recommend going in between meals. We got seated straight away when we showed up at 5.30pm on Sunday. I raved about the breakfast in my Shoreditch review but again: bacon and egg naan. That's all you need. Dinner is just as amazing. Far far, chicken tikka, house dahl, calamari, freshly made naan and rotis plus okra fries which are simply incredible to name a few. Expect innovative takes on Iranian/Indian dishes with great flavours and surprisingly amazing prices - I love that the prices are modest despite the ongoing hype with this place.

For me it's the perfect place to start of with food but especially drinks (sit at the bar if possible in the middle if on a date). Really good drinks served here. We had about 8 in a few hours and all were great. Stand out things to have for me are:- Moonsooned Cobbler cocktail- Whiskey Sour- Mango Fennel Lassi. - Chef special of Nalli Nihari- Okra Fries and Calamari are musts to have to start off withDidn't like:Dishoom SlawMurgh Malai (they serve it slightly pink chicken as a footnote)Little tip don't bother getting any table at back as it is around the side and bit out of the way I feel.

Especially recommend the chicken ruby, washed down with a hot baileys chai (which could be a bit bigger but hey). Be prepared for a small wait at peak times.",1,1,1,,
156,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"In a month I've eaten here 12 times and literally eaten and drank everything on the menu. I've weathered wind, rain and ice, for dates, get-togethers and family dinners. And though it's not perfect and you can get better Indian food (if you look REALLY hard) in London, it is the best place I can recommend in London overall. + Breakfast: I thought I knew it all about Dishoom until after a year having dinners I went for breakfast; and I fell in love all over again. The Bacon Egg Naan Roll is delicious; wood smoked bacon with gooey organic egg, a layer of cream cheese and fresh chopped coriander, with the char from the tandoor on the naan. Paired with a sweet and very mildly spiced chilli jam to lighten the smoke and char- I was licking the plate. Which is a beautiful white and blue like your Nanniji might have. The Chicken Keema looked good but wasn't amazing, and I found it too oily. Fire Toast (2-3 pieces) was ok, came lukewarm and a touch dry, but the preserves were nice. The Big Bombay breakfast is awesome, and the Masala Beans yummy; if needing a slight chilli kick (my preference). + Have a Dhoble cocktail to perk up your brunch, or a monsoon malabar coffee for those grim morning-afters. It must be said the coffee isn't great (i.e. barista level), but I like the chicory hit from it. Get a lassi, or ask can they do a sugar cane & lime juice otherwise.+ Lunch: you can't go wrong with with a Frankie roll and a Thumps-Up. Get it into you. Their wine selection is average, but their cocktails are why you are here. Summertime, hit the juleps. Wintertime go for a chota peg. Avoid the Indian Sula wine (overpriced) and Amrut whiskey (sub-par) if you are into those things. Sorry India :(+ Dinner: Aw yisss. I mean, I can write on every item, but no need. Their special, Lamb Nahil Nihari is a leg of lamb originating in Iran and infamous on the streets of Pakistan. The sauce is thick and unctuous and morish, scoopable with the garlic roti. The lamb itself is well cooked and tasty, but I doubt slow cooked (would be better) as it needed to be carved/pried off the bone on both occasions we ordered. A large portion, get to share at å£17.50. Don't opt for the brainzzzz (my preference).Headliners are the Chicken Ruby (perfect for those people who think Indian food must be a sauce, meat, and rice), Chicken Berry Britannia (recreation of CafÌ© Britannia in Mumbai), house daal mopped up with roomali (handkerchief) roti, vada pau with a dollop of fresh green coriander chutney, paneer tikka and more. Desserts- probably the only thing I'm not impressed with. The overly heavy Guju Shrikhand & Chocolate Mouse, and the Ghola Ice is divisive among friends. Best opt for a simple kulfi. Pudding wine isn't much to talk about, don't bother with it. Get chocolate chai or a 'Dirty chai' instead.Cocktails/Drinks: all of them. While downstairs go for the juleps and pegs; at the dinner table I love the East India Gimlet.Overall- for its price, service and consistent quality every day all day, it's impossible not to say it's my favourite place to eat in London. Always coming back.",1,1,1,,
157,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Wowzers. Great atmosphere. Our trip to London wouldn't have been complete without a visit to Dishoom. It's close to King Cross Station (Platform 9 3/4). I highly recommend making a reservation. If you do end up waiting in line, they bring out appetizers or let you sit at the bar, but it can be a long wait. This was the first time my family ate Indian food and they were spoiled by the best in London. Gluten free menu available.",1,1,1,,

Really tastes unique and authentic unlike some other curry houses in London. Great use of herbs and spices. The atmosphere is also great. There's something about the restaurant which makes you feel somewhat at home rather than in a big space with people you don't know. Definitely one of my favourite Indian restaurants in London.

With that said:I decided to try because I heard London had really good Indian food. I yelped the closest and best option from where I was, Kings Cross. I walked about 10-15min and when I got to the restaurant, I was shocked to see a long line outside on this late chilly night (8:30pm). I got on line seeing as it should be good since it's so popular. I overheard the wait would be 1hr+! The group ahead of me was about to turn away but the waitress convinced them to stay by accommodating them with outside seating with drinks from the bar before being seated for dinner. Then a waitress came out and passed out warm drinks to everyone waiting outside, it was pretty chilly out so it was very nice. I didn't realize what I was drinking but it was the best drink ever at the moment! I was seated only after 5min of waiting because I was alone and was able to sit at the bar. SCORE! The atmosphere was so chill. The bartenders were so trendy dressed in hipster suspenders. My bartender was super friendly and recommended a few options because I had no idea what to get. I got the cheesy naan and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and then a mango kulfi for dessert. EVERYTHING was sooo good! On top of that, I asked the bartender what drink they gave me outside and I was shocked when he told me it was CHAI! He was so nice that he gave me a free refill! I highly recommend this place when in London! I will definitely come back here on my next visit!",1,1,1,,

We actually ordered a second calamari after finishing the first bowl!  Everything was flavored delectably and dishes complemented each other perfectly. On top of that, the location is just cool.

From the bright, ginger-laced Pimms Cup to the impeccable naan, everything was spectacular. The prices are reasonable, but it's easy to run up quite a bill as each dish on the menu begs to be tasted. I would recommend everything except the tomato and onion salad; it's exactly that, and comes as a side dish with the delicious chicken tikka masala, so don't bother ordering it separately. We loved the lamb shank stew and the grilled corn on the cob, too.",1,1,1,,
170,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I had an excellent meal at Dishoom.  I know I'm trying - truly, truly trying - to be more discerning with how many 5 stars I give out but...here?  It's totally deserved.After finding it (this was no easy feat as we were going lo-tech and finding it sans smartphone), we were torn between three seating options: outside on the (limited, but sunny - vitamin D-enriched meal!) patio, inside at low rattan furniture with sun streaming through the windows, or upstairs in the more traditional of dining rooms.We opted to sit in the dining room; not perhaps the best option for the tan, but good for a quiet tete-a-tete which was the social purpose of this mean.The service was *on point*; always there to answer questions, always quick and responsive, but never overbearing.  Provided great recommendations and really helped make our meal spectacular.We decided on some far far (basically a must for all children of the 80s; they're essentially neon-coloured crisps with a trio of dipping options) to munch on while we decided.  Ultimately we went for some grilled mixed greens (SOUNDS BLAND; GET 'EM), the much-touted okra fries, the warm (ish) chicken pomegranate salad and the murgh malai, which was one of the best uses of chicken thigh that has ever graced my lips.  THAT WAS A LOT OF TRUTH SAY.We were both super-full (oh, did I mention; wine?), and got out with - including tip - 35GBP of damage.  Excellent work, Dishoom.Yelp note: decor is lovely, as is the incense burning.  Truly my sole but (but/t?) is...the wooden toilet seats.  Reminds me of camping outhouses and...yeesh.  Clearly some childhood camping trauma I hadn't unpacked, but didn't welcome revisiting it mid-way through such a lovely dinner.",1,1,1,,

173,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Getting into Dishoom is a Herculean in patience and false hope. It is worth documenting here upfront so you know.First of all, it will be busy. If they are open, they are busy. There is a reason for this but later. Second, yes the line is long. Yes they will tell you an absurd amount of time until you are seated but fear not! There will be little drinks while you are in line, bigger drinks once you get into the downstairs bar and amazing food as your reward. Finally, it will not take as long as they have told you. Which is a neat psychological trick.The atmosphere is probably the one thing I did not love. It is a sweaty, packed and really loud room. Pair this with eastern european waitresses whose high pitched voices do not carry across the gap and it can be difficult to even order. All of that being said, we got exactly what we ordered every time, even if it was difficult to flag someone down for additional beer.The food. I need to say it again, The Food! Amazing, Delicious, Indescribably Good... this is why you wait 40 minutes, shout to be heard with a waitress and endure your neighbor's chair bumping you 15 times during dinner.Go to Dishoom, then go again and then keep going until you have eaten everything!",1,1,-1,,

I'm hardly a connoisseur but know what flavours I like.The first time I came the queue outside was an hour long so I walked away, vowing to return earlier next time. I'm so pleased I  did because Dishoom has quickly become my go-to restaurant when I'm near Kings Cross. I've been twice since, once with a friend and then with my dad - who said this was ""the best Indian he'd ever had in London, probably the best Indian EVER!""The experience begins from the moment you join the inevitable queue outside. They offer you a drink (mint tea or a spirit I seem to remember) which I think is a very kind gesture. You hopefully go inside quite quickly to sit in the bar downstairs. The cocktail list seems to cater for all tastes - strong shorts or sweet and fruity options. My only criticism come from the trip with my dad when the menu had at least 3 drinks listed that they no longer offered.Once the go upstairs to the dining room you'll realise how nice and helpful the staff really; offering recommendations of their favourite or most popular dishes. I have over ordered on both occasions but they generously boxed up the remaining food into individual pots so I could take it home. I rate the Prawn Koliwada, Lamb Biryani and Ruby Murray but still have lots of the menu to work my way through.",1,1,1,,

The cocktails are unique and tasty. And the vibe is just so cool. I've been here a few times, usually getting the chole bhatura with an extra garlic naan and it is always good. The brunch is good as well - though a much more limited offering, it is all delicious. The masala beans offer a spicy twist on typical English breakfast beans. Don't miss out on the house chai - it's what keeps bringing us back. All in all, it's a great place for locals as well as to bring visitors to London. I will undoubtedly be back again.",1,1,1,,

Having been to their Covent Garden branch for NYE dinner some time back, I had decent expectations.The decor, the setting etc are supposed to take you back to Bombay. The hallmarks are high roofs with lights and fans hanging, wooden furniture that give you an impression of time having passed by and an atmosphere that whilst looking busy, lets you sit back and relax. Dishoom ticked all these boxes. Now, because we went at breakfast/brunch time, we got the breakfast menu.Going to the food, we got two bacon rolls with naan, which to me, is the best of both worlds. Delicious bacon sandwich, pimped up to an Indian level with naan and some tasty chutney. We also got a fire toast, which was, toast with some spicy chutney. We also got a maska bun (bun with butter) to share. There was the option of bottomless house chai, which some of us went for. For me the biggest delight was South Indian coffee from the Coorg district of Karnataka! I go giddy for Coorg coffee, so yes, that was brilliant. The food tasted great, the coffee was exceptional and the house chai, with the bottomless option was also a winner. However, there were drawbacks, significant ones, which take the experience down to a 3 star.Now, the problem was that if you are a vegetarian, who does't even eat egg, you have no options. You can either opt for the fire toast or go for an egg roll (similar to the bacon roll) without the egg. This, by far was the biggest disappointment. The other big factor was the congestion. The tables were stacked too close to one another, which meant that if you lean back you make unnecessary contact with the person behind you, especially if you're both big blokes. In a traditional Bombay Irani cafe, the tables aren't that close that you lose a sense of privacy.But having said all this, the staff were friendly and courteous, which is an asset to this industry.If I did go back to Dishoom, it definitely will not be for their brunch/breakfast, but perhaps for a proper meal.",-1,1,1,,

Where do I begin let's start with the atmosphere of this place very colonial vibe which is awesome you don't have anything like this in LA. Now to the food man everything we got from the condiments to the ruby chicken all amazing back to back packed with amazing flavors that hit the spot when your craving indian. The service here is on point whatever you need their waitresses are great. Prices here are a little high for the size of their portions but for the quality and taste this place is worth spending money in especially for how bad the dollar is compared to pounds.

181,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Amazing restaurant bar just behind the Granary. Architecture is stunning, and the food matches.We visited for the first time 11 Nov, when they had the soft opening - and probably went 5 times in two weeks!Had a selection from breakfast, the masala with chopped chicken liver and eggs - not too spicy and incredibly moreish and warming. Granola with berries and yoghurt - healthy and delicious. Sides of bacon (ginger pig) and masala beans which were also incredible.Running out of adjectives.My new favourite destination in Kings Cross.---Delighted to see that Dishoom has been picked as the Yelper's favourite restaurant in the UK. I know that it relates to another branch, but still, this is as good.",1,1,1,,
182,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"If you ask for any popular Indie restaurant in London, most people will tell you about Dishoom.It is located in King's Cross street (remember the famous hot dogs I told you about?) and unlike most places in the area, this restaurant really lives up to its reputation. Most times it will be crowded, but don't let that drive you away. The food experience you will get is definitely worth a little waiting and you'll leave with a full tummy and a smile on your face. I'd recommend the Bombay breakfast as it is personally my favourite, but there is a big variety of meals on the menu, so don't hesitate asking the friendly staff for suggestions.",1,1,1,,

It has that classic home food/ street food foundation but does it in modern, fun and classy ways. The restaurant just is so amazing inside. It plays on its location as a former railway depot and has made it Indian railway style...it's just such a great place to sit and eat with friends as there's so much cool stuff to look at while you eatThe food is outstanding : the house daal, pao bhaji, chicken biryani and lamb chops are world classHonestly if u want REAL Indian food go here!! This is not a curry house...its quality and class Indian food for people who know what Indian food from the subcontinent really is!",1,1,1,,
185,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,Awesome experience. This place is absolutely massive. Make sure you either make a reservation or be prepared to wait in a long line outside. They have a large communal sharing table in the back that is great for large groups.,1,1,1,,
186,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Went here for breakfast today and was blown away by the place. It is just very slick from the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave.The first thing that struck me was the size of the restaurant. It's huge and despite being split over three levels it somehow manages to be intimate at in spite of the space. Dishoom has received so many plaudits and accolades - and I can easily see why - but it's extremely modest to be described as a 'Bombay style cafe', as it's much more than that. Even the breakfast menu is full of Bombay flavours - one of the most unique breakfast menus in London. I went for the sausage and egg naan roll. It's unlike any sausage and egg roll you'll ever eat - in a very good way. Others in our party went for the acclaimed bacon naan roll and someone also chomped on the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli toast). After this experience, I'll definitely be coming back for dinner. And breakfast, again.",1,1,1,,
187,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Heavenly... Just Heavenly food! This place deserves 7 stars. Everything is just so great. Food, hostesses, service, ambiance... Very ethnic and classy Indian.",1,1,1,,
188,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"The stars are kind of a giveaway, so yes: this place is great. I would be remiss if I did not note that there were a few initial red flags, however.First: it's both huge and nicely decorated. This, perversely, worried me. Gilgamesh in Camden is huge; it's been years since I've been, but it was a hot mess of a restaurant, with orders mixed up, confusing portion sizes, swarms of confused staff, and cryptic pricing. The money had all gone on the decor and a very decent bar staff, but eating felt like you'd done very badly in an exam you expected to ace. Second: when we were seated, the waiter asked if I'd been to Dishoom before, and then explained the 'concept' to me. This worried me too. In a culinary context I am rarely keen on concepts that require explanation. But in this instance the concept was that we were expected to share, that it was a small-plates kind of deal, and that things would arrive when they were ready and not as part of a traditional starter/main framework; so, fine. This isn't Gilgamesh, where the concept was that they did expensive food very averagely from a bewildering variety of Asian cultures, so that's fine. (I'm still bitter about it, yes.)The worries melted away when the food came. Lamb samosas and some calamari - a signature dish, according to the waiter - came first. The samosas were pretty good; the calamari was excellent, with a light salty batter and a sweet, acidic sauce - tamarind? Pomegranate? Something like that. I would come back for the calamari alone. Seekh kebabs and mahi tikka were next, with some excellent cucumber raita and crispy, fresh naan bread.  Everything is really interestingly spiced; nothing's overpowering, or even very hot, but it's complex. The signature black dahl is brilliant, but there's equal attention to detail in the complimentary relishes (mint and coriander, red and green chilli, and something I missed because I'm a bit deaf.) I don't know what they put in the 'Gunpowder potatoes' - I assume it wasn't gunpowder - but they were delicious and fragrant.This all felt like pretty good value for thirty quid a head (including an OK cocktail and a nice bottle of pale ale.) I've eaten at pricier Indian restaurants like Tamarind and the Cinnamon Club and not had nearly as nice a time. The one drawback really is that it's very popular. When we arrived at lunchtime on a Saturday it was packed, and people (ourselves included) were queuing outside for quite some time. Inside it's noisy and occasionally hard to catch the waiters' eyes when they're running around making sure the food gets out to the tables hot off the stove (which they do brilliantly, but it's difficult to make sure this works in an it-comes-as-it's-ready environment. Or at least at Gilgamesh, anyway.) Definitely go. Book in advance if you can. I'm interested to go for breakfast - served until 12 - which looks like it'd be great, going by the menu.",1,1,1,,
189,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"To get to dishoom, you walk though the fountains on granary square, along canals and through crowds of students from St martins. It's a beautiful location, which adds to the feeling that dishoom is out of the ordinary. A feeling that continues when you get inside and experience their drinks, service and food.The door staff are polite and friendly, but be prepared for a long wait in the evening. Booking a table isn't available unless you are a group of 6+. We started out at dishoom at 3pm though on a Saturday and we got a table for cocktails in their bar below. There were eight of us and we decided to stay and eat upstairs later on. The table took an hour of so, but it's not really a problem when you are waiting in such nice surroundings. The interior design of the place is exquisitely executed. Signs are in English and Nepali, antique pictures from Nepal and India hang from the Jade coloured walls. A colonial vintage feel runs through dishoom's three floors, yet it never feels antiquated and modern twists breath vitality into the place. As you head downstairs to the 'the permit room' bar, their is a cosy atmosphere. The colonial feel continues, with teak furniture and Tiffany lamps. We started with some sumptuous cocktails. I had the Tanchoix fix. This is a delicate blend of mandarin, peppers and aged gin. The cocktails are quite pricey though at å£9 for a small one and å£18 for a large. Unfortunately not something we could have sustained. We then found that there was a great punch whose recipe dates back to the 1600's. It uses tea, arak, limes and jaggery. It is served in a cute vintage punch bowl with copper cups for all. There were 8 of us and the punch served us with a glass and a half each per bowl. This was a bit of a bargain, as each bowl was å£29 each. We went through six bowl and were quite merry!We ate upstairs and chose to get a number of dishes and share. The food is like the decor and uses the traditional flavours of South Asia whilst adding modern twists and European flavours into the mix. Particularly exceptional was the black dhaal main course, the paneer roll (which comes with a divine mint sauce) and the paper thin roti. This is not your traditional British Nepali/Indian takeaway usual... You won't find a greasy rogan josh or a bland korma on here. Instead Chili cheese toast, lamb on the bone curry (with or without lamb brain) and the Bombay dish of pau bhaji set your tastebuds alight and help to soak up the punch. After 7 hour there (not a joke) we were throughly drunk, thoroughly full and thoroughly glad to have chosen dishoom. And those of us who didn't have an individual cocktail at the beginning the whole experience cost å£35. You can't say fairer than that!",1,1,1,,

The decor was wonderful and it was a lot bigger on the inside than it looked from the street. We waited downstairs at the bar where we had some very tasty and interestingly flavoured cocktails. The table service here was wonderful and, although busy, the staff were very attentive and friendly.When we were seated, the three of us all ordered a side, main and naan to be shared between us. The flavours were phenomenal and it's some of the best Indian food I've had in a restaurant. Amazing food, flawless service and a wonderful ambience.

196,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"For my first trip to London, one thing that was said by several people is that you HAVE to try the Indian food when you get there.Let me tell you, Dishoom knocked it out of the park. We ordered a variety of appetizers and main courses to split between three people. All of it was top notch Indian food, making coming back to the States even that much harder.What really sold me overall was their incredible drink menu from the permit room. I got a gin cocktail that was absolutely to die for although I couldn't find the name of it on their website. Would absolutely make this a must-stop location for anyone looking for some authentic and delicious Indian food.",1,1,1,,
197,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Went here for dinner and thought it was solid but not extraordinary. I strongly recommend the lamb kebabs -- super flavorful! Thought the chicken biryani and okra fries were only ""OK"" -- same for the lassis.A note on the service and decor -- really spot on. Decor around the restaurant was comprised of a lot of salvaged/found goods, which gave the place a really ""worn-in"" and comfy feel, despite being a new and pretty large restaurant. The long bar was beautiful -- I would have loved to come back for a few drinks if I had more time.Seems like everyone rages about the brunch so might recommend that instead of dinner.",1,1,1,,

199,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"This place is really cool. I've been to the dishoom in Leicester Square/Covent Garden, but had a much better experience here. We came for breakfast on a Sunday at 9:45am so thankfully there wasn't a queue! We opted for the famous bacon and egg naan roll and were not in the slightest bit disappointed. The combination of tastes were delicious! We've tried coming in the evenings but the thought of queueing for 2 hours is just ludicrous. So we got a take out instead and whilst I still think the dinner prices are a little over-priced, I'd definitely eat here again.",1,1,1,,
200,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Perhaps I'm a bit naive, but the queue for here was phenomenal. My friend and I stuck around because we didn't really have much to do, but I still can't quite get over the wait! The queue managers are nice, though, and have taster drinks for people outside. At the bar downstairs, the waiter was friendly and knowledgable and made some tasty cocktails in front of us. When we finally got to eat (after 2 hours), we were famished. The black lentil daal and gunpowder potatoes were total winners, though. The interior, as with other Dishooms, is interesting and atmospheric. Split level, each section feels small and intimate, even though the whole restaurant itself is bigger than average.",1,1,1,,

By far the best Indian food I've ever had in my life. We had the okra fries (loved it - didn't even taste like okra), chicken ruby (a must have), Dishoom chicken tikka (a nice spicy kick to the flavorful and super tender chicken), and the black house daal (not sure what was in this dip but it was delicious).

It was up there. I wouldn't say the best *literally* but that's a sliding scale. You were definitely a solid second.If this review was on food alone, you would have got a five star.Alas.It is not. Instead your review includes service. Service particularly from a lady called Natalie. This is where things go awry.I have one rule when I'm eating anywhere. In fact, make that two rules. First being 'Even if it does look like a hipster would have an orgasm when they walked in, don't let that mar your judgement'. I didn't allow that to sway me. Joss sticks and all. I held my resolve.Joss sticks. In a restaurant. Right by the open kitchen.Second rule is, never allow a server to say 'you can't have that, other people on the table have ordered it'. Oh Natalie. Mistake number one. When I come to your restaurant in a group of eight. Not all of us are going to buy into your 'a dish is for the table, not for you' attitude. Oh no. If I order a lamb balti, that lamb balti is MINE. Not the table's. MINE.In the words of his holyness Joey Tribbiani: 'Joey doesn't share food'. No Natalie. He doesn't, and neither do I.When a table of eight has ordered three bowls of Black House Daal, and try to order a fourth. We don't care that you would never normally allow a table of six to order two between them. We'll order what we want.Your judgemental comments and attitude did nothing to make us like you. It only served to put us off coming back again.Once you'd seen that we had infact consumed all the Daal that we ordered. You comments of 'well, I assure you that has never happened before' also did nothing to warm us.The final straw in your incompetence was when, after we had paid all of our bill, including a larger than due 15% tip you proceeded to tell us that we had not even paid the base amount without service charge.Now don't get me wrong. You made an honest mistake. Maths off the cuff can be hard. Anyone could have made the mistake. The tone of, and judgemental nature 'Eeeer, excuse me. You're 60p short of the minimum'. Only disappointed us further. Had you checked your maths, you would have found your mistake.We left thoroughly disappointed, and will not be returning. This place gets a two solely for the food. I'd have knocked off another star and given it a one because of you, Natalie, but I'm not that rude. I recommend you avoid.I haven't even covered the offers of waters and snacks whilst we chose our food - all of which were charged for with no discussion of price. The 'bottle of water for the table' became three bottles of water for the table as they emptied one, brought over another and charged us for them.",-1,-1,-1,,

We were also able to wait at the bar. LOVED this restaurant. The food was delish. Very different than  Indian in the states. Not heavy on the sauces but more the spice.

214,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,3,"This review is mainly about the experience, rather than the food. It was an insidiously windy hike up from Kings Cross station to Dishoom and we were horrified to be told on the door with a smile that waiting time for a table was an hour and 45 mins, ... but not as horrified as we were when we were then told that there was a waiting time for the bar that we had been directed to wait in !!! We were also told that we couldnt order drinks whilst wiating for room at the bar 'because by the time the drinks are made your table would be ready ...' Not sure what that said about the waiting time for either. So we stood by the doors gazing upon the restaurant, a bar, people sitting eating and drinking ... for what felt like a thirsty 10 mins or more until we were able to go down to the bar that we would be waiting in. During that time we were able to appreciate 2 things : the visuals were awesome, the noise sucked. But the interior was lovely. i actually started to feel pangs of longing to be back in the asian subcontinent, such was the nostalgic attention to detail in every part of the sprawling comfortable 3 floor (? 4 floor ?) building.  And somehow , despite the dodgy soundtrack (a few guitar band indie-pub tunes) , all the vocal clamour and people noise added to the bustling-India ambience. In the event we 'only' had to wait for an hour and a quarter for a table, by which time I had kind of lost my appetite. Cocktails were good, as they should have been; pre -made, which mate be contentious or perhaps marketed as a plus point. The Gimlet was awesome, other nice mixes. Served on a hand-cut shard of ice which was definitely the epitome of cool.Food :  I was looking forward to their signature Black House Daal, and when it came it was good, but i wasn't too bothered about paying too much attention to it because I fell in love with the Roomali roti, soft, delicate, big, warm. Likewise with the Gunpowder potatoes  and Biryani and Mutter Paneerm which my three friends loved.  I felt the tastes were comfortable and pleasant, not quite as complex as I would have liked, but I was brought up on a Sri Lankan palate and perhaps we are notoriously exacting when it come to food ....The service was great, and the ambience in the restaurant was also awesome, i preferred it to the subterranean bar. The restaurant was a really great combination of relaxing, chilled, intimate, but feeling as though you are in the thick of things and able to gaze on some activity. Looking around, it felt like this would probably be the case from every table, and it was here that I felt that I could almost be in India. By that time the tunes had changed to seem more congruous. So, my friend said that the website says no need to book : I would come back, but I would not wanna be faced with that wait again, I would love to check out their other locations, im hooked on the interiors and i would definitely bring friends. I wanna to try more of their dishes and spend more time at the restaurant table eating",-1,1,1,,

The ambiance is worth the visit and the food is the best Indian cuisine I've had in multiple countries in Europe.   This is by far my number one visited restaurant in the UK.   I'll definitely be back.  There's something for everyone here and vegetarians will be well fed.",1,1,1,,
220,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Very good Indian food and one of the best meals we had in London! (Which explains the lines of ppl outside). Next time we would skip the pricy cocktails for a beer. Friendly services, except a few hiccups here and there.. and nice environment. We went for lunch and the wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad comparing to dinner hours. We asked our waiter about portion sizes and he suggested 5, 6 dishes for two of us. (Either we looked starving or I never knew people eat that much there). We ended up ordering only 3 dishes + garlic nan and we were stuffed. Every dish was delicious!Although they forgot our Okra Fries. The waiter apologized and brought it out later, said it was on the house but when the bill came, it was charged. We didn't bother to correct him since we did order and finished it. The okra fries were a bit salty and a few pieces were stringy. Overall it was great and we walked out full and happy.",1,1,-1,,

At any rate, I've never had Indian food quite like this is my life, so flavorful and impeccably prepared. I had the Vegetable Samosa, Okra Fries, Chicken Ruby and Roomali Roti - they were each fantastically delicious. I had a hard time picking a favorite when the waitress inquired - I ultimately said the okra, but could have selected any of them. I also had the Baileys Chai for dessert, which was a lovely, silky yet lightly spiced drink. The service was great too - she was very kind and made excellent recommendations. Had I come here at the beginning of my trip as opposed to the end, I may never have eaten anywhere else! Bravo!",1,1,1,,
222,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Flavoursome Indian street food in a funky retro surroundings - a real authentic Bombay CafÌ©! Dishoom really encapsulates the current trend for quality without the fuss. Step through the door and you leave London behind for a few hours - a heady mix of spice, sandalwood and sloooow scratchy jazz tunes really set the mood. Both the food and cocktails were exceptional, I'm a real fan of street food and sharing dishes so my friends and I ordered lots of smaller dishes to share which was perfect. Service was quite slow but we weren't in a rush, it's the sort of place that makes you feel nostalgic (must have been the jazz...or one too many Bombay Coladas!) and you just never want to leave - but alas, we had a train to catch! We came early evening so didn't have to queue very long but at busier times you can be queueing for ages which I can't be done with - no matter how good the food!",1,1,1,,

There is nothing Irani about this menu. The menu is surprisingly limited. There are only two veg curries and no dry veg or chicken dishes. Their signature Dal is too tomato-ee and does not bring out the flavours of the lentils at all. The service is in haste and sporadic. All our starters came together with drinks but were followed by the main course within 5 minutes and it was only 5:30PM. I've eaten much better Indian food in London. You can too.",-1,-1,1,,

We waited outside for 20-30 min (but were given a hot cup of chai), then moved inside to a bench, but weren't allowed to order a drink there. Waited another 20-30 min, then sent downstairs to the bar. Were there for about an hour and a bit, ordered 2 cocktails and then were finally moved upstairs for dinner. I have a feeling this is the standard pattern of how things are done at this restaurant - so expect that you'll have to spend money on at least 2 cocktails in the bar before you can have dinner and you won't feel annoyed about it!We had Keema pau, Chilli cheese toast to start (both were bordering on cold when they arrived). For mains we shared house daal, mattar paneer, murgh malai, kacchi lamb biryani, cheese naan.Can not fault any of the mains, arrived hot and well seasoned. Cheese nan was a bit too heavy perhaps (so much cheese!). Food prices are quite reasonable I think, but its the money you have to spend in the bar that really bumps up the bill. Not sure I like this system - not sure it happens at the Covent Garden branch.The decor and design of the restaurant is very special though - nice to have a chance to see the whole place, but not sure I'll be back in a hurry (definitely not when I'm in a rush to eat).",-1,-1,1,,

I came here for brunch, and have only eaten at a handful of places this flavorful.  My boyfriend and I have yet to find a better Chai tea (we've looked) since we returned to the U.S.  Very reasonably priced, very cool and trendy atmosphere, and the food is outstanding.",1,1,1,,

I have eaten in Brick Lane and yes there are great Indian restaurants there, but this place is beyond. The food, the service, the ambiance, everything is so on point that the experience is always amazing.I have been at the one in Covent Garden but decided to visit this one. New up and coming area and the restaurant has been open for about a month or two. My wife, who does not like spicy food, yet loves Dishoom, and I decided to split the following;-Dishoom Calamari. Crispy and a touch if sweetness. And the sauces they come with, mix excellent. -The Special-Nalli Nihari with Bheja (Of Course). A hearty stew. Leaves up to its billing. Amazing balance of taste and spice.-Dishoom Chicken tikka. This classic and beautifully done. Delicious-Cheese naan. Amazing, not much to say there.-Rice. Soft, steamed basmati rice. perfect complement. -Kingfisher beer. If they don't have the Dishoom IPA (which is excellent) this is your second best option to pair with your food.-Mango-fennel lassi. Just delicious. I always get this.-Blow horn spiced cider. My wife got this. Very crisp and refreshing.-Raita. Not only is helpful if you need to tame down the heat but its also delicious.Another amazing experience at Dishoom. Thanks also to our server Paul. He was awesome.",1,1,1,,

Because I was dining alone, I was able to skip the line and eat at the bar, but the line was absolutely absurd (take note if you're planning your night - at least they give samples of beverages and food while you're waiting). I had the chicken tikka (super flavorful, but a tad on the salty side), black house daal (delish - perfectly balanced flavors... recommend this with jasmine rice), and a virgin bhang lassi (highly recommend this smoothie-like drink, especially if you're not too good with spice - this will cool you down). These three items were more than enough for one person. I just wish we had this great of Indian food in a similar atmosphere in the US!",1,1,1,,

229,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Loved the atmosphere and the wood-paneled decor. I agree with other reviews that there is always a wait unless you go early.  The food was delicious.

My friend and I popped in before our train to Paris, and we went from being in the middle of London in modern day to enjoying mango lassis under the swoop of large fans, feeling like the jungle was right outside, and this was one of few outposts of civilization. The restaurant is based on the Irani cafes in Bombay, but not being familiar with those, I could only identify it as feeling colonial, for better or for worse. The food was absolutely divine, and surprisingly cheap for the experience. A must see in London.",1,1,1,,

It's a converted train station, with a big clock in the middle, lots of cool windows, and several stories. There's also burning incense in the air! Great vegetarian options as well. The curries are light and tasty, and the garlic naan is ultra garlicky-- just the way it should be! The staff is very nice too, gave us two free chai teas. Also had a dessert of chocolate pudding with cinnamon ice cream. It was so decadent and delicious! Love this place, and if I'm ever back in london, I will definitely be here again.",1,1,1,,

The roti was good - soft and easy to take apart, and quite large too (we shared 2). The naan was decent. Chicken biryani wasn't very spicy and the mattar paneer had too much tomato flavor for my tastes, but everything else was great, would definitely recommend.To drink I got the chocolate chai which was a nice, sweet way to end the meal.",1,1,1,,

And I then went for the Eton mess style desert and a bite of my friends pineapple and black pepper crumble-two amazing sweet treats. The restaurant itself is very cool and has an industrial but cosy feel. I loved everything about it and the prices are so reasonable. The only reason it's missing the full 5 stars was that the service was quite slow, we were left waiting for so long  to order food and get the bill-although the staff are lovely!

Tonight was my first time trying any of the Dishoom restaurants and I really enjoyed it.I started out at the bar, I ordered a Chaijito, a fusion of Mojito and chai flavour. The guy behind the bar was very friendly and made my drink right away. It was very refreshing and I ended up having a few more. Once we were seated we ordered some okra and calamari to start. The okra was amazing especially with the Chili chutney. I didn't try the calamari the other guests really enjoyed it. Next we ordered some main dishes. And biryanis to share. The Bowl of Greens is a must! It doesn't look like anything special but the flavour it amazing and the greens are cooked to perfection. The House Black Daal was also very nice and paired with the Gunpowder Potatoes I was in heaven. All the staff were lovely and the waitress we had was very sweet and had a great personality.Overall everyone enjoyed the meal.

240,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Another excellent meal in this wonderful Indian restaurant, we love the food, the ethos and the staff!",1,1,1,,
241,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,3,"They like to stress the Persian/Irani heritage of this place, but it is 85% Indian influenced. I won't lie, it's got amazing atmosphere and ambiance. The decor is fabulous, the building is wonderful (love converted warehouses), and it is tres stylish. I sat at the bar because I was a single, though it was not very busy and would have appreciated a booth. I decided to go with the flow and trust them.I think dining has a lot to do with trust when you're not sure on a place or you've never tried it. Yelp reviews and other people's recommendations can only go so far - in the end, it's what your tastebuds want, what your mind thinks is a good value for time and money. I think that for me, I will not be back because of the following:1. When I was seated at the bar, I noticed how blaring loud the music was. Because of the open structure of the warehouse, the two levels in the restaurant allow for the music and chatter from the upstairs to melt in with the downstairs. So when the bartender tried to talk to me, I could not hear over his heavily accented murmurs.2. While gorgeous, the bartenders can't be heard, at least by me. And they returned the favor. So I had to point out my items on a menu so I could be understood.3. I decided on the spicy lamb rice dish with a side of raita. The raita is first rate but the rice dish... well, the meat bits were good, but the rice overall was bland. The side sauces worked temporarily (by the way, who doesn't have salt and pepper out if you're going with the logic of bland rice?) but I felt near the end overwhelmed by the spice, and not enough flavor. The raita was tastier than the entree. Bad sign.4. I didn't want to finish the entree or the raita at the end. I was getting full, but remember my review for Salvation In Noodles when I talked about wanting to have a bigger stomach so I could eat more? I didn't feel that way at all for this place, these dishes, or the service. I think the bartender was disappointed that I wasn't ordering a drink and was confused why I would sit at the bar if I was just going to eat. Look buddy, I was just being polite and following the host's recommendation.5. At the host bar, there's easily four or five employees just standing around talking to each other. Which kind of upset me just because no one bothered to walk over to the bar and at least set things up. The menu was set in front of me after I sat down, thirty seconds later. I know that's a picky thing to complain about and it normally wouldn't be a big deal, but personal touch is really missing from this place, which unlike SIN, doesn't have the food to make up for it.Reasons to go? I dunno, I guess I can tell the bartenders put effort into their cocktails, they have a full bar, it may have been a dud dish I got, it may have been a bad seat, it also may have been the heat of the day that got me a little frustrated since Dishoom wasn't my first choice to eat at. I really wanted curry, and despite a lot of Indian inspired dishes, there was none. Crazy, right?So take my review with a grain of salt. I only wish that they had some to share with me for the dish I got today.",-1,-1,-1,,
242,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Enter at your own peril! Culinary witchcraft in broad daylight!We stumbled upon this restaurant when embarking on yet another pedestrian journey around London. We were hungry. It was on the way. So we briefly glanced over the menu and decided to give it a go. As soon as the doors opened, we stepped into a futuristic split-level, oddly decorated HUGE space, it felt like a set of Dark City, or The 13th Floor movies. That futuristic 50s, old with modern look. First impression - intriguing!We were promptly ushered to our table. We ordered okra fries and calamari as a starter (both very morish and delicious), followed by gun powder potatoes (nom!), mahi tikka (delicious dry fish, but order a side of something), and a black house dhal (OH-EM-EF-GE, this flavour explosion is a must have).The first time I visited, I was left LITERALLY speechless. The only thing that I was able to put together was profanity and swearing at just how incredibly unbelievable the food was. Honestly, it's witchcraft!Despite what the waiter will suggest, DO NOT share the black house dhal! This magical substance can divide friendships and start a war at the table! We were forced to rely on the trusted rock-paper-scissors to decide who was worthy of the last spoonful. I kid you not!Other deliciousness:- roomali roti - this thing is nearly the size of a beach towel. You could order it instead of rice!- chicken berry Britannia biryani - cooked in a dum pukht, where the pot is sealed with dough and content is cooked until it is tender and bursting with flavour- chicken ruby murray - award winning! And it got us leaving FAT TIPS!But wait! You're not allowed to leave yet! The desserts! What you gotta do is order the pineapple - black pepper crumble, and combine it with the cinnamon ice cream, ARE YOU INSANE! Oh lawd have mercy!Other equally delicious ways to satisfy your sweet tooth are the kulfi ice cream. Have the pistachio one!And just before you leave, order yourself a chai tea. Now that you're ready to do the penguin waddle after consuming what could have fed a small family of 12, welcome to the world of never ever being satisfied with any curry ever again. All in all, we think we are ruined! We have had to set ourselves strict limits and we are not allowing ourselves more than one visit a month. Enter at your own peril!One suggestion - come early if you can. Sometimes you could end up queuing for 3 hours to get a table. Booking is only accepted for groups of 6+",1,1,1,,

But they execute well here.  Good somosas, dal to die for, great grilled potatoes and lots of other consistently well-executed food.  The space is enormous so will be interesting to see if as word gets out whether this place will get packed.  Lots of different rooms and options for seating so it makes a big restaurant seem small.I do like the background music--was busy Shazaming songs although many of them weren't recognized.",1,1,1,,

A friend who travels to India a lot recommended this place.We lucked out and got the last two seats at the upstairs bar, and thank goodness we did because the queue piled up fast. (as a note to those not afraid to wait- we did notice waitresses going out with complimentary shots of sherry). The building itself is beautiful. I have an aversion to cumin, and hence the aversion to indian. So I asked which meals didn't include it. not only was i given an answer, but an outlined menu on which meals could be made without so i desired. The food was incredible. I even ordered one dish out of my comfort zone and i think i will crave it when i return to boston. More importantly were the servers though, and the drinks. oh the drinks. They are craftsman behind the bar. such unique spins on common bar drinks. Bay leaf and green tea infused old fashion, with an accompanying history lesson as the backstory to the inspiration of the drink. Everyone we spoke to was so happy, so personable, so knowledgeable and just lovely to be around. this will become a staple place every time i visit London, without question. Thank you for such a wonderful evening that wont be forgotten.",1,1,1,,

I am determined to spend time in the basement bar.",1,1,1,,
247,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Went on a Tuesday night and waited for 2 hours for a table. We had heard about wait times but didn't expect this. When we showed up before 7 there was a lineup all across the front of the restaurant. Although we waited quite a long time, I have never had such a good waiting experience. From drinks provided in the queue, to being moved to the bar as a secondary waiting area, 2 hours actually seemed to go by quickly. The place was well staffed and my friends and I became quite convinced that a girl's sole job was to go around making sure incense was always burning everywhere. Atmosphere was great. The building is massive, it's crazy to think how long we had to wait considering all the tables actually in the restaurant. Food and drinks were stunning. We were 6 all sharing so I can't actually confirm everything I tried, but it was all amazing. Will definitely go back.",1,1,1,,

I loved the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant and we were lucky enough to get seated quite quickly. The staff were very friendly and we were served some nice chai tea while waiting to be seated. Although they initially told us it would be a 45-60 minute wait we were seated in about 20 minutes. I had the mango lassi to drink which was very refreshing and not too sweet. The waiter recommended 3/4 plates per person which was more than enough food and we had enough to take leftovers home. The best dishes were the calamari, the matar paneer and the black daal lentils. Everything was quite spicy so be careful if you don't like spicy food. I was very impressed with the price for the quality of food, nothing we ordered was more than about 8 pounds. Overall great experience and a beautifully designed restaurant.",1,1,1,,

250,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I believe it is very hard to do a themed restaurant without it being tacky, but they have managed it! The theme is Bombay cafes in the 1920s and 1930s when prohibition was enforced so alcohol could only be drunk with a permit and they were the only place that everyone all Indian castes could go.Right down to the drinks served in apothecary glasses, the historical pictures on the wall and the real research that has got into this place, aligned with their quest for to authenticate flavours,  makes this brilliant place.Bookings are hard to get at short notice and turning up means a 1.5 hour wait, even on a weeknight. They  do make you feel very comfortable while waiting in the drinks area, but probably not worth waiting quite this long.The average age is probably late twenties and there are few people in the mid 40s and above, this is a trendy cool place and is quite noisy as goes with places for such a young crowd. The service levels are high, they really know how to talk about what a serving and whoever runs this place is bang.  However the waiters do have that slight cold edge of being on sales commission.It is not cheap, but not overly expensive.An authentic a big recommendation, that you will enjoy and so will the people you take.",1,-1,1,,
251,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Dishoom is the epitome of fusion; everything from the food menu, to the array of drinks to the layout of the restaurant and even the staff members are a wonderful mishmash of ingredients and culture. A replica of a Bombay Cafe, Dishoom represents a Persian influenced restaurant located in Bombay. The inside of Dishoom is certainly elaborate and transports you to another world. Their lamb and chicken is succulent, their prawns are sweet and their salad is fresh. My only criticisms of their food are that they have not allowed the Naan and Roti bread to rise much but instead enabled them to become a little dry with less flavour and whenever they have grilled the food the exteriors have been somewhat burnt and blackened. Both the drinks and desserts hold pleasant surprises and tasteful combinations. The waiter said I was brave to try the Kala Khatta Sharbat which contains kokum fruit juice, chilli, citrus and black salt but actually far from being a decision I would live to regret, as with most of their ventures, they succeed in achieving the combination of interesting yet pleasant. Unfortunately the toilets are buried far away and underground so try not to eat so much that it's hard to move, or drink so much that you would urgently need to relieve yourself. It is remarkable however how uniquely designed even the toilets are to suit the whole image of the restaurant. I am not a fan of smelling incense at every turn but all-round wonderful to behold, Dishoom is top-notch for originality.",1,1,1,,

We queued for 1hr 20mins in the pouring rain. But thank you for Dishroom providing us entertainments to keep us amuse in the queue.There are a range of drinks (alcoholic and non-alcholic) to order and all look interesting.  I started off with one of the rose lassis and was hoping to finish the evening with the Bailey Chai which was unfortunately sold out.The food was good but could had been warmer as most of our cooked dishes were luke warm. I enjoyed the okra fries and the Bhel which we started as an appertiser.I love the chicken ruby over the chef special (nalli nihari). But both was nice with roti or naan bread. Instead of steamed rice we had the chicken berry britannia which reminded me of another version of fried rice.There are a range of grills and we orderd a few to try. My favourite has to be the Murgh Malai which used chicken thigh that give it that smooth succulent chicken texture.Dessert we tried the pisatchio kulfi and the pineapple and black pepper crumble. I could not remember tasting or seeing any black pepper. It was like apple crumble but pineapple instead. The service was really slow but it has improved since the soft launch.

256,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"If you're looking for an authentic and scrumptious Indian meal, THIS IS IT. We ordered the Dishoom Chicken Tikka which was absolutely amazing! The chicken was moist and incredibly flavourful. We also got the black dhal and a vegetarian curry which was amazing and paired really nicely with the garlic naan. The concept is similar to how it is in India as well where food are served in small portions and meant to be shared. Price for each dish averaged between å£5 to å£9. The service was impeccable with attentive and friendly servers. All-in-all, an amazing experience. Definitely worth a return.",1,1,1,,
257,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,3,"If you're looking for top class service and atmosphere this is the place. If you are looking for great Indian food, this isn't the place. I found most of the dishes were sweet, as if the chef replaced spice with sugar. The wait for a table was a killer, so advise to get there very early. The menu selection is limited and the portion size was small so really you are paying for the service (even though it's a separate charge on your bill). Really it's a shame, as the service is probably in the top ten in London (if you discount the waiting time), but its just not Indian food as expected, more like sweet tapas with a Indian twist",-1,1,1,,

Dishoom on the other hand has too many restrictions. No take away after 5pm. No delivery. You can't order certain things off their lunch menu.The portions are tiny for the price. The only thing fantastic about the place is the ambiance but its not a place for a first date, it's very loud during lunch and dinner hour.",-1,-1,1,,

262,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"This was a great dining experience! We were prepared to wait, so we weren't bothered by the one hour line. We just had a drink (the drink menu was really fun to read!) and got our table sooner than expected. The service continued to be great, with our waiter taking several trips to the kitchen to make sure our meal was free from coriander. And, of course, the food was amazing too. The chicken ruby, black daal and lamb chops were all so flavorful and delicious. We also had roti and some rice, and samosas to start. If I were to repeat this meal I would order these exact same items, maybe with the okra fries which were out.",1,1,1,,
263,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"What a great place to enjoy authentic Indian food while in London.  My wife and I stopped here after reading the solid reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed.  We had the Vegetable Samosas Biryani, and the Chicken Tikka.  All were extremely flavorful with just the right amount of seasoning/spice.  We finished our meal with a traditional chai tea latte and their famous chocolate chai tea.  The chocolate is very good!  Come here to enjoy a great meal!",1,1,1,,
264,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"W O W! My only two even slightly negative comments are: this was not an easy place to find without GPS (the map on their website is NOT clear!), and we waited longer to get the check than we did between ordering and getting our food which is just plain annoying.The FOOD however was divine, absolutely wonderful and inventive. We had fried okra, which my 16 year old daughter discovered was a lot spicier three minutes after the first bite than she reckoned on. I adored it! The okra is not fried whole as I've had it before, but rather in thick slivers and the coating has lime and chili in it. I also really enjoyed the garlic naan, which was offered with or without butter- I went for with of course. Murgh malai (chicken with garlic, ginger, coriander stems and cream) was not spicy but flavorful and enjoyed by my daughter, I had the mango paneer salad, vegetable samosas and bowl of greens. This last was quite yum but had a LOT of sauce...if we had had rice it might have soaked it up but we went with roti and naan so it didn't add much. I was truly looking forward to the dessert called ""kala khatta gola ice""... but sadly they were out. So they offered us complementary chai and when we said ""no thanks"" ( as we wanted tea and scones at the V&A later) the server surprised us with complementary ice creams! The cinnamon was intensely flavored, not necessarily a bad thing...but the chili ice cream (yup, a slightly orange concoction) was downright sneaky! The first taste was smooth, creamy, slightly sweet and then POW! your tastebuds come under assault from the spicy chili. I managed four bites before putting down my spoon.We went Saturday afternoon around 2:15 and waited less than five minutes to be seated, less than ten before we ordered, less than ten to get our food...but almost twenty to get our bill. I didn't add to the included 12.5% service charge, but I didn't subtract anything either...Try this place if you have a varied palate, especially if you like your food spicy!",1,-1,1,,
265,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"I don't know where to begin. This place ROCKS. First off, their drinks and food are amazing, the Bombay colada is awesome and the brilliant bartenders are excellent at improvising with drinks. Our server, Mat was sassy and fun and recommended delicious food. We order the raita (cucumber yogurt), which perfectly complimented our order of murg malai (grilled chicken with some lovely spices). We also had the best curry ever: chicken ruby! Spicy, but full of flavor that left you wanting more. Also, we had the number one bartenders on the planet. It was me and my two best friends in our party, and bartenders Jan and Pavel took GREAT care of us. I've never had service from a bartender, let alone TWO bartenders, that was this amazing. They made us delicious drinks on the spot. These two gentlemen are definitely the reason I will be back incredibly soon! Thank you Jan and Pavel!! Dishoom was the best dinner my friends and I had in London. The food and service was out of this world. Did I mention they gave us some delicious chai drink while we waited in line? Yeah. This place is awesome. If you go anywhere else, don't expect you'll get as good of service as this place will get you. Especially at the bar!!",1,1,1,,

Incredibly good and friendly service, interesting, fun space in a large converted warehouse, great cocktails, but it's really all about the food! Just delicious Indian - most of it nicely authentic and respectful of traditional Indian, yet much of it with a great modern twist that made it even more interesting without being pretentious or fussy.  Decent value as well. The desserts - we tried four of them - were just as amazing!",1,1,1,,
267,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Really awesome spot -- fantastic food, atmospherics and service. Masterfully decorated and exceptionally run.

268,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"I much prefer this branch to the Covent Garden branch of Dishoom. Despite the infamous wait, service looks after you with a cup of cha and snacks. It's far more roomy inside and has a pretty cool layout with mezzanine dining above the bar area. Food is great (lamb chops get two thumbs up), but portions are pretty small - it's the only fault that makes me question the epic wait.",1,1,1,,

271,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,Had a great meal here. Service is excellent. My favorites were the dal (recommended by the server -- he was so right) and the naan. The lamb chops were good although not exceptional. The bowl of greens was overcooked.,1,1,1,,
272,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Love this location. Great food and atmosphere. Would definitely recommend going there. Be sure to get the biriyanis, black daal and chicken ruby!",1,1,1,,

The restaurant itself is really nice as well. The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is that it's quite expensive, moreover you'll sometimes need to buy a few things separately so it can be around 25å£ per person, but it's worth it!",1,1,1,,

I ordered the chicken biryani which went amazingly well with the yoghurt and the nan etc. Fried courgettes were spectacular, prawns and calamari..  I ate everything they have really. And their dessert was to die for and the service was on point and not to mention the venue itself! What a magical place..  it's Indian with a modern twist. Enjoy every second of it!",1,1,1,,
276,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"This place is very popular and even when it's pretty quiet on the streets of London on a bank holiday Monday the place is buzzing. We over ordered getting 3 starters and 2 mains but it was all very good. You need to be a group of 6 or more to reserve a table. Btw, it wasn't very spicy and I prefer it eye wateringly hot!",1,1,1,,
277,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"A very different take to your usual Indian restaurant - but a good different! Had a selection of snacks and main dishes and everything was really tasty, including the extensive drinks menu too. Only thing would be portions are relatively small and we were a group so had reservations and no waiting for a table - which I hear can be really long! Worth a visit",1,1,1,,
278,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,4,"Great food, and great cocktails. It was extremely busy and the line was long, but they comp'd us the drinks for waiting longer than the amount of the time they'd quoted so big thumbs up from me! That chai paanch is so velvety on your tongue, you'd never guess it was a clarified milk cocktail.",1,1,1,,
279,indian,NKGOw3iT06Wsj2uLOsYTgQ,Dishoom,5,"Just happened by and chose the place since we were pressed for time. We lucked out, this place was outstanding. The waiter was awesome, explaining everything on the menu. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious!",1,1,1,,
280,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishoom is an absolute must when in London. If you have never tried Indian food before this is the spot to try it out for the first time. My husband and I had an absolute feast. The food isn't cheap, but it is worth every penny!!! From the vegetables to the chicken tikka, you cannot go wrong. The garlic naan is to die for and so are the side sauces. I didn't really care for the dessert here, but that's no biggie. Just go somewhere else for dessert and stick to the food.As far as the vibe goes, it feels like you've been taken back in time. The music and decor are aesthetically pleasing and the music just seals the deal. Enjoy every minute here...I don't live in London and this is on my to-do whenever we visit.",1,1,1,,
281,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"In what appears to be lots of options for this place wherever you are in London, the carnaby location was closest for us.  Orders of garlic, cheese and plain naan were a must.  We had to get some samosas which ended up being the vegetable variety was my preference.  Biryani's were good, the chicken berry was good, though I'd want to try the jackfruit next time.The salli boti stood out in the menu as well as the taste in my mouth.",1,1,1,,
282,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Extremely impressed, definitely lives up to the hype. Arrived on a Thursday evening, was told there would be an hour and fifteen minute wait, but actually only had to wait around 20 minutes. I will say that their process seems overly complicated, we first had to give our name to a man across the alley with a tablet, and five minutes later he gave us the go ahead to see the hostess inside for a pager.The okra fries were phenomenal. Great seasoning and came out hot and fresh. The grilled corn was also fantastic, amazing flavor profile with the smokiness from the charcoal with the chili and lime. The chicken tikka was moister than other chicken tikka I've had, it seems like they use fattier pieces. It was good. The chicken ruby aka butter chicken seems to be a favorite but I'm not a huge fan of butter chicken, so I found this dish to be fine but nothing special. Overall, it was a fantastic meal, I would go back for the okra and corn alone.",1,1,1,,
283,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I don't normally go out of my way for Indian food, but when in London, you've got to try this place. Best Indian food EVER!We sat outside along the walkway which was perfect for people watching. I think the passersby in general were curious as to what Indian food is all about. People would literally stop and stare to see what was on our table.Service was outstanding with our waitress making thoughtful suggestions. The Bombay Pimm drink - mint, citrus, pomegranate, and coriander served with ginger beer instead of lemonade - was refreshing in the warm weather.The one dish you have to get? Salli boti. It's braised lamb in a rich and flavorful gravy served with buttered roti bread. I ordered a half plate and ended up ordering a second because it was that good. If you're on the fence about lamb or have never tried it, then order it here and make this your first. Order the garlic naan as well. The bread was terrific by itself but even better with the lamb.We tried many dishes and they were all delicious. The favs were the prawns - Masala if you like it grilled or Koliwada if you want a little more tamarind flavor with date chutney. The chicken tikka was good too. Although the biryani was wonderfully aromatic, I'd pass on this and carb up with the naan. There's just so much else to try.The food is amazing. Be sure to make reservations. There's little to no chance that you're going to walk in and sit down...especially if you're a party of four or more.",1,1,1,,
284,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"This is more of a 3.5 star than a 3.  Came here during our long layover in the UK and the wait time here was 1.5 hrs!  The food here although it was good we didn't think it was worth the wait.  Note that I am from NYC and we also have a lot of great Indian food selections but definitely wanted to try it in London because it is so well known. I didn't feel like any dish stood out but although overall it was filling the flavors wasn't what I consider out of this world.Good place, nice setting but food was just good not fantastic",-1,1,1,,
285,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I love Indian food. I love it so so so much but I rarely eat it bc many around me don't care for it, including Chuck. While in London, I needed to find a delicious meal for, what was likely, my only chance to score some delicious naan, samosas and curry. I landed on Dishoom. We arrived around 630 and there was already an hour wait. Thankfully, we were not super starving so we headed to the bar for a round or two of cocktails. They were very well made and our waiting time flew by. Thankfully our buzzer buzzed and we were seated. We grabbed an order of lamb samosas to start, followed with a cheese naan, garlic naan, roasted potatoes and an order of chicken curry. Now. We wait. The samosas arrived in three crispy little pockets of philo, expertly seasoned. They paired very well with the small sauces placed on the table before service. The naan was the perfect dipper for our curry which was nicely spicy while not being overwhelming. The small potato chunks were covered in dry seasoning and tasty. This meal (sans drinks) only cost about å£40 which was nice for all the plates we got. It was so good that I was able to get Chuck to go to the other location one more time before leaving.",1,1,1,,
286,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"As an American tourist in London, I loved this restaurant, and appreciated such yummy food at this price point. The staff was great about explaining house specialties and the appropriate number of dishes to order (apparently 2-3 small things per person).  Our favorite dishes were the lamb samosas, raita (a yogurt and basil-type dip), and the house special.  Important to note is that this house special dish varies between Dishoom locations, and the one of Kingly Street was excellent!  We found the black daal to be underwhelming (given how popular it seems to be) in comparison to the house specialty. No reservations needed for lunch on a weekday, but be prepared to wait ~1 hour for dinner. They may bring you spiced chai to sip on while you wait in line!",1,1,1,,

Some ongoing construction in the distance though right now so avoid sitting outside if that type of noise bothers you. The seating indoors is fun and the decor together with the incense/music whisks you away to another era. The kitchen downstairs is fun too - you walk past the energy (open kitchen) on the way to the WC. The food as always is solid. This time I just did a small order - house Dahl (so much flavor) and garlic naan. Highly recommend both items. Wish I were here early enough for breakfast - the bacon and egg naan eludes me yet again...",1,1,1,,

He suggested we arrive about 30-45 minutes in advance, knowing there would be a long queue. We got there at about 6pm and waited 50 minutes outside just to get the pager! Luckily, the weather was unusually warm and we were offered sweet wine and tea. Once inside, we waited about another 50 minutes at the bar. It was very crowded, but we were fine sipping on our Gimlets. We were seated by a fireplace with sofa seating, which was cute. Our friend did the ordering, but everything was delicious. Looking back at the menu, we had the okra fries, chicken ruby, chicken tikka, black daal, jackfruit biryani, roti, and cheese and garlic naan. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed. I enjoyed the ambience at Dishoom and the surrounding area in Carnaby was also a joy to walk through.",1,1,1,,

I have heard they always have 2 hours wait, so please make reservations.We were lucky to get a table with 10 mins without reservations.Ambience is nice & classy & it is pretty spacious.Food: we ordered vada pav, pav bhaji, okra chips, romali paneer wrap & chili cheese toast. Romali Paneer Wrap was the BEST tasting wrap I have ever had. In love with it. It actually takes you back to Mumbai.Pav bhaji, okra chips & chili cheese toast were also super tasty. But vada pav I felt the crust was a tad bit thick.

It was so tasty and the flavors were so diverse. I could eat 2 more servings. The chickpea salad on the other hand was not my favorite.

Goes well with the grilled meats and roti.Chicken Ruby - tastes similar to Tikka masala but a bit spicier and not as buttery. Roomali roti - like that it's not too flaky. Garlic naan - decent. not very fluffy.Service was okay.

Got recommended this place by a friend and absolutely had to go out of my way to try it and I would recommend it to anyone.We ordered the Okra Fries, Paneer Tikka, House Dahl, Garlic Naan, Basmati Rice and Mango Lassis for drinks. The okra fries are literally to DIE FOR. They are crispy, spicy and light and somewhat healthy because it's okra. Way better than any french fry or onion ring I've ever had and definitely use the dipping sauces (the orange one is the best). The paneer tikka could've used more flavor, but they were well made and tasted great with the dipping sauces. There was not much special about the naan or rice, but the House Dahl was awesome. Not a huge fan of dahl in North Indian cuisine, but this one had a hint of spice and a really deep taste and went great with both the naan and rice. The lassi was slightly the only disappointment as it was not creamy and was too sour.Debated between 4 and 5 stars for this place, but I was extremely impressed by the service. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and half the food had already come out. The waiters are all nice and the vibe of the place is awesome!

Food took forever to come out and they forgot about the chicken ruby so we waited an extra 30 mins after we had finished eating the rest of the food. Waiters were hard to track down outside.

Our wait time was just under an hour at 8pm on a Sunday, we were offered refreshing watermelon lemonade while waiting.  We had chicken tika, the daily special of lentil curry, roasted corn and a side of veggies.

The service is great. The price is fair.",1,1,1,,
301,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Visiting from the US, I had pretty high expectations of Indian food on the UK. Not only Dishoom deliver in taste and experience, I'm utter devastated that they've set the bar so high for all Indian cuisine that NONE in the US can compare to.When we first arrived, it was jam packed with people, I was worried we would have the longest wait if life, fortunately, not so. We were greeted by the warm smiles of our hostesses and offered that we wait at the bar for our 15 minute wait. The bartender seemed to have a keen sense of reading people because he knew exactly what I needed without me asking. It probably helped that I had no idea what to order. The Gimlet was a refreshing concoction of celery bitters, gin, lime, and a sprig of dill. One sip and I was transported straight to summer, refreshing, cool, and a little alerts cleanser. Our waitress then ushered us to our table, and with British hospitality explained with great detail how to navigate the menu to four clueless Americans. My eyes settled on the grilled king prawns and a side of basmati rice. As it arrived the Indian spices left a mouth watering aroma that left me drooling.No fuss, just king prawns encrusted with dried spices that my tongue could not pronounce. I bit and I could've burst into tears. It had the perfect char, lending a beautiful note of smoke, the spices provided a pleasant crunch before I reached the succulent meat of the prawn. The texture and flavors married perfectly into one bite. It was at that exact moment I knew I would never taste Indian food as delicious as was offered at Dishoom in the USA. To all those visiting the UK, this should be your number destination for Indian food!",1,1,1,,
302,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Really nice restaurant but the line was almost an hour long outside.. in winter. On the other hand the staff was really welcoming and nice, every ten minutes or so they kept coming and offering little glasses of either hot chai or sherry - how lovely. We tried both their chai and sherry and they were both really good.When we got inside there was another wait. We got lucky and found a place at the bar and waited there.Finally we got a table and ordered couple of dishes - Butter Chicken, Matar Paneer, naan bread and mango lassi with cardamom and eggnog chai. The food was very tasty and flavourful. I did not enjoy my eggnog chai, I think it was too sweet. And I wouldn't say it was the best I have ever tried. I'm not sure it was worth the wait for more than hour. I would definitely like to come back and try other dishes.",1,1,1,,

I went on a Tuesday night at around 8pm wanting to have a quick meal by myself and ended up waiting at the bar with a delicious cocktail for about 45 minutes. Completely worth the long wait times!",1,1,1,,
304,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Omg! Who knew the first meal that I had in London would taste so amazing! Seriously, and I did not expect anything from this place because we just walked up to a random restaurant to eat after landing in London. First of all, the service was spectacular and our waitress was super friendly and helpful. We got a lot of food and shared it amongst each other. Everything tasted delicious! I would recommend the bread and the chicken curries were good! They gave use some yummy crackers to start our meal and I was a bug fab of all the sauces that they provided us with! Everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection! You have to try this place of you are in London!",1,1,1,,
305,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Yeah, I'm going to have to go with the crowd on this one and say dishoom is pretty good: you'll spend a lot to get the variety necessary to sample lots of the menu, but it's a pretty good value. The chicken dishes (ruby and tikka) were both very good, as was the naan. The dishes that were really hyped (chai and daal) were both nothing special: I think I've had better chai at home using ""Oregon Chai"" concentrate (which is admittedly pretty awesome). My complaints deal with the wait, which is understandable if a place is popular. But the beeper says right on it that they give drinks to those waiting in line (sorry, I mean ""in queue""), and I saw none of this.  I asked about it (because I'd also read about this in other reviews), and I was told it's for times with longer lines before they hand out beepers - we'll then why does it say it ON THE BEEPER?!  Plus my wait was an hour, which deserves something. Instead I was invited to wait at the crowded bar and spend my own money.",1,1,1,,
306,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Following several failed attempts at trying to dine at their Covent Garden location, stumbled upon this outpost late on a Tuesday night. Managed to get in just before the kitchen closed (around 11pm), thus avoiding any lines they usually have.Quickly was given menus and settled on the Lamb Samosas (å£4.90), Chicken Ruby (å£9.50), and a Roomali Roti (å£2.70). Certainly on the expensive side which is assuming because it's high-end quality. Food comes out amazingly fast - first being the samosas. Three well crisped triangles with ground lamb and spices inside. Pretty good on it's own, but much better with the chutney provided. Chicken and roti come out next; a solid portion of diced chicken swimming in a rich gravy. Roti is soft but a little chewier than expected. Curry has a large tangy flavor that can get intense towards the end. Extremely filling meal leaving no room for dessert. Had also ordered an East India Gimlet (å£7.50) - a gin-based cocktail with celery bitters that was a solid nightcap (though I ordered it early on).I'm thankful this place was around after a disappointing stop at a nearby bar. Great over-the-top flavor that's good to try at least once.",1,1,1,,
307,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,2,"**Breakfast Review**Finally made it to Dishoom for a bit more Indian in the UK after failing to endure a 45-minute wait for dinner on a Sunday night. But the breakfast--a rarity, particularly for Indian--was pretty disappointing.  I was really hoping to maximize eating Indian while in the UK, and Dishoom's breakfast just wasn't up to par.They were kind enough to swap out the chicken livers in this dish for some portobellos. But while the minced chicken keema smelled terrific, it was just a massive salt bomb, especially when combined with the equally greasy and salty buns and crisps. It was just too much and I could even finish despite it being awfully expensive for breakfast. Other diners' order of naan wraps looked awfully good too so I ordered them to go.  The bacon one was not great, the sausage one offered a bit more texture and was better.The chai tea was awesome and unlimited. The normal menu for Dishoom still looks amazing.  But don't get breakfast here.",-1,-1,1,,
308,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Oh, glory be to Dishoom and for saving us from the... not so brilliant food in London. It is no wonder England imperialized everywhere else... they really needed some food with seasoning, taste, and that was edible. There isn't really any food you can go wrong with here, trust me I tried it all and I will do a quick line item list of what you need to do.Slaw - Had a little cranberry in there that did a wondrous job acting as the sweetener. Great crunch loved every bite and it was great as a contrast to the other flavors.Black Dahlia Curry - Great get it. Flavor that went well with some of our chicken appetizers. Smokey, a little sweet, and heaven.Appetizer Chickens - I don't remember their names so check out the pictures both were great one was a little spicier than the other.Potatoes - Went great with curry but not a must.Samosas - Good but once again not a must, if you are trying to get a little bit of everything go for it.THE VERDICT:Not the coolest experience place in London, but by far the best food. The wait staff was okay... the ambiance was decent. It was really the food alone that stood out for me and I wish we could have gone to more places like this while we were out there. There are multiple locations so you should easily be able to hit it up, even if your stay in London is short.",1,1,1,,

I went once for lunch and the second time for breakfast, that's how much I enjoyed it!For lunch we tried the okra fries, salli boti, garlic naan, and chicken tikka. The okra fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy and came with different dipping sauces! The Salli boti was so flavorful and fragrant with the right amount of spice. So good with the roti/naan. And the chicken tikka was tender and definitely had a kick to it!! Everything was delicious and packed with flavor. When I went for breakfast my friend and I shared the Big Bombay & date and banana porridge. Also ordered the chocolate chai drink which was so good!

This was a serendipitous lunch, because we were actually in Carnaby to eat at Mother Mash. Unfortunately for Mother Mash, they had a mechanical issue that drove us straight into Dishoom's arms. We were seated immediately and I ordered a house chai to start. On the menu, it states that ""all who have tried it are swearing by it."" That is no lie. This chai was really, really good. Better than any chai I've had. Very warming and comforting. For food, we ordered the following:+ Pau bhaji (å£4.50)+ House black daal (å£5.90)+ Gunpowder potatoes (å£6.50)+ Sali boti (å£11.50)The food was incredible! The pau bhaji was a bowl of mashed veggies and came with a hot, housemade, buttered bun. An incredible start to the meal, with a slightly spicy kick! The house black daal is a MUST. I've never had such amazing daal before. It's got so much rich flavor, given that it's been cooked for over 24 hours. The gunpowder potatoes were great too, as they were tossed with butter and cooked with aromatic seeds and herbs. And the house special - sali boti - is a classic Parsi dish. Braised tender lamb in a rich and deeply savory sauce that's topped with crunchy crisp chips. This dish is served with a roomali roti, a soft thin bread.I would recommend every single dish we ordered. Everything was cooked to perfection and left me wanting more. Make a trip to Dishoom today.",1,1,1,,

Although our server was incredibly helpful offering other options and suggested a dish for another time. Service was quick and efficient and decor is lovely! It's a bit dark inside but does have a nice ambience. I would fully recommend, even if it is a bit on the pricey side when compared to other Indian restaurants.",1,1,1,,

Every employee we came in contact with was beyond nice. They explained the menu to us and made suggestions. It was so amazing I came back for breakfast, which was just as wonderful.

I was completely satisfied and don't have anything major to complain about. I just wasn't blown away like I wanted to be. Chalk up another win to the hype gods I guess. We ordered the ruby chicken with garlic naan and plain rice. We also tried the black daal. Everything was fine, except I wasn't a fan of the black Daal. I suppose that dish just isn't for me.

The seasoning on these fries were so good, and the dipping sauce was even better.We got the garlic naan, Roomali Roti (thin pancake), Sali Boti (lamb dish), Chicken Ruby (their chicken tikka masala).*SPICE ALERT* - If you're sensitive or want a balance to all the spice, highly HIGHLY recommend getting the RAITA. It's a cucumber yoghurt sauce that you can mix with everything  to cool down the spice; or it's just fucking good anyway.Etch-A-Sketches available if you bring your kids. Not that I have any kids, but I asked for one anyway.......",1,1,1,,

The food, the service, and the vibe were fantastic. The staff went out of its way to answer questions and seemed truly concerned that we were satisfied. After ordering the black daal, a specialty, our server apologetically informed us that the kitchen had run out of the dish. Later the manager stopped to apologize and then offered us a free pudding. However toward the end of our main, she returned with a full serving of the daal.  ""The kitchen,"" she said, ""made more. You should try it."" It was delicious, she didn't charge us for the daal--and she still comped our pudding. Yes, we waited 30 minutes like everyone else, but the experience was worth it.

I arrived around 10:20 am on a Thursday and was surprised to see how many tables were full (some for business and other travelers/tourists). I saw practically everyone in the restaurant with the house chai so figured it was awesome and I'm so glad I ordered it. This was the best chai I've ever had AND there were free refills...say no more. I ordered the akuri (spice scrambled eggs) that came with 2 house buns and a grilled tomato. I also ordered the grilled mushrooms on the side. This was my first experience with an Indian breakfast and I absolutely loved it. The spices (chopped pepper, black pepper, coriander, ginger) really complemented the eggs well. I typically hate ketchup with my eggs but for some reason a little bit went super well with the spiced eggs.Will definitely make this a regular if I travel to London in the future.

We've been coming here regularly for the last 3 years. Even those in the team who are lukewarm about Indian food are blown away by the flavours and quality of the dishes on offer here.Dishes to recommend?- Jackfruit Biryani, super interesting and unique- Ruby chicken, classic and amazing sauce- House Dhal, can't go wrong with this, get naan bread to go with itPro Tip: they have a hidden ""feast"" menu, and if you have a group of 5 or more and are feeling hungry or not sure what to order, ask for it.

In fact, the vibe in the whole place is just great and the atmosphere put me in a great mood!Food was, for the most part, excellent. I was somewhat skeptical before our first visit because oftentimes, buzzy restaurants over-promise and under-deliver. Not the case with Dishoom. My favorite dishes were the black lentils and masala prawns, and the pau bhaji as a starter. The chicken ruby was also a big hit with our group, although not my thing as  much. Everyone loved the gunpowder potatoes as well. This is a place where you really want to get a bunch of dishes and share among the group.The reason I'm giving Dishoom four stars, not five, is because (and this is controversial), I wasn't wild about the cocktails. I had a Cyrus Irani and a Kalamansi Smash, and both were too sweet for my taste and just not that exciting. They were not gross, and not so bad as to wreck the experience, but I just didn't love either of them. But our friends did like their cocktails, so it's probably just a question of personal taste. However, I did love the espresso I had after dinner the one time, and the chai I had after lunch the other time. Once we were seated, and at the bar, service was great, especially given how packed the place is.

There was an hour wait, which I was happy to make with the bar being so conveniently close to the waiting area. After a tall beer, I was seated. I ordered the Black Daal, a slow cooked spiced lentil soup. The lentils were well executed, smooth on the palate and soft on the bite. The blend was too spicy and pungent. It lacked complexity and attention to flavor. This became a theme with the meal. The naan was soft and charred. Great execution. I ordered a lamb dish. It's not that this dish was too spicy that turned me away, though it was too spicy. This dish relies entirely on its spicing. The lamb was cooked too far and didn't have tender meat or the savour of lamb fats. It was just a large mound of boiled, then pulled lamb. The lamb tasted as if an entire rack of spices were mixed with it. The mixture was repugnant. Dishoom's spicing is ham-fisted and lacks panache. For someone who loves an intense palate experience, this may be a good choice. If you're looking for adept flavoring, well executed meats, and want to walk away without feeling as if your tongue was dragged through the soot of an ashen battlefield, this is not a good choice.

341,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Long wait, normally 1 hour at least for dinner. Service is pretty good as staff are pretty friendly even it's so crowded. But imo food favlor is over rated..",-1,1,1,,
342,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"My friends brought me here during my visit in London and I loved this place. It's a tapas style for Indian food and everything was great! I love being again to try multiple items at once! There was a wait when we got there. You started in the outside like where they give you warm drinks to keep warm and when they have room inside they move you in and give you a buzzer where you can access the bar. We got drinks and the okra fries while we waited. Those fries are like crack, and they come with 3 types of sauce which were all delicious. The lamb skewer and the curry chicken are a must try!",1,1,1,,
343,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Decent flavor, preparation a little underwhelming.We arrived for brunch on a Sunday morning, and we had the egg and chili cheese toast, along with the chicken liver dish and the bacon naan. In general, the flavor was decent, but the dishes overall, particularly the latter two, felt a little",-1,-1,1,,

346,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"My boyfriend and I were looking for good Indian while visiting London, and definitely found it in Dishoom. I will warn potential patrons that this place is POPULAR. The first night we tried to eat here, we arrived at around 6:30pm on a Sunday, and there was an hour and forty-five minute wait. We ate next door, and decided to try again the next night. On Monday we arrived at 5pm, and were seated right away.The atmosphere of the restaurant was very unique, and meant to recreate the vibe of an old style Bombay cafe. The menu is meant to be eaten family style, so we ordered a number of different dishes to share. My boyfriend also tried their Chai tea which he said was top notch! We ordered the Dishoom calamari to start which came lightly fried with a very interesting sweet/spicy sauce. It was delicious; could have ordered two servings. Then we also ordered the chicken ruby, lamb biryani, house black daal, and garlic naan. We liked everything except the daal. It had an odd, milky taste, and didn't live up to our expectations of a daal. Every daal we'd ever had before that had been looser with a strong ginger flavor. Honestly, there is something for everyone here. It's fun to try all of the different dishes, and the prices are very reasonable.",1,1,1,,
347,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishoom is pretty darn great. We got here on a Saturday for lunch and was told the wait would be 45 minutes. So we stood at the bar and ordered a chai (it's bottomless! What!) and just soaked in the ambiance (they do a pretty great job with it).We were actually seated in 20 minutes- love when they wait is shorter than promised. Our server was really friendly and super helpful.We ordered murgh malai, chicken tikka, daal and this pretty interesting irani  style lamb curry (i'm forgetting the name). While everything was delicious, I actually think their murgh malai was the star of the show. It was perfectly seasoned, melted in your mouth and had the perfect texture and flavor. It reminded me of the kebabs we get back in Calcutta!  I wish i was hungrier, or we came in a bigger group so I could try more things! Will definitely come back.",1,1,1,,
348,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Really hip, happening place, bartenders whipped up some nice drinks, made the long wait a little more pleasant. Food was excellent in terms of flavors, textures needed a bit of work, lamb was tender but marinade/sauce was somewhat grainy, cucumber/tomato salad had nice flavors, but could work on how things are sliced/chopped. The Bhel Puri also had good flavor, but rice kernels should be crispier. All in all, high on taste, just work on some refinements.",1,1,1,,
349,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This place was recommended by a friend ... given that it seemed a tad ""trendy"" at the moment I had my doubtsBut this place was insanely good and not outrageously priced.   Our server was a bit focused on only one member of our table but we ended up with some very good food.   The paneer was the only disappoint--it was lacking in flavor.  The rest was all home runs including the cocktails",1,-1,1,,
350,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I am from India, so I know what REAL Indian food tastes like. I have tried many different Indian restaurants around the world, and none of them have ever compared and will never compare to a legit restaurant in India. However, Dishoom is the restaurant that has gotten the closest to Indian food reality. Dishoom also has a very accurate attention to detail. Let me explain what I mean--the small details that are present in the food and the restaurant itself prove this careful attention to detail. Food wise, never before have I tasted a beautiful, perfect blend of Indian flavors and spices put into Indian food--it's a fantastic experience. Restaurant wise, the vibe of Dishoom is lively, fun, homey, and most importantly, truly Indian. If one is looking for a lively, exciting new adventurous experience, he or she should come to Dishoom and experience the closest taste to Indian reality.",1,1,1,,
351,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Wow.. I didn't think I liked Indian until I had Dishoom. I mean, I've had Indian food before and I live in Toronto where there's a pretty big Indian population and I equate that to having good authentic Indian food but I never l liked it until Dishoom!Carnaby location is awesome because I've always been able to walk-in without waiting 1+ hr. I've been to this location twice after feeling defeated at the Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations.The garlic naan is a MUST. Nice hot freshly made with a bit of a crisp on outer edges and not too garlic-y.Chai Tea was delicious! Just sweet enough for me (I like sweet).Chicken Berry Britannia biryani was AMAZING! I normally don't like to eat rice but it was soo full of flavour. There was also a hint of sweetness and a bit spicy.Chicken Ruby was sooo rich and good! Creamy sweet and mild spicy sauce with the most tender chicken. This goes perfectly with the Garlic Naan.",1,1,1,,
352,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"WOW!!! WOW !!! WOW!!!! I'm so happy you can reserve a table before 6pm, as I have seen so many times a queue outside the Covent Garden Dishoom.. thats lasts an HOUR!! I once ate/finished a 3-course meal whilst watching a woman in a purple coat move as slow as a dead snail just to get in the front door... NOW.. even though it is totally worth it.. SO is booking a 1/2 day at work just so you don't have to queue in the cold!! *Just a thought*We were actually sat earlier than our reservation at this Dishoom. Me and my husband were celebrating an anniversary so they didn't want us to wait, which was extremely nice considering I was thinking about eating myself. We were given a complimentary prosecco and talked through the menu.The waitress was incredible.. She even handled the fact that I was trying to crack unfunny jokes due to the hunger delirium that had set in.I thought we may have over ordered due to the excitement but I feel like you can never over order. THE FOOD IS INDESCRIBABLE! (but I will try).. HEAVEN!! comes to mind. I am used to a cheap and cheerful takeaway and there I am eating like a Mah€r€ja (Googled the word for Indian King). I would have eaten until I exploded it was that good.We ordered:Okra FriesLamb SamosasSali BotiHouse Black Daal (MY FAVOURITE. it was like I was eating silk!!??)Chicken Biryani Garlic Naan...I CAN NOT WAIT TO GO AGAIN!!!Thank you Dishoom.I'll never forget this anniversary.. not cause love is a beautiful thing...

VERY worth it.Step 1: Order anything that sounds remotely good to you, and you won't be disappointed.Step 2: Order the black lentils, the chai tea, and the garlic naan, because if you don't, you WILL be disappointed.Step 3: When you're completely full and feel like a very happy blimp, order more black lentils to eat at home later. Very crucial.Enjoy!",1,1,1,,
354,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,If I could eat every meal here I just might. Never disappointed with their choices and their cocktails are amazing. I love India food but this place spoils my local haunts for me a little bit.,1,1,1,,
355,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Worth the hype. Just to note, they don't take reservations, so expect to wait at least an hour. Super friendly service! They brought out sherry and chai samples while we were waiting in line outside. The bar area is super cute with the dim lighting and what not. They have a good selection of cocktails and wine.The food is amazing and perfectly proportioned. Got the calamari, garlic naan, chicken curry dish and a side of greens. Everything was flavorful and delicious. Make sure you ask for rice if you want it.",1,1,1,,
356,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Great restaurant, wonderful food and atmosphere. Due to its location on a super busy street, I would recommend getting there early. I went there twice during my stay - had dinner around 5:30 each time, with no waiting, but by the time I was finished and leaving, there was a long wait for tables; 1 hour or more.",1,1,1,,
357,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Best meal we had in London. Put down your knife and fork and eat with your hands ..you will not regret it ..the food here is out of this world.. utterly satisfying ..a roller coaster for the pallet and senses.the Murray Ruby Chicken was the star of the show!! Make sure to order anything that sounds remotely appealing ...the lentils the okra fries.. everything is ridiculous!!!,1,1,1,,
358,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"After a long day of sightseeing, lots of walking and waiting in all the touristy places, I was not looking forward to standing in the long lines again. But the tea gave me some energy and we waited for ~ 50mins. My family was getting restless but I nudged them to be a bit more patient as the reviews promised that it was worth the wait. I was hoping that I was not building up the hype ..... as I know for sure the hubby and kids wont flinch to give their candid opinion after all the wait. And boy what a lovely treat! The dinner was super yumm and totally worth the wait. We tried the okra fries,  lamb appetizer (I think the name was kebab that was truly the yummiest thing I ate), chicken ruby and jackfruit biryani. The thought of their food itself is mouth watering. If I could, I would fly all the way from SFO for this food.I wish they opened one branch in SFO too.",1,1,1,,

I am confident from what I had that everything must be amazing.  The mattar paneer was the best I've had as well as the lamb curry and roomali roti. Unbelievable! Highly recommended!!",1,1,1,,
360,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,This restaurant was by far one of my favorites in London! Highly recommended. We had the most kind waitress. Incredible food and staff!!,1,1,1,,
361,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,This place is pretty good but I wouldnt go to say it lives up its hype. Portions are quite small and prices are not cheap.The chicken was well cooked and decently flavoured. The naan was well cooked and not chewy. Samosas were your run of the mill kind not spectacular but satisfying. We did have to wait for 3 hours to get in and I wouldnt do it again. Chickpea salad was also refreshing . Chicken Tikka Kebab was well spiced but on the salter side. Mango lassi was perfect not overly sweet.  The service was a bit rude dude to high traffic but they could have been nicer.,-1,-1,1,,
362,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I would eat here every day - breakfast, lunch, or dinner!  This location tends to be less crowded than Covent Garden, but you still should expect a wait during peak times.For breakfast, I love their naan wrapped runny egg with handmade tomato chutney.  For dinner, it's all about the black dahl.  There are so many other highlights, but suffice to say that meat eaters and vegetarians will both be happy. And their cocktails are delicious, too!Service isn't always perfect but the staff do try hard and the place is always packed, so I can't fault them.  I am in London a lot, and I visit this location at least twice each trip.",1,1,1,,
363,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I could go on for ever about how excellent this dining experience was! When we arrived we were informed of the 1 hour wait time which was anticipated, so we sat down and enjoyed a cocktail at the bar. The wait only ended up being about 40 mins which was great.Once seated our server was excellent and introduced us to the establishment and provided a ton of recommendations which we took and enjoyed immensely. The black daal (by far my favorite), ruby chicken curry, garlic nan, a bowl of greens, paneer tikka, and a fantastic bottle of Ruinart champagne to top it all off! (Which is my favorite bubbles) The ambiance was romantic, yet fun. The servers were all hustling to the jazzy, Bombay music playing throughout the restaurant. Even my bathroom experience was great! When you walk downstairs to the WC you actually get to walk past the kitchen and can see the chefs doing their thing. It was a delicious, fun, and unique dining experience. I wish I lived in London to eat at Dishoom all the time.",1,1,1,,
364,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Came here for breakfast because Mother Mash was closed. The decorations around the restaurant is very unique and nice.

365,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Excellent food. A little slow with the drinks, but that's probably a function of how busy it was. Everybody wants to have some of this food! I'll be returning here in my subsequent visits to London. Pro tip: some (most?) of the food is meant to be eaten with fingers, so don't be too quick with the silverware.",1,1,-1,,
366,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"All-in-all a good dining experience. Prepare to wait as this is an extremely popular place. Had an hour wait so the wife and I posted up at the bar for a couple of drinks and a little starter which you can order while waiting. Wife had a BollyBellini that was interesting. Not the best bellini I've ever tasted but it was an interesting twist which was nonetheless still very good. We ordered the prawn koliwada which were great. Shrimp were nice and plump, cooked to perfection and the sauce had a real nice punch of heat which I cooled down with a Kingfisher, India's most popular beer.Once seated, about 45-minutes later, we ordered the chicken ruby, the chef special sali boti and the spicy lamb chops. Of course we got some garlic na'an on the side to dip in all the delicious gravies. The chicken ruby was spot on. Just the right amount of sweetness and heat. The chicken could be cut with a spoon it was so tender. Probably my favorite dish of our order.The sali boti definitely had some kick (spicy) and came with a side of the roomali roti which was paper thin. The lamb in the dish was similar to the chicken ruby, so tender! I used the roti to basically wipe the dish completely clean. Very very tasty!What prevented the fifth star was the lamb chop. While the flavor was still there and the marinade was delicious, the lamb was just not cooked that well. It was medium well, boarding on well. Lots of grey inside the meat when I cut into the center and not nearly enough pink and definitely no red at all. After having perfectly cooked lamb the previous night at The Ninth, this was very apparent. If they had nailed the cook this could've been a 5-star experience for sure.Service was great. Ambience was bumpin. Price point was fair! Definitely recommend this place.",1,1,1,,
367,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I have been to this location and one other at least three times now but finally getting around to my review. This is my go-to place to entertain guests and meet friends for Indian food. Hands down, always a solid meal.There is good reason there can be an hour + wait but they have a system to get you to the bar for a drink whilst you wait and even bring out drinks to people in the queue.The food is the reason people will wait but I also love the atmosphere! Old world India meets British flair. They keep the theme in the menu with excellent craft cocktails and dishes. There is mood lighting, some low seats and traditional tables. Service is fast and friendly.My favourite dishes are the okra fries (always), lamb biryani, chicken tikka, mattar paneer, garlic naan, chicken ruby and any assortment of the dips. I dare you to find anything you don't like or that isn't packed with flavour. Dishoom is the reason people say London has the best Indian cuisine out of India.",1,1,1,,
368,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,2,"Right.....can people please get over this Dishoom obsession so regular people can actually go and eat there. And Dishoom I am totally over your we dont take bookings nonsense.I get why its good for you but its awful from the customers perspective. Turning up on any given evening to be told its a 2 hour wait and oh by the eay you ahev to queue...and you cant leave the queue....and if you do you lose your spot. Its a nonsense.get a booking system,,,,get your head our your arse and maybe I will come back.",-1,-1,1,,
369,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Just what I needed, another reason to enjoy some of the best food I've found in London, this outlet tucked away in Soho.

There might be a wait, but it's worth it!Enjoy!",1,1,1,,
370,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"I would say 3.5 stars but I'm in a generous mood today. Came here with a couple of friends around 3pm on a Friday in order to avoid the crowds and we still had to wait for a few minutes. The food was good but for me nothing to RAAAAVEE about for months to come. The space is gorgeous in my opinion and the service nice enough. Would still be back though.",1,1,-1,,
371,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Dinner at Dishoom was easily my favorite meal in London! From the creative and well-priced cocktails during our wait to the plethora of delicious dishes that had us adding on to our order up until the kitchen closed, everything was so well executed and accompanied by attentive and effusively friendly service. I would have tried to come back for another dinner before we left but I didn't want to mar the great first impression.Started with a round of Bombay-style drinks from the bartender's recommendations: Thumbs Up Flip, East India Gimlet, and Sonia's Negroni, and they were all extremely strong and under $10 with pretty presentation. Late on a weeknight, there was still a reasonable (and accurate) 20 minute wait for a table, despite the spacious dining area. Reservations recommended.We moved to our table and met our server, whose name unfortunately escapes me because she was so helpful in making suggestions and ensuring we had the best experience! Our group generally has eyes bigger than our stomachs and she helped to ensure we made the best choices: the Sali Boti Chef's special is a must-get platter of tender lamb and flavorsome gravy topped with potato chips and served with roti, go big with the full order because it's just that good! They also feature their house black daal, which was a smooth and rich side that paired well with everything. The Prawn Koliwada more than lived up to their name with a plentiful portion despite the petite price and the smoky Gunpowder Potatoes I initially dismissed ended up being one of the highlights of our meal! Standard staples of garlic naan and steamed basmati were fragrant, but almost made me wish we'd saved the room for more of their unique dishes like the street food small plates and grilled lamb chops.",1,1,1,,
372,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Pretty cool place! Really big and spacious seating. My friend and I shared the okra fries which were so goood!! Got a little salty towards the end but it was nice to share.I got the chicken ruby, rice, and garlic naan. My friend got the chef special I think? It was my first time trying chicken ruby and it was pretty good! Slightly sweet and a little spicy. The garlic naan was kind of small but overall the food was decent.Service was great and everyone was really friendly.",-1,1,1,,
373,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Awesome Indian experience. The best Indian food in London. Go at off-peak time for no wait.,1,1,1,,
374,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Good, not great. Given the reviews, I was expecting to be blown away.  The food was tasty, but nothing too special.  I wouldn't wait in line for 45 minutes for the food again.I would definitely wait in line for the bar, though!  The rose and gin drink was out of this world and I'd love to come back and have a second one.",1,-1,-1,,
375,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Empty plates - should be enough for any Yelp review but apparently the bot wants more.When we were planning our vacation to London, several co-workers recommend Dishoom and boy were they right.  We've got great Indian cuisine in Los Angeles but this was by far the best Indian food I've ever eaten.  The other five star people have already said what can be said about Dishoom.  You will wait about an hour (walk around Carnaby Street), their curry is outstanding, so is the Naan.  If you're traveling go ahead and over order AND... eat it all.  They don't know you, you'll never see them again and your gluttony will not be remembered.  Totally worth it.",1,1,1,,
376,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"My son found this place on Yelp during our trip to London. I went to appease him, thankfully. The food, service and atmosphere were spot on. We just came back to London and will be going tonight.",1,1,1,,
377,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"OMG to die for. Really worth the hype!! Whatever you order will probably be solid. Just remember that naan/roti/rice have to be ordered separately as sides. Our meal here was probably the best meal out of our entire trip. They stop taking orders for breakfast at 11:45. Then they take a 15 minute break. You can start ordering off the lunch menu at noon. We got there at 11:30am, ordered house chai and a bacon naan off their breakfast menu as ""appetizer"" then ordered off their lunch menu later at noon for our main courses. There is a 12.5% gratuity that is automatically added to your bill. They make it clear that this is optional and you can ask them to remove it. However, we felt absolutely no need to. The service was great and the food was so good that we would have tipped much more!!",1,1,1,,
378,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I've heard so much about Dishoom. They've been on my list for a while. We decided to go our last night in London. The wait was about an hour, which they were pretty accurate about. We decided to stick it out and I'm glad we did. They offer you some light drink while you wait. The first part is waiting outside. Then you can wait inside the bar, which is nice because you can get drinks while you wait. I didn't get one but my girlfriend enjoyed hers. The staff was very friendly as we waited and they have a difficult job, dealing with hungry people waiting. Some people are unfortunately not very nice to them We actually waited at the outdoor tables once we made it past the line across the street. After a while we were buzzed in for our table. The restaurant has a great look, 70s Bombay. Funky music playing and a friendly staff. We were excited to finally be inside and we were hungry. We ordered a variety of dishes. Enjoyed it all. Especially the fish and chicken tandoori. The naan was excellent. The chicken masala we was very good. Great experience overall. And great food. I think one dish we got, a lamb dish, was a tad oily. But overall we were happy. In addition it was very reasonably priced. One of the last expensive dinner we had in London. Can't wait to go back. Maybe with a large group so we can make a reservation.",1,1,1,,
379,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,One of the best meals I've had in a while. This spot was recommend by a local colleague of mine. I ordered the chicken biryani with the yogurt sauce and cheese naan. Service was prompt and very friendly. Waited about 20 minutes for a table at 6pm on a Thursday. It looks crowded but they seat you quickly. Honestly not a bad thing I could say about this place.,1,1,1,,
380,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"We loved this place! We're of Indian origin and we know a little something of Indian food. Dishoom was awesome! Many of their dishes were authentic, and some of them were a perfect marriage of the East and West. We went in on a Saturday. The wait staff were super helpful and kind. They brought us chairs from inside so that we could sit (we were lugging or young kids). We ordered almost everything vegetarian in their menu. Paneer kebabs, paneer roll, black daal makhani, potato chaat, their seasonal dahi chaat, naans, rumali roti, rice, kulfi, okra fries.... ok, we ordered everything. I have to tell you - you must not miss the okra fries. They're we're unique and delicious. The daal was insane. The paneer roll makes me drool right now. The drinks were made perfect. Overall, I know we're coming back! This is a gem! Thank you all Dishoom folks, you nailed it!",1,1,1,,
381,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"My family and I love Indian food, and we knew that London was known for its Indian food. We needed a place that was convenient for us to walk to from our hotel. I found Dishoom on Yelp, and it was perfect! It's super close to Carnaby St and Regent St and tucked away in a cute cobblestone walkway that was decorated with lots of string lights and filled with people of all ages walking around. Turns out, Dishoom is a VERY popular restaurant, and we were told that the wait for our party of 3 would be about 45 min - 1 hour. So, I recommend trying to make a reservation beforehand. However, we were able to snag some seats at a high table by the bar and order some drinks and hors d'oeuvres while we waited. It was a Friday evening, and the bar and restaurant area were packed with patrons. It was a lively and positive environment! Dishoom definitely seems like the kind of place to come and relax with friends and/or family for a wholesome meal. There's even an ""outdoor"" patio in the back -- it's completely covered with glass window panels so people can sit out there even when it's raining. The patio has lounge seating and a nice garden decor and style, perfect for happy hour or a post-work dinner and drinks with friends.  While we were at the bar, my party and I ordered some virgin cocktails and vegetable samosas. I had the watermelon sharbat, a yummy fizzy drink that was very refreshing. I really liked that Dishoom offered an array of tasty virgin cocktails! The vegetable samosas were perfectly crispy on the outside. I don't know if the time just flew by or what, but it definitely didn't feel like we waited a whole 45 minutes before we were called to be seated! After we were seated, we ordered some more of those delicious vegetable samosas and perused the menu for dishes. The menu has many options and is great for vegetarians! As most Indian restaurants are styled, the food at Dishoom is meant to be shared. We ordered Mahi fish tikka, House Black Dhal, Vegetable Biryani, and the Chole Frankie roll. All the dishes came hot and were packed with spices and flavor. We enjoyed our entire meal! For our first night in London, we had great night at Dishoom and appreciated the warm welcome from the staff! We will for sure return to Dishoom next time we visit London!",1,1,1,,
382,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,What a great meal.  I can't wait to return.   Next time breakfast.   Indian cuisine in a more upscale setting.  Good service.  Nice people.,1,1,1,,
383,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"We went to Dishoom around 7pm on a Monday, and it was super busy, about 20 min wait for a table for 2. On a MONDAY! We passed the time in the bar area. The bar has a comprehensive specialty cocktail list, but I asked for a French 75, which was perfectly refreshing for spring.On to the food! All of the plates are ideally meant for sharing, which is great so you can try a bunch of things. The okra fries were a standout, as well as the saucy ruby chicken. There are different types of freshly baked naan - go for the cheese!With stylish decor and helpful service, it's easy to see why Dishoom is a neighborhood fave.",1,1,1,,
384,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Wow - great food, flavorful & intense, if the portions are somewhat small & thus a bit pricy. The chicken biryani was perfumed & de.icious (though more onions would be welcome) and paired with the raita was delicious. So what spicy Accra's the board, at least for the spice-phone we ate with so plan ahead on mineral water.  We got there early & waited 15 minutes,by 6pm they were quoting 2 hours.",1,1,1,,
385,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,The greatest meal I've ever eaten in my life. Start to finish. 200% reccomend. THE BEST!,1,1,1,,
386,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Loved the food, just always been put off by how loud this place is! Definitely not for a romantic dinner date, great for a rowdy after work curry party!!",1,1,1,,
387,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Amazing! I was determined to have Indian food in London and so glad my friends were able to make a reservation for 6 people at Dishoom. It was great we made the cutoff for reservations because when we arrived at the restaurant at 6pm, the inside was already packed (which was impressive because the restaurant is quite big) and a line was already forming with hungry patrons. We ordered an assortment of foods to share family style including lamb samosas, dishoom calamari, biryani, garlic naan, a bowl of greens, mattar paneer and chicken ruby to name a few. Everything was so delicious. Very well-seasoned, fresh tasting. The samosas were crisp on the outside, hot and filled with potatoes and lamb on the inside. The curries and ruby murray were creamy, perfect with the biryani and naan. The vegetables were a great balance against the more heavier foods.  Everything came quite quickly so our hunger was nicely satisfied. We  ordered a bunch of viceroy's old fashioned which hit the whiskey spot. We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch which was huge and plenty to share between 6 people. This place (which has multiple locations throughout London and I believe to be just as busy) is definitely worth a try! Great interior, good service and delicious food!",1,1,1,,
388,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Maybe the best Indian I've ever had. Excellent chicken tikka masala (called the chicken ruby here), and incredibly naan bread. This place is a staple of our London trips, and one of my top recommendations for anybody going to the city.",1,1,1,,
389,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Come early and don't come hungry because you will have to wait awhile before getting a table and even longer to get served. You can fill in this time by perusing their enormous food and drink menu. That being said, this place has garnered a ton of popularity and loyalty for a reason. The prices for the food are surprisingly low for the kind of quality you get, and the uniqueness of the menu rivals anything else you'll find nearby. This isn't your typical Indian fare, either. Sure, you have your typical garlic naan- amazing, by the way- your roti and curries, samosas, marinated lamb, chicken and seafood, and don't forget several different types of lassis (not just mango); but you'll also find many traditional dishes known only to those who have spent time in places like Bombay and know that culture intimately.From personal experience, I can say that the drinks- especially the cocktails are interesting and amazing- and their Baileys Chai is close to my heart. They serve a rich coffee called 'Monsooned Malabar Coffee,' which I suggest getting as a latte for extra thickness. Trust me, if you know good coffee, you won't ask for sugar.Their chicken and lamb dishes which pair perfectly with their garlic naan or roti, which is a large crepe-like bread you can unroll and tear into as you go along.So, pull up a chair, order a drink, and wait for the deliciousness to ensue. It's worth trying at least once.",1,1,1,,
390,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This was a delicious meal -- Dishoom jumped out at us on Yelp both for the high rating and the number of ratings.  I don't get the sense that Yelp is a particularly popular app with the Brits (lots of businesses with few reviews) but seems like a lot of Yanks are posting their London eats.  Anyway we had the fried okra, the tandoori shrimp and their version of chicken makhani -- chicken ruby.  The okra had a delicious batter and the shrimp was very flavorful.  The butter chicken was less rich and creamy than others but this made it less heavy, which we appreciated, saving room for their chocolate pudding with ice cream which was incredible. It's worth the wait in the bar for a table. On a Monday night we waited an hour.",1,1,1,,
391,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Died and went to heaven. Absolutely amazing food and such a great, lively ambience! The prawns were one of the highlights, as well as the Chicken Berry Biryani (O.M.G.) Being Indian American, I tend to look at most restaurant Indian food as a heavy, oily mush that is high on punchy and fatty flavors but low on the complexity you see in real home-cooked Indian food. This place is truly the antithesis of ""restaurant Indian food"" - each bite is so delicately balanced, with the flavors expertly crafted & deliberately designed. The unique twist with the slight Persian influence is also something that is truly magical and unlike anywhere else I've ever eaten in the world (including India!). Even something as simple as the Raita was just so carefully spiced and flavored - as a condiment, it truly took the main dishes to the next level. Bravo to Dishoom for curating such a lovely culinary experience that stays authentic to India, but transports you to a new realm of tastes at the same time!",1,1,1,,
392,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Such a good restaurant! We have been twice now and we are only in London for a few days. You must try the Gunpowder potatoes. The Chicken Ruby was also excellent. A lot of Indian restaurants in London didn't have mint chutney, but Dishoom does. I really liked that. The drink selection is great and there are several hand crafted cocktails to choose from. Definitely worth the hour or so wait!",1,1,1,,
393,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,First time trying Dishoom and I was not disappointed! Best Indian food in London! Can't wait to come back to the U.K. to have this again. Excellent service and atmosphere to top it off.,1,1,1,,
394,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Love Dishoom! We normally frequented their Shoreditch location but decided to try this one and it did not disappoint. The Shoreditch decor is a bit more fun but food wise you get the same quality. We ordered a few dishes and it was a much heavier lunch than we expected as potions were large! The chicken tikka is a different take here with a heavy ginger flavour which I don't mind but some may dislike. We love the biriyani here.",1,1,1,,
395,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This is the best Indian food I have had outside of India. They have managed to retain the true Indian food taste while putting a modern twist to some of the their dishes. From the Keema Pav to the Daal, everything was great. Definitely try their cocktails as well, which have some interesting combinations.Although it is quite busy and you might have to wait. This place is worth it and a must visit!",1,1,1,,
396,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"On my previous trips, we have waiting for about hour and a half too just to get into this place but the food always has been worth the wait. While waiting to get inside, we got to taste their hot tea which they serve free outside to the lines. On this trip of mine when I wanted to have cup of tea we decided to go to this place just for drinks and desserts. When we arrived here there was no queue outside around noontime. Entrance has a Ganesha statue as their other branches. They have various seating rooms and areas and some lounge seating at the back. I had to wait about 20 min to get a table. This time we tried the chai, rose lassi, mango lassi in our group and for the desserts had their malai kulfi and chocolate pudding with spicy ice cream. Everything was excellent - as per Dishoom standards.Great ambiance and awesome experience. If you have never been here this a must visit Indian food place in London.",1,1,1,,
397,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I love this place!  When I booked a reservation, I was having a hard time deciding between breakfast, which included an Indian take on a classic English breakfast, and lunch, which had a host of other scrumptious offerings.  So I made a reservation 15 minutes before lunch was set to start, which meant we were able to order a couple of nibbles off the breakfast menu, chill for a bit in the truly lovely open-air, relaxing, and warm atmosphere of this almost restaurant lounge, then stay for lunch.  My favorites were the following:  - Masala baked beans:  Much more memorable than normal sweet baked beans from a can that are served up, instead perfectly cooked until tender, but not overly tender, with a lightly spiced, aromatic tomato-based sauce.  - Spicy shrimp:  popping with spiced, tomato flavor, and lightly fried, they're the perfect way to start or accompany lunch. - Dal (black lentils):  Really flavorful, among the best I've ever had, luscious but not too creamy, with still a good texture, and a good balance of smoke and spice.  I love that the restaurant is so accommodating to dairy-sensitive folks such as myself, with menus highlighting the items that can be made without dairy, and those that cannot.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere truly special.  I'll definitely be back.  What a treat!",1,1,1,,
398,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"AMAZING Indian food. Dishoom is a trendy, hipster place, but it does not lose out on flavor and quality of each individual dish. The space is much larger than expected, and even has a ""garden"" room under a skylight. The dishes come out when they come out, so service moves quicker. Our server advised 2-3 plates per person and we gladly took that to heart because it was hard narrowing down all the dishes we wanted to try. We loved Dishoom so much that the next day, we stopped by Cinnamon Soho and turned around to head straight back to Dishoom just a block and half away. I was sad to have to fly back to NY the next day, otherwise I certainly would have fit in a third visit before leaving. Here's what we ordered and we loved everything!- Lamb samosa (4.90): Like the description says, they use phyllo dough instead of the Punjabi shortcrust version. I actually prefer the phyllo dough because it's crispier and lighter, making it a perfect appetizer without filling you up with dough. The minced lamb is spiced well with cumin and shines through. Eat it with the mint, tomato, and tamarind chutney!- Pau bhaji (4.50): Mashed vegetables, mostly tomato, beans, and potatoes. Slather it on the hot buttered homemade buns and you have a little veggie Indian slider snack. We had extra leftover so we scooped it up with the naan, which I actually prefer over the buns.- Chicken tikka (7.90): Delicious, flavorful, and a good char. I love chicken tikka and this was by far one of the best ones that I've had. The chicken remained moist and tender, which is usually not the case at most restaurants.- Masala prawns (11.20): If you prefer seafood to chicken and lamb, then this IS definitely the dish for you. It's marinaded in a green chutney thick sauce and grilled to absolute perfection. The shrimps are plump and succulent. I love love loved this dish. I wish this is how my shrimp come out every time I cook it over the barbecue.- Lamb biryani (9.90): Could use more lamb, but the rice is spot on, like seriously spot on. The rice is cooked in stock and spices and it really is just absorbed in the rice. When it comes to biryani, I always order lamb over chicken because the deep, rich flavor of lamb fills the rice more than chicken could ever. - Chicken ruby (8.50): You need a curry dish to go with naan... Dishoom only offers a chicken or paneer one. It's really like the iconic British chicken tikka masala, sweet, tomato-y, creamy, and buttery. About three pieces of chicken and the rest is curry... which isn't bad considering how much food we ordered!- Garlic naan: (2.50): Standard naan, but not say it's a bad thing! - Roomali rotiOverall, the food is to die for. This is by far one of  the best Indian restaurants that I've been to in NY and London. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long for a table during the late lunch hour. First day was only 15 minutes around 2pm on Sunday and the second was 30-45 mins on May Day. Service is hit or miss. The first time, our server was slow and couldn't really take our cues for when we were joking and being sarcastic... the second time, our server was so much more friendly and welcoming. If I'm in London again, I'll definitely make this one of my first visits!",1,1,1,,
399,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"The Carnaby Street area is full of wonderful shops, pubs and restaurants, and this place is no exception.  We were seated in an indoor courtyard type area, which turned out to be better than the sidewalk table we originally wanted.  The waiter went into detail explaining the menu, and was particularly helpful explaining possible allergens, as two of us have food allergies.  All of the food was great.  I had the sheek kebab, with grilled corn on the cob.  The kids had grilled chicken and awesome potatoes, and my wife had butter chicken.  We will be coming back.",1,1,1,,
400,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"We came on a Sunday evening after 6 and there was a wait for 45 mins for seating 2 people. This location I felt was quite huge as compared to the other two. Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. The reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. Coming back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.",1,1,1,,
401,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishoom is probably my favourite restaurant in London.  That says a lot coming from me, but I think after 3 years in London, I'm able to confidently say so.  Why you ask? The food is always outstanding, the cocktails are great, the prices are super reasonable, the ambiance is charming, and the location couldn't get any better. Therefore it wouldn't be fair to give Dishoom anything less than 5 stars.Three things I highly recommend: sali boti, chicken ruby, and calamari.  If you're a meat eater, order all three! (I'm drooling now just thinking about them.)I've been to three different Dishoom locations (Covent Garden and King's Cross), and wherever or whenever you go, you know you'll receive the same delicious food with attentive service. However compared to Covent Garden, I've noticed that this location is surprisingly better in terms of wait times.  As usual though, I would recommend coming a little early to avoid waiting outside in the rain.",1,1,1,,
402,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"About the food - Best Vada Pav and Pav Bhaji I have had outside India. Their chai is delicious too. I also had a paneer roll which wasn't amazing, just ok. They had delicious cocktails on the menu. About the service - I arrived a little before dinner service began so was seated right away. My food arrived pretty quickly too. On my second visit - Saturday evening around 7PM I saw a huge line outside the restaurant and was told there is a one hour wait. They serve complimentary chai to guests waiting outdoors - pretty cool, yeah?! You can tell that the place is usually packed because they have 3 hosts and 5 servers to serve only 1/4th of the restaurant. Interiors - The place Is decorated in a very homely yet chic fashion with old style chairs and tables, stainless steel utensils, pictures of family members on walls and diyas on tables. They have adopted a very interesting style of decorating the bathrooms as well - WC style, for those who know what that means.",1,1,1,,

This was my first time in a long while eating Indian food and it did not disappoint. Chicken Ruby was to die for and so flavorful.

406,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Best. Indian. Food. Ever.So now that that's out of the way, on to the meaty stuff: the review.Visiting London for work left little room for free time because of my super intense jet lag. My boss and her husband were going to dinner and since she's remote, this was a great opportunity for me to spend some non-working hours with her. They say a connected team works best right?Located walking distance of the Oxford Circle tube station, it's just the right location. You walk over and stand in a line outside to put your name in for a table. If it's raining, they have complementary umbrellas; luckily we had one from the hotel (see review for the Landmark Hotel). While you're in line, they will bring you chai or Sherry (so much yes). After our wait ended, we were able to then go inside and wait at the bar. With three of us, we each ordered different drinks. I opted for the Bollybelini first, Jake had an old fashion, and Liz had a twist on the whiskey sour. Yes, my girly drink wasn't exactly strong but o wanted to try something different than my norm. We ordered a second round of drinks and I had the Velvette Fog which consisted of chai ice cream, coffee liqueur, and vodka. So, it was dessert before the meal. For my last round (yes we ordered three before being seated) I had a big girl drink which was equally delicious. Each drink was 7å£-8å£.On to the food: it's family style and sooooo inexpensive. Go for the vegetable samosa - you will not be disappointed. That's what I picked and we agreed on garlic naan. I can't remember anything else because I let them do the selecting but it was ALL delicious. The food costed 50å£ total and we had PLENTY of food. It also came out within 3-4 minutes of ordering which was good because we were starved by the time we sat down. I would absolutely recommend this to others and already have. Enjoy!",1,1,1,,

It is also near some great shopping locales.Open for breakfast with a limited menu.  Lunch as well, but the real reason not to miss this Indian delight is its dinner menu and entertaining bar service!  The menu is massive but a few Not to miss dishes include the Lamb Samosas which are crisp little wedges of lamb and spice goodness served with a squeeze of lime.  The Black Daal with a bit of smoke and spice, a house specialty.  Chicken Berry Britannia with rice has some serious kick to it but is great!

Most Brits I know don't queue for food and when you hear that there's over an hour queue on a Friday night, I am highly anticipating the food.  We spent the first 20 min standing in a line and the hosts came offering rounds of sherry and chai.  Then we made it to a second line which we wait at the bar to be called for a table.  Swell business model as most people ordered drinks and appies there.  We got okra fries and they were fried and seasoned perfectly with salt and a hint of lime.   45 min later our buzzer went off and we were seated.  We ordered the chicken ruby which surprisingly the chicken breast meat was succulent instead of dry.  The corn, omg the CORN.  We just ordered it so there would be some form of veg in our dinner.  It was Super unexpectedly delicious.  The spicy salt on the side is quite hot and spicy.  It will blow your head off if out put you out too much on but it was almost too spicy for me and I was sweating but I just couldn't stop eating!  The roti was also done to perfection.

I came for brunch and I wasn't WOWd by the place, but I did have a good time, therefore I will give it four stars. First, order the chai tea. It is bottomless and the tea has a nice spicy kick to wake you up in the morning. I drank three cups and could have kept going if my stomach wasn't already full. I ordered the bacon egg naan, breakfast lassi, and their akuri dish. The bacon egg naan was good. The naan was light and fluffy and it was interesting eating American breakfast inside a naan. The breakfast lassi had too much banana in it for me. The akuri dish was also a little bland. I also like my food very salty. I wasn't impressed by it, but it was fine to eat. Overall, I don't think it's worth lining for hours for the brunch, but I will have to come back for dinner to round out my review.",1,1,1,,
423,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Came to Dishoom in Kings Cross with colleagues after a long day. Everything we ordered - shared among all of us - was delicious. Many of my colleagues have traveled in India so their standards are high, and Dishoom didn't disappoint. Ambiance is hip and fun. Definitely want to go back.",1,1,1,,
424,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,One of the best places to eat in London. My friends and I had a wonderful time while dining here. Everything on the menu was tasty.,1,1,1,,
425,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"In addition to the beautiful flavors crafted here, the presentation of both the dishes and the classically designed interior made this a lovely brunch experience.  I've been to plenty of Indian inspired restaurants (fusion type places), but this spot takes the cake. In short, the flavors are authentic, the atmosphere is lovely, and the staff was a joy to be around.",1,1,1,,
426,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"WOW. Probably, the best Indian food we've ever had. So tasty, worth to wait in the line for 45 minutes.",1,1,1,,
427,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"We went for breakfast on a Sunday morning. I didn't know that they had a breakfast menu -- it was a very pleasant surprise. Food was spot on. I ordered the omelette with a side of sausage, and everything hit the spot for me. I also had the breakfast lassi, which was quite filling. Everything was very reasonably priced as well -- including service, my meal cost å£13, which was very good for the quality and location of the restaurant. Service was very good. Our waiter was kind and prompt in responding to our requests. Lastly, ambience was lovely. Although I've never been to India, it felt like what a local restaurant might feel like. Also a bit reminiscent of Hawksmoor but with Indian influence. I could have stayed drinking another cup of tea, just to enjoy my surroundings.",1,1,1,,
428,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Food was excellent. I ordered the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and rice. It was so delicious, 10/10, everything was perfectly seasoned. I was hesitant to come here because I try to avoid touristy restaurants and was worried this was another overpriced tourist trap but my meal was truly wonderful. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the menu doesn't have much variety of Indian food. I was expecting to see goat or lamb curries, or more traditional Indian or Nepali foods, but the menu is mostly vegetarian, paneer, or chicken. And they only have 2 curries. I'd say this is more of a modern, trendy version of Indian food. If you're wanting traditional Indian/Nepali foods with more variety, I would say this isn't the right place for you. Still, I recommend going for the chicken ruby",1,1,1,,
429,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Amazing! Probably the best Indian I have ever had and I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in my lifetime. Loved the roti and it was huge. The lamb dishes were my favorite. Will definitely return when Im back in town. If you love Indian food this is a must try!,1,1,1,,
430,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Had an amazing dinner at this location of Dishoom the other night.  So glad we made a reservation and got there at 6 pm, as about an hour later there was an enormous line out the door!  Started with some prawns, lamb kebab and chicken tikka from the grill.  All were delicious, especially the prawns. Cooked perfectly with the right amount of spice.  For the main course we had the black daal, chicken ruby, mixed bowl of greens, naan and rice.  Everything was outstanding.  The service was great as well.  Can see why they have a line out the door each night!",1,1,1,,
431,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Best restaurant I tried in London. Set the bar a bit too high even, since it was the first dinner for us there.

432,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Love the food! We stumbled upon this place by accident but have previously read about its reviews. We couldn't agree more with those reviews! Everything we ordered definitely blew our minds. I have not had the chance to regularly taste Indian cuisine from all over the world, but this place I'd highly recommend! A few locations all over the town but I'd say this is probably the sweetest spot. We had the chance to get table on the pavement so we could bask in the summer weather & benefit from the late sunset. The line got longer by the time we were eating. Would definitely recommend it to people.",1,1,1,,
433,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"The procedure to get in was overly complicated (the hostesses at the door acted as if they were controlling backstage access to a Rihanna concert), but the food was well worth it once we finally were seated.

I will be back to Dishoom a hundred times over.. wow!",1,1,1,,
435,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,I'm the type of person that hates lines. Hate them. It's half the reason I don't go out at night - who wants to wait to get into the club? Not this guy. Well apparently that applies to everything in my life besides Dishoom. I will wait however long we need to and it's always worth it. Make sure you get a little bit of everything but don't forget the raita and the cheese naan to go with your chicken tikka and basmati,1,1,1,,
436,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"When half a dozen unrelated acquaintances/friends suggest a single spot for Indian fare in London - heck, I had to try it out! So make my way I did, walking around the streets of carnaby on a cold,rainy day during my holiday season trip to London in an attempt to discover for myself this much talked about ""Bombay cafe"" inspired diner. Maybe it was the cold outside, maybe it was the warmth and bustling crowds inside, maybe it was the wonderful hearty black daal or the friendly waiting staff that brought it over, or was it those slow moving ceiling fans that remind one of simpler times... whatever it was, I think I felt better about life post Dishoom!Don't expect life changing experiences, but expect to be pleasantly pleased. The menu is interesting  ... traditional favorites come with an interesting twist or too, like a jackfruit biryani but the black daal has no surprises, no twists just rich, feel so goodness ! In the end, I am glad I experienced Dishoom and I join my half a dozen acquaintances in recommending this to others!",1,1,1,,
437,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I make sure to go to Dishoom every time I'm in London. The place is always packed so I would recommend a resso. Great customer service. The Keema Pau is my fave. I've also had the Okra fries, Chicken Tikka, Gunpowder potatoes, and plain naan.. all equally delicious! Edwina's Affair is the perfect choice cocktail for any Gin lovers!",1,1,1,,

440,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"My favorite Indian restaurant in London! I went there twice on my trip because it was AMAZING! I basically ordered all the vegetarian items available on the menu. While we waited for a table, we ordered cocktails  (you can't go wrong with either alcoholic or non - alcoholic beverages) and okra fries which came with 3 dipping sauces. The service and ambiance is wonderful. It is worth the wait! I love Dishoom!! Would go back to London just to have another amazing meal at Dishoom because it is that GOOD!",1,1,1,,
441,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Great mix of street Indian food with genuine flavours. Really buzzy casual atmosphere in the day.. And steps it up in the evening.

I made the right decision to get take away so I could eat this food ALONE! I ordered the mahkani chicken. I literally ate all of it. Every bite. Extroadinary meal, really.",1,1,1,,
443,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"I had a great experience here. A co-worker insisted that I stop by for a meal, and I'm glad I took the advice.It's in a trendy location in Soho with indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived for lunch, just as the crowd poured in. Our waiter gave great recommendations, and our first 2 dishes arrived before we even finished placing our order  (servers electronically submit dishes). Huge selections of food and drinks. It is recommended that each guest order 2-3 small plates and share with the table. Everything we ordered was amazing... the lamb was the highlight as was the prawn plate.My only complaints were that although there is plenty of seating, they really pack the place tightly. You are sitting very close to other guests and you don't have much table room at all. You feel like you are constantly rushing to finish dishes because you need to make room on the table. The service started out fast, but after our first 2 small dishes, we ended up waiting quite a bit for the rest... but I am going to blame this on the incoming lunch crowd.",1,1,1,,
444,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Really nice restaurant but the line was almost an hour long outside.. in winter. On the other hand the staff was really welcoming and nice, every ten minutes or so they kept coming and offering little glasses of either hot chai or sherry - how lovely. We tried both their chai and sherry and they were both really good.Finally made it to Dishoom for a bit more Indian in the UK after failing to endure a 45-minute wait for dinner on a Sunday night. But the breakfast--a rarity, particularly for Indian--was pretty disappointing. I was really hoping to maximize eating ...Good.",1,1,1,,

447,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Great atmosphere, loud and busy but in a good way. Live jazz music which contributed to the volume and the atmosphere.

Then I ask my host for a recommendation and he strongly recommends Dishoom. It was late, dark and cold and in Kings Cross With bridges canals etc and I had trouble finding the place! When I entered I was  pleasantly greeted but advised that the kitchen was closing in 25 minutes - fine. However when I sat down I  discovered it was part of a (gasp) chain! My expectations descended into near-despair - my last meal in London was going to be a bland affair served on a styrofoam plate!Then my charming approachable lovely waitress (I can't recall her name but she was serving upstairs on January 9). She assured me I would not be disappointed and I grasped that tiny fractal of hope with all my being! I kept it simple with lamb samosas, Chana chaat salad and the chicken biryani and all were absolutely excellent. I think it's  worth a trip in business class (not coach) from New York to try the rest. Great vibe, great food, great service -wow!",1,1,1,,
449,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"We have the best chicken ruby ever. It's not super hot, a little bit sweet, but the flavor was so good. You got to try it and you will never regret.",1,1,1,,
450,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Had to come try this place and I was forewarned about the minimum 1hr wait time if I show after 6pm. It is so worth the wait! Even during your wait in line, someone comes by periodically with a choice of chai tea or a shot of sherry. With the nippy weather, either would make a good choice to help you stay warm!Once inside, it was a short wait with the buzzer so we ordered drinks. Bhang Lassi...must order! It's a different take from the usual mango lassi, tho they have that also. For dinner, we went with a variety to share. So among the two of us, we had okra fries (light & crispy with 3 dipping sauces), chicken tikka (not smothered in sauce like we're used to but very tasty & spicy), paneer curry (little heat, very delicious!), and garlic naan (texture was great and garlic wasn't overwhelming). For dessert, we tried their pineapple & black pepper crumble (more crumble than fruit but the warm custard sauce was the cherry on top) and finally, a chocolate chai (great blend of chocolate & chai). The dishes were not huge portions but I've come to learn this could be the norm in London? I was able to do 3 courses as a result which is awesome. Definitely would come back and try other dishes of theirs.",1,1,1,,
451,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Worthy of the 4.5 star rating.  The food was fanastic, particularly the daal, shrimp, and the mango lassi, and the place feels like a real institution.

The menu is cheeky, and provides an interesting history of the restaurant.",1,1,1,,

The wait is usually quick and you can grab some drinks while you wait.  The service is good and good generally comes to the table very quickly.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but particularly the house specialties and the Ruby chicken are highlights to consider.",1,1,1,,
455,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Yelp to the rescue! Standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square, my dad announced, ""I want Indian food."" On comes my Yelp app! A quick search pointed us to Dishoom in Soho. We were fairly pleased with the fins...Pros:- Super affordable! Especially considering its in a fairly popular, trendy neighborhood. - Delicious food. They serve traditional Indian dishes with a modern spin. - Designed to share. No starters/apps. You order all at once and food comes out as its ready. I enjoyed sampling a little bit of everything our table ordered. Cons:- Disorganized at front of house. We requested a table outside. When the hostess tried to seat us inside, we inquired. The time it took her to check and discover there wasn't an outside table available, we lost our inside table. - All staff (front of house and servers) seemed a little harried. Everyone we encountered was a mix of disinterested, rushed and short. All in all, Dishoom was just above average. I've had better but I've also had much worse Indian food in the UK. If they could button up service, it would bump this spot from 3 to 4-stars in my opinion.",-1,1,1,,

My first impression was how much of an eyeful the place was. The size and scale of the dining room is impressive, with multiple floors, high ceilings and retro furniture and enhancements. The menu is a wonderful inspired twist on traditional Indian fare, the drinks included. The food was quite yummy but more impressive then the flavor was just how the chef chose to put dishes together. It was a delightful and interesting dining experience. East India Gimlet - their specialty drink, so delicious I could drink all day!Bombay Colada - lovely twist on pina coladaRomali Roti - fun thin bread to eat, this was nice with the matar paneer or anything with sauceVeg Samosas - pretty traditional and yummyChana Chaat Salad - tasty and fresh and healthyBowl of Greens was very yummyMahi Tikka - Such a delicately prepared fish! I loved this! It was even more tender than ""flaky"" can describe. It pretty much melted in my mouth. Mattar Paneer - Paneer was in something of a red tomato based sauce that slightly reminded me of Italian tomato sauces but was very rich and thick with sweet peas in it. This was delightful. Fa fa - fun to eat, they brought complimentaryI loved eating here. It was a fun and interesting treat and dining experience. The menu was interesting to navigate with all the twists and turns. The food was perfectly prepared and really yummy. Service was great. Atmosphere was trendy and a bit noisy.",1,1,1,,
458,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I love Dishoom's Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations, and this one is right up there with the other two. You inevitably always have to wait about at least an hour, but they do their best to help that hour pass by quickly. We were served a selection of mint tea, lemonade, and chai tea as we waited outside in the queue. They ushered us into a bar area where we can get some drinks before being seated (good tactic, huh?).It's always nice to go with a larger group so you can share a variety of dishes. As a pescetarian, I always get the mattar paneer, which is one of the best curries I've had in London. My husband loved the Chicken Ruby. At this location I tried the Pau Bhaji, which is DELICIOUS. Next time, I'm not going to ask anyone to share this dish with me!If you're around King's Cross and can wait a bit for food, definitely stop by here for some amazing curry!",1,1,1,,
459,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"""have you tried Dishoom?"" ""You haven't tried Dishoom?"" This had been going on far too long - it was time to have an opinion of my own about this Dishoom restaurant I had been hearing so much about. It was a colleagues farewell lunch, and when I called to book a table for 11, I was initially told this was not possible - only when I told the lady at Dishoom that this was for lunch did she say that they can take a booking. This only made me more curious.The restaurant is set on Kingly street, which runs parallel to both regent and Carnaby street. Upon entering the restaurant one is taken aback by just how deep it goes - it is very spacious and almost feels like you have travelled to India 1970. With old school Indian music playing in the background (soundtrack available to purchase from dishoom also) we sat down on our table. The menu came promptly and we were impressed with the diversity of Indian dishes available and the interesting names they had (e.g. gunpowder potatoes, so called due to their sulphuric taste and the special salt used to prepare them i believe). Since we were many, we ordered a bit of everything and decided to share when the food arrived.The food. All our conversations halted when the food arrived, because we were too busy stuffing ourselves. The black daal is wonderful and the naan just the right balance of burnt and oily. The meat in the Biryani was very tender and the paneer of the paneer tikka was soft and moist. Each dish as it arrived drew eyes and our forks, knives and hands. I'll let the pictures do the talking.The service was excellent our (none of them Indian, bht not a problem) waiters were polite and knowledgeable. We ordered Kingfisher beer and mango lassis for drinks, which was great as the day was hot. For desert we ordered the Kulfis (ice cream) which were delightful.I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I have been told each franchise is slightly different, so I'll have to try the other Dishooms - here, the decor is very pretty and elegant, the service good, the food excellent. Decent value for money, I would love to visit again and try tor breakfast menu. 5/5.",1,1,1,,
460,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Wow! Been to India 2 times this place is legit! Best Chai I've had outside of India. Drinks are fantastic food is better. If you like Indian food this USA must go!,1,1,1,,
461,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishoom hands down was my favorite meal in London. When everyone says you can't go to London without getting curry, I can see why; London's Indian food scene is no joke. My boyfriend and I have never eaten at an Indian restaurant before, so we were a little hesitant. With a quick Yelp search, Dishoom came up as the best Indian restaurant in London, so we just had to come here on our last day. Tip - I read how the waits at Covenant Garden are excruciating long; there was no wait and ample seating at this location, so do come here instead! Informed by our waiter that every dish is meant to be shared, so order 2 dishes per person, my boyfriend and I shared the lamb samosas, the carnaby special, and the chicken ruby with 2 orders of garlic naan (we originally order 1 order of garlic naan, but it was so good that we had to have another order. It tastes better piping hot when it's super fresh and so worth the hand burns!). Everything was absolutely delicious! I legit died and couldn't stop saying how good the food was with every bite! The lamb samosas wasn't oily / greasy and felt light; it was also flavorful on its own, but tasted even better with the red pepper sauce provided. The carnaby special is great for those who want to sample lamb / love lamb as the lamb was tender and didn't have that gamey aftertaste that lamb tends to have sometimes. This dish was my boyfriends favorite with the thinner naan that the dish came with. My favorite was the chicken ruby as the curry was slightly spicy, but most importantly, the chicken was SO tender and juicy. You can honestly taste how complex this dish is and how much hard work went into making this curry. Ughhhhhh, I wish I had more as I'm writing this review. And yes, I mopped up the entire bowl with the garlic naan without shame. The menu suggests the thinner naan for this dish, but DON'T DO IT. The thickness of the garlic naan is the way to go. Dishoom, why did I visit you on my last day?! I seriously wish I took more advantage of the Indian scene from the moment I arrived at the airport in London.",1,1,1,,
462,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Had lunch here. Adorable place which charges fair price. I ordered keema pao, which is Iranian starter comes with bread and spreading. The spreading is made of lamb and some veggies. Me and my boyfriend liked it a lot. It's a little too salty for me but my boyfriend feels it's okay. Also the lamb fried dumpling we had for starter. I liked it so much, unfortunately I forgot it's name on the menu.We came in around 1:30pm and had waited for around 30 minutes for a seat there. The place is really popular. I had a Bombay colada with rum while waiting and I didn't like it because the syrup tastes too heavy. For entrÌ©es, my boyfriend had Lamb boti Kebab and it was too dry. I had Awadhi Lamb I liked it so much, the rice is so aromatic, and the lamb is well cooked. They dont serve naan bread complimentary, you need to order them separately.",-1,-1,1,,

This is definitively a good place to wow someone. The food is as good as the place is beautiful. You know that feeling when eating indian that you just ate something really hot and spicy without actually being able to differentiate the tastes (is it chicken? I'm sure that's fish! Funny I thought I order vegetarian). Here is the complete opposite. Tasty dished where you can actually taste all the ingredients. The dished are tapas so it's best to take 2-3 each and share (it's so hard to choose that you will want to share anyway). For 4 people we ordered 8 dished, 2 rices and some naans. That was the perfect quantity for lunch. Why am I saying that because you'll want to keep space in your stomach for desert. The pinapple crumble smelled delicious and the caramel ice cream is just to kill for. Pricewise count å£25-30 per head. A bit expensive but so worth it.

I waved someone over finally as my waitress was busy serving other tables and when he brought the check over I immediately put down my credit card yet he ignored me and walked away. He wasn't even doing anything but going back to chat it up with other colleague. Poor team collaboration means poor service to customers.",-1,-1,-1,,

472,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Awesome ambiance and had a great waiter. The menu was very uniqueThe food was great! Nice and spicy. Some of the best Indian food I've had in a while!",1,1,1,,
473,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Another fantastic breakfast from Dishoom! The newest Dishoom on Carnaby Street has the same authentic (I actually have no idea but it feels it!) feel as the other branches. Some darker areas with moody yellow lighting along with a beautiful glass ceilinged area which is kitted out with sofas and a fire place making it feel like you've walked in to a retro flat. We went as a group of six and booked (did you know they take bookings for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!) a table just before breakfast service finishes at 11.45. Tbh I thought the service was a little slow and they weren't overly attentive but the food came out in a reasonable time so that's the main thing!This time I opted for their house granola, fruit and yoghurt with fire toast, breakfast lassi and chocolate chai (just a small breakfast!). I've had the granola before and absolutely love it! It's full of nuts and sugary oats and the vanilla yoghurt and tasty fresh fruit that accompanies it is always the best quality. The fire toast was an impulse as I really wanted to try the pineapple and peppercorn jam and unfortunately the jam was a little disappointing. The toast itself is nice but would be even better with some bacon or egg (not that I could have fitted that in). Both drinks were very filling so be warned.... But also so worth it. The chocolate chai is such a treat and the lassi is so refreshing with a lovely oaty texture. Again getting the bill took a little while but overall a lovely breakfast out which is a little different to the usual pancakes or eggs benedict. P.s. On the way to the toilets you are able to see the chefs at work :)!",1,1,1,,
474,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Ahhhhh Dishoom! You have been a constant wonder for so long but finally I was able to taste your wonder and spice!Yes, Dishoom is the top rated restaurant in London, yes it's rumoured to be fantastic but it's only when you actually try their fantastic food you realise why! We went for breakfast/brunch and just made it in time (breakfast finishes at 11:45 so don't be late). We were all giddy, even Dan who has been many a time! As I am still on my health kick so I opted for the omelette with a side of masala beans and mushrooms! The food arrived quickly and was presented and served on a large tray - perfect for taking some Yelpy photo shots! And what can I say, the food was fantastic. The omelette was cooked to perfection and probably the best I've ever had. It was spiced beautifully and there wasn't a bit without a hint of something wonderful. The beans were the standout for me though - they have a kick, that's for sure, but they complimented the omelette and it truly was a taste sensation! The mushrooms were good, nothing amazing, just large fresh grilled mushrooms. Still yummy.The service, on point. The decor, a really bright and colourful array of shadows and shapes - exactly what I imagine an uptown restaurant in India to be like. I cannot fault this place and cannot wait to come back for dinner!",1,1,1,,
475,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Such good Indian food!  I didn't have big expectations for this place. Just thought it was a bit trendy and new and that's why it was popular, but boy was I wrong!  He fish (I forget the exact name) was excellent! Cooked very tender and seems to just melt in my mouth.  And forgive me but I forget the names of the dishes but there was a lamb and a chicken dish that we ordered that also were delicious.  I would come back here for sure!  We were also greeted by the manger and after chatting with him we were given free vouchers for breakfast!  It's a shame we were heading back to America else we would have gone for sure.  The vouchers ended up going to some friends instead.One complaint I had was the temperature of the place. Too hot!  I was sweating my bum off and on top of that, eating spicy food!?  Bad combo!",1,1,-1,,
476,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,Great recomendation from a friend of mine. The food was really good. The food is very authentic. Great place for a nice dinner ! Its a ocassion to try a lot of new thing! Lots of appetiser i felt so full but a good full! I will probably come back soon! These just missing some bolliwood dance to bring the roof on firee!!!,1,1,1,,
477,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,One of the top Indian places in London. It's not as traditional as other top Indian restaurants and I really liked the slightly fusion style of the food. Fun atmosphere but somewhat loud.,1,-1,1,,
478,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"went for dinner, booked a month in advance, great cocktail selection, edwinda's affair (if i remember correctly) cocktail is the best",1,1,1,,
479,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"I liked Dishoom. This is a 3.5 rather than a 3 but... I'm not sure I get all the rage this place seems to command. I think, for one, the unreal waiting time is so off putting that the food would have to be at least the best thing to happen to humans since sugar-free chocolate, but alas... it aint! I went with a party of 4 and we waited over an hour, and our food was good but average, and the waiters clearly overworked. Dunno... so many options in London, dont think I'd come back here. It's more of a mythical place than an actual culinary adventure.",-1,-1,-1,,
480,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,This place was a highlight of our honeymoon culinary experiences. So much so that we returned for seconds before returning to the US. Highly recommended. Get the okra.,1,1,1,,
481,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,We had to wait so long but they make it easy as they offer you a chai or brandy while you wait! Portions are small (at least compared to American) but food was very fresh and delicious. Bartenders were especially friendly and the servers were attentive. I liked their cocktail selection!,1,1,1,,

483,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Did not live up to the hype.The amount of praise this place has gotten, and the many attempts I've made to get a table. Finally we were seated for lunch at the Carnaby branch.The restaurant is beautiful, and is large enough to accommodate larger groups. There is a very calming and pleasant ambience. Service is good, although we waited a long time for the food, and the staff feel professional. Ordered extra naan just after receiving our mains, and it didn't arrive until we were nearly finished.Off the extensive menu, we ordered the Mahi Tikka which was delicate and cooked well but nothing spectacular. The Chicken Ruby was a nice curry, with the chicken being moist and tender. But again, nothing that made us very excited.We of course ordered a celebrated menu staple - the Black House Daal - which was rich and spicy. It was great to dip the Naan bread in.The okra fries were very soggy and tasted like they had been sitting around for a while. I do not want to write this place off yet, as I have heard great things about their brunch (which annoyingly ends at noon!). But I am yet to be convinced.",-1,-1,1,,
484,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Amazing!  This was my favorite restaurant in London.  There were 4 of us and we ordered about 9 dishes to share and we loved 8 of them.  The only one that wasn't amazing (in our opinion) was the minced lamb.  We also really enjoyed their cocktails.  The prices were reasonable and the restaurant has a really cool vibe.  I'd highly recommend dining here.  They don't accept reservations so come early if you can.  We arrived at 6 and didn't have to wait.,1,1,1,,
485,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,1,"Over an hour wait. Suffocating inside the restaurant it was very well close to 80 degrees inside. The hostesses were rude. The ambiance was loud. Poorly poorly poorly managed. Half of the tables were empty as we waited for ours. Now the good part. I'm kidding. The food was BEYOND disappointing. Both of our lamb entrees were a disgrace actually I can't even attest to the fact it was lamb. DO NOT waste your time or your money. #itsucked",-1,-1,-1,,
486,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Very Celiac friendly. I was impressed. A seperate menu and the GF dishes all come with an allergy flag in them, so you know they didn't forget. And the food was very very good.",1,1,1,,
487,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,I always love to eat Indian food while visiting London. Dishoom has reasonable prices with lively atmosphere full of families. The dishes are delicious and I love anything vindaloo or curry. I'm totally addicted to their lamb samosas. The portions are good sized and service is excellent. We enjoyed our meal here.,1,1,1,,
488,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"We had an amazing breakfast here.  My husband loved the Kejriwal (eggs on toast) and I loved the egg naan roll.  I also really enjoyed the side of beans, they were super flavorful.  I also highly recommend the chocolate chai.",1,1,1,,
489,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Beautiful place on Regent Street. Worth the wait even in this rainy weather. Quality and ambience is top notch. One of the must experience stops in London,1,1,1,,
490,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Dishroom is a fabulous restaurant - there are some fantastic dishes and we had excellent service. Definitely worth a visit.,1,1,1,,
491,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Some restaurants just have it all. Branding, atmosphere, value and quality of the food- all unite to create an unparalleled dining experience. Sometimes it's because of authenticity, sometimes it's expertise in one style of dish, but then there are some restaurants are constantly pleasurable, no matter what the dish or what time of day. Dishoom exemplifies this perfectly- their take on Indian cuisine is contemporary, hybrid and fun. Purists might sneer, but what comes out of the kitchen is fresh, vibrant and flavoursome. And although their brunch naan rolls are genuinely worth trekking across town for, their standard menu is just as satisfying. The food speaks for itself, but the environs and service at Dishoom truly never disappoint- and this is true across all of their London branches. The newest addition to the Dishoom franchise recently opened in Carnaby, offering a fuel stop that straddles Oxford Street and Soho. I visited with a group and we squeezed in just before the 11:45 brunch cut-off time on a Saturday morning. Staff greeted me immediately with friendly banter and I was taken through the bar to our cozy booth. The restaurant is spread across two levels- the main floor is open, spacious and there's ample seating that spills out into a veranda area. Here, diners sit an airy space, underneath a skylight and encircled by retro fittings. Electric fireplace, mahogany touches and that brown/orange colour combination that was hallmark of the 60s, this level of attention to detail is perhaps Dishoom's most endearing element.The entire restaurant is designed to emulate a Bombay cafÌ© circa 1968 and this is achieved right down to the minutia- it's so seamlessly accomplished that it doesn't feel kitschy. Everything is casual and the continuous din of other tables makes Dishoom a buzzy hotspot- and then you get to the menu. My staple is the egg naan roll and masala beans, which I immediately settled upon given our time constraint. As always, it was perfectly rendered: a warm, pillowy naan bread made to order in the open kitchen downstairs- it came filled with two oozing fried eggs, freshly chopped coriander and an indulgent lashing of soft, creamy cheese. It's paired with a tomato chili jam- which is a worthy of its own praise- balancing savoury with sweetness and singing with a fistful of chewy naan. The masala beans are always stewed to perfection, a tangy and complex side to mop up with gummy fingers after naan has been dunked into the sticky jam. This is the apex of brunch and has never disappointed.Every dish ordered in our group seemed to provoke envy- from the house granola, an aesthetic feat with wholesome oats, chopped nuts and bursting with ripe fruit, a hearty dollop of yogurt and a fat drizzle of golden honey- to the Big Bombay, a smorgasbord of breakfast fare with an Indian twist. One diner was compelled to order a second dish after eyeing up my naan roll, which was cheerfully organised despite the fact that the kitchen had moved on to the standard menu. The food at Dishoom Carnaby won't disappoint those who frequent other Dishoom branches. The service was in line with what I've come to expect and the dÌ©cor, ambiance and experience also lived up to my lofty expectations. Servers are occasionally bouncing between tables and need to be flagged down, but their good humour never wanes.Provided that Dishoom can continue to replicate this winning formula, I'm happy to see more of the franchise around London. After all, they are both killer and naan roll filler- so the faster I can locate a Dishoom in a bleary weekend haze, the better.",1,1,1,,
492,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,The tikka fish is melt in your mouth good and full of flavor. The dal is rich and creamy. Loved the Pimms cocktail.,1,1,1,,
493,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"Tasty Indian food, but not worth the 1+ hour wait. Also the food is extremely over priced for what it is. Portions are small.  My Chicken Ruby was really good and well prepared but I maybe got 4 pieces of chicken with my meal.  It's also ridiculous that they charge you for every piece of naan as well as for rice. Neither of those things are very costly and normally come with an Indian dish.",-1,-1,1,,
494,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Woah. Let me start off with the decor because it's absolutely exquisite. I felt as though I was transported into Mumbai in the 70s, or should I say Bombay...The little ceiling fans, the sepia photos on the wall and the steel tumblers for our water were the type of details that made the whole interior perfect. The menu is unique and they have your standard fare but also more typical bombay snack foods like pav bhaji and chole bhatura which is really exciting. Their romali roti is a must try - light and really a unique treat. The service is wonderful and we had a bit of a wait but the hostess was sweet and even gave us a small glass of chai as we waited. I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes!",1,1,1,,
495,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This place is a hidden gem that you absolutely must go to the next time you're in Oxford Circus. Very hip interior, try to get a table near the veranda in the back. Don't order as much as the waiters tell you unless you're really hungry or with a bunch of football players. The calamari breading was delicious and seasoned well. Our favorite was the Lamb Carnaby Special that had just the right amount of spiciness. The Mutgh Malai (chicken) was tender and mouth watering. Vegetable samosa come in a group of three which was perfect for our group. Overall, an excellent restaurant for lunch or dinner anytime.",1,1,1,,
496,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"One of the most interesting Indian meals I have had, and by interesting I still mean good.  To take advantage of Dishoom, ordered several small plates with a colleague.  Started with three snacks, all good.  Far Far, which were almost like prawn crackers but a different shape, were nice, particularly with chutneys.  Okra fries were great, not overly fried but very tender and perfectly cooked.  And you definitely need to order Pau Bhaji, mashed vegetables you eat on accompanying buns.For the mains, the sali boti, the chef's special lamb dish, is definitely worth ordering.  Great sauce and flavorful lamb.  Black house daal is a great lentil dish.  Paneer tikka was great, grilled chunks of paneer cheese.  And i was pleasantly surprised with Murgh Malai, a chicken dish with big tender pieces of chicken recommended by our server.A great and interesting Indian meal.",1,1,1,,
497,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"So we waited an hour and 15 minutes to get in.  It was well worth it.   Made some friends while waiting in line.  Overall, the food was fabulous and moderately priced.  The lamb special was amazing.  More important was how good the service was.  We had a waiter (Joe) who is Scottish.  Joe was just fantastic as he provided various recommendations that was spot on.  Even more, at the end of the meal, we asked how the chutney was made and he was able to provide us some insights which was great.  I doubt we will ever come close to making it but the fact he went out of his way to help, was very much appreciated.  Definitely coming back when I'm back in London.",1,1,1,,
498,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"As someone who was born and raised in Mumbai, I've always learned to settle for what is mediocre Indian food in the Western world. My experience at Dishoom, was, however, amazing! This is an authentic attempt to replicate the Mumbai cafes, and their bustling environments, with graffiti in Hindi and all, without the ugly water and smog stains. For the Hindi readers, and for English ones, there is plenty of wall entertainment in the form of humor and memorabilia that all will appreciate while you wait, or sip a cocktail. The cocktail menu has done an amazing job of replicating Indian flavors, and even bringing in versions of non-alcoholic Indian street drinks such as Kala-khatta into London, without the associated pathogen borne illnesses typically acquired by Westerners consuming them in India.The menu is creative and does everything from replicate typical Mumbai street food (again without the risk of catching typhoid) to fusion dishes that very cleverly bring out the flavors and tastes of Mumbai.This is a must visit in London for anyone that enjoys Indian food, and anyone who wants to safely immerse themselves into a taste of Mumbai without needed to get all the needed vaccinations and buying a plane ticket! The only downside is that the place is so good, and so utterly popular, that it is at times very hard to get a reservation, and the weekend brunch and evening dinner lines can extend deep into the street. Waiting in them, however, will not yield disappointment!",1,1,1,,
499,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Best place to enjoy Indian food with a bit of twist! Portions are just right too; gives you enough room to try variety of dishes!,1,1,1,,
500,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,2,"Good food, tasty but service is horrible.  I waited 15 minutes to place my order.  After I finished, it took 20 minutes to get my bill and then anther 10 minutes for them to come over to process my card; hire more staff!  I had the bacon naan which was glazed with sugar and very good, albeit a fairly small portion.  The house chai is good too but, again, on the small side and a bit too sweet for my taste.Only make a visit if you're willing to wait 45 minutes at your table.  Personally for me, it's not worth the lull waiting and poor service.  They also add-on a 12.5% service charge...",-1,-1,-1,,

502,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Went to London on a business trip and thank goodness for that or I wouldn't have stepped foot in here. I could never comfortably afford eating here on my own budget (let's just say.. last personal trip here, we ate sainsbury's å£3 meal combos every day). My very-well-traveled coworker said we need to go to Dishoom. ""Best Indian food outside of india."" I said ok!They take reservations only for parties of 6+ for dinner. Too bad, we didn't have that many people. So came here on a Wednesday night around 6PM to see how our luck turned out. Ended up waiting for 45 min for table for 2. They gave us hot chai while we waited!Appetizer: Lamb samosaMain: chicken tikka, lamb briyani, black daal, cheese naanDrink: mango and fennel lassiDessert: chocolate pudding and cinnamon ice cream (normally comes with chili ice cream but the waitress allowed me to swap for cinnamon :))Verdict: Coworker was 1000% right. Best Indian food I've ever eaten hands down. And as a New Yorker self-proclaimed foodie, one of my favorites meals I've ever had in life. That's right, I'll say it! I would spend my own money to eat here again.Everything was amazing. Service was amazing. Atmosphere was very cozy and modern Indian-esque. Yes it's pricey but I think it's a very good option for some splurging! Worth the wait and maybe even meeting up with some strangers to get your table count to 6 for reservations! ;D",1,1,1,,
503,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"If you are visiting London, you must visit Dishoom. Non-tourist-y and a local favorite.The food is authentic and perfectly prepared.

504,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"I love Dishoom. I've been to all four of them now and I still don't have a favourite! But they're great! For breakfast I've had the sausage in naan and the full breakfast. Both were delicious and filling! I also really like the carrot and ginger juice and an added bonus is that the chai is refillable for free! For dinner I think I've had most of the menu - a particular highlight being the Sali Boti and the Murgh masala chicken. The meat in both the dishes were so tender and tasty, literally melted in my mouth when I ate it!The service is always great and the atmosphere and decor are exquisite! Love it!",1,1,1,,

507,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"It was a very simple equation: good service + nice table + great selection of dishes= excellent dinner.We literally ordered almost all the menu as we wanted to try everything.  The choice is large but you will always find something that you will like.Personally, as I already been to dishoom twice before, my ultimate favourite is still the black dal dish but the chicken kebabs are a must. I also have an obsession over the Rose and Cardamom lassi that compliments so well all the spicy food we had.I really appreciated how helpful was the wait staff and that they could accommodate us without reservation. It is also  noticeable that when you order food at Dishoom, you get your food quite quickly which is always a good point.",1,1,1,,

The food is very good in decent portions easy to share. Some are very spicy but you can see that in the menu before you order. The waiter is also very helpful. A place to visit again",1,1,1,,
509,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Unlimited Chai, the best breakfast in London with a Bacon Naan Roll, and awesome decor.What's not to love? Seriously good. I prefer breakfast/brunch here than dinner but chilli squid and some specials are good also.I'm not sure I can think of many places with as much charm, humour and ultimately; identity that I've been too. DIshoom seems to be effortlessly cool whilst being elegant and casual at the same time. I like most of their food, but I love the interiors of their Bombay CafÌ©s even more. There are 'rules' of the house and an authentic jukebox filled with proper indian tunes that can be played (apparantly).",1,1,1,,
510,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"What can I say, this place is worth the hype!! Been here twice on my trips to London, and highly recommend. Most recently, I came for dinner on a Friday night, and Dishoom was packed. However, the restaurant is pretty large, and we had only about a 20 minute wait before we were seated. We grabbed some drinks at the bar, where the bartender recommended some great drinks that had an Indian twist to them - saffron, mint, etc. Definitely try them out - even if they sound questionable, Dishoom really knows what they're doing. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well - they've done a great job recreating the 1960s Bombay cafes. Theres a cute lil story on the menu - read it! and then read the rest of the menu, because there are SO many delicious options, it'll take a while to pick. A unique dish that I haven't seen at other Indian restaurants was the Roomali Roll, which was great for a light dinner. Full of flavor and spices, I almost wanted another one! I love paneer, and this dish had a nice soft roti wrapping the delicious paneer. Overall, just a great restaurant, and as I write this review, I almost wish I could go back to Dishoom for dinner tonight! Definitely go check it out and eat some great Indian food in London!",1,1,1,,

514,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"YUMYUMYUM. Dishoom's been on my radar since it received the honour of being the highest-rated business in the UK on here and I finally managed to convince the bf to come here! He'd been avoiding Indian food after a bad experience he had, but had been slowly getting back round to enjoying it. And he certainly enjoyed it too!We knew we'd probably have to wait for a table as every time we'd passed the restaurant it was busy both inside and outside, but it was totally worth the wait! We got to sit in the bar area with a Kingfisher beer while we waited too, so it didn't even seem like that long at all.The restaurant has a really cool, retro 60s vibe as it was inspired by cafes in Bombay (when it was still known as Bombay) in the 60s. It seems pretty laid back and so, while it could technically be classed as a fine-dining experience, it's definitely not stuffy. The staff were really friendly and knowledgeable when I asked about spice level. Despite the Chicken Ruby sounding seriously awesome, I wimped out and went for the Murgh Malai as it was marked (M) for mild. I have no regrets about this whatsoever though, as the Murgh Malai was amazing. Loads of flavours going on, the chicken was seriously tender and I had to slow myself down eating it cause I was stuffing it in my face! Mr Debs let me try his lamb kebab and it was tasty as well. The basmati rice and roti we shared were a nice accompaniment, the three chutneys we got were tasty as well, although the chilli one was pretty hot! (I tried it as a dare, the spice was punishment for me and Mr Debs' immaturity level and my own idiocy haha.) The mint and coriander chutney was by far my fave!And now for dessert! I ordered the chocolate pudding after being advised by our server that they could swap the chilli ice cream for cinnamon (smart move, Dishoom) and it was lovely. Velvety smooth, indulgently chocolatey and the cinnamon ice cream was fab! I also got to try the bf's strawberry Memsahib's Mess and it was yummy as well - it tasted really fresh and the slight rose flavouring made it a really delicate dish.They're opening in Edinburgh fairly soon and I actually cannot wait!!!",1,1,1,,
515,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This is a very good Indian restaurant. Every dish we had was excellent. The service was good, and the food came pretty quickly. Most places have good food and okay dessert but Dishoom's dessert was just as amazing as their food. I would definitely recommend the chicken ruby, the masala prawns, and the vegetable samosas. Even my kids who don't particularly like vegetables ate the samosas. If you want to kick the pepper up a bit get the chili on the side. Their naans are also a  delicious side to get with your meal.",1,1,1,,

Upon queuing outside, I drank 3 complimentary chais - happy me! then we waited inside at the bar for some time. The place was very busy and is large. More dinners can be seated in the conservatory.We were shown to our table for 3 and we promptly ordered some starters; prawns, calamari, lamb chops and chicken tikka. The chicken tikka was served luke warm and we informed our waitress whom offered to rectify the situation. We understand that during the soft launch week, there are going to be hiccups, which is why they offer 50% off the food. We also were served the chicken ruby wam and informed the waitress. From then on, the manager wanted to ensure we personally received piping hot food and replaced the chicken ruby for us.We enjoyed some new dishes only available on the Carnaby menu, such at the Chole Bhatura and the Sali Boti. I really enjoyed the Sali Boti as I liked the crunch of the sali crisp-chips with the tender lamb in gravy.We left in a food comma and were unable to find room for dessert. During the soft launch, the take away option is not available (for the obvious reason) The Manager did not charge us for some of the items due to the food not being served hot. This is why I love Dishoom - they always put the customer first and take pride in customer service.",1,-1,1,,
517,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Really good Indian food! Food is worthy of 5 stars for sure however I'm taking one off for the rather slow service and these fact you have to queue up outside, rather than them just taking your number so you can go for a drink and return when table is ready.It's a bit different to your normal London Indians so you won't see the usual jalfrezis and tikka masalas on the menu but everything we tried was so good! My favourite dish was the chicken ruby, one of the best curries I've had and went really well with the garlic naan. Would highly recommend this place!",1,1,1,,

Everything we ordered was well flavored, not too greasy, and delicious: lamb samosas, chicken tikka, some lamb special, basmati rice, and chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. We loved their orange chili sauce! I can't wait to visit London again, and I can't wait to come back to this restaurant!",1,1,1,,
521,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Dishroom Carnaby in Kingly Street delivers great, bold flavours in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, just as you would expect if you have ever been to one of their other branches before.I know Dishroom for quite some time already, yet I had only managed to go there once since moving to London five years ago. Finally, when walking around Kingly Street in Soho before Christmas, I decided to have a quick dinner at the latest Dishroom restaurant.The place is huge, much bigger than it looks from the outside. The interior is cleverly designed with different rooms with distinct colours and features. Overall, Dishroom Carnaby is a modern, colourful restaurant hat blends a classy style of tables, chairs and couches with modern elements and bit of fun. I was sitting in the room where mirrors mimic windows. I really liked the tone of the light, and the window-mirrors added something oddly comforting  and weird to the atmosphere. I was warmly welcomed, and then after a very short wait, a lovely girl quickly showed me my table. Staff are really friendly, one waiter in particular was very professional and funny. However, at times there was a bit of a wait until I got the attention of the staff around me. What surprised my was how quickly my food arrived. After a brief conversation with my waiter, I ordered a lamb samosa. It was a palatable parcel that I enhanced slightly in flavour with the various chutneys. Without a question, following my waiter's recommendation was a great start to my dinner.As main, I went for the Carnaby special, Sali Boti. While I am not always the biggest fan of lamb, this dish was a triumph. The meat was tasty and tender, the sauce was a beautifully rich gravy and there were also different textures that made the plate more interesting to eat. The pancake-thin buttered roomali roti bread on the side was perfect to finish off the sauce. I decided to add a rose and cardamom lassi and also a tap water. The lassi was surprisingly nice and great to balance the slightly spicy food.This was a brilliant and delicious dinner, and I did not have to think much about what I wanted, as all the plates and drinks were recommended by the funny and knowledgeable waiter. For dessert, I treated myself go the Dishroom Chocolate Pudding. I must admit, I thought it was an absurdly spicy warm chocolate, but it was also absolutely delicious. The strong chocolate taste in combination with the spicyness confused me a little bit, but I did indulge in it and the ice cream also complemented the chocolate well.To sum it up, my dinner was quick and very tasty. I enjoyed every minute at Dishroom Carnaby, the only detail that did begin to annoy me more and more was the background music...",1,1,1,,
522,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Went for brunch during a recent trip to London as I have heard so many great things about Dishoom. First of all, the dÌ©cor is like stepping in to a fairy tale. The bottomless chai is the only way to go in the morning (stronger than most I have had but so good!) and although the portions are small, they are very filling. I am looking forward to going back for dinner on my next trip!",1,1,1,,
523,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"This is the 4th Dishoom to have recently opened near Carnaby street.  Dined here during the soft launch with somebody who had never been to any of the Dishoom branches and was keen to finally try the much hyped place.  We did not need to queue as we arrived around 9pm after peak time.  The service was incredibly slow we initially ordered some starters at the bar, 50 minutes later we were still waiting for the food to be served at our table, clearly this is unacceptable even during a soft opening so management deducted the cost of the starters from the bill.The food when it finally arrived was disappointing, the fish tikka was cold, the calamari and prawn starters lacked flavour.  The falooda dessert was served sprinkled with pistachios despite our request for nuts to be left out due to a nut allergy.  My dining companion was unimpressed with our meal at Dishoom, when asked would they return to any branch of Dishoom the response was a definitely not!The only thing worth returning to Dishoom for is the breakfast bacon and egg naan with chilli jam and the drinks selection at the bigger branch in Kings Cross.

525,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I could wax poetic about this place. It has the old Bombay charm and the food has been consistently good. I've been here on most of my visits to London. The gunpowder potatoes, okra crisps, pav vada, paneer-mango salad, choke bhature are all to DIE for. For the meat eaters, the beri chicken biryani, lamb chops and lamb boti kababs are highly recommended. But their dessert is the best of everything. Start with the rose flavored Memsahibs mess, a delightful rendition of the Eton mess. Also the pineapple-pepper crumble just melts in your mouth. We also had a bowl of the Kashmiri chilli ice cream and it was the perfect end to the meal. This place makes me immensely happy.",1,1,1,,
526,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Oh so so good! My teacher's assistant during my study abroad trip to London told me that my London trip would not be complete without coming to this restaurant. Completely agree with her! Amazing food! Be wary of what you are ordering because some do have 'a kick' but it's such a great place.,1,1,1,,
527,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Dishoom offers wonderful modern Indian with a twist.  The decor in the front was not as nice as the King's Cross branch; we should have checked the back room.  The service was very quick and attentive, and the food was flavourful and tasty.Vegetable Samosas were crispy and spicy, Bhel had a good mixture of different textures and flavours, Dihsoom Calamari was tender, but Prawn Koliwada was nothing special.  Chicken & Pomegranate Salad was very fresh, full of flavour, and definitely my favourite.  Sali Boti was exquisite and came with two pieces of wonderful Roomali Roti.  The tender chunks of lamb were slow-cooked with lots of spices and herbs, and the gravy was aromatic and buttery.  House Black Daal was again creamy (dairy) and flavourful.  Chole Bhatura was pleasant, but we didn't like the fried bread at all.  Awadhi Lamb was perfumed with cardamom, was buttery/milky and contained tender chunks of lamb.The prices were very reasonable and the service was friendly and efficient.  The best place to enjoy a romantic Indian in town.",1,1,1,,

532,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"I came here without a reservation on a Sunday evening. I don't recommend walking in. The wait was not unbearably long, but the bar and restaurant were very crowded. Had their take on an Old Fashioned while I waited, and it was killer - partially due to the bay leaf/green tea reduction they mix in. Once seated, service was excellent and shockingly fast considering how busy they were. After ordering, I couldn't have waited more than 12-15 minutes for my food. I ordered the chicken tikka, which was very different than the traditional chicken tikka masala (and the menu was clear on this point). It was a dry seasoning rather than a sauce, a bit spicier. Still very good, though I thought the portions were a bit light for the price. I didn't fall in love with this place, but I enjoyed my food.",1,1,1,,
533,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I love this place. I was in the London/Luton area for 7 days and I found myself at Dishoom on 4 occasions.Alessandra. She is just amazing. Not only did she provide me with an endless palette of delicious cocktails, but she was so welcoming. I would be lying if I said I didn't go back to see her. She was so pleasant to converse with and it made traveling alone for business feel a lot more like a vacation.As for the food... you really can't go wrong. I made it here for brunch on a Friday morning, as well as dinner on 3 other occasions. The Murgh Malai and the Lamb Boti Kabab came as recommendations by the service staff. Fantastic. So perfectly seasoned and cooked to the perfect tenderness.I would go back here in a heartbeat.",1,1,1,,
534,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Potentially the best Indian food I've ever had.Fun atmosphere and ambiance, attentive service - just make sure you get there before 6pm to put your name down because otherwise they make you queue outside before you can even put your name in! We put our names in around 5:45pm on a Saturday and were seated in about an hour. We ordered:- Veg samosas - very small, so great to start. All 3 chutneys were excellent.- Vada pau - Didn't need the bun it was served on, but the potato pancake inside was delicoius- 2 orders of Chicken Ruby - it was so good we got a second order after we were already stuffed! - Chicken tikka - flavorful, tender, juicy. Oustanding.- Sheekh kabab - we originally ordered the lamb boti kabab but the meat was so tough and inedible we had to swap it out. They were very gracious about it. The sheekh kabab was a much better option. - Black house daal - Pretty tasty, but honestly I recommend getting 2 orders of chicken ruby and skipping the daal.- Bowl of greens - literally a small bowl of tasty greens with some sauce so you can pretend to be healthy.- Lamb curry that was served with roti - really good, but again, the chicken ruby was the star.Highly recommend!",1,1,1,,

After all, it's one of London's top rated cuisines and had seen Dishoom recommended multiple times.I had the Pau Bhaji, Black House Daal, Roomali Roti, and House Chai. These are all house and signature specials and rightfully so. The Pau is buttered like my mom would and the bhaji makes my mouth water thinking about it. The black house daal is so savory and perfectly paired with the handkerchief thin roti. House Chai was perfect as well as I'm someone that usually scoffs at people who think they've had chai... This place warmed my heart and brought back some great travel and home memories. The only reason for the lack of 5 stars is that I was seated in the underground room and came alone, so the ambiance was lacking for me.",1,1,1,,

538,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Plenty of reviews already but for anyone who is familiar with the Cheesecake Factory in the US, Dishoom for me is like the Indian restaurant equivalent. Delicious food, consistency, good service and heavily themed restaurants with a queue out of the door.I'm not a fan of waiting around when I'm hungry (it makes me grumpy) but we came for an early dinner and were seated straight away. Previously we queued for the Covent Garden branch when it first opened and attempted to go to the Shoreditch branch but decided against after the woman at the desk gave us a withering look and told us it would be a two hour wait.You know it's a heavily tourist visited place when the waiter starts to explain to us what a samosa is. Yes, we know already thanks, as does anyone who lives in the UK.Overall a good reco. You could probably choose anything on the finely tuned menu. Nothing scary or too spicy or weird so it's very safe but very satisfying and the prices are reasonable.The interior is great too with a retro themed vibe and nice casual, bustling feel.",1,1,1,,

Luckily, this restaurant has ample bar space so we were out of the cold & able to grab drinks within 5-10 minutes. Their Bombay colada is really good but super low alcohol. They have a Dishoom IPA in bottles, very hoppy but delicious & worth a try. No draft beers, is this a london thing?For Appetizers: Okra fries- do it if you're a fan but they're just like any other okra fries. Nothing to write home about. Skip the samosas - they're just average. This location's special was the Sali Boti - a lamb curry - it's really flavorful and good. The dhal is really, really excellent. I'm not a huge dhal fan but I wanted to lick the bowl clean. Definitely order it.We also had the Chicken Ruby which is your basic butter chicken - absolutely to die for!Get the roti over the naan - you can get naan anywhere, the roti is super soft & just good. I wish I had got the roti'sNot many great dessert options so we skipped it.Service throughout is great from the host staff whom are friendly, the bartenders whom are lively & the waiters who are hard pressed for time but don't rush you when you are dining. Rule of thumb - indian food is simply just better in England so you can't fail.",1,1,1,,

They're expanding at a fair pace right now, and it's impressive to see the quality is just as high in their newer spots. Came here with some Yelpers for a brunch treat and ordered a fair amount of food between us. Everything was top-notch and I was particularly impressed with the naan and cheesy toast. None of the flavours are overwhelming and the chocolate chai is yummy - though it could be more chocolatey for my taste! Friendly staff, comfy booths and a stellar location.

Don't take advise from the waiters on what they recommend as I did that twice and absolutely hated their choice. Their 'pau bahji' is undoubtably one the best in town. They should just serve that as a main. It's a thick saucey' type of vegetable curry with a hint of lemon which you dip the soft bread into. Their biryani is gorgeous. They can serve up mocktails for all Muslims even though it's not on the menu and considering the foods halal. Priced a bit high but given the location (behind Regent Streets Hamleys), it's not a total surprise.",1,1,1,,
543,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"During a 20 min wait outside the restaurant, we were offered a cup of hot masala chai ( and Sherry). The lady outside the front door was completely rude and lacked the basic ethos of customer empathy.  We understand that the  restaurant has created and maintains a buzz but they need to be aware at the end of the day they need to treat their customers right. The wait is quite stretched, still lesser than the branch at Convent Garden. After entering we were informed since we were  initially advised a 45 min wait and we had waited for only 20 mins we would have to wait for the remaining 25 mins and were given a buzzer and shown the bar. Apart from the above, it was an overall nice experience.We ordered two cocktails the Bombay Manhattan and the Old Viceroy's and a mocktail called the Kala Kattah Sharbat. The drinks were nice and the bartender was extremely friendly and chatty. I must say the cocktails were pricey approximately å£10/drink.After about 25 mins we were escorted to our table. And we ordered Bhel, Prawn koliwada, Channa Batura, Spicy Lamb Chops (which was very greasy and fatty), Paneer Tikka, Awadhi Lamb Biryani (which had a slight sweetness and not a lot of flavour of the spices) and Vada Pav. The food was good. This was the first time I have ever been served biryani without any accomplishments like raita (a yogurt dish with tomatoes and onions) or gravy. Lack of it left the biryani feeling very dry. As we left the restaurant around 9pm the crowd reduced and there was hardly any waiting time. So if you want to eat here and do not want to wait in a long queue either get there before 6pm or after 9pm. I personally prefer their Kings Cross Branch.",-1,-1,1,,

I have to say it is a nice change from the typical 'tacky' decor of many Indian restaurants. The music is really good as well, and you are able to buy the CD! The service is great and the staff friendly, but since you cannot reserve a table, there is usually a huge line in the evenings especially on the weekends so be prepared to wait a while- but they care for you so much that they offer you Indian lemonade while you wait! Definetly recommend the gunpowder potatoes!",1,1,1,,

I like the Covent Garden location more because it truly evokes the Irani restaurant feel. Back in the day, post colonial India and especially in Bombay, Iranian immigrants to India would setup and run these cafes with amazing food and atmosphere. Dishoom Covent Garden is throw-back to this. The Carnaby St. one is a more chic. I think the food is quite good and a moddish take on Indian staples not found in most Indian restaurants, and is reasonably priced. Would highly recommend this.Get the bun-maska with masala chai.

They have a shelf in the center of one room with old photos and books, giving it a real homey feel. We had the paneer, rice, okra chips, calamari cheese nan and prawns.

Lamb curry was pretty average. Chicken was tender and better than expected. The naan was however, quite disappointing. It was overcooked which made it crispy. The more disappointing part is that all of the naan and the roti that came with the lamb curry was all lukewarm and not hot. Feels like they have been out for 15 min or so. All in all food was ok, price was reasonable, attentive server and food came on quickly too, but definitely would not queue two hours for it like many have.

Since the line waiting outside was significantly shorter we decided to put our names down. We were able to get inside and just chill at the bar there.

Otherwise the manager (?) made his rounds and asked us how we were doing which is always nice. Overall: 4.8 - Highly recommended. Very cool part of London - heard the breakfast was amazing as well.",1,1,1,,
560,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,Best Chicken Tikka Masala (they call it chicken ruby)  I've had in my life.  Service was super slow and a bit inattentive but food is outstanding.,1,1,1,,
561,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Absolutely amazing!  1 hour and 15 minute wait, outside...which they clearly warned us.  They served Chai Tea while waiting.  Service was great, and this Food was absolutely delicious!  My favorite the Chicken Ruby.  The best Indian food I have ever tasted, in a cool setting with great people!!",1,1,1,,
562,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Was told that we HAD to go here for a meal ... WOW   talk about glad I as dragged along the decor is fab   the food is even better .. our table of 4 most likely ate a weeks worth of calories at one sitting from so many dishes we lost track of who ordered what lolplease do yourself a favor  ,. eat here and bring an appetite you can thank me later",1,1,1,,
563,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"OMG this place is awesome. Greatest service I have had in a long time. Amazing specialty drinks Chai Mojito, 1948 Sour and others,  gotta try them. Menu should be sampled like tapas; get something from each section. We followed the advice of our waiter and loved it all.Great prices to for everything",1,1,1,,
564,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,2,"Considering the wait, I expected a much better dining experience. I love mango lassi and the one I ordered tasted like something out of a can. The black lentil daal the specialty of the house was very bland and uninteresting. We also the Jack fruit biryani which I did not like. The vegetable samosas tasted like something from the frozen microwave section at the grocery store. They were not crispy at all and tasted reheated. The garlic naan was fine but very small portions. Given the reputation from other reviews I expected much more, especially given the price.",-1,-1,1,,
565,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Amazing food and service. We waited for around an hour and a half but it was worth it! Chicken ruby, chicken tikka, veg samosas, garlic naan, black daal - highly recommend all of these!",1,1,1,,
566,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Everytime I eat here, I find a new reason to love it.  So now this is edit 4 to this review.  Reasons why I love Dishoom:1.  Black House Daal:  seriously the best lentils you'll EVER feast on.  I can eat a whole portion myself.  I crave these and keep coming back for more!2.  Mattar Paneer:  How can they do this dish so perfect?  I just don't get it!  This is always my go-to dish at an Indian restaurant, and it's always delicious.  But Dishoom really takes it up a notch!  3.  Their cocktails:  They have a really fun cocktail menu, and I've never been disappointed.  The worst is when you get a å£10 cocktail and can't even taste the booze...well at Dishoom, you don't need to worry about that :)  4.  Breakfast:  Yes I said it - Indian breakfast!  Their KEJRIWAL is to die for.  Try it - you won't be sad. 5.  MEMSAHIB'S MESS:  Don't ask questions.  Just order.  But don't plan on sharing it.  Keep it to yourself6.  I've now tried everything on their menu (yes I have), and I have zero complaints.  Make a booking to avoid a long queue!  Their portions are a bit bigger than a ""tapas"" sharing portion, so don't feel like you need 3-4 dishes/person!",1,1,1,,
567,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"I got back from London a week ago and I am still thinking about this restaurant...Dishoom was one of the most delightful dining experiences I have ever had!  The food, service, price, atmosphere...everything about this restaurant is great and I can't wait to go back when I am in London again.Menu:*Pau Bhaji*Lamb Boti Kabab*Chicken Ruby*Black House Daal*Roomali Roti*Biryani*RaitaDrink:*Mango&Fennel LassiWe arrived at Dishoom around 6pm on Sunday evening with no reservation.  The hostesses were able to accommodate us without any problem and sat us at a table for two in the front section of the restaurant.  (On their website, Dishoom states they leave room available for walk-ins so when I was unable to get through to them via phone I felt assured that we could get a table without having a reservation.)Our server was excellent and gave us great recommendations while pointing out Dishoom's signature dishes.  We ordered a bit more than we could handle but I didn't want to miss out on anything.  My favorite combination was the Biryani with the Raita.One of the managers came by our table to make sure we were enjoying everything. I told him we were leaving in the morning and would be sure to visit again for their breakfast.  After we spoke he came by our table again and offered us 2 free vouchers for breakfast!  So lovely!  On top of that...I asked him about the nice smell in the restaurant and was curious what kind of incense they were burning.  He told me he would find out...he arrived at our table with an entire box of incense and gave it to me as a gift!  SO LOVELY!!!  I was genuinely moved by his generosity and for going out of his way to make us feel so welcome. Dishoom's atmosphere is vibrant, cool and comfortable.  The open kitchen downstairs invites guests to view the energy and skills that go in to the food and adds an element of excitement to the dining experience.  The back rooms of Dishoom are stunning.  The fireplace and couches are the focal point of the area and give off a ""cafe"" feeling of ease, comfort and community.I do not know when my next trip to London will be....but I do know that Dishoom will be a part of it.",1,1,1,,
568,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This is the latest restaurant to be opened by the Dishoom chain and it is so nice inside! I'm not sure if it was just me but I felt transported to the 70's. The gold and brown dÌ©cor and the lounge feel they have carefully constructed makes for a really nice cool atmosphere. While there are a lot of tables you never feel closed in or claustrophobic and the music is pretty good there too. We went shortly after it had officially launched, around 6pm on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get a table right away. When we left around 7:30pm the queues were massive so please keep this in mind if you want to go there for dinner. They will allow you to book tables for parties of 6+ but anything less than that then you might be in for a wait. The bar is good and the cocktails they serve are delicious but this is definitely not the place to come if you're in a rush. We definitely ordered too much food but they were lovely enough to pack some of the things we had left into takeaway containers for us. I would especially recommend the chicken ruby curry, the cheese naan and also the biriyani. All of the food we had was delicious, the only thing I wasn't too fussed on was the daal but that might just be my personal taste. Service wise it's a bit of a mixed bag as while everyone is very professional and friendly, they are always really busy so getting your bill, paying the bill etc can sometimes take a little while. If you're not in a rush then this wont be a problem but can get a little annoying if you have places to go afterwards. If I could eat here everyday then I would as price wise it's reasonable and the food is consistently delicious.",1,1,1,,
569,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Great Indian food! I usually go there for lunch and dinner for the curry, naan, and other larger, sharing dishes. Decided to try breakfast this time - got the omelette and naan wrap - and it was good",1,1,1,,
570,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Great place to eat! I took my parents from Japan there and they loved it! I've been here multiple times throughout my uni. The dahl makhni is to die for, and they also have a pretty decent salad. If it's your first time, try the biriyani and get a cocktail!",1,1,1,,
571,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This was far and away the best meal I've had in London.  The atmosphere is absolutely perfect for dinner, the bar menu is creative and wide ranging, the staff is extremely friendly and attentive, the music is spectacular,and finally the food was 100% perfection. My dinner companion and I wanted for nothing, and when we said we had to leave by a certain time, they had our food wrapped and bill paid immediately. I would eat here twice a week and it will be a reason I come back to London.",1,1,1,,
572,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Lovely dining experience.Food is great, atmospheres is friendly, young people will like it even better.Indian cuisine at is finest (at least from a north american point of view)",1,1,1,,
573,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"The food and the service were excellent. We ate with our two children (ages 11 and 15). They enjoyed it as much as we did. The Chicken Ruby, a curry, was delicious. We also enjoyed the spicy lamb chops. For dessert, try the chocolate pudding. They can make it with chili pepper or cinnamon. All I can say about it is yum!Most dishes on the menu are a la carte, so you mix and match to put together the combination you like. Our server was helpful as we were not familiar with the menu items. We would definitely eat there again!",1,1,1,,
574,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"I had found this place due to a recommendation online. It was a very nice atmosphere. However, the food was expensive for no reason. I had ordered the chicken tikka masala. It came out unexpectedly without sauce. In ordered to get rice or bread you had to pay extra. Honestly it was adequate Indian food but in London there is no need to eat Indian food adequately.",-1,-1,1,,
575,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,This is a must go spot. Food is amazing. Unlike anything you have had before. We started with the chili cheese toasts which were phenomenal. Cheesy with a little heat on perfectly toasted bread. We had two lamb dishes each of which were perfectly spiced and prepared. The mango paneer salad was unusual and refreshing. You must go!!!,1,1,1,,
576,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"It's a moment like this that leads to many upon many stories.   I came in here with two local friends, based on a recommendation.   Seeing that there was a long wait, I knew we didn't do wrong.   Our server was spot on with recommendations and everything else we could want.   In fact, he should probably be promoted.  We kept ordering drink after drink after dish after dessert.   Everything we had was splendid!",1,1,1,,
577,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,One of the best Indian places I ever had! The chicken ruby with garlic naans was delicious!! Yum yum,1,1,1,,
578,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This was the last meal we had in London before heading home and I must say it was the best meal as well. The flavors deviate a bit from traditional flavors one might expect but they are done in a really great way.  We had two orders of the Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Chicken Ruby and of course the cheese naan.  Our server was nice and super friendly.There was a bit of a wait, but it's managed quite well.  They try to seat you in the bar area and get you set up with drinks straight away.  We had to wait outside a bit but they brought us out warm chai to drink while waiting which wasn't for very long.We'll be back here next time we're in town.",1,1,1,,
579,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"The food was good, but not exceptional from an Indian palate perspective. Overall the place balances well on service, price and ambience. I think their best dish is Kaali daal. Their biryani, both veggie and Chicken were mediocre. The chicken tikka definitely hit the spot. Unfortunately the beer was not very cold :(",1,-1,1,,
580,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Always a pleasure coming to Dishoom. And breakfast/brunch is always the best.,1,1,1,,
581,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Pretty cool vibe. Tasty food. And great service! Was in town and I randomly went into this place for dinner. Could be great for date night or just having dinner out. Either way, great spot!",1,1,1,,
582,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"This place is amazing, however, due to this it gets pretty busy/crazy.  The service is good but at times it gets nuts so take it in stride as your drink may take a few minutes...well worth the wait!!!",1,1,1,,
583,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Worth the wait, which is passed easily by sitting outside enjoying a cocktail or two! We ordered the fried okra, calamari, shrimp app, and vegetable samosas. We couldn't get over the tastes of all the food. Then we moved on to the chicken ruby, which was full of flavor and delight.  The naan and the roti was a good paring. We also ordered the lamb boti, mixed greens, corn on the cob. We loved the chicken ruby and ordered it  two more times because we eat a lot and we really enjoyed the tastes of ginger, tomatoes, coriander, cilantro, cumin.... you can taste all of that in there so delicious!!!",1,1,1,,
584,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Fun and spicy Indian restaurant and bar. Firecracker shrimp and shrimp masala were amazing, but rest of meal and service was great. Fun lively bar scene too, mid-Soho. Great value",1,1,1,,
585,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"I'd never visited Dishoom before a friend suggested moving our scheduled lunch here, as they had just opened. It was good, indeed we came back the next morning for bacon-and-egg naans, which is something I'd happily do again (perhaps once the light mornings of Spring roll around, London is far too grey far too often in Winter at 8am - and those crisp, bright mornings should be spend wandering around a park instead).The food is 'upmarket' Indian which is great, but without stretching to haute cuisine I find it hard to see how 'good' the dishes can be, particularly when you still can find a layer of oil on the top. That being said, there was a nice selection of mains.However, the breakfast naan is to die for. It is perhaps my top-rated single item breakfast in London, such a good mix of flavours and textures that I'm not sure exactly how to relate it to you. If the menu description of fresh naan ""graced with a little cream cheese, chilli tomato jam and fresh herbs, and wrapped around one of these first-rate fillings"" sounds at all appetising to you, then please do check it out. The chai is milky and sweet (perhaps a touch so for my tastes), and coffee acceptable but not stand-out.Perhaps my main issue is one of expectation, with Dishoom being touted as the best thing since sliced naan, which it unfortunately wasn't. I very much appreciate the decor, the smells wafting up from the kitchen and the smokey incense - perhaps these will draw me back here, or to another Dishoom, in the near future to sample further.",1,1,1,,
586,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Totally worth the hour and a half wait. Dishoom has a great bar selection to start off with, and the sharing-style food plates are perfect for two or an entire family. Definitely some of the best Indian food I've had!",1,1,1,,
587,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Very different from Indian food stateside. I'm not saying it wasn't good. It was. Just different. More trendy I guess. There were only 2 Indian beers on the menu whereas in Los Angeles you usually have a choice of 5 or more. But the food at this Dishoom in Soho was very very good - just not what we're used to. Cheers!,1,-1,1,,
588,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"Indian food is a must do while visiting London.  With so many amazing reviews, I wanted to give it a shot.  We stopped by around 7 and the wait was 1.5 hours!  We had to stay in line outside and couldn't leave to wander around.  It's hard to resist since there are numerous bars nearby.  The staff is really friendly and they even serve complimentary tea while waiting.  Once inside, you're handed a pager and you wait some more.  The bar is busy and drinks are good.  Once seated, the food comes out fast!  The flavors were as expected and all delicious.  The only thing I found odd was the rice was basic steamed basmati rice.  This is different than what I'm typically used to in the US with spices that make Indian restaurant rice so delicious.  Anyways, I'm not familiar with the other Indian places in London as I'm sure there are many good ones.  But, this was really good... but not sure worth the 1.5 hours wait.",1,1,1,,
589,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"My husband and I really liked Dishoom at Carnaby. We had lunch rather than dinner to eschew the lines. We were very thrilled with both the service and foods. The waitress thoughtfully asked if we had food allergy. We ordered house chai, which was refillable until 5pm. What not to love about this?! We had the pau bhaji, mahi and cheese naan. They all are tasty. We sat in the patio area, with cozy decorations. We highly recommend this place to any traveler!",1,1,1,,
590,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,Is it ridiculously expensive Indian street food? yes and sure you could go to Wembley and get the exact same thing for like 1/4 of the price. But does it stop from going? no. It is good food and great cocktails even if you are getting slightly mugged. Plus the funny advertisement in the women loos slightly cracks me up every time.,1,1,1,,
591,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Delicious Indian fusion food in an adorable setting. Definitely try the okra fries and chocolate chai.,1,1,1,,
592,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Arguably my favorite Indian restaurant in the Western Hemisphere :). My baby brother recently started university in London and I helped him settle in. Dhishoom is just what we needed after a long day of shopping and unpacking! Waited an hour for a table, but fear not. Enjoyed a chilled wheat beer followed by a whisky sour made with real egg white by the bar. We were hungry so ordered the okra fries and calamari. Both were delicious and served with a variety of chutneys. Once we finally got a table, we settled for Romali Roti (very rare to find outside of india), seekh kebab, and saali mutton (similar to a mutton curry) Everything was spot on delicious :)! Our server was also friendly and I loved the atmosphere. Overall a memorable experience!",1,1,1,,
593,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Went here twice during recent trip it was so good.  Great atmosphere, better service and phenomenal food. My wife and I ate here for $80 (converted from GBP) and left food on the table. That included two alcoholic drinks too. Great value for western Soho.  I will warn that a lot of the food has some kick to it. Be sure to not necessarily trust the markings on the menu on spice. Talk to the waiter and they'll help. Lastly, order the bowl of greens. Good stuff.",1,1,1,,
594,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Got of the tube at Oxford Circus and did a search on Yelp for nearby Indian Restaurants. This restaurant came up and the reviews where good. Walked over and was told they had a bit of wait but they had a large bar area, where we could order drinks while we waited. The wait was not nearly as long as they quoted. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was fantastic, and the service was impeccable. Will definitely be returning the next time I am in London.",1,1,1,,
595,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Second time here and it's fast becoming a favorite. While there isn't much atmosphere to speak of, the decor is great (seventies chic) and staff are very nice and quick. the food though is the attraction (of course) and every dish is bursting with favour. You'd expect a place like this (and part of a ""chain"" - there are at least 2 or 3 others peppered throughout London) to serve dumbed down version of Indian food. In fact, quite the reverse with some very tasty interpretations or adaptations of Indian staples.. Definitely try the Chole Bhatura or the Sali Boti (the house daal is a must) and for drinks, go for the lassi. Enjoy",1,1,1,,
596,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"From the moment I arrived, the service, environment, and overall experience was absolutely incredible! With a great variety of foods and drinks, I have to say that they definitely know what they're doing here! It is a must-try!",1,1,1,,
597,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,4,"I was not unsure what to expect, I certainly didn't expect to really like the food so much though!  I am not a huge fan of curries, so when people suggest going for an Indian, I'm quick to resist.  However, a friend really wanted to visit and I'm really glad we did.  I got the Murgh Malai and it was delicious!  We also tried Chicken Ruby (it was good, but not right for my taste buds).  The lamb samosas are really yummy (and I don't like lamb!) and the chilli cheese toast is just a bread with some cheese.  The Paneer roll is alright, but there are better dishes to try from.Also tried the chicken biriyani - a bit spicy for my taste buds.  The chocolate dessert with cinnamon ice cream rather than chili ice cream is DIVINE!Service can sometimes lag a bit - but overall a good experience and I would definitely go again!",1,1,1,,
598,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Tried this on a whim. So delicious. The garlic naan was fresh, the texture and baking perfect. They only serve one slice here which is appreciated.

599,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,"Really phenomenal food, service and atmosphere.Came here on a Saturday night at 8pm.  Wait was 1 hour 15 minutes.  We heard so many great things that we decided to wait.  There is a long line that forms down the street which you must wait in.  Then, after some time you are granted admission to the bar and given a pager, after which you receive your table.Atmosphere is amazing.  Met some really fun people in line and the hostesses bring out chai, lemonade, and sherry to keep you going.The food was for the most part spectacular.   At the bar we tried the mango and rose lassis, both were unique and flavorful.  We ordered the vada pau, bhel, and paneer roll appetizer.  The paneer roll and vada pau were fabulous, bhel was just ok.For dinner we had the black daal with white rice and cheese naan.  All were exceptional.  For dessert we tried the chocolate pudding based on our server's recommendation and it really wonderful.So to sum up, totally worth the wait and some of the best Indian food I've had anywhere.  Solid 5 stars.",1,1,1,,

For our main meal, we share the lamb special, black daal, mattar paneer, and marinated chicken thigh. Everything was wonderful. Especially the lamb. Dessert was naughty chocolate chai. We need to recreate that at home, it was so good. If I lived in London, I would be back often. As it is, I might need to stop again before we leave.",1,1,1,,
601,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,5,Everything about this place was wonderful. Our server Marius was great and all of his recommendations were on point. I highly recommend eating here or just coming for drinks. I could not be happier with the meal or service.,1,1,1,,
602,indian,ytEROygdBl4rxFrF5ggACQ,Dishoom,3,"I don't know what the fuss is about... This place is at most average. The naan was oversalted and burned, mahi masala lacked flavor, chicken tikka masala wasn't great (untrimmed fat on the chicken, not grilled all the way through and not flavorful), samosas were thick and too crispy. Chicken biryani was good but I honestly had better. Maybe this is the standard fare in the UK compared to the US but there are so many much better restaurants than this one!

We started with the calamari and spicy prawns, both delicious.  For the main course we got the murgh malai for the kids, Mahi tikka, dishooom tikka and chicken ruby.  All accompanied by a couple orders of naan and rice.  The chicken ruby was our favorite.  All in all a fantastic meal, a bit pricey, but worth the splurge.

I will probably come here at least once every time I visit London.My favourite dishes were the black daal and the chole bhature. Do NOT miss out on these two, they are perfectly spiced, filling, and simmered for hours. Mmmmm.Allergy note - I have severe allergies to nuts, peanuts, and shellfish, so I am very cautious when I travel and don't normally eat Indian. Am I ever glad I decided to go inside and ask! Not only is the menu almost completely free of nuts/peanuts (a few exceptions in deserts and I think one dish, but no oils, cashew milk, etc.) they are also very careful about marking down your allergies. When I came back for brunch, they even had a little toothpick that said ""allergy"" to mark my food :)",1,1,1,,

Our food came out with little flag toothpicks that read ""ALLERGY"" on them. The food was absolutely amazing. We started with veggie samosas and the bhindi fries. I had the black daal, steamed greens, and the Roomali roti. Yep, I ate it all. My boyfriend loved his chicken (he's from India so I feel like his vote may count more than mine).

The samosas were a good size and equally flavorful. Also ordered the mango lassi because it has such a unique flavor! The service: Beyond excellent. My phone ran out of batteries and I needed an outlet to plug it in. Not only did the staff found me an outlet, they guarded the phone, trouble shot issues when it wasn't charging and made sure I got my Uber. The best type of people. We loved this place so much we went to dinner twice in five days. The only tip I would give new visitors is to take an Uber rather then the train.

About 30 min ride from Central London but this is the real deal.  A few blocks from Brick Lane this place is packed with locals, visitors, and local workers and hospital staff.  This place probably seats 250 ppl and was packed 30 minutes immediately after opening on a weekday.Started with a pitcher of mango lassi that was nice and refreshing not too thick or watery.  Lamb chop appetizer might as well been an entree with 4 huge chops.  Had to try the British national dish of chicken Tikka masala which did not disappoint as it was both richly sauced and tender.  But the star of the meal was the stir fried ""dry meat"" which was like an explosion of spices, savory and spicy.  Can't wait to visit again next time.",1,1,1,,

We ordered the garlic naan, meat biriyani, and the lamb saag. The garlic naan with the lamb was good but I was expecting something better.

So, you should probs try them if you're into that. I love this place, and I will continue to come here with friends.

The lamb chops and sheekh kebabs were my fave! The biryani meat to rice ratio was annoying. There was too much meat and not enough rice and the portion was tiny. Then they also brought out biryani sauce with additional meat. That was great but had there been more rice we could have added the sauce, which essentially was like another curry. Rice is so cheap so I'm not sure why they were stingy with it. Mango lassi was delicious, kheema samosa perfect. Chicken karahi was more one a chicken tikka masala but still okay.

Although it's not Indian food, it really hit the spot. I got the dry meat and the famous lamb chops. The dry meat might not sound appealing, but it was better than I expected. The meat was juicy and tender, and the flavor was amazing. I could really see why the lamb chops were famous. They were good even though I got takeaway. The prices were pretty reasonable as there was enough for me to eat two meals. They were extremely busy, and took a while to prepare my order, but that's okay. Great spot for lamb!",1,-1,1,,

We were originally heading to bricklane, but this one caught our eye on yelp, it looked and sounded different from your standard Indian restaurant in east London. We were rushed to our table in the basement, packed in like sardines, everything about this place was built for a fast in and out experience, we were shocked at how busy this place was, we honestly thought we were about to experience something special. The food was pretty standard, lacked spice and major key flavours, the naan was greasy, and again lacked any flavour at all. We also hadn't realised that it was a BYOB restaurant, so getting up to go to a corner store within the first 5mins of the meal was a great thrill.Thankfully the end of the meal came, but not before we had to down the beers we had purchased because they rushed the food from table our so quickly. We then had to queue to pay along with all the other people waiting for a table (not totally sure why). Not a terribly great experience, my advice would be to find a smaller more hospitable traditional atmosphere.",-1,-1,-1,,

636,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"During my short stay in London, I heavily relied on Yelp to hit up all the best spots.  We came here on my last night in London and I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe because it was a Sunday late night and the quality plummeted but I couldn't shake off the bad experience. After reading that it was best to make a reservation, my friend booked the night before.  We arrived approximately 45minutes before our reservation time and the lobby was PACKED.  It was hectic and chaotic.  I know this place gets busy so we already leveled our expectations prior to coming here.  However, there was no clear line in the lobby - we couldn't figure out which queue was for walk-ins or which area was for reservations.  We tried to ask a host multiple times where and how we check in if we already made a reservation.  He pointed us to stand in line with everyone else. I understand this is a busy restaurant but customer service was extremely lacking.  The lines were not efficient. All this waiting gave me time to people-watch...Cleanliness was a huge thumbs-down.  The tables weren't properly wiped down - there were still food crumbs on the tables before the waiters would hide it under the paper place mats. I saw a waiter use the same hand he was cleaning the table to deliver a stack of naans - placing his thumb on top of the naans to hold them down during transfer.  That was gross!! Now the food:  Complimentary salad and appetizers were appreciated.  The food was good but not outstanding. We had a chicken and dried meat dish with rice, roti, and naan to share between two people and it was plenty! Their meat dishes were on the slightly salty side but that's just for me.  My friend thoroughly enjoyed the flavors.  I dream about their garlic naan to this day.  They charge for the bottled water FYI.  Overall, this place was not for me because of the terrible customer service.  Maybe if I had went when it wasn't so busy, the experience would've been different.  But for now, I don't think I'd recommend this spot.",-1,-1,-1,,

There wasn't a great selection for veggies but the food I had was nice enough and reasonably priced. Pretty easy to get to but a little tucked away.

We had ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Karahi, Lamb Chops, and Naan...holy crap was it good!We tried coming back about 10 days later on a Saturday night and the line was out the door, about 30 people deep so we went to Lahore Kebab House instead. The next day we came and got the tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, lamb chops, goat karahi, biryani, and kulfi. I would low key pass on the biryani cause they got some weird raisins in it and it seemed just not traditional in both Pakistani and Indian dishes. The service is really great, throw some Urdu in and they will love you. We need this quality of food in the U.S ASAP!",1,1,1,,
644,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Let me start this review by saying I am no Indian food expert. I grew up in the Midwest bible belt of the United States and our idea of ethnic food was a sweet and sour chinese buffet. When I moved to Chicago, I got my first taste of authentic Indian spices and fell in love. I was shocked to hear when I booked our honeymoon to London that some of the best Indian food was here. I was prepared for that whole fish and chips vibe, not Punjabi.We stayed near the Aldgate station area so this place was conveniently located to our hotel, plus it had some of the best reviews in the entire city. Also, when we arrived it had almost no tourists (aside from us) which is always a huge selling point for me. First piece of advice, grab a reservation. I was lucky and found something but just barely. Even with reservations we still waited for 15 minutes. We had the Karahi and Spinach Paneer with a billion orders of Naan. It's difficult to mess up Naan, but this was some of the best I've had. Also, whatever yogurt dip they brought, please bottle this and ship it to the U.S. so I can eat it on everything. I had my eyes on the dry meat but the portions were huge and we couldn't handle more. The table next to us ordered some kind of meat dish that practically covered their table and I feel like I could have gotten down with that if I hadn't filled my mouth with endless Naan. These were like, body building men three times the size of me though.",1,1,1,,

I'm just disappointed in the service because it took us at least an hour to get our food! After about 30 minutes of waiting, we tried to flag down a couple of waiters to see where our food was at but they would just glance and walk past us. Finally one guy was nice enough to stop (although disgruntled that he had to); we advised him we were still waiting on the lamb and he responded very confused saying ""there are no orders for this table."" WHAT?! By the time we finally got our last dish it was like 10 pm and we've been starving since 8. Also some warning, the restaurant doesn't have a good vent system and everyone's ordering the grilled lamb, so expect to walk out smelling like a BBQ.",-1,-1,-1,,
647,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"What an adventure!Okay, here's the deal. This is the place to hit for amazing kebabs and grilled meat. Interestingly, these are all items you will find in their appetizer section. The actual entrees are your typical Bengladeshi/Pakistani/India fare, but not particularly memorable. Stick to the grilled stuff and you will be very pleased and the naan are fresh. The seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, and lamb chops were all great!So, the food really hits the spot and there's no argument there. The prices are also very reasonable for London. As for the service/seating experience, that's where it hurts. You can make reservations online through their website. However, if you arrive on a weekend night like we did, you will be greeted by an unhappy mob of people overflowing out the entry room of the restaurant into the street. There is one guy from the restaurant running around trying to get people to form into a serpentine line and manage the flow. When you inform him about your reservation, he will simply say, ""Online reservation, no reservation. Only phone reservation."" When you show him your confirmation of the reservation, he basically will tell you a bunch of rude stuff that doesn't make any sense and tell you to get in line with all the people who don't have a reservation. As you may have noted from other reviews, they basically don't honor reservations. I got the idea that there was a mild chance they might honor a phone reservation, though even that was somewhat doubtful. From all appearances, the wait even at off times on a weekend evening could run into the 1-2 hour range. When we arrived, it was definitely around two hours wait. We saw many other people arrive and have the exact same issue. This restaurant basically lures people in with seemingly available reservations and then blindsides them with a huge 2 hour wait on arrival. They had no apologies and seemed to imply that everyone who made a reservation had done something wrong.Part of the popularity is that they don't serve alcohol, but they allow you to bring your own. Given the cost savings, it is a hugely popular destination among the drinking crowd. This is what we gathered while we waited. We had little children in our party, it was already 9:30pm when we arrived, everyone was starving, we had cabbed all the way across from the other side of London only because of this reservation and not wanting to wait at something closer, and this bait and switch with the reservation was not something we were going to let slide. After intermittently hassling the front man for about 45 minutes, he somehow squeezed us into a small table downstairs and allowed us to skip out on what appeared to be at least another 60-90 minute wait otherwise. End note: Grilled food is solid if you can get in there somehow. Just be prepared for 3rd world shenanigans! Again, for a 30 minute wait or if they actually honor your reservation, probably worth it. Otherwise, you may be disappointed.",-1,-1,-1,,

651,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"If I were forced to name only one (a terrifyingly difficult challenge for a food lover like me) favorite food establishment in the whole wide world, it would have to be Tayyabs. It took me a while to believe all the fabulous comments regarding Tayyabs having been loyal for so long to Lahore Kabab House, perhaps a mile away. But finally I did and from the first time I ate here I knew I would want this to be my last meal on earth. I do not exaggerate my friends. I can be quite demanding and merciless in my comments. So please take me seriously.My problem with Tayyabs is that everything on the menu is so good and I have only one stomach and so many dishes to choose from. So I always over order. The beef kababs are to die for. Then the karahi daal (most of the dishes come in karahis) the chana masala, the saag or palak aloo, I could go on to mention everything on the menu. When accompanied by my wife, we also order aloo gobi, chicken boti, karahi lamb and lamb chops and sometimes I order the huge tandoori prawns, (I may be using my own names for some of the dishes) -- all scooped with with delicious naans and washed down with a jug (yes I mean a jug for all that much food) of mango lassi. Go for the kheer but save some room (or more appropriately create some) for the blissful mishti doi at Ambala, nearby on Whitechapel Road.I spend so much of my precious London (another of my favorite cities) time trekking back and forth from the West End to Whitechapel but believe me it is worth it. For me a journey all the way from the US to London to partake in the devine food at Tayyabs is also well worth the cost and the time.---------------------------------------------As an update, my wife and I went to Tayyabs on Christmas Day in 2017 (yes it was open, even though with the public transportation system in London closed that day and we had to find a cab there and back on a day when, understandably few cab drivers were working). The kababs did not taste like on previous visits although the daal, chana and saag were just as good. My wife only ate some of her kadai chicken and complained that it was not as good as in the past. So I am lowering the rating to 4 stars though would still like the daal here as my last meal.I have heard mention (and not having been there yet cannot confirm) that the previous chef from Tayyabs now has his own restaurant, Needos around the corner.",1,1,1,,

The spicy one is SO good. My husband and I have a problem with heat-addiction, so we finished that one. It's pretty hot, actually. Looking around at all the other tables, most had hardly touched the spicy one. The bbq lamb appetizer was incredible. It came out steaming hot and we ate that up in one minute.The lentils and chicken dish I had were also great. My husband ordered a shrimp dish which neither of us could eat.

The naan was freshly made and has the perfect amount of pull to it, the rice was hot and the curry was delicious. The lamb in the curry was as soft as you're going to find and the chicken in the other was moist, although I did enjoy the lamb and potato one more hahaThe service was friendly, we got our food fairly quickly and it's BYOB so the alcohol prices aren't a problemOverall, if you get the chance, visit Tayyabs, you won't be disappointed!!",1,1,1,,

Mango lassi is also pretty decent if you want a non-alcoholic drink. Everything else I tried was just ok... Chicken tikka, masala fish, tandoori chicken, karahi chicken all came out really dry. Karahi lamb is better. The portion's quite big so try not to order too much or bring more friends to share.",-1,-1,1,,

661,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"After the long wait at Dishoom (2hrs), my friend and I decided to stop at Tayyabs the first night we were in London. At first, the waiter/front desk person told us the card machine was broken and would only accept cash. We didn't have cash but didn't want to step out in the freezing cold weather either so we stayed inside yelping other places near by. About 5 mins later the guy comes back to us and tells us we can go ahead and take a table and he'll ""figure out payment after dinner."" It was a weird thing to say but we were starving so we didn't reject the offer. Food was fresh and made to order but it was just OK, bland for my liking and personally had better Indian/Pakistani food. We got Chicken Karahi was 2/5, it was not a normal Karahi, the Garlic naan was 4/5 (best thing we got) and the grilled chicken was 3/5 (was bland and not much flavor although it looked mouth watering). Overall, the place was just ""O-K,"" I wouldn't recommend it or go back but wasn't terrible either. Oh, and if you're wondering about what happened with our payment situation, well, they accepted our card after all (so I guess the either the machine wasn't broken to begin with and they prefer cash or a miracle happened while we were eating and it worked later).",-1,-1,-1,,
662,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,Amazing lamb. Didn't try to many things her didn't have meat. But the menu seems wonderful. Always crowded for a huge places. Solid. Next time I would like to have tried more dishes. Don't forget byob.,1,1,1,,

664,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Well, if you're coming here for a spicy curry you'll be disappointed, since the place focuses on Punjabi food which although aromatic and full of spices, but tends to be on the milder end of things.We've tried the lamb chops + Seekh Kebab starter. Those were simply heavenly. I can't even start to describe how good they were.I also ordered the Karahi Ghosht, which turned out a milder than I expected, but had a fantastic blend of spices and aroma.My experience overall was fantastic, and much better than the sought-after curry houses of Brick Lane.",1,1,1,,
665,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"The line was ridiculously long. Instead of taking names, you have to stand on line. After 45 minutes to an hour of waiting, we were seated. Food was tasty. Lamb chops were full of spice. With all the awards on the walls, I thought this would be mind-blowingly good, but we've had better Indian food from smaller joints. As mentioned in other reviews, downstairs they tell you the credit card machine doesn't work. When we were first sat, the host told us ""all you have to do is come upstairs."" Once the check came, our waiter got very angry when we said we only had credit, and the guy upstairs said it was ok. Finally he allowed us to go upstairs and use their credit card machine which worked perfectly. This really ruined the end of the night.",-1,-1,-1,,

Food was finger licking good, spicy and full of flavors. We got the mixed grill meat platter (highly recommend it if you want to try everything), chicken tiki marsala, lamb curry, garlic naan, Peshwari naan, lamb chops, mango lassi popsicles, etc. Tip: Forget about your expensive cashmere or trench coat at home. Expect to smell like meat when you come out of the restaurant as the grill meat comes in a sizzling hot pan. Its so worth it tho. The waiter told us its cash only but they totally accepted our credit card. Not exactly sure why he told us that.

670,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"I have to start by saying that the restaurant experience is not only the food that is being served, and I understand that this place is no fine dining but the noise level & stress wasn't something I could handle! We had a booking on Friday night & we walked in only to see that not only they have a full house ( the place is huge) but about another 50 ppl waiting in unbearable heat & noise & everyone was running after the guy trying to show him their reservation & get a table & he would tell everyone wait there 5 min! But it actually amazed me how he remembered everyone not having any kind of system!!Anyway we got a table after less than half an hour running after different waiters, all very friendly & attentive by the way even if they have sooo much to do!The meal came in a blink of an eye but it was not very pleasant to eat in that stressful environment & heat & smell from the open kitchen ( everything we had on, stinks now!) The funniest thing of all was the ppl that walked in with so much alcohol in their hands & then we understood that since they are not serving any alcohol everyone buys their own from Tesco just a min away. Prices was incredibly cheap but the food didn't impress me that much!",-1,-1,-1,,
671,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"After a failed attempt the previous night, we finally got seated at 6:30 pm on a Thursday for our 6:00 pm reservation. Just too much hard work! So, was the food worth it? Well, yes and no. Yes, because you have to experience it at least once. The lamb chops kind of live upto the expectations and hype. 2/4 of our pieces weren't that well cooked and were borderline raw and chewy. Having said this, the marinate itself has good flavor. We also got the chicken tikka which goes very well with the grilled onions. Again decently flavorful. For entree, we got the Lamb Kheema and gosht masala. Both were good. Flavorful! Now, it's not worth it, because the food is just so damn greasy, that eat here once a week, and you are guaranteed to get a heart disease. It's just not healthy! Perfect for a post drinking night session!",1,-1,1,,
672,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"Why this place has such good reviews, I'm not sure. I've been to India many times, I've eaten amazing Indian food in London. Rasa, Dishoom, Woodlands, even our local Bangalore express in the city beat Tayyabs hands down. This is fusion food at best. I came here with my partner on a recommendation. We had a reservation but there was a huge line outside, which we took as a good sign. That said, it was quite annoying eating beside a huge line. If people don't reserve in advance, I think it would be reasonable to ask them to wait outside so as not to ruin other diners' experience.Popadoms and dips came to our table quickly, but everything else was quite slow. They were the best part of the meal.We ordered the paneer tikka, naan, rice, chana masala, pumpkin curry and paneer masala. All tasted overwhelmingly of pepper and every dish was extremely oily. The paneer tikka tasted bland, unseasoned and arrived burnt. Our naan was cold and chewy--not fresh. No complex spice combinations, no warmth, just a sharp peppery flavour. I wonder whether this place paid Lonely Planet or another guide book to promote the restaurant, because it certainly isn't even on a parr with the moderately good Indian offerings in the capital.",-1,1,1,,
673,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"For those in the know about the London food scene, it's not all about fish & chips and bangers & mash. Nay, it was actually chicken tikka masala that was declared Britain's national dish. Indian cuisine is oft enjoyed in London town and the Whitehall area is the place to go.After reaching out to a few local foodies and review sites, Tayyabs was highly recommended and we were not disappointed. The BYOB was bopping with the young crowd, dimly lit, bustling, yet somehow intimate. I appreciated that they brought out their branded water gratis. Perhaps they knew we'd need it for the curries to come.ChutneysA troika of chutneys were brought out including a spicy red chile with lasting heat, a white cucumber with slight chili heat on the finish, and a sweet, cooling mango chutney to save the day.PapadumSome papadum and a puffy rice cracker were on offer, featuring crisp, light textures. SaladA salad of yellow and red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, and lemon was also brought out.Vegetable Samosa [0.80 Pounds = $1.31]  We had to try a samosa, which was filled with savory potatoes and chickpeas, housed in a crisp shell.Lamb Chops [6.50 Pounds = $10.64]The lamb chops were definitely a showstopper and well-recommended. It's served smoky to your table thanks to the cast iron grill. In addition to the nicely developed char, the lamb was tender, moist, and delicious. Not at all gamey. The grilled onions added some sweet savoriness to each bite.  Naan [1 Pound = $1.64]In preparation for the curry, we ordered some naan, which was the perfect vessel to sop up all the impending goodness.  Chana Meat Curry [7.25 Pounds = $11.87]The chana meat curry was wonderfully fragrant and had great depth, with coriander and garlic permeating the roast lamb. The chana dal and the whole chickpeas made each bite even heartier and somewhat (only slightly) tempered the heat of this beast of a dish.Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala Special [7.25 Pounds = $11.87]Marinated chicken tikka, karahi masala, coriander, chopped tomato, sliced onions, chili The chicken tikka was moist and contained huge pieces of boneless chicken. The onions and potatoes mixed within were plentiful and the base of tomatoes helped to create a sweeter depth than that of the fiery chana meat curry.And as an attempt to soothe the lingering heat, our meal ended with some creamy milk chocolates.So, if you're ever in London, do pop on over to Whitehall and enjoy a proper curry. Tayyabs has got you covered on all fronts. It's also one of the better bargains you'll find.",1,1,1,,
674,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Excellent Indian food with so much flavor!!!We ordered a variety of their dishes and enjoyed most of them. Started our meal with the Lamb Chops and they were truly magnificent! I never tasted lamb chops with so much Indian flavor, and I just couldn't have enough of them. We also had Samosas and Spicy Popadoms for appetizers and both were pretty good. For entrÌ©e I had the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala. Although it was very good, I'm more used to the chicken tikka masala being cooked with a lot of yogurt sauce, so it wasn't what I expected. It tasted more like a chicken korma to me. We also ordered a side of Keema Nan, but didn't care for it much.We also ordered a jug of their Mango Lassi, and as sweet as it was, we ended up finishing the whole jug.Overall, I liked our meal because it had so much flavor. If I lived in the area, I would definitely go back and try another dish. The dÌ©cor was nice, and the service was ok.",1,1,1,,
675,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,One of my most favourite restaurants in town. Not just for Indian food but in general. Top experience every time. Highly recommended,1,1,1,,
676,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Went for a lunch with my team from work. Had heard a lot about the place so all of us had a lot of expectation.The place is a short walk from Aldgate East station, and you can see the Neon signboards and unmistaken Tayyan's  facade from far even during the day.We got in as the lunch service was started and we were seated immediately. However, it was an horrendous 25mins wait before our orders were taken. We ordered  the classic Sheek and chicken tikka (gave the chops a miss) , paneer tikka for starters. And a Kadai Chicken, Dal Tadka and a veg dish with Garlic Naan for main. The food arrives reasonably quickly after that.The verdict - location was Ok, the decor nice, staff okeyish but isn't it all about the food? To be absolutely honest, I found the food quite ordinary with no dish meeting my heightened expectations. Sheek was nice but as my starter was the Chicken I had to eat that even though the meat was extremely dry/hard. Didn't enjoy it at all. The Paneer Tikka was soft and perfectly cooked. I hoped that he mains might change the experience but it didn't. The Dal was pretty ordinary and the Kadai Chicken was only so-so. The best main dish was the Vegetarian one, a Potato and Carrot curry with fenugreek leaves. The Nan breads met the standard then it is an South Asian restaurant. The desert in form of the classic Ras Malai would have been tastier only if it were served chilled. The bill came to around å£55 quid so it was a value for money but it missed hitting my mark big time.You wouldn't be greatly disappointed here, probably stick to the Lamp chops because many people swear by it but don't go in with a huge expectation else you might be pretty disappointed, just like me.",-1,-1,1,,
677,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"A Punjabi restaurant still running since it opened in 1972.The decor was modern and comfortable with it's leather chairs. Tables were of solid oak filled with a jug of water.Make sure you make a reservation. Even with two floors the place was quickly filled and a long queue formed. Noise levels got a bit high but service didn't let us down. There are so many waiting staff employed in a restaurant but they needed it here to keep things organised and in control.SaladService was quick. As we sat down, a free salad was delivered to us. It was simple. Not much umami from the tomatoes but at least it was all freshly cut.  PoppadomsAnother lady was very cheeky and placed a plate of plain and spicy poppadom in front of us and asked if we wanted it. We assumed it was free as well so took it until we found out in the bill that we were in fact charged 80p for one.Both were thin, crispy and light enough to enjoy before the meal. The spicy one definitely had a nice edge to it but not exactly 'spicy'. It came with three different dips to enjoy them which we didn't really use so can't comment.Vegetable samosaThe pastry itself was a bit more crunchy than I'm used to but it worked really well against the soft juicy filling. More flavours and spices seeping through each bite and becoming more and more apparent in its hear. There was some complex spicy savoury flavours and textures from the range of vegetables in there.Lamb chopsNot the most tender and some quite tough but I think it's all about appreciating the flavours here. It's obvious that these had been marinating for quite a while, releasing a rich in depth spicy kick as you gnaw on them with nice undertones of sweetness from the lamb itself. Great stuff for those who are willing to use their hands and teeth.Seekh kebabAnother item I saw on everyone's plate. These were incredible, packed full of spices and herbs. You can imagine the exploding sensation of all those different spices on your tongue as you slowly chew on it. It was incredibly juicy and tender and grilled perfectlyPeshwari naanDelicious stretchy light buttery bread filled with a delicious mix of minced up nuts, desiccated coconut and sugar. It was a great side dish to counteract the spiciness of the food with its nice mix of sweetness and nuttiness which is accentuated further by the roasted sesame seeds on topKahari chicken. Lovely caramelised onions offsetting a nice sweetness against the rich spicy umami tomato sauce. It felt like it had been simmering for ages from the complex savouries and spices I was getting. The chicken although a bit dry, took on a lot of the flavour in the process and there was enough sauce to aid it with moisture. Didn't waste a single bit of sauce and enjoyed it greatly with rice.Methi Aloo Gajar. Described as fenugreek, potatoes and carrots we were only given one piece of carrot. Nevertheless it was amazing stuff. Delicious chargrilled aromas throughout the whole dish being cooked in the karahi (small wok). The potatoes were incredibly fluffy, taking in the lovely array of spices and the fenugreek flavour which gave it a lovely rounded sweetness with a slight bitterness undertone.Saag meat. Sadly the lamb fails to remain juicy and bouncy inside. It became dry and rough on the tongue but it was still soft and tooth tender. It was more about the simmering process of all the spices, lamb and spinach coming together. The lovely creaminess created as a result of the overly wilted spinach, wrapping round each piece of meat, aiding it in moisture. They achieve something that usually requires cream but this was obviously lighter. Not overly spicy but enough herbs in there to keep your tongue buzzing in its complexityPilau rice This was lovely and cooked al dente. Subtle aromas of spices and not too buttery either.RasgulaA rolled up ball of an Indian soft cottage cheese, almost like a sponge soaking a vast about of sweet syrup inside, releasing it as you bite into it. It was incredibly sweet, texture slightly crumbly.RasmalaiAgain like a sponge but this time saturated with the milk its bathed in. Made of a soft cheese it was incredibly light and crumbly and gave it the ability to soak and release the sweet spice milk once devoured. The milk itself was delicious, beautiful aromas of cardamom, rose water and a sweet nuttiness from the pistachios.Great meal although things could have been better. Firstly they were quite sly in selling us the poppadoms by just placing it on our table. It's also a very loud place to make conservation. To keep things cheap they don't use the highest quality of meats which means some can be tough or dry. However there was nothing that couldn't be chewed through, just requires a bit of bite and patience. The quality of this restaurant lies in the rich marinates and flavours produced. It is all very budget friendly for the portion given. Might be a long wait to be seated but once in service is quick.",1,1,1,,
678,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"This has to be, by far, the best indian I have had in London up to now. It was recently voted within the top 10 restaurants in London and you can totally see why. We were lucky enough to have a table reserved for a large group, if we hadn't we would have been queuing for hours as with the other 100 or so people waiting. The waiters are attentive and very quick with their service, even if slightly rude at times but it is understandable when you're dealing with a bunch of large rowdy groups!Now to the food! We ordered their special - dry meat with sides of saag paneer, dahl and peshwari nan. The meat was lamb and it was truly fantastic. Cooked to be perfectly tender and juicy, it went down a treat and I couldn't get enough. The sides too were delicious, the only downside however was that there wasn't enough paneer in the saag which was a slight let down but in honesty I just cannot fault this place for the taste, quality and authenticity of the indian food. I will most definitely be back to try some more dishes :)",1,1,1,,
679,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Adding my voice to the choir to say that this was one of my most favorite meals ever. After leaving England at the age of 6, one of my most distinct memories was the unparalleled quality of kababs at the Pakistani restaurants there, comparable only perhaps to kababs in Pakistan and BK Jani in Brooklyn. When I came back to London as a 24 year old, I knew I wanted to taste the lamb again -- locally raised, which probably explains the immediate difference in taste.Tayyab's did not disappoint. We went with a large group and I just remember them bringing out one dish after another of sizzling meats, each better than the last and each leaving me wanting more. I especially remember the lamb chops and seekh kababs.When the meat itself is high quality, that taste shines through. Tayyab seasons it's meat expertly, prioritizing authenticity but maintaining an even hand, and the outcome is that the taste of the food pleases virtually every palate. Whenever I make it back across the pond, this is on my must try list of places and it should be on yours too.",1,1,1,,

It's carnage during weekdays!The starters or shall I say the mixed grill starter was the only saving grace as the meat was cooked, tasted great and got us excited for more. Well it got pretty no-frills after that (as advertised) where the meat was chewy and spices were a hit and miss. The pumpkin curry was not bad but still room for improvement. Now what irritates me the most is when they advertise mango lassi as a lassi when actually has no lassi like ingredients and is just a mango milkshake.I remember coming here many years ago and coming out satisfied by experience and taste and that's all gone down the drain. Rant over!",-1,-1,-1,,

The eating had been pretty bad, and we were all excited to be in a fun part of town. Someone did some Googling and found Tayyabs. Our group was made up of one passionate eater (me), one vegan, one person who had never tried Indian food before, and one person who was ok with whatever. Everything we ordered was stellar and delicious. Samosas, lamb curry, all veg dishes, the mango lassi, the naan...the tastes took my weary mind off of the difficult project I was in the midst of and transported me to India. Even the person who had never had Indian food before loved what he ordered. Damn good sign, right?I complimented the owner after we paid, and he said that he wished I would have told him that it was our first night eating at Tayyabs before we'd ordered. A few moments later, I ordered kheer (rice pudding) for the table, and when I went to pay for it, they wouldn't take my money. On the house. What a class act. After posting a photo, all of my Londoner friends, and friends who find themselves in London a lot, proclaimed their love for Tayyabs. So yeah, next time I'm in London, I'll surely be back.",1,1,1,,
683,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"This place never disappoints - the currys are great, would particularly recommend the dry lamb, lamb chops, spinach and paneer curry as well as the pashwari naan. It's byob which is an added bonus!",1,1,1,,

Yet, it magically shows up on a lot of great lists and it was the first place that a local thought of when we asked for Indian food. It was pretty damn good....mind you I'm no expert on Indian food, but I am definitely a big fan. Its menu is impressive. Yet, we opted to stick to the staples and started with their chicken tikka and their famous lamb chops. The chicken tikka was not too dry and offered a nice balance of flavor between the spice of the paprika and the bite of the garlic. The lamb chops were simply put, a signature dish of theirs so don't miss out.The kebabs are pretty balanced and well done, while the curries very good and the daal beautifully done. The pilau rice was refreshing, but the naan was clearly the winner. Get the tandori choice is traditional, but the garlic is pretty awesome as well.Service is a little lacking, but you won't be left in need. Plus, it is BYOB and it is incredibly helpful as you enjoy a great meal with friends. Definitely go with a group since it might not necessarily be a good first date spot.",1,1,1,,
685,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Tayybs is an experience on its own. You maybe just coming for the food (well, definitely you are coming for the food!) but it is the whole vibe in the place that makes you enjoy yourself there.The booking system is somewhat confusing. They do accept both reservations as well as walk-in guests. There is a separate line for the two waiting lists. Yep, even if you have made a reservation there is a good chance you'll still wait 0,5h for the table. So come early!That said, there is an important hint if you are planning to dine there. But probably you already know it. The place doesn't sell alcohol, but it does not mean you cannot drink booze there. Simply arrive prepared with your selection of drinks for the night. You don't need to pay for opening the bottle. And it makes waiting for the table so much better :)And now to the meat. It is delicious. Even if you're not a big fan of far east cuisine (then what are you doing here?!) you'll find the right meal for you. The selection is quite decent. Everything seems to be prepared fresh, in front of your eyes, as the main dining room is right next to an open kitchen.Also for vegetarians there are plenty of good options there. I need meat to survive, so I wasn't paying any particular attention, but it seems you should be fine as well.They can also stuff you for the next few days as you can order any of the meals for takeaway.",1,1,1,,
686,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Tayyabs is delicious but rather intense. I brought my mother and aunt here because they love Indian food and many people recommended Tayyabs as the best in the city. I dutifully made a reservation for 8 PM on a Tuesday night and we showed up to a complete madhouse. There was a huge line (INSIDE the restaurant) of people trying to get tables, including those who made reservations. Waiters were dodging around all the people with plates of sizzling lamb chops and steaming curry and I witnessed multiple near collisions that could have been disastrous. It was incredibly loud, hot, and rowdy- a bit overwhelming for my family who had just flown in from the States that morning. We were finally able to sit in a very noisy room, where we had to yell to hear each other. We ordered the lamb chops, chicken keema, dahl with eggplant, and garlic naan, and we thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes (especially the lamb chops!) and it is nice that they allow you to bring your own alcohol. The food is great and the price is right, but in the future I will consider the decibel requirements of the guests I am bringing here.",1,1,1,,
687,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Without a doubt, I had the best Indian food of my life at Tayyabs.When we got to Tayyabs, about 20 minutes late for our 7:30pm reservation, we saw a large crowd of people spilled onto the street, with complete chaos and pandemonium inside. The maitre d' was surrounded by several people angrily demanding why they hadn't been seated yet. I figured that we'd never be seated, but surprisingly, the maitre d calmly confirmed our reservation and sat us within 3 minutes of our arrival, while being chased around and accosted by other impatient would-be diners.We ordered the tandoori chicken, Karahi king prawns, Karahi mixed vegetables, along with 2 naans and rice. The tandoori chicken was the best I've ever had - juicy, flavorful, and spicy. The Karahi king prawns were amazing, in a deliciously spicy ginger and garlic sauce, perfect for mopping up with the naans. Tayyabs is BYOB, so we came prepared with a bottle of wine. We had a fantastic experience, and would definitely revisit Tayyabs the next time we are in London.",1,1,1,,
688,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,We got here a bit late after our reservation and they almost gave the table away. Very busy. Probably because of being too busy we waited more than an hour for the food. When they served the food we had to wait 15 minutes for the rice. By the time the rice got served the food was cold and not enjoyable at all. I can say the food is VEEY good but as first experience I wasn't that excited,-1,-1,-1,,
689,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Heard a lot of things about this place prior to our trip to London so having dinner here was high on our list. Neighborhood is not as bad as other reviews make it sound. Use the Whitechapel tube stop. About a two min walk from there. We had a reservation at 7 pm and came in with an extra person but we were seated right away. Staff is not unfriendly but to the point. Food comes out very quick. They have daily specials so check them or before you pick the day you visit. Lamb chops are very good but were over hyped in my opinion. Mango lassi was excellentTheir credit card machine was not working on our night so make sure you bring cash.The place is recommended by everyone for Indian food. Was definitely a highlight of our trip. Will likely visit again. But would be a good to temper you expectations before you visit.",1,1,1,,
690,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Good restaurant if you're in the area but not worth a special trip. The lamb chops are amazing, but not a fan of the chicken tikka masala (I recognize that's not the most adventurous dish, but it's a good barometer). Service is good.",-1,-1,1,,
691,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Coming from California, my bar for Indian food is set pretty high. I had heard about the food in White Chapel, and friends recommended Tayyabs. It was less than 5 min from the White Chapel station and was pretty easy to find. You can actually make a reservation online. Definitely do so since there will be a line.Food is substantially cheaper than what I'm used to..- Chicken tikka: 5 large pieces of chicken breast on a sizzling plate for å£3.40- Seekh kabab: ground lamb, good seasoning, very tender, only å£1.10 each - Garlic naan: super buttery. The edges were bubbly and had a good bite - like a Neapolitan  pizza - Kahari mixed vegetables: probably the most disappointing - no distinct flavor and too oily - Lentils and lamb: the lamb was tender and without gaminess, and the lentil sauce was perfect for dipping naan Everything came with 3 house chutneys, raw vegetables (lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers), and house made papadams. Bonus: BYOB!  Bring your own bottle (they have openers) with no corkage fee.For the two of us, the grand total was about å£25 in the end, which is super reasonable since it would have definitely cost in California (plus tax and tip...).  The food itself was solid, but to me, it wasn't significantly more outstanding than elsewhere.  Warning: you will likely smell like sizzling plates / food when you walk out.",1,1,1,,
692,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,Went in for dinner yesterday. I don't eat red meat so got the chicken tikka which was dry and lacked flavor. My husband is vegetarian and got the paneer tikka which was a disaster. The naan was A-okay. The only thing we ordered that was good was the parantha. After waiting in line and hearing so much about this place I was very disappointed. The lamb everyone was ordering looked good I have to admit as an ex red meat eater. If you are going to eat the lamb give it a shot but otherwise no. The positive- it's cheap and byob!,-1,-1,-1,,
693,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Came here at 730pm on a Saturday night and there was a crowd both inside the waiting area and outside on the street. Luckily my friend had made a reservation for three so they seated us immediately. Ordered chicken tandoori, lamb chops, fish masala, lentil and eggplant, aloo keema, and two rices. Portion sizes are generous and food is packed with flavor. The chicken tandoori was a little dry in some spots but otherwise everything else was delicious. The restaurant gets very loud - was hard to hear one another towards the end of the night.",1,1,1,,
694,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Most impressive Pakistani restaurant I've ever been to. With Pakistani restaurants, you're usually sacrificing food quality and authenticity for dining experience and overall restaurant environment and attention to detail.This is the first Pakistani joint I have seen that breaks that trend successfully all while also keeping competitive prices on its menu. For any Pakistanis traveling to London from out of town, definitely stop in if you have time. It's an impressive establishment.",1,1,1,,
695,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Absolutely wonderful, authentic Indian cuisine.Prices are reasonable and portion sizes are well worth the money.Would definitely recommend the dry meat, and the tandoori chicken.Complimentary papadums, and a good selection of sauces at the table.The place was completely full when we went, so I'd definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time.",1,1,1,,
696,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"I was warned that Tayyabs would be quite the experience. I was also warned that all my clothes would smell like Indian/Pakistani food for a good while after.We made reservations, but that didn't seem to matter as people just mobbed the front desk and they served whoever they saw, rather than who was there first. A sure sign of a popular restaurant! Note that this was on a Tuesday night as well!There were four of us, and for starters, we ordered the lamb chops, tandoori chicken, and chicken tikka. Everything was good, but the lamb chops were pretty amazing.For our mains, we ordered methi aloo gajar, karahi dhal gosht (lamb), karahi chicken keema, and the saag meat (spinach + lamb). The plates are a bit small, so plan accordingly. We asked for the karahi chicken keema to be extra spicy (since they said everything was basically mild), but they seemed to have forgotten. It was still good. My favorite was probably the karahi dhal gosht, which had lentils and lamb.In a word, their naan is AMAZING. Huge, fluffy and so tasty. We ordered three different types (regular, keema and garlic). All were amazing, but I liked the keema since it had meat.It's BYOB so stop by a deli somewhere beforehand to pick up some beers or wine.",1,1,1,,
697,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"I'd heard a lot before my visit here. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to the hype.Tayyabs is a cheap indian restaurant in Whitechapel. They have a great BYOB policy, so you can pick up some drinks from the nearby Tesco to go with your meal.There are some nice touches. When ordering the staff member will attempt to remember your order in their head. Given how busy they are, it's not a fool-proof tactic and the attempt to look smart often backfires as they'll often forget something from your order. The guys who are good at it however can indeed remember 16 diner's orders without getting anything wrong.Starters are brought to you table which you might assume are complimentary, but you're charged for the poppadums and dip. That's a big disappointing, but in fairness they do ask you if you'd like it first instead of just plopping it on your table.Order is quick and food brought to you table as soon as it's ready. Given the small table space fitting everything can be like solving a puzzle. The food is average. They're supposedly famous for the lamb shanks, but I wasn't impressed. The meat is tough and often burnt. The currys are small in portion given the prices. The starters are actually more filling. Definitely focus more on the naan breads than the rice, as again the portions are small.There's a lot of potentially like about Tayyabs. However when it comes down to execution. It falls flat. Prices are definitely reasonable, but it strangely still doesn't feel like good value for money after the meal. There are plenty of better places.",-1,-1,-1,,
698,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Aaaaah I so wanted to love this place, after reading all the great reviews, but damnnn I don't know, it just didn't live up to the hype. We arrived and got a table quite easily on a Thursday lunchtime and were quickly brought some salad to nibble on. Following from that, we waited for around 30 mins for someone to take our order and only after asking a few times, did we finally manage to order. I might add, it took a lot of staff members asking each other to take our order, which was a little strange.The food arrived and was fairly ok. The fish dish I got, had plenty of bones, which wasn't great. The saag aloo was amazing, super spicy and a great addition to the meal. My friend got chickpeas which were nice and a great side dish. The chicken tikka for me didn't live up to expectations.All in all, the meal was just average and I felt like the service could definitely be improved next time. However for å£25 for two, it really wasn't a bad price and I'll be giving it another go one evening to see if I fair better.",-1,-1,1,,
699,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,Okay how can a trip to London be complete without visiting the king of the so called curry mile? It's an experience you have to share just for the sheer feeling you get from walking into a massive restaurant with such fine consistency of tastiness of its curries and meats.,1,1,1,,
700,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Well what can you say?  Many people have reviewed this place and love it and I am no different.  The lamb chops are awesome and everything is way above par, despite costing very little.  Of course, the price you pay is a long wait but since you will likely be drinking the beer you brought, why worry?",1,1,1,,
701,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"I had been here about a year ago and remember really enjoying it, but the most recent experience was really disappointing. My chicken tikka masala tasted nothing like it. In fact, my chicken tastes so dry that I stopped eating after one piece. Service was rather bad too. They had one of our orders wrong at first, and for another one of my friends, they didn't even remember her request to leave out the potatoes in her dish. Quite loud as well, given the crowd. Honestly, I'm not sure how this place could attract so many people. Rather disappointing experience overall.",-1,-1,-1,,
702,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Tayyabs is practically an institution to East London's food scene, and is one of the best Pakistani restaurants around.The restaurant spans four floors and can seat hundred, yet there is always a queue (which luckily goes by quite quickly).The dry meat and lamb chops seem to be staple items, but the menu is rather light on chicken, fish, or essentially non-lamb options unless you want to go vegetarian. The veggie options are rather good though...The restaurant is BYOB, and there's a Tesco a few blocks away whose alcohol sales may be formed exclusively on patrons of Tayyabs. The mango lassi is also great, and does well to cut through spicy food!The servers made me feel rather unwelcome, but at least they were efficient.",1,-1,1,,
703,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"4 stars for the food. Just fantastic and so tasty! But the atmosphere and chaos is insanely exhausting. I remember coming here over 7 years ago and it was a lovely, airy place and now it feels too trendy for what it is, and the crowds are huge! I made a reservation and that doesn't even really matter it seems because everyone just queued up anyway.What saves this place is the food, excellent curries, the mango lassi jug was so good, and the desserts are to die for. Loved the rasmalai!Always worth a try, especially if it's your first time.",1,1,1,,
704,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Hands down some of the best food I've ever had. We stopped in because our air b&b host recommended it and we were not disappointed. When we arrived, I was absolutely starving but we hadn't made a reservation so were forced to wait I line. Lucky for me, there is a small to go counter at the front of the restaurant. While my husband held our place in line, I went and bought us samosas which were amazing. The place was packed so it took us a little while to get seated but that was our fault for not calling ahead a reservation. When we did get seated though, our waiter was quick and attentive.We both got the chicken tiki masala and were not disappointed in the slightest. The taste was phenomenal and the presentation was great too. We got some nan and popadom which I also recommend getting. If you're looking for good Indian  food, I highly recommend it!",1,1,1,,
705,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Tayyabs is amazing if you come in with the right expectations. It's a terrific place for the following reasons:- Cheap (average cost per person is under 20)- BYOB - keeps costs low and allows you to have tons of booze with your food- great for groups - Tayyabs is huge and has plenty of room for groups 10+- Good food - Usually when I eat in groups I'm disappointed with the quality of the food. However Tayyabs bucked the trend by having quality, tasty food in large portions.Therefore if you want to have a good time out with a large group of friends, this place is perfect. Please note it's very loud so be prepared to shout across the table. (not the best place for romantic nights out or quiet dinners with the parents!)",1,1,1,,
706,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"My sister recommended this fantastic place that did lamb chops some time ago, and I'd utterly forgotten about it. But then when it came to introducing a former school friend of my wife to his first Indian cuisine experience, having looked around the Brick Lane area we came across Tayyabs - and lo and behold, it was the restaurant my sister had recommended some time ago.Booking online was easy, and we got a decent table in the restaurant. The menu isn't extensive, which personally I take as a good thing because it means the restaurant doesn't just have a fridge full of pre-made sauces that they add to things. Having been on holiday in India, I can usually tell the Indian from the Anglo-Indian and this was much more towards the former than the latter. The restaurant is bring your own, which my friend did and it was no issue - they do sell soft drinks though.So for the food. We ordered a lot, and it was surprisingly cheap. All in all it came to just under å£50 for three of us, and that was with three starters, two mains, two portions of rice, two bread, a vegetable side and soft drinks. Oh, plus poppadoms - but you literally couldn't have fit another plate on our table. The paneer tikka was delightful, I'd made the cheese from scratch before and I can tell that either Tayyabs did, or their supplier makes it very fresh. It was just spot on, and there is no way it was from one of those relatively hard paneer blocks you get from the supermarkets.I didn't try the lamb chops, but for a starter it was a huge portion and my friend said they were good. The samosas were a star - probably the best I've had, and obviously home made rather than the traditional tightly bound triangles you get in most restaurants. The garlic naan breads were covered in a generous volume of butter, and the sauces on the tikka masala and the lamb dish were delicious. This isn't your standard Indian as it is more authentic than the normal Indian restaurants - but not so authentic as to feel like it is utterly alien. I would recommend that you book as it gets very busy (and loud!) but it is well worth it.",1,1,1,,
707,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"This restaurant is good but not great. I ordered the following items: Mutton Grill (3.5/5)Lamb Chops (3/5)Chicken Tiki Marsala (4.5/5)Garlic Nan (3/5)Mango Lassi (4.5/5)The lamb chops are ok, but tough and hard to get off the bone. I ended up having to use my hands which was not great. Mutton was also very tough and overdone. The chicken tiki Marsala was great but came 35 mins after the first dishes. The food seems to come out at a completely random order. People who ordered after me were done before I got my second course. This place is also a very obvious tourist hotspot. In the 1.5 hours I was there, 90% of the people visiting were American tourist. I happened to be sitting right next to the door and being American myself, I noticed the distinctive accents. Overall this place is ok but the staff needs more training and the food needs some work. I would come back but skip the grill and try more curry.",-1,-1,1,,
708,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Some of the best Punjabi food I've ever had the chance to injest. I stopped by for lunch and had no problem getting a table.

709,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Went here last weekend and I was so impressed with the waiter we had I had to write this.  First the food was very good we had two different types of Lamb (both very good) and Chicken Tikka Masala also good, lentils and assorted breads and we picked up some kingfisher at the local convenience store around the corner.  But the highlight was this guy who seated patrons assisted with cleanup and made sure we had everything we needed.  He was great.  So I will return here, and find out his name, and thank him again",1,1,1,,
710,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"To many Tayyabs is the best curry in the East, and it turns out these many are pretty much on point. A lingering Sunday hangover and need for some comforting full stomachs sent us in search of a curry and what a choice we made. First thing to note is this place is known for being busy, and I mean lines out the door for several feet busy! Friday and Saturday night be sure to wait for a while but Sunday evening was perfect, table of 5 was snapped right up for us, joy. Secondly, and even better, is that this curry house of fully BYOB with no charge for corkage. Such a good idea and with a little Tesco 2 minutes walk up the road you can supplement any feast with a cheeky tipple or two. So on to the food. The menu is vast but it's vast with good options, incredible platters and starters with a good array of sides and little delights to grace the table top. Like any good curry things were kicked off with some poppadoms and personally I judge a curry house on the mango chutney. Tayyabs was on point (again), slightly chunky but a good flavour and a decent portion that 5 people could easily tuck into. After some discussion (sometime heated, due to the hangover) we decided to let our server do the hard work and decide for us. The service is fantastic and they really treat you well once in the door, so we had no issue with the waiter bring us his best picks. A few round of poppadoms later and here it was, a feast of epic standards and proportions. The curries and accompanying naan bread were all amazing, the smells took all of us to food heaven and conversation ceased as the next 20 minutes or so were spent eating ourselves into a solid food coma. Some top picks were easily the pork chops. I've heard this place was known for them and I would more than recommend getting them on the table. Huge chunks of tender pork in a beautiful spice mixed. Pork tends to dry in other locations but no sign of this. Other picks were 100& the garlic naan (no explanation needed) and the chick pea side. The BEST chick peas i've had, each one was as soft as the other and they almost melted in the mouth. The sauce was like a Bhoona but a little less spicy, and the after taste almost creamy Korma like. A little tip that we found, the curry and sides are so good that we didn't even touch the rice, just went straight for the hard stuff. Yes, this could be the hangover again but I'd seriously think about letting the dishes doing the talking and drop the rice. Get full on meat not carbs (little life lesson for you there).In all we left happy, well fed and well served. This place is a must and I write this in the cab on the way there. I'll see you in the line. Job Done.",1,1,1,,

There is seating on two levels -- try to get a seat on the main level, not downstairs for the full experience. Be prepared to wait, and sit in tight quarters next to a full table of Indian men, business people, East enders or any of the above. Once your food arrives, none of the seating or crowding will matter anymore...just the smell of the sizzling, smoking dishes is enough to delight and satisfy!  And no, the total on the bill is not a mistake.",1,1,1,,
712,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"This place is amazing. Simple as that.If your looking for an Indian grill then this is the place for you. Arrive early evening to avoid the queues. The wait for a table can be up to an hour and without a bar, or anywhere to rest, this can be tedious. It is worth the wait. Don't be put off if, you will only regretting not eating here.As I have previously mentioned there is no bar here and this in turn means no booze. BUT, this only means one thing. BYOB.Bring some beers and a bottle of red and you're in for a smashing evening of the finest grilled meats East London has to offer.  I'd go for everything and anything grilled. The last time I was here we literally had one of every grilled starter to share amongst three and it was plenty.Great value for money with the bill, for three, coming to å£40. Fabulous place.",1,1,1,,
713,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"I think my view still stands after eating here, lamb chops were good, but not out of this world good. Well marinated, but not as juicy and tender as it could be, in fact close on the dry side. The service definitely needs improving, took ages for the somasa to turn up, and he still got it wrong. As we tried to tell the waiter what exactly we ordered, he walked further and further away. The funny side he still got the order wrong and had to go back. It was very busy again, and the noise level just kept going up and up, It definite a vibrant atmosphere.",-1,-1,-1,,
714,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Attended the restaurant last night. Atmosphere was great but a bloody great shame the food did not match said atmosphere.Tayyabs suffers from the age old problem that all south asian restaurants suffer: the curries are all cooked in the same base sauce! There's no authenticity or uniqueness to an aloo saag when compared to a chicken karahi! The food is made to cater to an audience that is either not asian or are so drunk they can't tell the difference between authentic indian food and a restaurants budget-cutting variation!If you're a brit asian like me, you can get better food at home!The mango lassi and sizzling mixed grill starter are banging though! Must try both if you come here. The expenditure is also easy on the wallet!",-1,-1,1,,
715,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"I wanted to go to Tayyabs as I'd heard sooooo much about it from various sources. However I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. We got there and we were sat down fairly quickly which was good, in the middle of a line of tables for two people. The tables were very close together and I could literally rub elbows with the person next to me, so I felt a little boxed in. We opted for paneer tikka, chicken tikka, lamb chops,masala fish, baby chicken masala and a garlic naan and a Coke. Let's just say, we were hungry. The person who took our order didn't write any of it down. When the drinks arrived it was a Diet Coke, not a normal Coke, despite having specified normal Coke. After asking three different people, they changed the Coke over so that was slightly annoying. The paneer came first and I was excited about it as paneer is one of my favourite foods. However I was really disappointed. The paneer was rubbery and hard and bland. Paneer is not supposed to be like that, it's supposed to have a slight rubbery texture but this was hard - I found it difficult to cut through with my knife and fork! The chicken tikka and the lamb chops slightly redeemed Tayyabs. They were both delicately spiced and cooked really well. The meat was really succulent and tender. Really tasty. The masala fish was really not my thing. I didn't like it at all however my dinner companion did so it wasn't all bad. When the naan came, we looked at it but didn't realise until we tasted it and realised that it wasn't garlic naan. However the two of us just couldn't be bothered to send it back as the last time we tried to send the Coke back, they took forever. The baby chicken masala was very tender and cooked really well but I wasn't overly keen on the sauce - it was a bit bland. Maybe it just wasn't to my taste. Overall my opinion of Tayyabs wasn't great. I thought that the service was poor, the food was okay, not the best Indian I've had and I felt that the seating was quite intrusive. But I do understand why people like it, it's affordable, tasty(ish) Indian food where you can BYOB!",-1,-1,-1,,
716,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"I do understand why other people may be gaga for Tayyabs, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.I had an old school friend visiting from the States who'd never had Indian food. As we eat Indian a fair bit, and recently did a cooking class in Goa for a week, I decided this must be rectified immediately. I wanted to be able to show him Brick Lane and the environs, but I knew the restaurants on Brick Lane can be a bit hit-and-miss. I'd heard great things about Tayyabs though, and they had online booking, so it was an easy choice.We arrived at 7pm on a Friday for our booking, just 3 of us. We kept trying to say we had a booking but they weren't interested as it wasn't crazily busy (Ramadan fasting time). They took us up to the top floor and we got a table right away. It is definitely close quarters but okay.The menu is quite short, and as our guest didn't know what any of it was, really, I just went ahead and ordered - a lamb dish, a chicken tikka masala, sag aloo, rice and garlic naan, along with some paneer tikka, lamb chops, and samosas to start. Our guest had brought a beer, so I asked for a bottle opener, and we ordered Coke.The food came out pretty much all at once, except for the paneer which was first. My favourite foods of the night were the samosas and the paneer. I didn't try the lamb chops, and our guest only had one, so I think he wasn't blown away.I just didn't care much for the curry, to be honest. Not a huge amount of flavour and a bit oily.The garlic naan was more like a garlic bread from Prezzo, swimming in butter. The service wasn't rude but wasn't attentive. After we'd been there about an hour, it started getting really, really loud. This was easily because of the amount of BYOB that the tables around us had - they were well on their way to being wasted. We made a pretty swift exit around this point.The upsides were that we all left full, nothing was *bad*, and we spent under å£50 for a silly amount of food. A good spot for a tourist to feel authentic, but not so much for someone who has more time and choices.",-1,-1,1,,
717,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"So I've lived in the Eastend for 10 years and have never been to Tayyabs. Yes I know, but whenever we've thought about going, we've not had a booking and thanks to reputation and the guide books there's always a massive queue!One rainy Friday evening a group of us decided to give it a chance we could get in. The queue was short considering. There was only 4 of us so a little easier to seat. The place was rammed! After about 20 minutes of waiting we got a table. The vibe in the restaurant is similar to crowded pub, very loud and hectic. Service was ok, we felt more like a hinderance than paying customers. I think the restaurant has become a victim of it's own success. The food was good, but definitely not worth queueing around the block for.",1,-1,1,,

But, well...I'm going to add my voice to the chorus:It's totally fine.Wait, wait, hear me out.We went at an off-time (late afternoon on a weekday) which is totally recommended.  For food that wasn't earth-shattering (more on that in a moment) I would have left with a lil' taste of bitter to compliment that curry post-meal if I had been queuing for ages.There were a lot of North Americans there (so the London guidebooks have been doing their job) and there was a lot of staff on the floor and yet...the service was bizarre.  We sat down and it took a long time for anyone to come.  When they did it was extremely brusque and aggressive.Us: ""and we'll split one naan""Server: ""one or two naan?""Us: ""one, thanks""Server: ""so two?  One is not enough""We ate lots, though.  Pappadums: weird.  one about twice the size as the second and - as someone else mentioned - not crisp.  Should'ha skipped on this onePakora: yep.  Delish.  Wedge of lemon and some raita over these chick pea flour-dusted Naan: fine?  I mean, nothing spectacular but they were fluffy and warm and good for soaking up extras from the meal.Mango lassi available *by the pitcher*.We went for a lentil and baby aubergine curry and a chicken curry; both recommended by the server.  They were good not great; size wasn't particularly large (this was fine), but the real issue was that flavours weren't punchy.  That said, the chicken was really tender and the highlight of both dishes.Yelp note: WISH WE HAD GONE FOR THE LAMB CHOPS.",-1,-1,1,,
719,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,Great restaurant with a menu to suit all spice ranges in the heart of central London. There's no alcohol menu so take your own wine. Soft drinks served there. The staff are helpful and will guide you through the menu.,1,1,1,,

My grandparents had their warehouse on new road for decades and the food has been on point since I was a kid. Kebabs are a staple. That's all I dream about when I'm in LA (live there now)Dry meat, lamb karahi, and lamb chops can't go wrong with either. Anyway I'm heading there now my mouth is watering !! Lol",1,1,1,,

I did like the sundries we had (naan bread etc) but it's hard for me to get over the fact that my plate looked like it had come straight from the Deepwater Horizon accident.Most of my friends rave about the lamb chops, which were tasty but not sufficiently so that I'd forget about everything else.In the UK, Indian food has this reputation of being unhealthy, rich and you'd think after the decades that Bengalis and Brick Lane had been here, they would have at least tried to change this image. Apparently not.",-1,-1,1,,

Plus BYOB.Highlights:  Food was delicious, cooked great and ample quantity, Location was easy to find, Staff was friendly and a huge dinning area.Can improve: Lamb chops were a little over spiced and over cooked.  Also, the experience feels very rushed, they will have ALL your food out in 5 and you feel like they want to turn the table as soon as possible.  Benchmark: For me the best Indian restaurants are Delhi Spice, Namaste Lounge & Everest Lounge.Last dined in June 2015.

724,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"A very popular restaurant. Despite of having a massive three story place, people kept queueing. Booking is a must. Great options of Pakistani menu. Grill meats were full of flavour, lamb was my favourite one. Regarding to curries, the lamb rosh was also tasty. Get ready to have your tongue a little bit spiced! It will burn for a little bit. Order your mango lassy to cool down things. Eat the Asian way, grab your naan bread and stuck it in that curry, get messy is fun! The place doesn't sale alcoholic beverages but you can BYO, great!

726,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"thefoodseeker.comWhen venturing out to London, it is only customary to have a good curry during your visit. A patient of mine had recommended this place, which was recommended to him by the celebrity food critic Simon Majumdar (a UK native). Known for their lamb chops, the restaurant was started by Mohammed Tayyab and has been within the family for over 30 years. Their use of spices is generally tasted in every dish. When seeking Tayyabs, the closest tube stops are either Aldgate East or Whitechapel. It is definitely a bit hidden in an alleyway, but as soon as you see the bright blue lights and the crowd of people standing in the queue, you know you found the right place. An array of desserts is displayed upon entering the door. People huddle around waiting for their names to be called as the smell of succulent lamb is within their grasp. Tayyabs is a BYOB eatery, so walk over to the nearest off-license or Tesco as soon as you get off the tube stop. And....don't forget to make a reservation for this place! Trust me on this one. It can be done online in less than 2 minutes.Pappadums as well as a salad were provided, along with three different sauces complimentary to the start of the meal. The sauces range from spicy, to a sweet chutney and a cooling creamy sauce. All delicious!LAMB CHOPS ( å£6.50 FOR 4 PIECES): My favorite dish. The chops are delivered in 4 pieces, topped with a tomato and served on a bed of grilled onions. This dish could easily be ordered for each individual. The chops were succulent, rubbed with their own spices and provided with enough heat as to not overwhelm the palate. Is it the best chops I've ever had in my life? I wouldn't say so, but it definitely is ranked high up there and worth a try! KEEMA NAAN (å£2.75): A definite must order. The naan was so fresh and stuffed with minced meat, onions, green chili, and garlic. The bread glistened under the light, waiting to be engulfed by the hungry individuals. CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA (å£7.75): The dish is definitely not your normal chicken tikka masala you would find in the States. It contains karahi masala, coriander aka cilantro, onions and chilis. It definitely has a kick so utilize the sauces and the naan. The dish definitely goes well over basmati rice and you can bet your buttons that the chicken was not overcooked or dry! KARAHI GOSHT LAMB (å£7.00 SMALL): This is my favorite of the two curries. Why? The lamb just melts in your mouth and provides enough heat from the chilis and spices for the dish. Again, naan and basmati rice are a must with this dish. GARLIC NAAN (å£2.00): Order this if you feel like having bread without the stuffing. It is pillowy, soft, and oh so delicious with just the right amount of garlic!PISTA KULFI AND MANGO KULFI (å£2.75 EACH): And just when you thought you were done, you're not. This is a must to finish off the meal. It's ice cream with the creamiest texture in popsicle form. Don't mind the wrapping or the shape of the popsicle. You won't care once you want to cool off your tongue and sink your teeth into these. There are other varieties, but we chose these flavors. No disappointment whatsoever. Overall, it was a lovely meal shared amongst friends (family style) without breaking the wallet. We each paid å£20 with tip and the meal left us thinking about the lamb once more.",1,1,1,,

The chicken was moist. The lamb was not gamey. The beef isn't Alberta beef but still good. Loved the mango lassi! Defintely recommended for anyone visiting Easy London.,1,1,1,,
729,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"I had dinner at Tayyabs tonight at the recommendation of a local friend, and I have to say I was not disappointed.  I was seated within 5 minutes of walking in even though it was at the height of dinner (6:30pm).  Looking at recommendations from my fellow yelpers, I ordered the lamb chops for an appetizer, which came out quickly on a sizzling cast iron plate and were absolutely delicious.  The seasoning and charring on the meat worked beautifully together.  Next I had the Dry Meat curry, which was anything but dry. (Dry meat garlic, chilli, turmeric and beef), this was also amazing, spicy but not too hot.  Along with that I had saag paneer, which was a partial let down of the evening.  While well spiced and flavorful, it came absolutely swimming in oil, again it was good but for a vegetarian dish I was hoping it would be a bit lighter and the oil just seemed excessive.  Lastly I rounded out my meal with garlic naan, which was also slightly disappointing only because it was under cooked.  I think another minute or two in the oven and it probably would have been perfect.  And finally a banana lassi to wash it all down.  The banana had been raved about by a couple yelpers, it was good but I think I'll stick with mango in the future.  Still a delicious meal!",1,1,1,,
730,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"An essential part of planning a trip in a foreign city or country is relying on Yelp reviewers to point you in the right direction.  Tayyabs is the most reviewed restaurant in London, and for good reason.  Approaching the nondescript restaurant, i was unsure.  However once we opened the door and saw the hundreds of people dining, we knew we were on to something.  We started with a mango lassi, we were preparing ourselves, just incase the food was uber spicy.   We had the dry beef, which comes in two sizes and is by far dry.  It was so spicy and the meat was so flavourful.  We over ordered, tip: if sharing a few dishes, order the small version.  The next was grilled shrimp.  Most people have been to a mexican restaurant where your fajitas come steaming hot to your table.  This was a more refined version of that.  A screaming hot skillet comes to your table and you can see the onions and lettuce actually burning the longer it sits.  The shrimp were massive and tender and so spiced, simply delicious.  Overall, I found the service lacked simply because the restaurant just accommodates so many people. However the food and electric atmosphere  would bring me back into Tayyabs",1,-1,1,,

I have been waiting 30 minutes for the check and have asked three times.  I'd understand if it were busy but it's not, the staff are just totally indifferent.  Also, bathroom are not clean, hand dryers are both broken, one sink is clogged, the other doesn't work and there are no paper towels.  Needless to say, it's been a pretty poor experience.",-1,-1,-1,,
732,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"I was told to try Indian food in London as it was one of the best outside of India.  So my friend brought me here and the amount of people waiting to put their name in was insane.  Luckily someone in my party had the right idea to go online to make a reservation through Tayyabs' website.  So we didn't bother with the line and just booked for half an hour later at 10:15p and the restaurant closes at 11p.  We order a lot of stuff, can't remember what.  None of the dishes were disappointing, and a few stood out.  I'd like to return to London one day to check out more restaurants to do a proper comparison.  The service was okay during the meal, weird towards the end.  They cleared our drinks before we were done, some of the workers wore their jackets and stared at the remaining few tables to pressure us to leave.  Then they shut off the lights.  It was pretty hilarious.  I think if you want to close promptly, or close to 11 as possible, you shouldn't seat people at 10:15.  A nice tip is that they don't serve alcohol here so BYOB.  It's nice there's no corkage fee here.",-1,-1,-1,,

We had two dishes between the two of us, an amazing sag paneer and a melt in your mouth dry meat which was lamb. The only think I didn't like was the mango lassi. The portion got that was just huge though; one would easily serve two. Be aware that when you fit down they'll put some papadums on your table big they're not free. They do tell you this but just be prepared.",1,1,1,,

The biryani specialty is good, the nihari specialty is decent too, and I want to try them all! The naans are amazing when they come to the table fresh and piping hot. One time I took a friend, the naan was not so good as usual, but otherwise I have found it to be excellent. I think the plain naans are better than the others I tried as well. My husband loves the seekh kabab here too. The palak gosht is decent too and the prices are very good.The kulfi here is amazing and they have the equally good pistachio flavour as well. The place is always packed so I assume everyone else knows how good it is too:) I'd advise getting a reservation if you can, the line gets long. It's not a fancy place but if you want to go somewhere casually, it's great!! Takeaway is fine too, but if you eat in it's always better.",1,1,1,,
735,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"Controversy klaxon! Tayyabs has well and truly jumped the shark. The first times I've visited I did the classic queuing that everyone does but this time I had booked a table. My father is visiting and is really into authentic Indian food so I decided to bring him here. I booked because I didn't want us to have to wait although this now seems pointless, because there was no queue. It was actually the quietest I've seen it. And yet, they still wouldn't seat us until the fourth person in our party arrived. So even if you book a table, you still wait. This is a ridiculous policy and is clearly because they want you to eat, take your money and get you out ASAP. This was the case the whole evening and, let's face it, Tayyabs popularity is not what it was so they don't need to turn tables so quickly. They came over and hustled us into ordering and were so unclear about everything. It's so loud, you can barely hear what they are saying. I went to the bathroom after we ordered and when I returned, both our starters and mains were on the table. FFS. Starters are meant to come BEFORE the mains, not altogether so they can make you leave faster. It was very unpleasant and the same thing was happening to all the other tables. The food itself was fine, but nothing special. I actually preferred an Indian meal we went to in my hometown of Cork two weeks ago! The BYOB thing is great and it's cheap enough,but I'm over their crappy service. Tayyabs, I won't be back. Your food just isn't that good to warrant shoveling it down in two minutes.",-1,-1,-1,,

Reconciled me with mutton, actually. Garlic naan is average, but chicken tikka soft and tasty. Rice is simply superb. The sugar tooth would be disappointed by the kheer, but I relished its subtler notes, even after medium hot curries. I would not bring in most of my French friends though, as virtues were to my taste: they would burn their mouth, kill their taste, mar their pleasure.I dined there alone, conversation would have been difficult as the place is crowded and rather noisy. But I enjoyed my meal nonetheless and had no problem metabolizing it - as sometimes happened when I Indian-dine in Paris.",1,1,1,,

Came with two friends right before 7 and we were seated after a 5 min wait (the line and wait became much longer after 730). To start each table is given a plate of delicious papadum and three chutneys. We ordered the chicken tikka masala (delicious), karage chicken (a bit of a cinnamon kick, very unique), garlic naan , rice, daal (my favorite dish of the night), eggplant (really good), and a jug of mango lasse (they ran out of banana). Had we been bigger lamb fans we would have ordered their dry meat. Overall it was a great meal, really lively ambiance, and an affordable 43GBP total! Highly recommend coming and bringing a few bottles of wine or beer -- it's BYOB -- better value than Dishoom.",1,1,1,,

Friends who have been here before, recommend the kebabs over the curries.Their lamb chops were quite good as were the seekh kebabs. Husband and friends said that the prawns were good too. The chicken tikka though was dry and the paneer tikka rubbery. Kheema was a nice spicy gravy that went great with the rotis. The biryani was tasty, but I was quite put off with the addition of peas and other veggies in a mutton biryani.Tayyabs is great VFM, but not a ""return to"" on my list.",-1,1,1,,

The restaurant is huge, so I don't imagine it took too long, but air on the side of caution. We started with popodoms and 3 sauces, which were all equally amazing, the yogurt sauce had a kick that was fantastic! We ordered the lamb, a chicken tikka masala, sag aloo, chick peas and loads of naan. Everything was better than the dish before. Tender meat, so much flavor, comes out very quickly and very hot. Its also BYOB so we brought loads of wine and fizz. This also helped cut down on price. It was just over a tenner per person to be stuffed full of food and walking out a bit tipsy.. you cannot beat it!  All in all, I will be back again and again because it was so good! NOTE: There is a tesco right around the corner so dont worry about clinking bottles together on a tube ride.",1,1,1,,

In London, Indian food looks fancy and goes for å£15 or more. Dang...The food itself was yummy, but not that much more amazing than my favorite local place in SF. What makes this place a 5 star for me are two things: Naan and Mango Lassi.The Naan was SO FLUFFY. It had a bit of crisp on the outside, but was mostly soft, pillowy, and just yummy. The Mango Lassi was just super yummy. They must have found the ripest mangos in all of London.

I use the term endearingly, much in the same way Ron Weasley continuously refers to Hermione's antics as ""mental."" My coursemates and I, about 13 of us, decided to have dinner here for a final summer dinner before we all parted ways and when we arrived I was staggered by the amount of people on a WEDNESDAY EVENING. It was at dinner rush, our reservations were for 7:30 pm but thank god my classmates had gone here before or else I would not have known to reserve. So if there's anything that you should take away from this... if you want a guaranteed seat make a reservation. The decor was interesting, a bit chic and mod with neon lights. It has no kitschy Indian decor to dress up the atmosphere, it's almost like a night club. Overall, my first impression was chaos... but like an organized chaos. It seemed like all the servers, despite the massive amount of people crowding the doors, knew exactly what to do and where to go. Since it was such a busy night, we were left to peruse the menu with some poppadums and a trio of sauces for a generous amount of time. Eventually it took some serious flagging skills and a complete disregard for British propriety and subtlety to finally grab the waiters attention to let him know we were ready to order. But the most impressive part of the night was when the waiter came around to take our order. Among the 13 or 14 of our group, we all ordered a variety of starters, mains, and rice/naans. It was a hodge podge of a few starters, a myriad of mains, and different varieties of naans. The waiter remembered it all, no pad, no pencil. To our astonishment, he repeated the whole order verbatim without any missed dishes. My coursemates (who the majority of us have worked at least once in the service industry) gave him a well deserved and very awestruck round of applause. I know it may have been premature because the food hadn't arrived but damn... that takes some skill. I'm not going to speak much on the food. It was good and as it has been said repeatedly and several different ways the lamb chops were delicious; the dry meat was a bit more lack luster. But from what I gather Tayyabs is an institution in London, it's a place that everyone must try. The food is good and the atmosphere is thoroughly enjoyable. I don't know what it is but it could be the fact that very few restaurants are able to nurture a fun atmosphere without having their customers having to shell out more money for it; a part of it understands that dining in good company with good food is enough to make a night fantastic.",1,1,-1,,
746,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"I can't recommend this place enough. To start, the food is exceptional. Really really good. You won't get the usual fare though, so if you want a chicken korma you may find yourself left wanting. Just order whatever tickles your fancy and you'll probably end up happy. And they don't mention spiciness so if you particularly do / don't want spice, let them know. The service is also great, our waiter got a standing ovation for remembering all 16 meals without a pen and paper. He also pulled the ""I don't work here"" joke to dramatic effect. Well played sir.  Well played. The atmosphere can be anything from withheld to...  Boisterous. I think they'll try and sit you in an area that reflects your group. 10 tweenagers will end up in the silly room etc. Book ahead. They get incredibly busy. That's pretty much all I have on this one. Good food. Good service. Oh and BYOB. Which is always wonderful.",1,-1,-1,,

I'm not a fan of going to Indian restaurants, but this is the consequence of the lack of great restaurant where I live.I went there with a reservation, it was great idea because it so busy.The menu is large and offer a huge choice and daily specials. I was surprised about the low prices, quantity served is large. Great value for the money.I tried the Biryani which was really good and a bit too spicy for me. This place is swarming after 6pm!! A lot of waiters are going in and out, so I would recommended not to be seated next to the kitchen.

Just a short walk from the more obvious Brick Lane eateries, Tayyabs has been pleasing the crowds for many years now.  I particularly like the fact it is still unlicensed and you can bring your own booze (if you must - they have a good choice of lassi and other soft drinks) while on Brick Lane these days you are lured in with offers of free drinks.Everything I've eaten here has been delicious, and the prices are very competitive.

It will shoot you straight up the heaven and back, it's that good! Everything we ordered was scrumptious. The Keema Naan was the best - so buttery and flavorful; I'm on the brink of drooling just thinking about it.

The waiters were not great at explaining what the different dishes are, probably catering to a more knowledgeable audience The atmosphere was very busy and crowded, and as we were sitted next to the entrance, 70% of what I heard during my visit (the remaining being my brother talk) was big groups complaining on why they cannot be seated before everyone in their party arrives at the restaurant. I had heard that since Tayyabs has become very popular they have expanded their space maybe ""too much,"" and that was indeed the feeling I got. Big kudos for being BYO!",-1,1,1,,

755,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Tayyabs. To me it's an institution not only of East London but London itself. I've had 3 different groups of foreign friends come over in the last year and the first place I take them to introduce them to a bit of London cultural food is here at Tayyabs. It's not just that you can bring your own booze (offies nearby), it's not just that the queues EVERY day show that repeated business is showing it to be success, it's not just the place is huge. I swear I've been about 30 times and there seems to be more and more rooms that I never knew existed. It's cheap but most of all the food is exceptional. I love the curry's I really do. They are all tasty and if you look online you will see daily specials that are worth getting. Also 'dry' curry is not dry at all. It's probably one of the best. But it's the starters that I come back for again and again and again and again. It's these that I ALWAYS order. I love the chops. Ah those lamb chops sizzling toward the table. And the Sheekh kebabs....the Panneer Tikka...the Chicken Tikka. These FOUR you pretty much should get. I've been a few times when this is all I ordered for myself. It's that good. If you're really hungry of course go forth and get a curry and naans. Share those if need be. But always get those starters. The Lamb Chops if you've done your research needs no selling. It's the best in London. And though you can bring your own bottle of wine or beer...I would recommend (speaking as an Asian person myself) get a Mango Lassi. It's strange that my non Asian friends have rarely had this. I grew up having this mango pulp and yogurt drink that is fruity, creamy and smooth. it's ace. I'd actually prefer to have this than the booze with my curry to be honest. Yogurt is traditional to help cool you when eating hot food. So...what are you waiting for....GO! It's defo in my Top 5 places to eat in London. Enjoy!",1,1,1,,
756,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Whenever someone asks me where to eat in London, this is the one place I always recommend. I have been here over a dozen times over 4 or 5 years. Two dozen? Quite likely. Three dozen? Certainly possible. And this place has been around for decades. You do not want to go to Brick Lane. You want to come here. And BYOB.You can read the other reviews that talk about the ambiance and whatnot.I'll cut straight to the point. Here is what you want to order:1. Chili lamb chops. They come out in a massive cloud of smoke spice. Eat all the grilled onions that accompany them.2. Dry meat. It is not dry at all. It is delicious. Where were you all my life, dry meat?3. Chana4. Urid dal5. Something else from the veggie list -- okra, baby pumpkin, change it up to spice up your life.Gluten free notes: I eat here all the time with no problems, though I have not attempted to verify what is or is not gluten free. Papadums are fine (rice & lentil). No naan for you!",1,1,1,,

758,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"A very popular Indian/Pakistani restaurant out in grittier Whitechapel, but worth the trek out there. Lamb chops are the popular dish here but I liked the kahari chicken keema (ground chicken curry) and the dry meat (lamb cooked in curry sauce till the sauce is concentrated). The meats were juice and flavorful. Highly recommend those dishes. Also had the daal, mixed vegetables, and garlic naan, which were average but good. The only thing I didn't like was the burnt onion chips that topped most of the dishes. It's a loud crowded restaurant but we only had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated on an early Friday evening.",-1,1,1,,
759,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"I heard from many people that this place was fantastic and after looking at all the positive reviews on yelp I knew I had to give it a try.I took my fellow yelpers advice and made a reservation a few days ahead and brought a bottle of wine to this BYOB spot. When we arrived for our 6:30 reservation there was still a few open tables, but by the time we left around 8:30 the place was packed with a wait. And it was only a Monday! If you have a group, be sure to call ahead.The food was full of flavour and the selection was pretty good. We weren't too overwhelmed with the massive menu that many other places have. They even have the menu online so you can check it out ahead of time. We asked a few questions from our server and he didn't seem to have a problem answering them which we found helpful. Don't ask anyone else helping the room anything, they won't help you, well at least that was our experience. Their was a main man on the bottom floor and he was the only one we could ask questions to, order, or pay.I give it only 4 stars rather than 5 because they brought a starter after all our food came out and it was clearly sitting up in the kitchen because it was dried out and not hot anymore. Our breads also came out a little later than our mains so we had to wait for them to begin. So, nothing awful, just not the perfect set-up. The price is very fair and all together we are very interested in returning with a few more people so we can try a bigger variety of dishes.",1,-1,-1,,
760,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"The food at tayyabs is great. Obviously the stuff off the grill and the fresh breads are the big draws. But the curries, the saag, the channa, the prawns are fantastic too. If I was just reviewing the food there would be five stars here. But I choose not to go there any more in the evening, because it's a crappy experience. You queue for ages, often an hour. Then you get squeezed into a seat. If you're unlucky that seat has the queue winding around you so your seat occasionally gets kicked while you're eating. The waiter is trying to be helpful but he's struggling, serving too many tables, squeezing through too tight a space. Then you're rushed out because hey there are 200 people waiting for your space. Go to tayyabs for lunch, but not at night. There are equally good places in the side streets, where you can have a lovely dinner time experience. Try Lahore one for example.",-1,1,1,,

763,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Tayyab's came highly rated from our friend who lives in London. We walked there from Brick Lane so we really worked up an appetite. He made reservations prior to our arrival and I can see how busy they get, even at the time we went which was not really lunch or dinner time. The food here is not the Indian type of food I am familiar with eating. We got some grilled meats Seekh Kabob, Lamb Chops and Chicken Tikka. We also got a mixed vegetable dish and garlic naan. They gave us papadam with some tasty dips. The garlic naan was exceptional. The meats, we asked if they were spicy and they told us no, but my hubby was sweating bullets! Overall, the spices used on the meats were very similar and I did not notice much variation in taste of the different meats. The veggie dish was very oily and I almost forced myself to eat it. I know giving back your food is not acceptable and I did not want to waste any money! So I ate it. Their website says Punjabi food and you can reserve online before coming in. I am sure this will save you some time. I would say overall the food was good, but nothing I would go out of my way for again. It's pretty expensive in my opinion. Compared to food in London its comparable, but for me it was a lot for what it was. I would be more curious to try the curry houses that are just down half a mile from here.",1,-1,-1,,

And yet when we showed up and said we had reservations, we were first ignored, then told to leave the line we were standing in to sit down, and finally told to rejoin the line again, where we waited behind other walk-in customers for another 20 minutes. I'm perplexed -- why have a reservation system at all if you don't honor it?That being said, the Karahi Chicken was phenomenal, the Naan chewy and hot, and the Seekh kebab spicy and tender.",-1,-1,-1,,

However, upon actually trying this place, we were incredibly disappointed.First of all, our lamb chops were not cooked all the way. We didn't ask for raw meat, thank you very much.Second, I found hair in my rice. At that point, my appetite was gone.Third of all, the samosas were not so great. Even the samosas I have tried in the US were far more flavorful.Don't waste your time going here. Dishoom was a million times better. And the service here was a joke.",-1,-1,-1,,

I've been lucky enough to sample nearly every dish, and you can't really go wrong with any of them - although the lamb and chicken tikka are standouts. There can be a queue if you come during peak hours, but since it's a restaurant with three levels, it usually goes rather fast. Did I mention the food is good value for the quality and the price, and that it's BYO too?!",1,1,1,,

Granted, it had been a while since my last visit but wow, what a miserable experience!To be fair, the food is still amazing.  The lamb chops are still finger lickin' good.  The table still falls silent once the food arrives - you can't get it in your mouth fast enough.But there were two major downfalls this time.  We were there on a Monday night.  It was not full.  There was no queue out the door.  There were empty tables.  The service was its usual surly self but it seemed worse than usual.  They couldn't be bothered to help us make space for the food that was coming out and instead was telling us, quite rudely, to move stuff around.  Really?  What's the freaking rush?But the worst was the bottle of water that they leave on the tables.  You think it's free but it's actually å£2.50.  They won't bring you tap water.  It's the bottled water or nothing.  How cheap can you get that you won't even offer tap water?  A completely disappointing experience and I'm not sure I'll be going back, despite the delicious food.

I don't see any reviews stating otherwise but I'm going to go ahead and praise Tayyabs anyway.Definitely a place to book in advance - queues out the door at 6 in the evening. It's a BYOB with a noisy very busy atmosphere making this restaurant a great choice for a celebration or pre-party meal. Staff are all very polite and efficient especially considering that the fast paced nature of the place I imagine makes it pretty stressful to work in! Our waiter took orders from all 15 members of our party then recited it back perfectly and didn't mess up when it came to actually delivering it too! Everyone's food was delicious (get the paneer) and came quickly. Tayyabs is a great choice for vegetarians, at least half if not the majority of the menu is veggie. So yeah, definitely go!

Quality is shocking, prices high, queues long, service non - existent. My last curry was just a few pieces of lamb swimming in oil.There are now way better places all within a few minutes walk...

A bonus was when I discovered that they had started taking reservationsSo, it was great to swan past the queue of people waiting to be shown to our table. Fellow London Elite Tirthankar D also joined us and he was able to help to navigate the menuTheir signature masala lamb chops were of course obligatory and we added some tandoori chicken from the grill. The curry section wasn't their strong point and we had a selectionThe lamb chops were very good - moist, juicy and succulent given some good charring from the grill and heavy with spice.

Great that it's BYOB too, so I'm hoping it wasn't the 3 bottles between us that's influencing this review... Minor incident of finding a small rock in one of my bites, but I didn't break any teeth and they were super apologetic about it.

We ordered two entrees and some naan. The entrees were absolutely delicious and made the wait for a table totally worth it. The ambiance suffers a little bit because this place is so busy - it's a huge restaurant (three levels), yet the tables are crammed in and every seat is taken.

Definitely have not had Indian food like this in the U.S.I loved their Naans especially because they had so many different varieties.

Tayyabs is one of those institution-type places that will likely remain popular 20 years down the line even if it degenerates (or rebrands as a fine dining place or something).  A few notes:- decor-wise, it's not quite as, uh, stylish as Majliss in Oxford, but that lighting...- lamb chops: they'll stick in your teeth, but that seasoning is goooood.- the onions at the bottom of the cast-iron grilled meat pans are possibly the best thing in this place.- last time I went I had to piss in a bucket.- a busy curryhouse is somewhat close to my idea of a nightmare.  People always get packed in, large groups, the underlying assumption that it's ok to get pretty hammered and raucous in an effnic place (maybe I'm being harsh there, but...).  I rarely go to Tayyabs at night.- chaotic service, you'll probably never get the same person twice.- soggy poppadoms.  Soggadoms.- I can't ever see pakora without immediately thinking of this: youtube.com/watch?v=wxKt‰Û_- I absolutely love the tinda masala (pumpkin curry) - the tanginess of the pumpkin really makes this dish stands out.  Plus, although crispy fried shallots make everything better, they totally supercharge this one.  Nom nom nom.-  Dry meat and chana meat.  Thank me later.  The chana meat is particularly excellent.- Mango kulfi! (filed under 'Deserts' [sic])Considering that it's the same price as most bog-standard curry houses, Tayyabs is great.  Every single dish I've had here has been packed with flavour and despite all the detracting qualities of the place, I'm still always really excited to come back here - I'd be hard-pressed to name a better Punjabi restaurant in London.

We ordered quite a bit of food (as usual for an Indian) but the best was the house speciality lamb cops and the saag meat. The curries were full of flavour and there was a lot of meat in each dish. The naan was super light and fluffy and was perfect to mop up all the sauce. We polished off all the food and although I was super stuffed afterwards, it was worth it.The only niggling point I have is that the service was quite rushed and I definitely felt like they were trying to turn tables over. There was a queue on our way out, but I would have enjoyed a bit of a slower meal. For the quality of the food and the price I will defo be up for making an East end trek for their curries again.",1,1,1,,
793,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"This place always gets rave reviews and is in my area so I tried it a few months back.  I'm not the biggest fan but that's partly down to the business model - which is to get people in and out fast and not really do reservations.   There is often a big queue and the place is packed to the rafters.   A lot of people love that,  the brassy shouty mayhem feels buzzy and authentic,  but it's not my cup of chai!  They do a great mango lassi and the desserts were yummy, but the main courses seem to be that brash ghee- soaked variety, rather than the complex spicy concoctions you can get at some other places in the area.",-1,1,1,,
794,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Such a let-down. The only thing that this place has going for it is the food. Normally, that would suffice. But Tayyeb proves to be the exception to the rule.The wife and I booked a reservation here and after a long trip on the tube and a bit of self-induced (for Tayyeb) confusion about how to seat a bunch of parties that were queued up and raring to go, we sat down and had dishes, cutlery, and sauces plopped unceremoniously on our table. Having grown up with Cantonese waiters doing the same thing (but with much more insouciance), we weren't perturbed. Nor were we perturbed when we were told that they no longer did BYOB (great, another bottle of vino to pack for our trip back!). Nor were we perturbed when I asked for a fork and was given a knife (I ended up eating everything with a serving spoon). What did perturb me was the food. After such inept service and organization, I hoped fervently that every bite of the Karahi lamb chop masala, karahi gosht, garlic naan, and sikkh kebabs would be manna from heaven. Not so. They were all good- the garlic naan was soft, the kebabs were spicy and aromatic, and the main dishes were delightfully fragrant with a hint of heat. But they weren't that good. It certainly didn't warrant the long trip, the slack service, and the utterly self-induced chaos that marked the entire experience.Oh yes, that BYOB policy? Totally arbitrary. The table next to us pulled a bottle of vino out of their bag and was handed a corkscrew. Unfortunately for us, we had already finished eating. Psssht!",-1,1,1,,
795,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"It's amazing how many people this restaurant can accommodate. Right when you walk in, you're corralled into I guess what some people would call a queue. Yup, it's packed and every seat in the restaurant is filled. If you don't like crowds, you may be uncomfortable... Get ready to rub elbows with the strangers next to you. Luckily, the two times I've been, I haven't had to wait more than five minutes for a table.I've tried a few things and all were actually quite tasty. Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Karahi Chicken, Lamb Chops, and Garlic Naan. You really can't go wrong with anything you get and if you're starving when you get seated, you are in luck. The food comes within minutes of ordering, it's amazing! Be careful because everything is piping hot and sizzling when it gets to the table. Dipping the naan in the curry is my fave and I always leave stuffed to the brim. It's a fast-paced restaurant, there are plenty of servers but they're typically running around and in a hurry so don't expect all-star service. I like this restaurant... it might be a bad thing that I live walking distance to this place.",1,1,1,,
796,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Unique Indian experience. I discovered it from the book writen by Alain Ducasse, the famous French chef and this place lives up to its reputation. It is packed and lots of people are forming a line the all time you are having diner. We had a reservation. Menu is clear with several dishes to choose from but not too too many which simplifies the process. We got tika masala, eggplants, dry meat plate, naan, lamb chop to start, a samousa and some rice. Everything was great, especially the fact that plates are spicy but just the right way. Sauces with naan, check, eating lamb chops with fingers check, mixing everything in your plate Check. We did it all. Plus it is BYOB, yes, and they have a Tesco down the road to refill if you run out. Perfect set up, honestly this place is a must and it is the first really true food monument of London I have tried, and it was a success. Go for it all the way.",1,1,1,,

Great Pakistani food, with notably great flavours jn parts, but worth its status as one of London's must eat spots? Firstly some Tips: book in advance, and aim for just before dinner service (5.45/6pm). Yes that queue is for reservations; you'll be swept upstairs into a lovely large series of dining rooms. The pompadums you are offered as not free, at 80P each. Also do not be afraid to wave to get attention, this place is extremely busy and fast.+ Food was delivered at a lightning fast rate, you literally wouldn't believe it. We ordered paneer tikka, 3 seekh kebabs, prawn Karahi, muttom tikka Karahi, 3 tandoori roti, 1 peshwari Naan, jug of sweetlassi.+ Seekh kebabs were delicious, best I've had in a long time. Everything else I have to say was fairly tasty but not hugely exciting.We left full and satisfied and had a good night, but I'm not in a huge rush to come back.

Their selction of roast meats like tandoori chicken and lamb chops are pretty impressive, must be the marinade. The lamb was tender, not easy to do as a lot of places get it chewy. Nice decor and probably a decent place to bring clients as it looks rather formal",1,1,1,,
799,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Yes, I am joining the masses of people that make the trek to White Chapel for Indian food. The rave reviews for the mango lassis and pork chops at this place really don't lie. And BYOB is a marvelous way to enjoy your perfect beverage while dining here.Stand out to me was the na'an, of which I would recommend you order at least one per person. The texture was something like a lightweight, delicious pizza crust.Our dining party also found the vegetarian options very pleasing. I also discovered a few things I might not have otherwise. Like Indian candy dessert! I recommend the one that looks like a mess of orange Twizzler. Delicious.Seating situation is weird at this restaurant. Almost all tables are somewhat communal and if you're not comfortable sharing a table with strangers, the crowds they permit to snake around your table pac-man style while waiting will probably feel somewhat overwhelming.Worth noting, however -- I'm not ordinarily a huge fan of Indian food and I really liked this place.",1,1,1,,
800,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"I am in London a lot for business. This was my first time to come to Tayyabs. Excellent food, excellent price. Very nice people. Good hospitality that they allow people to bring in their own beer and wine as they do not serve alcohol in the restaurant. There were many people from all walks of life around me, very pleasent atmosphere. I had the Karahi chiken, a samosa, saag aloo, rice and regular naan. Also a masala tea to end it. All the food was so fresh and flavorful. So this next week I will come here again. I like to hop on the tube, walk a mile or so to tayyabs for exercise then after dinner, head back to the hotel via a walk alomg the Thames to the Tower hill station. Wonderful journey.",1,1,1,,
801,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Great place. Always full! Get ready to get in line... a long one. The signature dish, the dry meat, however, will definitely make it worth your while. Plus, you can bring your own booze. One more reason to try this fabulous Indian place.",1,1,1,,
802,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"There's usually a wait for this place, which signaled to us that it might be a place worth checking out. (That, and our host whom we were renting a flat from had recommended it.)We walk in and were lucky enough to wait only about 5-10 minutes before we were seated in the downstairs seating area. Note: the downstairs is DARK. I could barely even see what I was eating. We decided to order the chicken tikka masala, chicken keema, garlic naan, and a jug of mango lassi. It seems like only another five minutes pass before everything is brought to us. Super fast service always raises a red flag for me -- either the kitchen is extremely well-coordinated or everything is pre-made and reheated.Either way, the flavors of the food were decent enough, although it wasn't quite what we were expecting. Whenever we've had chicken tikka masala before, it was served in a creamy, thick, and rich sauce. However, this chicken tikka masala was soaked in a very oily and thin sauce and didn't taste as good as others that we have had (mainly because you would get a mouthful of oil with your chicken). The chicken keema, naan, and mango lassi were pretty tasty, though. For a party of two, we probably shouldn't have ordered a jug of mango lassi, but it seemed to be the better deal as opposed to ordering two individual glasses.All in all, I've had better. Maybe the Bay Area has spoiled me too much, but Tayyab isn't the absolute worst. The flavors are strong and definitely have potential. The service, though, is a bit rushed at points (re: food arriving five minutes after we ordered). I understand that there's a waiting list of customers, but that doesn't mean that the customers who are seated should be given a quick meal and shooed out the door.",-1,-1,1,,

804,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,I didn't like it here at all. It was rushed and we were squeezed into the smallest table. It felt like a bit of a conveyor belt. The 2 stars given because the pork chop starter was really delicious but the rest of the food was just ok.,-1,-1,-1,,
805,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"I was very excited to check out this restaurant after having seen all the reviews and it certainly lived up to everything people say about it.Yes the queue (and the whole experience) is crazy, and so are people who go here without a reservation. Although actually, I'm not too sure that advanced us greatly seeing as we eventually got a table just because a waiter yelled TWO PEOPLE and someone I chatted to in the queue shoved us forward. We got to sit near the queue which was awesome because you're all like HAHA I'M EATING AND ALSO LINGERING.Following yelp reviews I ordered lamb chops and seekh kebabs, both of which were delicious although weirdly we both found that the lamb chop found underneath other food was much more tender and juicy than those on the top of the plate - sitting under lights too long? Tandoori chicken was also pretty good although no tandoori will never live up to my mum's tandoori ribs (which I recently tried to replicate with terrible results).If you're looking for a non meat dish I'd really recommend the methi. I love the fenugreek flavour and am always looking for this dish on menus since I was introduced to it a couple of years ago (by a Pakistani friend at a restaurant called Spices and Herbs in Juba, South Sudan, which is - implausibly - one of the best Indian restaurants ever, trust me. Go there if you happen to be in town).I also was really into the spicy popadom and the tandoori roti (chapati) was perfect. Which continuing on the random East Africa tangent this review has taken, reminds me of a dish called Rolex which involves an omelette wrapped in a chapati. Srsly: raebear.net/recipes/role‰Û_My sister said she'd come back here, so that's her seal of approval as well as mine. Excellent value for money and fun, frantic, sizzling food.",1,1,1,,
806,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,1,The food was very lacking and the service was horrible. There was absolutely no spice and the tables were way to close to each other.

807,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,Food is delish! And it's BYOB so can't go wrong. However on my last visit did discover chewing gum stuck on the bottom of a plate - disgusting!,-1,-1,-1,,
808,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"First off, I know very little about Indian/Pakistani/Punjabi cuisine, but despite that, it was almost earth shattering to me...food in the US is *okay*, had chicken tikka, naan, and lassi in Brighton (was actually *very* good).I had the Karahi Chicken main, veg samosas, garlic naan, and a mango lassi - the main was a bit piquant but very tasty of its curry sauce (I think) and the chicken was very tender. Vegetable samosas were nicely cooked and vegetables nicely done too. I think this place is the very best on garlic naan, not too powerful on the garlic but still plenty, and the naan was nicely cooked/baked. The lassi, oddly enough, I had last - and it could of been a dessert - not too sweet but yet the perfect balance of sweet, the mango flavors, and just almost velvet-like.My friend had the starter of chicken tikka, main of keema (I think), some roti, and also some lassi. Chicken tikka and keema was awesome, as was the mango lassi, but the roti was eh...I guess she didn't like it. I wasn't in the mood for the roti, so I didn't bother.Its BYOB, but they do server a few non-alcoholic drinks (and lassi) and, of course, water.Tayyebs is a bit crazy as people are eating, talking, going to their tables, getting out from their tables, looks if the place needs a renovation 10 years ago, and a bit crowded - but its all worth it for the taste of great food.The only con: because its busy and fast paced there, if you want attention (like order your food, get a table, etc), then get one of the wait staff folks - otherwise you may wait a bit more than you would like, though you'll eventually get seated or attention.Will definitely come back when in London next.",1,1,1,,

My friends both really liked it, so I'm trying not to be too moody, and give it 3 stars.Making a reservation doesn't seem to help too much with the crazily organised queueing system! We booked a table for three, and arrived a few minutes early, but didn't get to sit down for around 25 minutes. We had to wait in a squashed hallway (completely rammed with other people trying to queue) with waiters pushing past us with sizzling dishes!!One of the waiters stood on my foot, which left me in a bit of a bad mood as he was heavy and it bl***y hurt! He didn't bother to say sorry...but did knock me over as he wanted to go in the other direction. The food was good, cheap and came quite quickly once we found seats!

Surely it doesn't need more people reviewing it, but that's not how we roll here, because I'm going to tell you a secret... stay tuned.A year or so ago Tayyabs changed their policy and started allowing reservations.  Before you'd show up, wait an hour, and finally get to sit down, after spending all of that time staring at huge plates of grilled meat and luscious plates of curries delivered to other tables.  Well, here's how to go to Tayyabs without needing a reservation, and you'll be able to just walk in and sit down.  Sounds too good to be true right?  Well, here's a tip: go for lunch on Sunday.  I know, so simple why didn't anyone else think of it (to be fair people probably did).  While all your other London friends are at the pub having a Sunday roast, you can go to Tayyabs and not have to wait!  Do it.  You know you want to.

813,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"When my parents came to visit, they wanted to get curry in the UK - heard it was better than the British food!  We asked a friend and she recommended Tayyabs, so we headed there on a Wednesday evening.  We phoned ahead and tried to reserve, but they said not to bother.  Boy, was I annoyed when we arrived and saw a massive queue, and a crowded restaurant!  I American-ly complained about this to the host, who then got us seated immediately, so perhaps it pays to be a bit of a whiny Yank sometimes.  This place was PACKED with people - big groups, having a great time.  It was quite hard to have conversation, we were shouting the whole time, but my mom said she didn't even mind - she just liked being around so many happy people!We brought our own wine and beer, since they are BYOB which is great.  We perused the menu which doesn't do much explanation, so consulted our phones a lot.  We munched on poppadoms and chutney while we tried to figure out what to order.  Then we waited for maybe 20 minutes before somebody took our order.  We had asked a few servers to be attended to, and they said they'd get someone, then disappeared.  Finally, someone who looked a bit managerial (different shirt) came and put his arms on the back of my parents chairs and was basically like ""what do you want?""  So we gave him our order, which he didn't write down, then he walked off.  Fortunately he got it all right, but he was pretty rude - was it because we'd asked a few times to be served?  He seemed pretty nice to everyone else.  We didn't really appreciate his attitude that made it seem like we were bothering him.Eventually, the food came out, and we forgot our annoyances about the service.  We started with the lamb chops (which EVERYONE here orders) which were wonderful, great smoky grilled flavor.  You get 4 in an order and we'd happily have eaten more.  Then we shared a chicken with spinach, a prawn dish, and dahl gosht (lamb with lentils).  Can't remember the names!  Also pilau rice, tandoori roti and garlic naan.  Everything was wonderful!  I loved the garlic naan, and my boyfriend was raving about the roti.  The prawn dish was the favorite, and know when they say it's spicy - it is!  The lamb was very juicy, and the dishes weren't too greasy, which is always appreciated when eating this type of food.Took about a million years to get the check.  I don't know - I'd give them four stars for the food, but the service is so, so crap.  They just rush you, don't walk you through the menu at all, and we were treated a bit rudely initially.  And I can't believe they told us not to bother booking when they knew they'd have a queue out the door!  That plus hardly being able to hear each other....I think next time I'll try another restaurant.

Do yourself a favour and get acquainted with the flavour!,1,1,1,,
829,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"I've been hanging out for great sub-continental food since arriving in London 5 months ago. Disappointed a couple of times by ventures on Brick Lane, but this was the best by far. They specialise in grilled meats from a tandoor oven so don't pass up on the lamb cutlets, chicken, seekh kebab or the different kinds of naan. The curried okra and dhal were so delicious and with a decent kick of spice. You can always cool down your taste buds with the mango lassi which was also a delight. Atmosphere is too hectic for my liking though. Crazy busy, noisy and crowded. But worth it",1,1,1,,
830,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"We had to try some Indian food while in London - it's better here than in India, right? That's what everyone says.After sifting through dozens of Indian places on the internet, we were stressed: they were all either too expensive (like ), too arrogant, or just too busy. Luckily, one of my friends stumbled upon this place ticked away in sketchy Whitechapel. It was a godsend. Somehow we got seated right away, but it was during the Olympics, so no one was in the city. Make reservations.It was fucking bloody delicious. I have no idea what we got, I let my Punjabi friend Dave do all of the ordering, and even he was impressed with the food. I think we tried 32 different types of Naan that evening. Kilos of lamb. I don't know, it was a blur. The best part (for an American in London) - the prices were very reasonable. Oh yea, BYOB. 3 points.",1,1,1,,
831,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Very very busy Indian restaurant with BYOB and a good party atmosphere. The place is huge and have a large amount of staff. Come here for cheap food and no corkage on you drink.The only downside was the confusion with orders and the  general disorganised staff- this could somewhat be excused by the volume of people in the restaurant. Food was standard Indian .Good location for a birthday or group night out but don't expect amazing food and service.",-1,1,1,,
832,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Excellent for grilled meats and curries. The garlic naan is delicious as well.Unfortunately, there is always a line for a table. But the restaurant is huge so I've never waited for more than 30 minutes",1,1,1,,
833,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"I came to Tayyabs on a Friday, and it was very busy. Quite a few people were waiting to be seated. I recommend a reservation if you are going during prime dining hours. The tables were very close together; so much so, that a waiter needed to pull the table out of it slot so that the patron could be seated.At the start, I was asked if I wanted Popadoms. I said yes and later found out that you are charged for Popadoms. It's an insignificant charge compared to the rest of the meal, but I'm not a fan of venues which are miserly.For dinner, I ordered Karahi Mutton Tikka Masala (for those unfamilar with Indian and Pakistani food, it is basically lamb chunks served in a skillet bowl with spices and a few veggies) with a Tandoori Naan. The Mutton and the Naan were delicious. Tayyabs also offered three sauces: white yogurt based, spice based, and sweet based; each was tasteful in its own way and added an element of versatility to the meal.",1,1,1,,
834,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Tayyabs is an institution, that's for sure. The food - especially the lamb chops - is still incredibly delicious, and there are still long lines out the door, but I've taken away a star as I think the service has gone downhill. Yes, no one ever went to Tayyabs for service and ambience (let's face it, it's the Indian restaurant equivalent of the sadly lamented Wong Kei), but, still, there are certain standards, such as offering tap water - not charging for it - and trying not to injure your customers. On the latter, try your very best to gauge the direction from which the food will be served, and sit away from there. On a recent visit, I had sizzling bowls of food thrust right past my ear onto the table, causing me to jump in the process. There wasn't even a ""careful, hot!"" warning which came with it. I finally managed to save myself by piling up bowls and cutlery on my side of the table so that there was no more available space. That's right - I threw another friend at the table under the bus in order to save myself. So what? I will say one thing about the waitstaff though. They have incredible memories. Our waiter took our order (a table of six) without writing anything down and headed off to the next table (a table of ten) and took their orders before going to the kitchen. Nothing went awry with our orders, and, I believe, the other table got all of their food as well. It was a pretty amazing feat.",1,-1,-1,,
835,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"Are the people offering reviews not locals? Who on earth would give Tayyab more than the 3 star ""ok"" rating?The restaurant is beautiful and clean, and the prices are decent. You could be going to a shadier looking place and pay the same (depending on the dishes). Waiters were nice, but service was slow and inattentive even though we were RIGHT NEXT TO the kitchen. The servers bring out parathas and dips/chutneys once you're seated. Fantastic!Mixed grill - not on the menu, but they'll offer a variety of the tikkas-- lamb, chicken,  shish kebob, etc. All of the grills were very delicious, and it all comes in a giant pile of greasy, oily meat. The shish kebob and the chicken were my favorite, but they really overcooked the lamb. Good flavoring... bad presentation and method. Chicken tikka masala - this is my favorite dish in any south asian restaurant (yeah yeah it's not ""authentic"" but that doesn't mean it's not crazy delicious!). There wasn't much curry. Flavoring was good but it left much to be desired. I'm stuffed but still want a curry...  (from somewhere else)Daal - Lentils and aubergine. Eh. Didn't care for it to be honest. It was rather dry.Naan - Best part of the meal honestly. Soft, fluffy naan. I tried the plain, garlic, and paretha (?). The garlic one tasted like nothing. It just plain naan with some coriander sprinkled over it. The peshwari naan must've had crack. It was DELICIOUS. Tasted more like dessert (fruit and coconut-y in the inside). Nothing crazy fancy but the naan was fantastic. My biggest issue was how greasy it all was. The naan was dripping with (and had piles of) butter and oil. Yikes. I get that you're supposed to brush the naan with the butter but I don't want my bread with pools of grease, thanks.Mango lasso - YUM! Smooth, creamy, delicious. I wish it had more mango (and less yogurt) but it was fantastic and I had three glasses. Whoops. Order a pitcher if more than a handful of your table wants mango lassi.I really liked the place overall, but I'll probably head elsewhere for my curry cravings next time.",-1,-1,1,,

We waited for over 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order. Sauces and poppadoms were placed on our table without us ordering it. We ordered lamb gosht (spicy and decent), daal (bland), chicken biryani (flavorful and delicious), bhindi 'okra' (delicious) and plain naan (oily but tasty). We were underwhelmed by the serving size of the dishes and the quality. They were really busy at 4 pm on Sunday so maybe they were having an off day. Bottles of still water were placed on the table for å£2.50 each. We asked for tap water but our waiter said it's only served upstairs; it's strange that it's only served in a part of the restaurant even though it's the law. On the bill, they charged us for the poppadoms, which we didn't order or weren't asked if we wanted them. We addressed our concerns with the waiter and he wouldn't budge until the manager stepped in.

But don't let the large space fool you into thinking that seating will be a quick affair. We had a reservation and it is a good thing that we did because there was a line of people out of the door and inside, weaving around some of the tables. Fortunately we were not seated at any of those tables because that would have been rather annoying. Instead, we went downstairs into the bowels of Tayyabs where we were wedged in between two couples or maybe we were all at the same table - it was all that tight.We had the lamb chops to start with. This was a big mistake because the couple next to us had some kind of mixed grill thing, which had lamb chops AND other stuff. Fortunately, the lamb chops were delicious but I really wanted the other stuff too... I had the dried meat, which was awesome if unappetizing sounding and my friend had the lamb karahi. We also split a karahi bhindi, which was great. The rice was just OK but the naan bread was excellent.

But we said nothing.By close to our meal we realized we were not given a Garlic Naan. which was fine as we were full already. so we told the server not to bother about the Naan and asked for the bill.Our bill had an entry for Garlic Naan. No big deal, we asked our server to correct it as we already had told him about it before asking for the bill.Then the conversation went something like this:Server: But i did not charge for water.Us: The water was same one you serve to every table. The menu says nothing that water is not served without request (coming from  LA we know)Server: The water was mineral water. It costs 2.5 pounds on the menuUs: The bottle clearly says still water. It taste like tap water too.Server: And I did not charge for papadams either. For those of us not of South Asian heritage, you never charge for it unless it is asked as a menu item. Sure enough menu had no entry for it.At this point we asked to see somebody senior.in comes another man who parrots the lie that water was mineral even he admits we did not order it. i then ask him to ask any other guest drink water from identical bottles.He refuses, changes to a native tongue that i fully understand and asks haughtily ""what are you going to do, eh?""

At 7pm, you'll wait about 20 minutes. Far more after 7.30pm. As you wait, you'll smell the smoky, burned-ish, foods going by you.The neighborhood is sketchy, by American standards, but quite safe. Once you're seated, the waiter comes quickly to your table to get your order (remember: you pay 2 quid for the bottled water on your table, another 1.50 or so for pappadam - rather tacky, but given that the rest of the food is really cheap, ok to overlook).I had the lamb chops, the masala fish, butter naan, and chicken karahi. The lamb chops are delicious, although a touch greasy (almost worth patting them down with a paper towel); the masala fish, honestly, was overcooked and a little too firm to eat, with not a lot of flavor; the naan was excellent, soft and buttery; the chicken karahi was also delicately spiced, but not too spicy.Don't go here if you're looking for fiery Indian style food. It's more nuanced than that. You won't walk out of here with a perspiring forehead and a burning tongue, unless you ask for extra chilis or sauce (why!?).

You're certain you're going away from civilisation when you suddenly come across it! The seven of us sat and perished the unusually concise menu for an Indian restaurant. We'd all heard of apparently legendary lamb chops so three plates of these were ordered along with a wide variety of mains. The food arrived quickly and at boiling point and was very quickly devoured! It was delicious, flavourful, dynamic and most of all very satisfying without the inordinate fullness you can get from other Indian eateries.

872,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,Decent enough Indian food although it's always crowded and you'd generally be expected to wait in queues to get a table.  The lamb chops are a specialty and the lassi by the jugs a treat. Decently priced. Doesn't have an alcohol licence so they are generally  okay with you bringing your own alcohol.  Probably one of the more popular Indian restaurants in London.,-1,1,1,,

If you can't hear your companion, can't get up without moving the entire table, can't have a beer unless you bring it, or breathe due to the smoke....can you really rate it that high?How about this, it's a 4 if you get it to go and a 1 if you have to suffer in the restaurant.  By the way, the service was fairly lame too.",-1,-1,-1,,
874,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"2.5 stars, rounded down for the overall poor experience. (A few friends later told me that this place was a tourist trap).Unless you somehow find yourself in this far eastern part of Zone 1, I would not recommend making a special trip to eat here. This place was recommended by a friend's friend. We had made a booking for an early Saturday dinner, and after reading plenty of reviews, I was definitely expecting poor service, but thought that the delicious food at a reasonable price would outweigh the service. I was also fairly excited that you could BYO here. So Hubs and I decided to take the long Tube ride over to Aldgate East. When we arrived at the restaurant, there was a very long queue inside. We went to the employee who was standing at the front station to check in, but he told us that we had to talk to the man in the blue shirt, who was running all over the place seating people. After a few minutes of observation, we realized that we couldn't stand around and wait until he was free but rather had to chase this guy down. Hubs finally did, and he did seat us very quickly even though we were early for our booking.I wasn't expecting stellar service, but our server was curt and unwelcoming. He hardly acknowledged our existence. We ordered our food, and we made a mistake by asking if we could BYO. The server just said ""no"" and walked off. We didn't think that much of it, thinking that the restaurant probably recently stopped allowing BYO since they were so busy. So we just left our bottle of wine in the bag. Near the end of our meal, we spotted another couple seated next to us with a bottle of white wine on their table. At first I thought that maybe they had ordered it, but when we saw that our server dropped off 2 more water glasses and the wine opener for the customers to open the bottle themselves, we were peeved! Our server had the nerve to tell us no and then let this other couple BYO?! I know we didn't come here for the service, but at least treat your customers equally poorly? And apparently acting like a civilized human being in this place gets you NOWHERE.The food was good, but didn't knock my socks off or anything. I've had much better Indian food in San Diego. We shared 3 kebabs, the lamb chops, and a small karahi gosht (lamb). We only ordered 1 order of the garlic naan. We could have eaten another piece of naan, but since the complimentary chips were a good vehicle for dipping the sauces, we didn't. Our bill came out to around 20 euros, and we were full but not stuffed. I think we have a pretty high tolerance for poor service in exchange for delicious food that doesn't break the bank...that's how most authentic Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley in California are... but the extremely poor service really ruins a nice evening out.",-1,-1,-1,,
875,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Tayyabs is (to this culinarily uneducated person), perfect. A modest menu with a large number of options allows you to spend time chatting to the people you came with over that bottle of wine or beer you picked up en route (yes, it's exclusively bring your own).I've lost count of the number of times I've been here over the last 3 years, and never been disappointed by the portion sizes, quality and price.

I also had a chicken tikka saag dish that was appropriately spicy and really delicious.  I'm currently on a restrictive diet, so I didn't get to sample the pappadum and naan, but there were plenty on the table, and they looked fantastic.  The place was pretty busy for a weekday lunch, and I was told that by 4:30, it's packed with a line.

When I walked in and saw all the white folks dining and loads standing in a queue for a table I admit I was worried.  Could it be it got lots of write ups about how wonderful the cuisine was and that's why there were so many non-Indians?  Or was it going to be a huge let down?  We took the risk and waited patiently for our table.  Hmmm, I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.The server plopped down pappadums and three different chutneys on our table and asked if we wanted it. We said yes, of course!!!!  Little did I know that on the bill there was a charge for that.  That's pretty lame.  You don't set down something like crackers or bread on a table like that if it isn't free.  If I wanted to order it off the menu I would have!Besides that cheap tactic to make extra money I thought the saag aloo was good, chole (chickpeas) were too mushy, and the goat was pretty good.

The first give away of how good it was was the q that went on for miles. Since we had nothing else to do, we queued up. 90 Minutes later we were still standing, but at this point very curious. We were not disappointed. Though the place was jam packed, the staff never forgot about us and the food was delicious. The fact that its not full of white people flocking to try the famous east end curry houses was music to my ears. I would book in advance, but is definitely worth a go.",1,1,1,,

The bhindi (okra) was really delicious, the naan, yum, the lamb chops, I felt were a bit overrated here.  The flavor was great, but the meat wasn't as juicy as other places I've been to.  The sausages that come in the mixed sizzling plate of meat were delicious!!  That was actually the highlight of my meal there and that didn't show up in any of reviews whether yelp or otherwise.  Definitely make a reservation and expect to wait even so.  It's crowded, so don't expect a soothing dinner experience.  It's very popular and trendy (at least right now), and I'm not sure the food merits it THAT much, but I'm definitely glad that I went.  Their dishes were quite good and different from the usual curry and naan types of places (in the US or otherwise).  If you show up, be ready to wait in a loooong, crowded, and noisy line.  Some of the tables are right next to that line, and quite smushed together!  But, it was a fun experience nonetheless.  We got some sweets to go, too.  They are excellent!",1,1,1,,

Only one thing left to say: get the lamb.The location of this place is a little tricky - it is situated off of the main road in a somewhat difficult to find location. While the surroundings are not exactly the most bustling part of the city, the restaurant itself is quite busy most of the time. In fact the place is often very crowded - be prepared to be up close and personal with the people dining around you.However if you don't mind the coziness, then the rest of the experience will blow you away. While the service is nothing extraordinary, the prices are extremely cheap, which is a welcome sight for London diners on a budget like myself. The food was exceptional - everything we had was very good, although the lamb was far and above the best.A couple of caveats though: First, they don't serve alcohol so it's BYOB (which, frankly, I see as a plus). In case you forget this, when you get to Tayyab go out the door and turn right. Walk a fair distance and you will find yourself at a store that sells alcohol, on your right. Second, the line can be quite long so be ready to wait or plan ahead and send one of your more amicable friends to hold your place.",1,-1,1,,

The waiter seated us on a table we had to share with another couple even though there were plenty of free tables. When we asked if we could move to one of the free tables he just said that they are reserved for larger groups. It took another 10 min before we got the menu to order. Even though there are almost as many waiters as customers, the service is very slow. We then ordered some kebab and a curry. I don't understand anyone can rave about the food there. The kebab was dry and overcooked. The curry was ok, but really nothing special. It was a bit bland and the sauces have clearly been watered down. The only good thing was the mango lassi. The prices are also higher then you would expect for restaurant in this area and especially for this quality of food. Our overall bill came to 40 for a lunch for 2 with nothing fancy on the table. I wouldn't go there again and certainly cannot recommend it. Not sure who is giving all these 4 and 5 stars here.

The line, which we had not been expecting on a Wednesday night, put us off, but not before I realized how close I lived to Tayyabs and made myself a deal that I had to come back, even if I had to make up a reason (as if ""I'm hungry"" isn't a valid reason...).In April, I was in need of a great place for a group of friends to have dinner, and someone suggested Brick Lane. I mean, Brick Lane is cool, but come on: 195 reviews and a 4-star average? We're not going to Brick Lane; we're going to Tayaabs.For six people, we demolished four dishes with naan for about å£10 per person. We brought our own beer and wine, and only left because the table turnover is so frequent that a big party needed our table next. I hope they had as good of a meal as we did.

Lamb chops was one of the dishes on the table. That's all I know. You know what else I know? This place is LEGIT. Located in a not-so-glitzy part of London, it's a true gem that only locals know about. We dined with my pal Lizzie G and her lovely boyfriend Al -- man, I'm so glad she made reservations for us here. I was a little uneasy at first (Indian isn't a cuisine I gravitate to normally) but knew I was in good hands and to just trust Lizzie.Like Kathleen M says, it's hot as ever in here -- even on a relatively cool evening. Body odor wafted through the air, but (thankfully) the smell of curry mostly covered it up. Lizzie wasn't kidding; we left reeking of curry (in a good way) and sweating like whores in church.We were lucky enough to walk in with reservations just after 7pm, but by the time we were done the line was wrapping around the block. It's a rushed service too... they obviously don't want you lingering.So here are a few things I learned:1. Bring your own libations, and don't bother with anything but screwtop bottles2. Ask what's in the dishes and don't be afraid to order them3. Be prepared to take home food. Lots of it.4. Drink the fruit smoothie they give you to help with the spice.5.

That's simply poor for a chef's special.We also ordered the garlic naan as well as the keema naan and there are no complaints.  Very good naan.

The menu is big with plenty of naan, lassi, meat, rice, veggie options. When the waiter took our food and drinks order (for 12 people) and did not take any notes I started ohh no I see it coming it is going to be a disaster. But he surprisingly remembered it all. ImpressiveThe salty lassi was perfect - not too cold. And the chicken and veggies were tasty as well, not too spicy and on the big portion side. Maybe a bit too oily for my taste.The food is very good value for the prices. It is a busy place (book in advance) so it was hard sometimes to get the waiter's attentionFYI it is BYOBIn a nutshell: I don't often go to that part of London so I am not sure I will get the chance to go back but if anyone asks me for Indian/Pakistani recommendation I will make sure to mention Tayyabs!",1,1,1,,

This place did not disappoint. I ordered the Karahi Chicken, Naan and a Mango Lassi.  I also had a bite of my niece's dish - Rice with Lamb bits and everything was delicious!  But the stand out for me was the Mango Lassi.  It comes in a metal glass and was so flavorful and refreshing.  I'm still thinking about it.  The service here is also good.  The waitstaff were polite, answered all my questions and were efficient.  I will definitely come back to New Tayyabs when I visit England again.",1,1,1,,

917,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"I love Tayyabs - a deep love affair dating back over 10 years and over 50 visits. For me it was love at first smell - but reading through some of the other reviews I can understand why others may not have fallen under the Tayyabs spell. You need to be clear about what you are getting here and what you are not.....the foodthis is Punjabi food and the grill is where all the action is. Mixed grill on sizzling hot plates - the aroma cutting through the air - I love that smell - if they bottled it I would buy it. The lamb chops are the highlight (they really are the best of all the punjabi restaurants I have sampled) and the seekh kebabs suitably spicy. Mutton tikka, chicken tikka, chicken tandoori all are good. I have worked through most of the menu over the years and to be honest I only really order from the starters and breads these days. The curries are ok here but I have other favourite places if curry is what I am after. I seldom am. Seduced by the punjabi grill......a carnivores heaven.the atmosphereIts heaving with queues snaking through the restaurant and outside. Every night of the week. Its packed - tables are close, spread over three floors. Its loud, its hectic, its great fun...perfect for groups if you book ahead. Not somewhere for an intimate first date or romantic night.  We like the ground floor best and the round table next to the kitchen is our favourite if out with the kids. This is our go to family birthday restaurant - the kids are big fans of the chopsthe realityyou will wait to get in even if you have booked - bring some cans for the queue and just accept it...it helps if you know the managers (and we do now). You will be rushed through your meal if you let them - the food will be out quick - order your food in two batches if you want to linger a bit...once you have finished eating then they need that table and the hot towels will reach you before you have cleared the last bite from your plate. Its not somewhere to spend the night. IT is BYOB - no corkage charge - bring in whatever alcohol you want - there is no charge - makes this place a seriously cheap places for a night out.New Tesco Metro has opened at the end of the road - perfect for picking up alcohol.My favourites: lamb chops, seekh kebabs, masala fish, some tikka and a vegetable karahi (sometimes) plus lots of the delicious roti. Really good breads. How I love the great Tayyabs!",1,1,1,,
918,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"This restaurant is located 5-10 min. walk from west of Whitechapel underground station. Its easy to reach there anywhere from 4 zones via underground.Tayyabs serves almost authentic North Indian food (1 star removed for not being 100% authentic). I have visited Karim's in Old Delhi by Jama Masjid, which by far serves the most authentic North Indian food; Tayyabs is not quite there. I believe that the cooking method is similar but the spices are on the mild side.I had ordered Peshawari Naan (sweet stuffing inside and quite loaded with butter), Bhindi Gosht (Okra, mutton in spicy curry), Chicken Tikka and Sheesh Kabab. Peshawari Naan was interesting but too heavy (oily) for me. I would have just ordered regular Naan, which could have been more enjoyable with curry. Bhindi Gosht was really good but a bit on the mild side. Gosht was tender and cooked perfectly to absorb spices. I highly recommend this dish, which I believe is not offered at many other Indian restaurants. Chicken Tikka and Kabab were tender but again on the mild side. I would definitely go back to this place but ask to make everything spicier.",1,1,1,,

That is no exaggeration. The speed and friendliness of service was impecable and quite amazing for such a busy night.The bill at the end of the night was incredibly low, despite my wife and I being absolutely stuffed. We ordered:Chicken Tikka starterKarahi Chicken mainRiceGarlic NaanBaring in mind that isn't a lot of meals, we were both stuffed. Living in the US, it's so hard to find a good Indian, but when you come back home to this... it's all worth it. Mega Yum times.",1,1,1,,

Hands down, the food is great: it can be a little too greasy but it's manageable and I like it.However, in some hours the hassle is so big that you can't hear your companion properly over the table. The tables are uncomfortably close and overhearing a stranger's conversation is not what I've signed up for. I guess they just wanted to make use of the space but stuffing that much people so close to each other is not appropriate. If you don't mind that, you'll have some delicious Indian food.",1,-1,-1,,

I wouldn't mind that much were I in Lahore, but in London, paying London prices, you'd like a bit more consideration.Finally, one of the waiters once dropped some sauce from a plate onto my wife's coat. We played it cool, and tried to calm him down as he looked stressed. But despite insisting on giving us a discount, when we finally arrived at the cashier, who had heard of the story, no discount whatsoever. Being in a group, and desiring to get out asap we didn't make a fuss. And yet....I've been told to go off peak as it's a different atmosphere. I hope it makes me change my mind...",-1,-1,-1,,

The waiters were shouting at us to take our seats, and shouting at us to take our orders, and left me feeling like we were eating against the clock. As for the food, the Karahi Chicken was pleasant, generous with meat, and very inexpensive, but nothing to write home about, and the peshwari naan just tasted artificial. I'm really not sure where the hype has come from...",-1,-1,-1,,
927,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"This is my second review after my third visit to Tayyabs and unfortunately, still, I cannot understand why the hype continues.This time, the food was actually quite good. Nothing special, but fresh and tasty. My friend had the karahi fish tikka masala which was by far the best. The naan was also  good. For this, I'd come again.But the service.... we were served poppadoms and once the waiter had taken our mains order, it was served within LESS THAN 5 MINUTES! We hadn't even finished our poppadoms! Any plate we finished with was instantly removed from our table and hot towels were brought over the second I finished my food. Never mind that my friend was still eating!I couldn't help it and timed how long it would take for the couple, who sat down next to us, to be served their food after their order was taken. By that time the place was busier than when we ordered and still it only took 6:22 min for the mains to arrive and once again, they hadn't yet finished their poppadoms either.The service was so fast but really not so friendly that it impacted the experience as a whole. A shame.PS: For truly amazing Bangladeshi food, please try Chilliz on Brick Lane. Divine!",-1,-1,-1,,
928,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,I was in London visiting a friend and wanted to try some Indian food. This place is amazing. I ate to my heart's content. Indian food in the US just doesn't compare. Lamb chops are a must and the mango lassi is yum.,1,1,1,,
929,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,Fantastic restaurant. We went to a wedding celebration there a few years back. Great food. One of the best place for currys in London!,1,1,1,,
930,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"I had high expectations going in, but unfortunately was not wowed.  My main gripe with Tayyabs is that they really pack in their patrons - the tables are very small and very close together.  We were literally sitting with another couple (and the girl was extremely annoying).  And - probably a product of how busy it was - the service was just ok, for example it was hard to get the server's attention if we needed something, and it was hard to hear because it was so loud.That said, the food was good, though I wasn't a fan of the rice being a separate menu item (rather than being part of the entree).  Husband got the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala, while I got the Lamb Gosht.  My husband liked it, though he said he prefers Indian-style Tikka Masala.  My lamb was flavorful, lots of spices, and I also liked the way the rice was prepared (different than I've had before).  To compliment the meal, we ordered some Peshwari Nan, which had an interesting, sweet, buttery spread inside.All in all, an average experience.",-1,-1,1,,
931,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Cracking place, great food, BYOB. Only bad thing is that they keep the run rate of people so high that your reservation is rarely on time.... But it's worth it for the food. And so inexpensive for the amount of food too!",1,-1,1,,
932,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"My husband and I tried the food in Tayyab by take away. We ordered the famous lamb chops, saag aloo, seekh kebab, murgh chana and of course the favorite nan bread. Having had Indian food before, I knew it is going to be spicier than many can tolerate. I enjoyed the taste of the food but the husband did not as it was too spicy for his palate. Therefore I get to enjoy most of tayyabs cooking (yay!) all to myself. Though it was definitely flavourful the only fault I could point out is that the dishes were greasy and oily.Otherwise, I will continue to visit Tayyab to satisfy my Indian food craving but perhaps only once a year to prevent the plaque formation in my arteries.",1,1,1,,
933,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"Tayyabs, Tayyabs. You have pissed me off, royally.We organised a joint going away dinner as my friend and I are leaving our jobs for the bigger and better in the great beyond that is the corporate world...but I digress! Tayyabs was our choice of a restaurant and from the beginning of our visit, it was an unsettling experience!Tayyabs is PACKED. You need a reservation. What they don't tell you? All of your party NEEDS to be present in order for you to be seated. The attitude they give you immense - how DARE you show up to dinner with 99% of your party due to a friend being late? You have to wait in the limited seating area - with sticky floors beneath you - or outside, with heaps of trash (alluring aroma in the heat, let me tell you). Those are your choices. All this was fine - we kept quiet and waited for all our party to arrive and were seated. Everything about this experience was sub-part. I am not someone who believes you should accept shit service for good food. To be honest - Tayyabs didn't blow my mind in terms of cuisine. I have eaten in some of the best Indian restaurants in the country - hell, the world, and this didn't stack up enough that I would ignore rude comments, menus being shoved into my hand, having to beg for drinks or even any attention. Dinner was rushed - the menu is limited for vegetarians and the options are standard for Indian restaurants. The hygiene (or lack thereof) in the downstairs area of the restaurant kind of put you off eating there, but you keep quiet and eat - and the food isn't bad. I ate dinner with people who work in fine dining and they weren't pleased by anything and it's not because they are picky. It was almost as if I was asking for the world when I asked where our missing items were - everything was a bother. It reeked, the servers were rude and condescending, the food was so-so and the ambiance was non-existent. I'll skip Tayyabs - and the hassle - in the future.",-1,-1,-1,,
934,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"I really enjoyed the food but our service definitely left an odd taste in our mouth.We arrived early, as suggested to us by Londoners to ""avoid a queue""  We sat and were promptly greeted by a man who asked us for our order.  I chuckled at his style because as I was speaking dish after dish, he was not paying attention whatsoever, staring out the window and saying ""yes, yes"".  When I finished, however, he rattled off everything I had said and went to put it in.  Ok, that's was kind of funny, no problem there.My buddy ordered a coke, which finally arrived 35 minutes later.  We weren't exactly timing each minute but after half an hour of nothing, it became noticeable.The samosas were quite good, one meat and one veggie.  I preferred the yoghurt cilantro sauce to the other two.Our mains were the kahani chicken, saag meat and the urid dahl.  All three of these items were absolutely delicious.  They had lots of flavor, well balanced heat and were just great, great dishes.  The garlic naan was also absolutely awesome.Perhaps it's my perception of restaurant service coming from the US but typically, I'm not used to a place that acts like its customers don't exist.  Either way, the place was packed by the time we left and I think that is the most telling.",-1,1,1,,
935,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,The best Pakistani food in the world is in London and this is the best of the best. The flavors are subtle and yet linger on the tongue. The smells of the restaurant you will want to bottle and take home. The lamb is spicy and yet flavorful. The tandoori lamb chops are not to be missed. Naan with lamb is better than any pizza.,1,1,1,,
936,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"My brother insisted we came here as a break from our usual Brick Lane fare and for its reputation as one of the best curry houses in London. The punters seem to agree with that opinion as the place was packed out and we were lucky to get a table at 6PM on a Monday.The food was ok but not as good as the reputation suggested. My problem was that the place seemed like a production line, trying to move people out as quickly as possible. Our starters arrived and almost instantly the main course arrived leaving us with a crowded table. As a curry fan I just didn't get a great vibe from this place.",-1,-1,1,,
937,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"I'm a bit shocked I haven't reviewed this place yet. It ranks as one of the best Indian joints in London beating out Lahore Kebab House, Mirch Masala, and my newly discovered Simply Indian. As most people have said, the lamb chops are definitely a must have with tender meat, laden with spices, and grilled to provide that nice almost charred crust. You can't really go wrong with the usual slew of curries (I typically aim for a good lamb jalfrezi or vindaloo for my heat fix) and the garlic naan is buttery and crispy as it should be.Ordering is an exercise in efficiency but if you ask nicely they will provide some suggestions. Just make up your mind quickly as the waiters tend to get a bit impatient. I've never had a problem with being seated with the longest wait (for a group of 10) being 15 minutes but we've also never been later than 6.30pm.Added bonus is the BYO status which allows you to pop into the off license next door (that place must do killer business) and grab a couple bottles of wine or a crate of beer and plonk it down on the table without worrying about a corkage fee.Overall, its good tasty Indian food at a pretty cheap price and beats anything Brick Lane has to offer hands down. It also works wonders as a pre-night out dinner stop but make sure to grab some gum from the off license too as garlic and curry breath is rarely a winner with the ladies!",1,1,1,,

We ordered a lot of different options and once we were finally able to order the food actually came out pretty fast. The chana was ok, I asked for it spicy thank goodness because it helped add some flavor. The naan was also pretty good but everything else was horrible! The chicken tikka masala has absolutely no flavor and was super oily which was gross! Would not recommend this place to anyone And would never return.",-1,-1,-1,,

The spicy pompadum is my favourite style that my local Indian place in Boston had, and now I know where to find it in London...at twice the price.3) The waiter's memory. We had a group of 6, he didn't write anything down, and he recapped it all near-perfectly when we were all done ordering.The meh.1) Loud.2) The food just wasn't that great.3) The naan was particularly disappointing. oily and chewy.The bad.1) The card machines weren't working the day we came, so we  paid cash... and change (å£14) never came.

947,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT EAT ANY FOOD.However, I felt I should review the restaurant based on the experience that made me leave it before having a chance to order. Due to the nature of the food cooked there (in large metal pans, as seen in the pictures on yelp) it is a very smokey atmosphere. Add to that the fact that a lot of the spices associated with the cuisine are quite hot, and you have a recipe for disaster for anyone with asthma or breathing problems. While my friend and I tried to last it out, we both ended up having to ask to be relocated away from the cooking area. Our waiter told us we would have to talk to the manager, who came about ten minutes later. He said of course, and moved us around the corner. Unfortunately, it was still exceptionally smokey and we were both actively coughing. We told him this, and he tried to tell us we were wrong. So we pointed to the inches of smoke clinging to the ceiling. At this point, he offered us a table on the other side (one that we had originally asked for) but we felt put off by the whole experience, and the coughing, so we went back to a standby favorite on brick lane proper. As a second note, the table beside us also had to leave before they had eaten any food because the woman was allergic to onions. We heard their conversation with the manager (as the restaurant does put you in quite close quarters) and apparently, though the waiter had been informed, they were brought numerous dishes with onions, which they kept having to send back. At that point, no longer trusting that things would be cooked in an allergen-free way for customers with health issues, they chose to leave. All this being said, loads of people were there and seemed to be enjoying themselves and the food. Also, the dessert bar looks fantastic. BUT if you have asthma or food allergies, maybe you should reconsider.",-1,-1,-1,,

Curries were great too.  The mango lhasi was to die for.  Be warned, no alcohol is sold on the premises.  The restaurant, however, allows you to bring your own alcohol and will charge no corkage fee. Very well priced (15 pounds per person, ate till we dropped).  While it is a bit out of the way, it is WELL worth the trek.  Do not forget to book a table. We went on a Wednesday and there was not a SINGLE seat available so make sure to book well in advance or be prepared to wait.  Also, be patient, as the place is so full that you will wait a bit for some of your dishes.Last wort of advice, do not miss the lamb chops. Wow. Simply wow.",1,1,1,,

To be fair this is Pakistani owned so it's not true indian food to start with. Honestly I am baffled by the reviews raving about this place. I will never come here again. I brought my Indian Husband and his cousin and his girlfriend here and they said it was bad too! Honestly Do not waste your time here, there are plenty of better indian restaurants in London. This is one of those places where the reviews are misleading and disappointing.  I also had the lamb chops and they where just ok nothing amazing.

My buddy was feeling a little more than peckish, so we walked done whitechapel to have a bite.We got in without any issue, but the place was far from empty.  First off, this place is so clean.  Despite being a busy place, trying to fit as many bodies in as possible, the bathrooms were sparkling and we weren't forced to sit on the laps of our dining neighbours.We ordered the paneer tika, okra, and lamb chops.  We split a jug of mango lassi.  All for å£21!  The paneer was, well, lovely.  Fresh soft, but with form.  The stewed okra was spicy and was not over cooked. It was reminiscent of a Nigeria dish, but the hot spicy was nicely balanced with the fresh tomatoes and lemon.  But lets not forget the reason we all go to Tayyabs, the lamb chops.  So good, I picked them up like a cavewoman and nom nom nomed.Why not a 5? Lamb chops should be serve medium rare or rare, these were well-done.  I think I read it in a religous text once...",1,1,1,,

954,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"We had Pre-Booked a large table on a Friday night and greatly welcomed. This place was one of the first restaurants I went to in London before I actually moved down and since I have been here I just keep coming back. The food is next level. So flavoursome and even better ridiculously cheap for what you get. The menu is quite small but I believe that's were the trick is. Because of the small menu everything is cooked to perfection. All the curries are medium spiced, so if you need something mild it might not be great but anyone that likes a bit of a kick you'll love it. It is also BYOB which is great if you are trying to save pennies. The total bill for 8 of us, including lots of starters, breads, rice and curries came to just over å£100, insane! Normally they are extremely busy but on this occasion we were not rushed out by the staff. To avoid disappointment or a huge queue always make sure you book. (Visit - 13/02/2015 Dinner)",1,1,1,,
955,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"A visit to Tayyabs is a rare occasion despite it being a stone throw from my apartment in East London. This is largely due to the consistent and everlasting que that instantly prompts me to venture further along. While this definite sign of popularity is a bonus to the reputation of the business I do not enjoy waiting in a long que through a crowed and smokey environment only to be let down by bad service and sheer irritation of having to shout at my guests over the cramped and chaotic atmosphere.While I am sure Tayyabs reputation was warranted at some point in its thirty years of trading I feel that these days it is merely riding the wave of its past splendour. While the food is mediocre, I tried the Tikka chicken, Saag aloo and Briyani, it is the immensely poor service that really lets it down.The venue does not have a licence you are welcome to bring along your own tipple.",-1,-1,-1,,

Yes, you will likely have to wait for a table in a long line, yes you will rub shoulders with your neighbours, and yes you will almost certainly smell like curry for days afterwards. No, you wont have intimate privacy at your table and no, they won't encourage you to linger for hours over your dinner, staring adoringly into your date's eyes and nursing a bottle of BYOB vino. But damn, the food is really, really tasty. If you go early to beat the crowds and are prepared to deal with the noise and the hustling waiters, you will reap the rewards of hot, spicy, perfectly seasoned Pakistani dishes that leave you wanting more even though you're too full to contemplate another mouthful.  The biggest downsides: 1)  it's a trek to get to Whitechapel, and 2) Tayyabs has ruined me for a lot of lesser Indian and Pakistani places throughout London which I would have otherwise naively enjoyed.",1,1,1,,

We congregated outside the restaurant around 5, and it still was a 15 minute wait (granted there were 8 of us). The papadums were fresh and crispy and tasted like home... The dipping sauces were not too sweet nor sour nor spicy. Yum! I have to say, the place doesn't disappoint. Everything from the Chicken Tandoori (which is the most moist I've ever tasted Tandoori to be - even compared to some of the places in Singapore) to the famous Lamb Chops... The only thing that was a bit off the mark was the Chana Masala... But otherwise, everything I mean everything was good. Also - CHEAP. We stuffed with naan, rice and lots of curry and grilled meats all for a measly å£12 a person. Unbelievable. Will I go back? YES!

The mango lassi had the most amazing ratio of yogurt and mango. Too good for words.We had okra, chicken, and lamb curry. Out of the three, I'd actually rank the okra one the best tasting because of the complex mish-mash of flavors. The lamb was lamb-tastic. Pure lamb flavor within the curry sauce.

Yes, the area looks very dodgy but it's still safer than many US cities. Just use your commonsense and caution. The strange looking people live at the Sally Army Booth House hence their presence.    For those not in the know, the foundry was where the US Liberty bell (currently in a museum in Philadelphia, US) was cast. But let skip to what Tayyabs is all about. It serves fantastic and fresh Pakistani food! However everyone knows how good it is. So I went a weekday to avoid the crowds and it was still very busy. So be warned first. However back to the food. Certain days have their specialities. I enjoyed two sticks of spicy minced lamb with a large side salad followed on by mondays special of slow cooked Nihari lamb. Two rotis mopped up the juices. It came to just 10 squid ahead!    While in the area take a look at the entrance to the Mosque on the whitechapel road.

Service isn't bad just very hectic so be prepared and don't be shy to order or grab the attention of the waiter. On a side note, they don't have license to sell alcohol, which works in their favour.

They don't have to give you great service. They can and will make you wait or seat you by the door. They really don't have produce great food. Because night after night, this place will be full and turning customers away.Your experience here will depend on the following;1. What time you arrive. Get here earlier to avoid queues and get something resembling decent service2. Where you're sat. If it's anywhere near the door then you'll be absorbed into the scrum of people trying to get in. If it's in one of the back rooms then you'll be out the way in relative peace.3. How much you drink (directly related to 1. above). The queue itself is a destination. People will be drinking their BYO alcohol whilst waiting to get a table. The longer you wait, the more you drink before your food. After 5 beers in the queue the food is going to taste just like a Sainsbury microwave curry, isn't it?4. How stressed the staff are. This also related to No 1 above. Get here early, or late, and you'll find your staff are happy to serve you. Between 7.30 and 10.30 they're robots screaming into walkie-talkies and throwing a plate of naan breads at you.I used to love Tayyabs. I've had a few great nights here.

Thousands of restaurants in London and she & her friends were there the same time me & my friends were!They're known for their lamb chops, which was good, but a little overdone for my taste. I prefer mine medium-rare and these were more like medium-wellHowever, the tandoori chicken ROCKED. And i seroiusly mean that.  Very juicy, flavorful, slightly spicy and just amazing. I could have eaten that dish forever. I'm always cautious with tandoori dishes coz they're more often than not...overcooked. Not these ones!I had the Shrimp curry dish which was a tad too salty. My friend had the Bindhi (lamb) Okra curry and that was very flavorful  We ordered 2 Tandoori Pratha...my fave. Naans are too thick and bready for me. Prathas are definitely the way to go!Mango lassi was good too. Reservations HIGHLY recommended. We came on a Monday night and there was a line out the door AND inside the restaurant (it was like club nite there)It's a tad more exp than other Indian/Pakistani places, but i thought it was OK. Also....for tourists/visitors/ Londoners who don't venture in ethnic neighborhoods....well, this place is in Whitechapel...it's a tad sketchy..which freaked out my friend who now lives in London but was from Hawaii. But really...if you've ever ventured into the Tenderloin in SF for amazing, cheap food...then this is just another Friday night for ya.  Definitely recommend (recommendation came from Londoner friend/ Yelper Jeremy H)",1,1,1,,

I recommend making reservations (if there are 4 or more of you) or going VERY early.  The queue is a little crazy.  Also note that making reservations doesn't mean you will avoid the wait entirely during peak times, it'll just speed things up a bit.-no license, so come prepared if you want a drink.  there's a convenient tesco on the walk from the tube station.",1,1,1,,

I agree with another reviewer that this place looks more like a nightclub when you first arrive with blue neon lighting outside and crowds of people waiting around.   I wasn't really expecting to see this after a 10 minute walk though the backstreets of whitechapel.We squeezed inside and were invited to join the end of a long queue, however we were seated after 10 minutes when a small table for 2 opened up.   I realized the place is BYOB after sitting down and immediately noticed groups of people in the queue drinking wine/beers/cider straight from the bottle.  This is definitely not your standard Indian restaurant and seems like a large party was about to break out at any moment.   If you after a quiet night i would avoid this place... that is unless you don't mind lots of lots of noise, waiter squeezing past the queue carrying various plates of food over your head and people knocking your jacket from the back of your chair multiple times.  The wife got the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala, however, i blindly asked the waiter to recommend something that was very spicy like a Vindaloo.  This turned out to be a huge mistake and i quickly had food envy whilst seeing the waiter deliver plates of sizzling lamb chops to satisfied looking customers all around the restaurant.  This appears to be their specialty!  Damn i should spent more time reading the yelp reviews beforehand.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was very good whilst my Vindaloo inspired dish was just OK but this is not what they specialise in.We were surprised, upon receiving our bill, however,  when the total came to just over å£20 for the 2 of us including mains, rice, naan and sparkling water.  Combined with the bottle of wine from Tesco, this was the cheapest dinner i can remember having in London.On another note, the service was a little sketchy and it was obvious this place was focused in turning around tables, more than providing a fanatic dining experience.  It was hard to communicate with our waiter to get recommendations on what to order, we asked for 1 bottle of sparkling water and he seemed annoyed when we asked to send the 2nd bottle back, my main arrived and we had to remind him after 10 minutes that he forgot to deliver my wife's dish (appeared he forgot to tell kitchen), at this point i sent back my spicy dish as there was no spice.  Finally when the check came our waiter told us we had to pay cash, then after we didn't have enough to cover the bill, he said that we only need to pay the tip in cash.  however, in the confusion he put a å£5 tip on the card terminal and when we asked him how much our bill was he seemed to get our bill confused with another table.  So we left another cash tip in the confusion.... Anyhow, at these prices you have to left allot of this drama slide.",1,-1,-1,,
984,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"So another first for me on this move to London! Tayyabs was quite an experience. I've learned to leave my preconceived notions back at home, so I went with no expectations other than be prepared to wait. This place is a family owned restaurant since 1972 and its reputation follows. Whether it is a good or bad reputation, it has it a reputation because of all the years in business.As a first timer I thought the food was decent, but not great! The king prawn shrimp and masala fish were both overcooked, but the spices were good. We also had the Kema naan which was excellent. And the chick peas dish was also very good!The Mango Lasi was also delish and very helpful to ward off the spice. As I said before, if you go with the understanding of the following list, you'll enjoy the experience. -there's a long wait-the restaurant is a production line so get ready to get in and out once you've sat  down-bring your own alcoholic drinks and openers so you don't have hunt down the servers-servers are not too attentive because they're running around taking orders",-1,1,1,,

The service is brisk but friendly, and gets extremely busy so be prepared to queue.  Tayyabs is a BYO so you can take your favourite bottle of wine or rum! what more could you ask for. We take all our friends and family here and once you have tried it I'm sure you will too.",1,1,1,,
988,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"I ate in this restaurant this past Saturday night after it being hyped to death by friends of the lady I was taking out.  Everyone raves about this place like it's the greatest restaurant in the World...I must be missing something?  We arrived 30 minutes before the time of our booking, seeing a huge mass of people standing outside just right of the restaurant door I said to my date ""lets have a couple of drinks in this bar before we head in"".  It wasn't a bar...it was a que of people for the restaurant.  We walked inside and busy is not the word...if a fire marshall witnessed this the restaurant would have been closed down for the night.  Walking inside I felt I had gone back in time to 14/4/89 to the Hillsborough football stadium.  We were pinned up against a wall for an hour...30 minutes past our booking time. When we did finally get seated it was at a table in the walk way, so for the duration of the meal I had to lean forward slightly as there was a crowed of people standing in line behind me, having to make way for the serving staff.Service was fast and to the point, I have no complaint with this.  Food came quickly, but was piping hot and fresh.  Again, no complaint here.  Taste was good, but no better than any other Indian I've been to, it simply was nothing special.  Price is on par with any other Indian restaurant, about å£35 for 2 people.I thought it strange all night that everyone in the que was drinking cans of beer.  It was only when I sat down I noticed there is no drinks license so it is bring your own alcohol.  I do not want to bring my own alcohol anywhere.  A night out for me is relax, order a few at the bar, not stop off at an off license before the venue.  On reflection now, EVERYONE in the restaurant was drunk.IMO the restaurant gets this busy and has this much hype because a. it is cheap and b. you can bring your own alcohol.  So it's just being used by people on a night out as a feeding and drinking ground.  Definitely not suitable as a quiet, romantic evening.Nothing special, far too chaotic, would not visit again.  DOES NOT DESERVE THE 5 STAR RATINGS IT IS GETTING.",-1,-1,-1,,
989,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Walk straight past Brick Lane, do not be tempted by the mediocre and overestimated offerings there, and head straight to Tayyab for hands down the best Pakistani food in London.Make a reservation because some nights the line stretches down the street but even if you have to queue the wait is worth every second. You can either think of the restaurant as crowded and noisy or convivial and full of life as I did but, whatever, the food is worth it.We had a busy table jammed with so many dishes it was hard to work out exactly what I ate but nothing disappointed and I do vividly remember some outstanding spiced lamb chops that I woke up thinking about the next morning.The prices won't break the bank, especially  as it is BYOB, you will have a delicious meal and a lot of fun.",1,1,1,,
990,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"I think I must be missing something here. Tayyabs seems to be about the most hyped curry place but, as far as I can see, it deserves nothing of the sort.Firstly we had to wait for half an hour to  be seated. You are made to wait in the restaurant in a long line. This would be fine if there was actually any space but you have to put up with waiters constantly barging into you as they try to serve those already seated. I'm not averse to waiting but it better be for something special. When it was finally our turn we were shown to seats that hadn't been properly reset.Poppadoms and chutneys came straight away after we sat. These were a trio of a spicy chutney, a yoghurt dip and mango chutney. The poppadoms were good but the chutneys were questionable. The mango chutney was very watery, and lacked a bit of flavour. The yoghurt dip had a very slight taste of gone off yoghurt, a little bit sourer than is pleasant.The menu at Tayyabs is small. Generally this is a good thing in my opinion. I would much rather a place does a few great dishes rather than loads of average ones. Unfortunately they couldn't even manage that. The caramelised onion in at least one of the dishes we ordered would probably be more aptly described as carbonised. The mutton curry was tough - it just plainly hadn't been cooking long enough.Worse than the errors in the food were the wait staff. They would walk past and seemingly shout at us ""Service good?"" without making eye contact or waiting for a response. They were also desperate for us to hurry up and finish eating, having to be sent away 3 times as they tried to clear our plates before we had finished. I understand that they're busy and need to turn the tables over but we weren't being particularly slow and had in fact arrived after our neighbours.I really don't get what Tayyabs offers above any other curry place. I can't really think of any redeeming feature, other than the price of about å£15 a head.",-1,-1,-1,,
991,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"The food is absolutely delicious. Well, some dishes, like the lamb chop, tandoori chicken, keema naan or mango lassi are out of the world. Others are okay. They are always very crowded, and queues can be over an hour, so I recommend doing an online booking. We did just a few hours before our dinner and was still able to cut the long lines.",1,1,1,,

993,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"I had one of the saddest moments of my life here, but followed by a very happy moment when I returned only a week after...The first time I came here, I did so in response to my handy dandy Frommer's Free and Dirt Cheap London guidebook (which I try to read in secrecy as not to draw attention to the fact that I am new to the city). Unfortunately, I had just gotten sick and my nose was so stuffed up that I could only breathe threw my mouth. I know smell has a lot to do with taste, but I have never experienced a complete lack of taste due to a stuffy nose until that day. Needless to say, as a foodie, this may have been the most depressing day of my life. I sat there, watching my friend gobbling up the lamb chops and curry, as I slowly chewed on what I could only know and feel to be meat - but could not even taste AT ALL. I think I almost cried. BUT *light shines* I had the pleasure of returning just a week later when my nose was all cleared of mucus...when I practically devoured my food! Making up for lost times, gnawing off any spec of meat on the bone. If you enjoy lamb, I would say the lamb chops are a must. It comes out on a sizzling hot iron plate and makes your eyes bulge as they follow the plate to another table...you think, ""Whatever that is, i'm gettin' it."" The curries are also yum and the 3 sauces on the table are DELISH.Anyways, Thanks Tayyabs for showing me just how truly important the taste of food is!",1,1,-1,,

My friends and I just get a beer for the queue and wait it out, totally worth it!My favourite Indian/Pakistani place in London, it's just OTT flavour but all the best for it.",1,1,1,,

With all the reviews I heard I was expecting to be impressed. The food wasn't that great, way too overrated. Tandoori lacked much flavor and the lamb I had was just ok - nothing special. The biggest contribution to the low score was the service. The waitstaff are rude. They put popadoms on our table, along with a salad. Little did they tell us they charged us for the popadoms. When we told them that we didn't order it, they said they asked us if we wanted popadoms, and they put it on our table. Here's the thing: the never asked us if we wanted popadoms. Even if we said yes, we would have assumed it was complimentary, as bread usually is at most restaurants. Instead they got rude with us, got into a fight with us over 3 pounds and left us with a bad taste in our mouth about the restaurant. We ultimately paid, but I would not recommend this place to anyone, ever.",-1,-1,-1,,

My friends and I were a group of 15 for dinner one evening, and the staff were friendly and got our entire order correct and delivered quickly. The paneer tikka was amazing, as was the fact that Tayyabs is BYOB! Excellent prices as well.My only complaint--while the spices and flavours of the lamb chops were amazing, 3 of the 4 chops that I received were incredibly fatty, to the point where I got only 2-3 good-sized, non-chewy/fatty bites off of each piece. But again, I guess the fact that you're paying such low prices means that the quality has to take a hit somewhere!",1,1,1,,

BYOB makes time go faster and it's SO DELICIOUS and SO CHEAP. DÌ©cor: It's dark and it's busy. That line through the restaurant is quite annoying- both for it's length and for it's presence.Service: They're fast, I admit it and they got everything right!Food: Okay, where do I begin???- The free pompadams were good too. Spicy with a kick and it was great fun putting on all the dips! Especially the Mango Chutney: We asked for 3 refills. Yes, THREE. It was so good on literally everything!!!- Peshwari Naan- big, fluffy. Don't underestimate how full this makes you. I wanted to try this one as it was different from what I usually get. It was sweet and stuff, but with all the curries and stuff that we had, I actually prefer plain or garlic naan just to match it up.- Chicken Curry- Man, I really wish I remembered which one I ordered. But I can guarantee you it doesn't matter which one you order. It will be good.- Lamb chops- we got this to share and in my opinion, they're a bit smaller than I expected. It's still good, but maybe it's the American in me that I want/expect everything to be bigger?- Mango Lassi- GET IT WHEN YOU GO. BEST LASSI I HAVE EVER EVER HAD!!! Oh, my mouth is drooling as I think about it. Creamy, not too thick and PERFECT with your meal. Get a jug and share--for the four of us, we didn't think it would be enough but it was a perfect amount especially since we were so full from our actual food anyway.Bottom Line: The wait is obnoxious and it is overhyped. But man, I cannot deny how CHEAP and how DELICIOUS and FUN this place was. BYOB is a brilliant idea and it just about makes up for it. Though make reservations when you can!!!!!",1,1,1,,

Maybe that's my fault for having very high expectations.The service was pretty poor - rushed and rude. They clearly wanted our table asap and it showed.In terms of value for money, I'd say it's decent but not amazing. The main reason it seems cheap is because it's BYOB.

Food comes quickly too, although not sure if that is a good or a bad thing! In terms of dishes, there are limited choices, and no beef or pork, so its between chicken, prawns, lamb, and veggies. I can recommend the lamb chop, which turned out to be like spare ribs instead, but still very tasty! The curries are oily as most indian/pakistani places are, but the meat is very tender and its all very tasty. Oh and btw, the restaurant is BYO for free, so you can save alot on drinks by bringing your own!

Our group was 8 people, and we ordered: 4 Lamb Chop and 4 Kebab appetizers for the table, 2 pitchers of Mango Lassi, 6 Large entrees from Karahi Gosht (lamb - one of the best things on the menu!) to Dry Lamb to Chicken Tikka Masala, 3 plates of Pilau rice, and lots of Nan for a grand total of å£145.  Go ahead and do that math.Things you must eat there:-Lamb Chops-Dry Lamb-Karahi Gosht or Karahi Dhal Gosht (Curried Lamb)-Allo Gosht - (a mixed curried meat and potatoes thing)-Karahi Bindi (Curried Pumpkin - don't laugh, its amazing)-Mango Lassi-NanThe last thing to note is that Tayyabs is BYOB, so if you want to drink (which you should, beer is great with curried food), bring it with you.  There are several grocery stores and off-licenses conveniently located nearby.As Lizzie said, New Tayyabs might be chaos, but it is delicious - and inexpensive! - chaos.",1,1,1,,
1003,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Admittedly, a large part of the reason that I made a stop in London while on my European vacay was for some good Indian food. Sure, seeing Lizzie G and Miriam W would be highlights, but in my eye it was all about the Indian eats. The line at New Tayyabs wraps around the already cramped restaurant, ramping up the temperature indoors. Seriously, it was hot as Hades in here. And that's spoken by an Atlantan who's used to heat. It's hot. Wear as little clothing as possible during the summer, especially if you want to try their spicier dishes.It didn't help that they were overwhelmed by the crowd and therefore slow on the water refills: it was seriously disgustingly hot in there, to the point I couldn't appreciate my food to the level I knew I should.While the chicken tikka masala looked unlike any other version of the dish I had ever had, it was definitely delicious, as were the other foods I took advantage of that night. I didn't have anything that steered me the wrong way, and I left New Tayyabs fully aware of what London had to offer, and wanting more.",1,1,1,,

I tried the lamb chops, dry meat (which despite the awful name is not dry at all), succulent shish kebabs, and a pumpkin side dish.  Everything was truly outstanding!

1013,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"Tayyab is an Pakistani/Indian restaurant in East London near the Whitechapel tube station. Having previously lived in London, I always make a special point to come back to Tayyab when I am in town. Tayyab is by far the best Pakistani/Indian food I have had and comes with a very only-locals-know-about-this-place vibe. Tayyab is BYOB (there are numerous Off-License stores along the walk from the Whitechapel station) and unless you call and make reservations the day before or early the day of, you will likely have to cue for a table (reservations are highly recommended). Poppadums with the three classic mango, mint, and chutney sauces begin the meal. The chicken tikka for an appetizer is wonderful and served on the hot plate with peppers and onions. The main dishes are all great (thought not diet friendly given the amount of oil used to prepare them), though I would recommend anything with lamb in it. Make sure to get a homemade naan to accompany the sauces of the main dishes. While I typically do not get dessert, there is a counter on the way out that has the classic desserts of the region.The prices are one of the key sellers of this place. Appetizers like chicken tikka are around å£3.50, mains are around å£7-12, and sides like rice and naan around å£2.50-3. Even at my most hungry times, an appetizer, main, and one order of naan are overfilling. A full meal can easily be under å£15 each. Just remember to pick up wine and beer on the way to the restaurant. The atmosphere has changed considerably from when I first came to Tayyab years ago. In the past, small rooms to the left and right of the entrance on the ground floor were the only spaces available for dinner. Now, a full upstairs is also available. The decor has also become significantly nicer. Unfortunately, this means a large number of diners are eating simultaneously, meaning that service is slower and sometimes inaccurate. While the staff always try to correct the errors, it is challenging to gain their attention most of the time (we had to get up a few times to grab a bottle opener or waiter for more water). The atmosphere of years ago had better service, but the quality of the food still outweighs the poorer service to keep me coming back.The dining atmosphere is quite packed and it can become difficult to hear your companions if not sitting close to one another (this is a side-effect of the upstairs expansion as well). If you are looking for a quiet or romantic location, this is probably not the place to meet. However, if you are looking for an informal, reasonable, and authentic Pakistani/Indian restaurant, Tayyab is a perfect choice.",1,1,1,,

The restaurant is Halal meaning they do not serve alcohol, but why would you want alcohol when they have mango lassi? Service leaves a lot to be desired, as does the immense waiting time to get a seat (there is regularly a queue stretching outside the building). The food is worth the wait if you've never been there before and the prices are excellent, but it's not the sort of place you can go to if you're hungry and want to eat something quickly.

1032,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"I'm going to stuff my little greedy face with as much Indian food as I possibly can, and I want to do it here. New Tayyabs for atmosphere and tasty meat gets a stonking 5 stars. Queues out the door, people drooling over your shoulder as they wait for you to finish so it's then their turn to eat, curry in still simmering metal pans hovering over your head, waiters ordering though ""action man"" style radios, New Tayyabs is chaos. But in a fabulous way. I love curry, I have a set few dishes that I like, ""westerners curry"" as my Asian friends will call it but here you are pushed to try something new. Tip 1: Ask what's on the menu, find out what is in each dish and order a selection for the table.This place is BYOB so make sure you bring your own lubrication. You'll also have to wait about 40 minutes for a table even if you have booked it, prepare fr that and you won't be disappointed. Tip 2: Slip a tenner in someone's hand and I'm sure this wait will get shorter, remain polite and patient. The food is totally worth waiting for.You will leave stinking of curry, this is normal. If you haven't split it down your front it's a sign that you didn't make the most out of the night. Tip 3: Have dessert! Yes I know you are full but you really need to sample the amazingness that is the sweet treats here. I want to swim in the food here, not in a pretty way. In a dirty cover me in food I'm a glutton way. I left here and my head was spinning from the wine and my lips tingling from the spice. I can't wait to go back!",1,1,1,,

1034,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,2,"I have to say, I was not impressed.From the moment I walked in and was nearly knocked over in the chock-a-block reception area by some completely oblivious Australian's messenger bag  as he shoved me into a mass of people in order to get through with his off-license carton of Fosters, I knew there was NO way New Tayyabs could possibly live up to this hype.And I was right.Half of our party sat down at our table while the other half was left standing, waiting on the previous diners to eat their dessert.  Strike one.The service was abrupt and not at all friendly, which, I have to say, I kind of liked, especially when the servers shouted on their walkie-talkies (""I need a naan here at table niner"") and shoved through the masses of queueing patrons with poppadoms and chutneys without so much as an apology.The menu was very meat-tastic, and although there were vegetarian options, I have it on good authority that they're just not the main event.  Perhaps this is why I'm underwhelmed by New Tayyabs and you can thusly ignore my review and opinion.  You see, I got a pumpkin curry, and it was simply mediocre and contained too much ghee for my liking.  But, also, the naan was a bit deflated and boring.  The pilau rice was nothing special.  Strike two.  (The tandooried fish starter, that I tasted, however, was excellent.)  But, barring the unimpressive food, the huge queues and the fact that you will dine with an audience of hungry would-be diners hovering over your shoulder (literally), my lasting impression of this place was the way it made me smell.  My entire being wreaked of curry house.  When I woke up today, my coat smelled so much of stale, nauseating curry that it transferred onto my clean cardigan during my morning commute, so I had to face my entire workday wallowing in curry shame, subjecting my colleagues, too, to the stench.I've taken two showers since yesterday.  I can still smell the curry.Oh god, please make it go away...(Also, no chocolate with the bill?  WTF kind of Indian restaurant is this?)",-1,-1,-1,,

Great value for money also at Ìâå£14 for 2 main courses, rice and nan bread.

(thank you for that). Amazing. We started with veg samosa and moved on to chicken tikka masala, kahari chicken keema, lamb kahari and Chana masala ( which might have been the best dish) rice and garlic naan. We ended the meal with a kulfi (which I've never had before - think of it as a spice-busting popsicle)Full bellies.

Near on one hundred (it seems like it) people cram into the already fully sat establishment aching for a seat, just anywhere they can be handed a menu so the delve into arguably London's best Indian food can begin. It doesn't matter whether you have a reservation or not, you are going to have to wait if you come here in the evening, the place is packed to the rafters.We did have a reservation, and the waiter took us to our table (after waiting) where some of the seats were still taken be a small group finishing their desserts. He duly told is in a loud enough voice for those sitting to hear, that this table was ours once these people got up. Talk about pressure. 10mins later they were gone and we had our table. The calamitous nature of trying to get seated is an experience in itself. The queue never ceased at any point of our two hour stay.Now we were to the reason that this place is the most popular restaurant in the area, if not London. The food is absolutely sensational. The meat samosa's were stuff of legend. The peshwari nan was impeccable and the lamb chops... OH MY GOD - heavenly! I ate and ate, till I thought my inners would spill'th out. Yet I would not stop. I ate fish, mince, curry, rice, weird brown cake that looked like poo, but tasted like a small moist parcel of love. I drank fluffy mango lassi and water from the never empty jugs.If Jesus wanted to remake The Last Supper I'd take him to New Tayyabs. Non of that water to wine nonsense, this is BYOB. Tayyabs is affordable, the experience and atmosphere is something to remember and the food is sexy incarnate.  If you haven't eaten here yet, set a day, put it in your diary and go.",1,1,1,,

We were in a rush, they'd thrown us at the end of a very chaotic line, and no one had acknowledged our presence for over half an hour. Then they fed us, and somehow that one star multiplied into five.The restaurant is located on the street behind Whitechapel. It has a modern, bar-like feel to it that actually exceeded my expectations for the decor. The place is kind of like a madhouse, with the line winding around tables and waiters dashing all over the place, but the food was so good that I didn't even care that the door swung in my face every time someone opened it and waiters kept bumping into me every time they passed behind me.After the excruciating wait, everything went pretty smoothly. We ordered meat samosas, lamb chops, kahari chicken keema, rice, garlic naan, and mango lassi. All of it was amazing. Sure, it was greasy and the portions weren't that big, but the dishes were reasonably priced, well-spiced, and incredibly filling. The service was quick and, contrary to my expectations, surprisingly polite. I would absolutely come back here again.",1,1,1,,

Im vegetarian and would recommend the aubergine daal, saag aloo and peshwari naan. its BYOB, so the meal is always a bargin too. However, because its so good expect to queue outside the door for a table if you havent booked (and sometimes even if you have booked!) and the waiting staff are always pretty stressed so can be abit rude.

Once on a Friday lunch time, and then also on a Wed eve. I still cannot see what the fuss is about. The place was noisy as f%$K! I mean, I could not hear a thing anyone in my party was saying, but I could hear the random next to me screaming to his dining partner opposite. Friday lunch time was quieter, so if you are keen to go but want to hold a conversation, try a week lunch time instead.The waiters were friendly and accomodating, if not a bit distracted and distant!.The  food was so so, lamb chops were good, but have definitely had as good elsewhere (Delhi grill for example). BYO is always a winner. A  few things that let it down...I don't think it's good practice to place poppadoms, sauces & a salad down on the table without asking if it is wanted, then charge for it at the end of the meal. That's like placing a plate of samosa's on the table without saying anything and charging for it!ASK if we want to BUY/ORDER poddadoms or give them complementry!The rice was not good at all. It was gluggy, sticky and wet.The flavours weren't there either.The Karahi curries were nice, good kick of flavour, however, 3 bits of chicken in a chicken curry just isn't enough. There was more ghee than chicken.The naan bread was pretty good & fresh.I know it's an institution, it was probably fab back in the day, however, there are plenty of great places like it now in and around London to give it a run for it's money.",-1,-1,1,,

But given that my group was seated right away, we had a fantastic time. The restaurant does a great job of explicitly describing what to expect out of each item in their menu. With four in our table we ordered a chicken, fish, lamb and a vegetarian dish and were thoroughly impressed with each one. For those who plan on going out to an event after dinner here, make sure you allot enough time to shower beforehand because you are going to smell.

New Tayyabs serves up some of the best Indian food I've had. We had some lamb kebabs and spicy chicken curry both served on hot sizzling plates and bowls, along with buttery, soft naan. Now that I'm reading the reviews again, I should have gone with the lamb chops but once I looked at the menu, I couldn't remember at the time what everyone had been raving about.Oh man and how could I forget. Their mango lassi is wonderful, sweet but not over-the-top sweet but milky, smooth, amazing AND huge. I could have easily shared one tall glass with a friend. I also didn't know you can bring your own drinks here. Not sure if there's a corkage fee, but it didn't seem like it. The young gals next to me brought a giant bottle of rum. Service is great, and the prices are pretty affordable.

With that being said, there was no wait, and the service was fast and efficient.The mango lassi was perfect, not too sweet and the flavor was spot on.The Karahi Chicken Keema was delicious...chocked full of flavor. The baby pumpkin was also good, though it was loaded up with cilantro, and since I'm not a huge cilantro fan, I only ate some of it; my husband, on the other hand, had no problem finishing the dish for me.If you are in London and looking for great Indian food, I would recommend Tayyabs.

I find that Indian food is either good or not good, there's no in between. This definitely falls in the 'good' category. The starters were delicious, sheesh kebabs for å£0.95 each! Lovely lamb samosas, and chicken tikka pieces that were moist and succulent. For the mains we had chicken biryani (pretty good, not amazing), and chicken curry (lovely). The naan breads were perfectly cooked. They didn't serve alcohol so we popped over to a local Tesco for some canned beer (ergh!). The service wasn't fantastic, but I wasn't expecting much. The place was packed, and everyone seemed to be enjoying it all. I'd definitely go back. I paid å£16 for a very substantial meal - amazing value!",1,1,1,,
1053,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"For all the hype, I was pretty underwhelmed by Tayyabs. I was pining to try the lamb chops after hearing so many good things about them, but mine were only okay -- they seemed a bit burnt to me. The curries were good, but not excellent -- I would have liked a good deal more spice. The best part of the meal to me was sadly the pistachio kulfi I had for dessert, which was like eating frozen heavy cream on a stick.That said, for the food alone, I would give Tayyabs a solid four star rating, especially at such reasonable prices. The service, however, was appallingly bad. So bad that it affected the quality of the meal itself.The first shortfall came in that we had to ask to see a menu about 20 minutes after being seated. Secondly, my brother had to ask for a banana lassi at least three times (after the waiter reassured him that it was on the way) before one finally showed up about an hour later. After we got our bill, two more banana lassis showed up as a result of the ineptitude of the waiter.If you're in the area, Tayyabs is a great place to get some dinner. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. As an aside, they don't serve alcohol, so if you want a drink with your meal, you'll have to bring it yourself.",-1,-1,-1,,

If you can wait come back another day, their food is definitely worth a try.  Always start off with the mix plate of kebabs which includes Chicken & Lamb.

If you can live with these limitations then you will not have to wait hours for a table and the entire experience will be that much better. I love the food here, I don't bother ordering curries, instead I just get grilled meat, naan and rice. The naan is amaaazing! It's really buttery and tasty and I happily stuff my face with it. Obviously, the lamb chops are amazing. I don't know why I like them so much, because there's barely any meat on them and they vary from being painfully spicy to being virtually mild, but I love them! They're truely addictive, though I haven't gone as far as some who only ever order the lamb. I also like the tandoori chicken, which is much better than the dry flavourless stuff you get in most places, and the tandoori fish is also amazing. If going for a lassi, get the mango or sweet. I accidently was given the sour one last time, and it is disgusting. They put in whole seeds (coriander? I don't know) and it's just rank. Stick with sweet, or bring your own. Btw, don't come here on a first date. Wait until you've been together long another to be comfortable shouting across a table and gnawing on bones.

Unfortunately Tayyabs is victim of its own success. Another one of these East London restaurants that's living off the fumes of a former accreditation of excellence but fails to deliver. I would say the average customer was not raised on a diet of Indian cuisine so experiencing curry is an irregular event (being half-Pakistani I had the stuff coming out of my ears from an early age) and perhaps hard to quantify - my own gf exclaimed how a lamb masala ""nearly blew her head off"" so there you have it. I had a chicken karahi which was bland (real curry houses offer chicken thigh as is the tradition in the Punjab), the meat rubbery and unbelievably luke warm. My naan was stone cold and my Nan could make better pilau in her sleep. The place is packed to the rafters making it uncomfortable to relax - at one point I had the jacket of a customer dangling in my curry as he was squeezed along an overflowing line.

They also told us you can make reservations, which I would recommend. Ok, so now on to the food.

Their offerings are really simple and clear - a selection of Pakistani and North Indian appetisers mostly served on a sizzling platter, a variety of different curries, standard bread and rice and a small selection of drinks including a very generous sized lassi (I highly recommend the Mango one). They don't sell alcohol, instead opting for a Bring Your Own (BYO) licence so if you want wine or beer, you can really have whatever you want. Service for food tends to be very prompt, almost on the side of excessive eagerness and pressure to both order and clean up at the end. This is completely understandable when you look at the long queue of people inside, and often outside. One of the diners I was with found it a little on the rude side, although I think it just comes with the territory of the restaurant wanting to please all and is a way for them to keep the prices down. This restaurant is easily accessible from both Algate East and Whitechapel tubes, and just a small walk away from Brick Lane. I reckon it offers much better foods than many of the other places on Brick Lane, and made much better without the constant harassing or pressure to come and dine.

The Tandoori chicken was lovely as well.

The interior and casual dress of the diners ensure this is nothing more than a cheap and cheerful eat. The best curry places are rarely glitzy  and certainly not in London where you can find an infinite number of authentic international restaurants. Those who consider their surroundings more important than what's on their plate would do well to aim for a bland Mayfair restaurant.

1102,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"Tayyabs - Pics at The London FoodieI have wanted to go to Tayyabs for a very long time but for one reason or another, I never managed to get a table. On one occasion, a couple of friends and I tried our luck without a reservation - as we arrived there we found, as predicted, a very long queue ahead of us. After waiting for 20 minutes or so we gave up, and headed to the nearby Lahore Kebab House.Last Thursday, I finally made to Tayyabs thanks to the delightful Jennifer and Louise who miraculously managed to book us a table - never underestimate a woman's power of persuasion I would say! I had first met Jen & Louise at the Bangalore Express tasting a few weeks earlier, and was looking forward to eating and catching up with both again.We arrived at Tayyabs to find the busiest restaurant I have ever seen - the queue was a tangle of nearly a hundred or so people huddled together, pushing and shoving and looking rather miserable. Despite our booking, we still had to wait a good 40 minutes for our table while others with no booking had to wait even longer.Our waiter was cheerful and well natured considering the number of diners he had to look after - he patiently took our order and assisted us to open our bottle of wine. Being a Pakistani restaurant, Tayyabs is a BYO restaurant which helps to make it an even more affordable choice.After a few minutes, two sizzling hot plates, piled high with a selection of the most beautifully char-grilled meats, arrived at our table - the smell was wonderful and we quickly tucked in. The meat was tender and had been perfectly seasoned. It was spicy without being too hot, and combined with the heavenly char-grilled flavours it made for a sensational dish.The selection of meats included ""chicken tikka"" å£2.80, ""lamb chops"" å£5.50, and ""sheekh kebab"" @ å£0.90 each. Each plate of meat cost å£11.90.To follow the grilled meats, we ordered two curries - ""Karahi Chicken"" å£6 and ""Allo Meat"" (Lamb) å£6.20. These were also excellent, as the karahi (like small woks), where the curries were cooked and served, had been blackened by the intense heat and were giving out that perfectly char-grilled aroma.To accompany our mains we also ordered a couple of the vegetable dishes, the ""Lahori Chickar Chana"" (chickpeas) å£4.80 and the baby pumpkin or ""Tinda Masala"" å£5. These were fried and served in Karahis, they were both deliciously spicy and had good flavours.We also had ""Pilau Rice"" å£2.50, the most scrumptious Peshwari Nan å£2.50 and a ""Garlic Nan"" @ å£2.As we brought our own wine, we only shared a large bottle of water å£2, and a very creamy and delicious mango lassi which å£2 was a real bargain. By the end of the meal, we were all too full to order dessert so we shared a couple of ""Kulfi"" (Pistachio ice cream skewers) @ å£2.50 each. The ice cream was sensational and I wish I had ordered a whole one for myself!My experience at Tayyabs has revived my love for Pakistani cuisine, its kebabs and curries. At å£67 for a table of 5 or å£13.40 per person, Tayyabs is incredibly good value. Despite the chaotic booking system and ludicrous queues, I cannot wait to return to Tayyabs and try all those dishes again.Verdict - Sensational grilled meats, wonderful Karahi curries and vegetables at very reasonable prices.

I can only rationalize it to ""your restaurant is so popular that your servers could act like a-holes but we'll still sit there no matter what""... and we did. We ordered the: lamb chop starter, mutton tikka, chicken kahari, allo gosht, and some naan. Did I mention there were more then 2 of us although I could have inhaled all that food on my own. It was amazingly delicious and hearty. They did the lamb chops well (I am generally not a fan) and the mutton was ridiculous! Top it off with some BYOB action and I was a happy camper.

I wouldn't say the food was excellent but you will have a good meal here nonetheless. A speciality seems to be the lamb chops which everyone will tell you to order. They are arguably their best dish. I would also recommend the Korai. Whilst this place gets rave reviews, do not go here with too higher expectations as the food is not that amazing.

The lamb chops that I had been looking forward to sampling looked like they might have to wait for another occasion and talk turned to other establishments in the area that could possibly accommodate a large group at short notice. Fortunately we had the diminutive, but pretty scary, Priya in our party who marched to the head of the queue and had a quiet word with the staff in Hindi. Five minutes later we were all seated and cracking open the first of many Cobra beers. The restaurant itself is big, bustling and very vibrant. There are a couple of large rooms upstairs and another one in the basement. A wonderful, pungent aroma of meat and spices hits you as soon as you walk through the front door; great for getting the taste buds salivating but be warned that you will be making a trip to the dry cleaners the next day. After Priya's amazing success in getting us all in at the drop of a hat we decided that we would leave ourselves in her hands and let her order for the whole table. Popadoms and the usual accompaniments were first up; all very tasty but nothing to write home about. Things started to move up a gear with the arrival of plates laden with a section of nan breads which looked divine and tasted even better. To start with we had the mixed grill which is highly recommended. The succulent chicken tikka came sporting a lovely char, the sheekh kababs were full of flavour and the lamb chops took this meal to whole new level. I was beginning to understand why there was such a big queue of hungry punters happy to wait for an hour to get a taste of this delicious cooking. I'm struggling to remember everything that we had for the main courses but stand out dishes were the lamb chop curry, which was the special of the day, and the karhi keema. Despite our best efforts a couple of hours later we still had a mountain of food left which seemed a waste to leave uneaten; not a problem said our friendly waiter and few minutes later her returned with our food and nan bread beautifully package for us to take home. As Tayyabs is a bring your own booze place and charges no corkage fee the bill for this amazing Pakistani Punjabi feast came to an incredibly reasonable å£16 a head. A very small price to pay for what was one of my favourite meals this year.

Enter Tayyabs, which I came across back in 2009 when Charles L.'s rave review of this place.Granted it's a bit out of the way from Central London, but it is WELL worth it. Succulent flavorful lamb chops and tandoori chicken on sizzling platters with onions as well as their tandoori paneer made for excellent starters. Their okra and chickpea items were beyond anything I had ever had in the US, and their Tuesday quail special was particularly exquisite. My favorite though was their tikka masalas, and no, they aren't anything like the creamy, neutral-flavored dish that everyone has come to know in the US. No, their version here is much different, and much much BETTER. I ordered both their chicken and mutton tikka masalas and out came pieces of meat in a piquant chile laden sauce that had the perfect balance of spice and heat. Add hot from the tandoori naan and rice and a pitcher of perfectly sweetened, richly flavored mango lassi you get the best Indian meal I've ever had.

We tried so many different dishes but my absolute favorite is the Dry Meat and the Pista Kufti. I taste these in my dreams, that's how great they were. The lamb chops are decadent, savory, spiced morsels that just melt in your mouth. The channa was the stuff of legends and the pappadums and mango chutney, there just didn't seem to ever be enough. The chicken tikka was absolute delish as well. Service is super fast and everyone there is so friendly. Since I've moved, I can't partake in the goodness as often as I want.

It was about 17:30 and the place was just about empty, so we had a good table by the window. I have to admit I am a bit of a hygiene freak when it comes to food preparation, here you will find the toilets not far from the food preparation area and a bit smelly. (there may be other toilets, but these were the ones I used). Staff were sampling the food behind the open buffet counter, I dread to think how many times the spoon was used between each bowl.When our popadoms were served they came on a small plate and were held in place by bare hands. I do hate other peoples fingers in my food. I can see why some reviewers have complained about the poor standard of these popadoms to me they were the prepacked ones you cook under the grill and there were a large quantity just stacked in front of the buffet serving area.The saving grace were the chops, as all previous reviewers have raved about, yes they are good, but that was as far as it goes. It is a small menu if you leave out the vegetarian section, and the portion size (unless you go for the large) is nothing to write home about.I think the price for the meal is a psychological thing, yes it seems reasonable, but considering you bring your own drinks with you, if you add the price of a couple of bottles of kingfisher at restaurant prices and have the large meals, the bill is about on par.Having said all that we were not disapppointed. I like a restaurant where you take your own drinks and there is no cork charge. Take screw tops just in case, and your own wine glasses.

Make a reservation unless you want to join the queues which can stretch to many dozens of people. I didn't try the much-adored lamb chops, instead having some Karahi dhal gosht and focusing on veg dishes: bindi and a pumpkin curry. All were really well-flavoured. My wife and I were stuffed full on the above, rice, roti and some paneer - and we had to take some home, we couldn't finish it all - for just å£25. It's not the best curry I've ever had but it's certainly value for money. It's BYOB.",1,1,1,,
1136,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"pop by for some photos:hungryinlondon.com/2011/‰Û_  Tayyabs is a real London institution as it is the case for few other cheap ethnic haunts. Not far from Whitechapel Tube Station, this inconspicouus restaurant is tucked away in a little backstreet. That said, Tayyabs would be inconspicuous, if it wasn't for the hordes of people patiently waiting in front for their share of Punjabi Pakistani food. Tayyabs was founded more than 30 years ago and has been growing from a local cafe to one of the places you have to visit in London before you die (or before you leave, which some people might argue is the same). It does not have an alcohol license and what adds to its incredible value is there is no corkage charge for bringing a bottle or two. Finally it was my time to pay Tayyabs a visit. When you are disorganised enough to go on a Saturday evening like yours truly, be prepared to queue at least 30 minutes. Even though the turnover is high, there are a lot of people queuing too As soon as we were seated we got served poppadoms with raw cucumber, onion and tomato and a selection of very tasty chutneys (mango, rajita and a tomato chili one), and this for free! I The menu is small and easily fits on one double-page  there is selection of tandoori dishes, some meat and fish curries and some vegetable dishes. Apparently the lamb chops (6) are a must at Tayyabs. They came sizzling hot (a portion consists of 4 chops) and full of wonderful flavours from the tandoori grill, unfortunately they were borderline to completely overdone. While I was not fully convinced about the reason for Tayyabs cult status after these chops, I was fully taken by the wonderful garlic naan (2) which was light, soft and fluffy with just the right amount of garlic. I thought the Karahi Chicken (6.50), tender chicken immersed in a rich tomato based spicy sauce, was merely nice. The Karahi Mixed Vegetables (5.20) however, were among the most delicious curries I have ever tasted. Vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, peppers, aubergine and potatoes were cooked far beyond al dente in a flavourful gravy of Indian spices. Yes it was greasy but I loved even the grease on this rare occasion.lamb chops (6)garlic naan (2)Karahi Chicken (6.50)Karahi Mixed Vegetables (5.20) The atmosphere is reminiscent of a canteen but well, so are the prices, one can't complain really! The value for money ratio at Tayyabs is hard to beat. I didn't have Indian food this tasty for that ridiculously small amount of money anywhere else in London. I don't say it doesn't exist, just that I haven't found it yet. Open for suggestion though!",1,1,1,,
1137,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,This place is known for their lamb chops. It is very delicious served on a sizzling plate. I really enjoy their sweet lassi as well. Most of their dishes are above average but I go there for the lamb chops!,1,1,1,,

1139,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,1,"For a place as intensely raved as Tayyabs, I was seriously disappointed. My drink (salted lassi) and appetizer (a meat samosa) were delicious, but our entree, karahi gosht, was abysmal: it tasted exactly like a canned beef stew! Even worse, in the following hours I came down with a bad case of food poisoning, a first in all my years of heavily patronising Indian restaurants. I won't be going back.Plus, the tables were uncomfortably close together; we were essentially sitting with two strangers.",-1,-1,-1,,
1140,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,Sketchy neighborhood but THE BEST Indian food ever!  Quick service and very clean.  Tandoori chicken and tikka masala was amazing... hands down the best Indian food I've ever had.,1,1,1,,

I'd order take away if I wasn't. The poor table before us had to withstand 2 waiters breathing down their necks and us, looming over them, desperately waiting to appease our starvation. I suspect from the queues that this place is always busy but perhaps next time I'd test out lunch and hope for a more peaceful experience. P.S. The food is everything it's cracked up to be.",1,-1,1,,
1142,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,5,"WOWWW!!! I think this is my top London eat so far. Incredible. I'd been told of this place back in the day when I called East London my home (a distant 5 months ago), but, deterred by the tales of queues out the door, I hadn't made the journey. Thanks to my good friends persuading (well not much persuading at all) we ended up there last Friday night, 6:30, prime rush hour. Yes, there was an enormous line, but it moved surprisingly fast. I actually enjoyed the wait, as the aromas that fly past you are a fantastic appetizer for what's to come. As it's a dry restaurant, my friend popped out to grab some wine, while I watched sizzling racks of lamb and chicken kebabs criss cross in front of me. I busied myself by reading some of the reviews on the wall (apparently Zagat rated it #10 resto in all of London, scoring only one point less than Gordon Ramsay's). And apparently the usual range of celebs (Britney, heads of state etc.) have stopped in. This restaurant is a highly efficient operation (which I always observe in great detail, having worked the hospitality industry. These guys know how to run this ship). Veggies and dips on the table literally as we sat down, a waiter at our side within 2 mins...my friend's napkin replaced *before it even hit the floor*. Seriously. They are all over you. Very fast, very hustle/bustle but in a good way. Now...the FOOD. OMG. (must stop saying that). But it was OMG. Could they pack any more flavour into these dishes?? My friend (who's Pakistani, I was told to go with a pro) did all the ordering, so I can't me more specific to the dishes other than to say, pretty much anything you order will be absolutely amazing. Fall off the bone chicken, beautiful curries, incredible. I hadn't done Pakistani food and found it to be a mix between Indian (for the spice factor), and Persian (one dish in particular, name fails me). The price factor is also pretty omg (small caps omg, as this is London after all, but relatively speaking, very very affordable) As soon as we finished I wanted to do it all over again. Because it's so busy, it's not a place to linger over your byob, so get in, get out and get back in line!!!",1,1,1,,

1144,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"The food cannot be faulted but my experience with the service staff (a very important aspect for me is the service) brings down the rating to three stars as they have outed themselves as a greedy bunch more than once. I have been there several times by myself, usually order the chicken tikka and a dal and it is quite bothersome to put up with the same questions every time - What?? No rice?? No bread???. Um, no. I'm here for some lunch, not a three-day feast. Staff also get annoyed when you send back the papadam - i guess because they have just earned 60p less (for those who do not know, they charge you for the papadam they automatically bring to your table). One waiter flew into a badly masked rage when, after ordering a mango lassie and not recieving it with the meal, we insisted that it be taken off the bill (he wanted us to have the lassie even though we had finished our meal and were paying). He was furious and let's not forget that a lassie costs 2 quid, you would have thought it was 200!! Great food but greedy, greedy, greedy staff. They should be happy that business is doing so well instead of getting in a twist about someone not wanting their 60p papadam. And oh, if you order take away it is advisable to check you have everything - I've had take away three times and each time they managed to forget something or give me something i had not ordered.",-1,-1,-1,,

The Pakistani and Indian cook in different manner. The day we went into Tayyab was crazy. The queue was so long and waited for an hour to get a table. But it was worth the wait.As soon as we got seated there were these spicy popadums with different chutneys. Had to lick the last chutney off my finger tips. Being a fan of lamb I tried the ""Gosh Dal"" - lamb cooked with lentils and i loved it. The ""karahi bindi ( okra or ladyfingers) were ok..not spectacular.

Voted number seven in the Zaggat guide's top ten London restaurants this year as well as Indian restaurant of the year so I had high expectations. You can have a nice meal here for å£10 which is typical for the Brick Lane area, not typical for central London generally. The service was not good in a conventional way, but they got the job done, and were very fast. It's a place to grab a quick bite, don't expect to hold your table unless you book the private dining room. As Tayyabs is not licensed you can bring your own and on the upside there is no corkage fee. To start I recommend the Seekh Kebabs, they come out sizzling on a hot plate with loads of gorgeous onions. For main course I got the Daal Tarka. It was nice but not as good as I'd had on Brick Lane before. Definately get the garlic Naan, its really tasty especially compared to the pilau rice which is only average.",-1,1,1,,

The Dahl was mushy with no texture due to over cooking, it had no heat despite asking if it was both dry and spicy when I ordered.  The Okra was swimming in oil and again mush.  There was nothing good about the meal at all. I talked to the waiter and got a wave of his arm saying look how many Indian families love their food (most of which were bordering on obese, so I guess they love their oil). My friends had the lamb chops and the a couple of chicken curries.  The lamb apparently was excellent. The chicken curry again was full of oil and had very little punch to the spices or subtlety to the cooking. They left both curries.  Do: have the grillDon't: have anything else on the menu unless you love oil, lovely oil. oh and more oil. a big thick layer of oil. on top of, in and oh, go on more oil would be great thanks.Nasty, badly cooked curry. Not good.  Brick Lane is notoriously bad for curry and this is no better.I think I'll stick to homemade Punjabi food, Masala Zone or Vijay's Chawalla on Green Street - all amazingly made with very little oil at all and far superior to the rubbish Tayyabs serves as Indian food.Yuck.",-1,-1,1,,

I think the BYOB policy has meant they are doing good trade so they don't have to be polite to people anymore. When I asked could they take our order the waiter was rude.

The samosa's are also good value for money. An excellent range of starters and mains makes it an ideal place for large groups which allows you to try lots of the dishes in one sitting. The chicken keema dish is particularly good with their freshly made naan.

Certainly not a date place, but excellent for a pally Sunday lunch.",1,1,1,,
1166,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,4,"I've been coming here since 2001. The service is always courteous and the food is the best North Indian/Pakistani food this side of the Amritsar/Lahore border post! The food is faultlessly spiced; some say it's a little hot. Well, real Indian food is. But like all real food, you can see the spices as well as taste them. No mucky generic sauce blankets the dishes here. Everything is served piping hot and riddled with distinct cooked in flavours, whole spices and real taste. To start I'd recommend the Sheek Kebab (comes with salad) and a naan - when these arrive, tear the naan, fill with salad, a kebab and yoghurt sauce and tuck in . . . . it's a delicious starter. The Samosas here are also great. Keep an eye out for the daily specials on the menu - my favourite is the Tinda Masaala, a gourd not unlike a round courgette cooked with lots of fresh ginger, green chilly and spices. Don't go overboard on the rice and naan thing that so many people seem obsessed with, you won't have room for the real food. Have one, or the other, not both. You won't find a single dud in the dishes served here - the owners (and the clientele) just would not stand for second rate food. To drink, I'd recommend the Mango Lassi. It's sweetness soothes the heat of some of the dishes superbly. Booze is not available here, but you can bring your own subject to a modest corkage charge. This is real Punjabi food as it is eaten in North India and Pakistan. Eat at Tayyab's and challenge your pre-conceptions. You might realise that the so-called Indian food served in Brick Lane (with one - just one - exception) bears no relationship to real Indian and Pakistani food.

Don't let the line (at times out the door with a 30 min+ wait) turn you off, for this off-the-beaten-path BYOB is a treasure.  My favorites include the mixed grill, paneer tikka, karahi bhindi (okra) and of course, the lentils with aubergine - I've never had anything like it.   However I have had better chicken tikka masala and the sourness of their pumpkin curry is unexpected and doesn't quite jive with my taste buds.  If things get spicy - which they can here - the mango lassi won't let you down.  Unfortunately I've never quite made it to dessert but when I do I'll report back and add to this post.

You get these little glasses to drink your grog out of, which make you feel like you're at a speakeasy. Credibility - it feels like a local restaurant, rather than a tourist experience (Brick Lane) or a recreation of the 'great days of our colonial empire' (your average high st curry house). Atmosphere - it's always buzzing.",1,1,1,,

I think that is always a good sign when people are prepared to wait for hours for a table (the guys that sat next to us, just as we were leaving had waited for 2.5 hours!). Once seated we were asked what we wanted straight away, but hadn't had a chance to look at the menu. When we asked for a minute we were left alone for ages, amd became probably the only people all night that needed to actually flag down a waiter! We ordered our starters and mains, but everything came together. Lamb chops, chicken tikka and pakora were outstanding, as were the nann. The mains were ok, no real heat, but liked the use of tandor-cooked meat with the sauce, leavng the meat very tender.I wouldn't normally have given 5 stars, because of the service, however considering how hard they were working and the fact that the food was so good, I had to. The fact it was so cheap is also in their favour...",1,1,1,,
1179,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Not many reviewers seem to give this place less than 5 stars ... so i guess my review will be different. :)I would like to know whether there is anybody in London who has been able to get a table here by waiting for less than half an hour ? Whenever you go, you find a long long line that snakes out from the door and for 50 metres beyond. It probably shows how popular the place is, but its such a turn off for a new customer.Even after you get the coveted seat, the ordeal is not over. The place is cramped, very cramped. You have to almost get up to let the server pass on to the table after you.But having said all this, one has to admit that the food, the non vegetarian food,  is excellent. The lamb chops are well known. The kebabs are heavenly, the chicken tikka or the fish dishes. The main course is also probably good (sorry, i stuffed myself with the kebabs and so couldn't try much of the main course dishes :p).The question is, how much trouble are you willing to take for the sake of tayyab's food ? I for one, probably will not go back very often.Full 5 stars for the food, and -2 stars for the pain.",-1,-1,1,,

The tikka paneer is out of this world, and the baby aubergine dish is consistently excellent. Don't get me started on the meaty starters my mouth's watering already. You can bring your own booze but don't expect to be able to get through more than a bottle of beer. One final touch which I like: tap water is provided as standard, and your jug will be topped up regularly. If you've tired of Brick Lane's identikit, meat-and-sauce curries, this is the place for you.",-1,1,1,,

Our samosas weren't too greasy and stuffed absolutely full of delicious, herby meat. The chutneys provided on the table are a great variety and wonderfully made (taste so fresh!). We also got a starter of paneer tikka (I've heard the chicken tikka is die for, but I wasn't in the mood for chicken that night), which SO smokey and deliciousobviously marinated in delicious spices and then freshly grilled, it was the best paneer I've ever had. The curries did not disappoint. After reading raving reviews, I ordered the dry meat & my husband got karahi lamb gosht. The dry meat curry is something everyone MUST try - absolutely nothing like your traditional British curry that is greasy and watery. The dry meat is called such because they cook the lamb in lovely juices and sauces so slowly and for so long that the lamb positively absorbs all that wonderfullness, leaving very little sauce behind (but infusing the lamb with SUCH flavour). It was absolutely divine and probably the best curry I've ever eaten. Next time, I am going to try some of those lovely sizzling starters I keep seeing described, but I am definitely ordering the dry meat dish again. Tayyabs also serve their trademark creamy sweet/salty lassi, which I hear is quite popular for cooling tongue unused-to spicy curries. Meal for 2 with 2 curries, 2 naan, 2 samosas, 1 starter: an UNBELIEVABLE å£19! Tayyabs is BYOB for drinks, so this helps keep the prices down a lot. Either get there early or be prepared to queue - this place is popular. Also, don't expect to linger over your food - with prices so cheap, they need a huge turnover of customers to make money, so don't be rude and stick around. Eat quickly, enjoy it, then leave so the next dinner can be blessed with some great food,",1,1,1,,

Before you head out, be sure to pick up the beverage of your choice (BYOB), or go the non-alcoholic route with a delicious lasse.

They said they were good but hadn't been to the Lahore Kebab House and that's the problem.  This place is like the Lahore Kebab House on an off day in an Ozwald Boateng suit, very sharp decor but not quite as good with a tandoor as the local competion.  The sheek kebabs were good, the garlic naan was great, the urad dhal was good, the lamb chops were quite good too, but the chicken and lamb tikka were a little on the dry side and the tarka dhal was bland, dry and looked like it had been left out over night.  The karai gosht was also nothing to write home about.  Still, very reasonable prices and a good place to go on a date if your other half likes Indian/Pakistani food.All in all the food is better at either the Lahore Kebab House or Mirch Massala which are both nearby.  If you must go here you have to book, even on a Monday.  Not a bad place by any measure, but I probably wont come back here.",-1,-1,1,,

Reasons below. 1, Poppadums were stale (They were soft). One of the waiters was blaming the weather! 2, Mango Chutney was watered down - It was pouring off the spoon like water - not thick and gloopy. Manager infomed me it wasn't watered down and that they make it themselves. Any one who has worked in an Indian restaurant knows that you don't make Mango Chutney - you buy it in. 3, We ordered two curries - a sag gosht and a dahl dish. Both had onion skin in it! They both tasted horrible. I have eaten about 200+ of these dishes in my life time and never have I tasted such horrible dishes. 4, Manager was rude and unapologetic, to a point were an argument ensued They took the charge off for one of the curry dishes, not both. I had to ask them to take the poppadum charge off. The mixed grill was good but I thought it was not as good as Lahori Kebab House on Umberston Street. I would much rather go there. Edited to say: I am a critical person hence I have a lot of reviews here but I do give credit where it's due.

OH THE FOOD. whereas brick lane can be hit or miss depending on which curry-pimp you listen to (and this can be very tiring), tayyab's is hands down tasty, inexpensive, and very accessible in terms of the crowd -- lots of types here, no need to be in a suit, nor hipper than you in skinny jeans. indeed i don't recommend the skinny jeans as this is the place to loosen the belt in terms of your tummy. the menu won't explain things to the unfamiliar (know what all the curries are ahead of time) but you may as well just close your eyes and point, you can't go wrong, or if you really want to be careful hope that you get one of their more patient waiters who might help clarify. the place is big and the turnaround fast, so pardon the speedy, cold service that's usually the norm. Long and short - under any other restaurant I wouldn't go back, because of how far it is and the service, but Tayyab's is SO delicious and INCREDIBLE value for money (30 pounds for four people, inc. drinks when i last went) that i would definitely just go ahead and plan a day around it. :-)",1,1,1,,

The prawn karahi was incredibly zingy with coriander and again the spiciness was just right.

I'll admit it, east London is dodgey and scared me silly but I've heard that Indian food is better in London than in India. I doubt that can be true but Tayyabs makes it easier to believe. My friend and I wandered the streets and peered into a few establishments, nothing caught our attention. We were tired and hungry, so we decided to stop at the next decent Indian place which happened to be Tayyabs. We showed up at an odd hour and the place was empty. We sat down as if we had the life sucked out of us and ordered some usual items. When the food came out, we both forgot that there were utensils in front of us and did not breathe until we had finished inhaling our food and anything that seemed edible on our plates.. Yes it was THAT good. Good thing no one else was there so there were no one there to witness our uncouth behavior.Fat, happy and amazed; we returned to our friend's flat. Later on in the week, we asked our buddy to take us to an Indian restaurant that would convince us that Indian food in London is better than Indian food in India. He said okay and where did we end up? Tayyabs! [Yes at this point I felt as if I was a local] Although the experience this time was completely different. It was the same great food but since it was dinner time on a friday night the service was rushed. We ended up waiting a full hour until they sat the 5 of us at a table. We all ate merrily and were chatting away when the waiter came by and started taking out plates away. A few that were not finished eating looked at each other. As the waiter was reaching for my friend's plate he was compelled to ask [in his un-phony British accent] the waiter ""Excuse me sir, are you short of plates? We are not finished eating"" It was clear that he was still eating and the waiter replied ""Yes, Youuuuu are not finished but shhheee is"" and took my plate away. Now this warrented evil-burning-the-back-of-your-head-crazy-eyed-stares from all of us at the table. Another waiter came by and asked if there was a problem and my friend explained what happened. The waiter told us to take our time... We finished eating and when the bill cameout, we were tempted to leave a bad tip.. but in the end we decided that maybe they were short of plates and left a decent tip.

The mixed grill is what Tayyabs is famous for and it never disappoints! Within minutes of the sizzling plate landing on the table most of the food is gone. I suggest you book ahead as there are always queues. Tayyabs reputation has grown quickly due to its proximity to the square mile and once people try it they always come back and bring others. I recommend the mixed grill to start off with and then chicken Karahi with Naan bread. Also go for the Mango lassie as its a mango milk shake that is out of this world! Finally the best thing about Tayybas is it serves authentic top quality cuisine at rock bottom prices.

The service is abysmal - they rush you to finish so they can replace you with new diners - but not unfriendly, and diners sit elbow-to-elbow, cramped liked anchovies in a jar.

Queue's are always a good sign outside any restaurant but this one is actually quite fundamental to the whole Tayyabs experience. Even if you manage to book (which will require at least two weeks advanced preparation for weekends) you'll still have to wait at least 15 minutes until the waiter manages to turn your table. Therefore my advice is to go at least half an hour before you think you'll want to eat. That way you can take full advantage of their BYOB policy, have a couple of cans of beer (they don't allow glass in the queue) and scour the menu. By the time you manage to get a seat your taste buds are already warmed up and you are ready to order.     Please don't let this warning put you off, I'm only trying to prepare you so as you don't run away when you're warned it'll be a 45 minute wait for a table. Tayyabas is well worth it. It is my favourite Indian restaurant in the whole of London. Their Tandori Lamb Chops are smokey, spicy, sweet and delicious, the kind of taste you could only hope to recreate at home. Their curries are phenomenal too- I'd recommend the Sag and the Bindi which are both packed with fresh vegetables. A small curry is more than enough and that way you can order starters and side dishes guilt free. Last time I went the bill for four of us was å£45 and we ordered poppadoms, starters, curries, nann, rice- the works!

1219,indian,jx_G97Cl4r8r4kr2XIdLdQ,Tayyabs,3,"Very good flavors but the whole ""experience"" of dining on good Indian food is brought down by the rushed and somewhat rude waitstaff. I forgot that it was BYOB and had to go to the local Tesco for some wine. By the time I got back my two ladies had been moved to another table because they had not ordered. Apparently, since we had a reservation, we were first seated at a more desirable table. When we failed to order quickly enough we were demoted to the very busy and bustling front of house where the tables are shared. I wasn't too bothered by that but I was bothered by my thanking the waiter without getting so much as a look or a smile as we left. It was almost like we had pissed them off by coming to dinner there. Too bad because the food is very good and very interesting. The dry meat curry particularly so. I'm not sure I would return given that I only get to try London Indian food so rarely. Even though the prices are three to four times what Tayyabs charge, I would still rate Amma in New York and Noor Jahan in London as the best Indian food I have eaten.",-1,-1,-1,,

And overall, not really friendly at all.I wish now I had gone with the traditional Thali, but the dish I ordered sounded very good on paper. Noodles with prawns and squid.The dish came out very quick, considering their menu mentions giving them time to prepare everything fresh. Now the sauce was delicious. Very very good. But given the price of the dish being over å£17, there was very few prawns and only a couple pieces of squid.When I finished eating, it took a long time for anyone to check on me and get my bill (I had to ask for it). Even though I saw them attending to other tables.Therefore, given the poor service and price, I give it 2 stars.",-1,-1,1,,

The waitress Sahana took the time to ask preferences and Based on answers she made excellent recommendations from appetizers, to main course, side dishes and dessert. Highly advise to order the  Butter Chicken, delicious! , and  Chicken Saffron Korma.

We looked them up on Yelp and saw that the reviews were encouraging so we took a chance on a Friday night and showed up without reservations. They were about a 15 minute walk or less from Leicester square. They were fairly busy and we waited at least 10 minutes but still a very reasonable time to wait on a Friday night WITHOUT reservations. The service is NOT great but you get over that pretty quickly because of the food. The samosa was amazing. Both of our meals were great. The drinks were excellent. The ambiance was awesome. The bathrooms were even cool. We wanted to order and eat so much more but we were full on the food we had ordered!

Mini-chains of Indian restaurants is not something we see in the States, so I was intrigued to see what the results would be.  The place was buzzing and very busy for lunch and we were seated right away.  The dÌ©cor did not seem much like a chain restaurant in my opinion, it is modern, but also warm and cozy at the same time.The menu is very busy and there is a lot to choose from.  I had the chicken saffron korma and we also got the butter chicken thali.  Additionally, we got garlic naan and rice.  Everything was very good.  Nothing was amazing, but not one thing that hit the table was mediocre.  I really liked the chicken saffron korma.  I have not seen it at many restaurants back home.  One thing that was lacking here was the service.  We waited for a long time for our server, ultimately ordering from the host.  We got our drinks from one server, food from another server, drinks ordered from another server (which never came) and the bill from someone else.

We tried the shrimp curry and it was delicious. I love all the options you have with a Thali. The flavors are always so diverse and interesting. One of my favorite appetizers is the dahi puri- it's like this spicy puff filled with cool yogurt. AH! SO GOOD! And the mango sorbet is a delicious finish to any meal. On another occasion we decided against the Thalis and just ordered curry.

Pressed for time we walked into Masala zone.  It should  be called the ""coriander zone"" for their  heavy handed use of the  spice.  The veggie samosas had large offensive seeds that I had to spit into my napkin. The korma has so much coriander it was inedible. Also, I'm confused about the curries. They were more like  soup than actual curry.  The butter chicken lacked any kind of subtlety or depth. It was more like tomato soup.  Finally the rice didn't get eaten and the naan was bland. Such a bummer and I have to wonder how this place gets so many 5 star reviews.On a positive note the staff was pleasant and the atmosphere appropriate for a soho restaurant.",-1,-1,-1,,

The place does seem a bit overdecorated but the vibe and the atmosphere is pretty good - I can definitely see this place being a good date dinner venue.  Service was pretty lacking. Their payments system was down, and staff didn't seem to do a very good job communicating with each other so there was quite a bit of confusion and a pretty significant and frustrating delay. I ended up needing to pay in cash since they couldn't really sort out what was wrong. The food is delicious and very heavily spiced - the spicy offerings are actually quite spicy. They have thali sets that come with a little bit of everything if you like variety. The grand thali can be split between two people easily. Portions are reasonable although Masala Zone is a bit on the pricey side, although I don't think it's egregious for the area.",1,1,-1,,

This place does try to make you wait too long for a table even when they are clean and you are next for it. They seem to be content with leaving you at the bar and hoping you order a drink to pad your bill. When you're hungry this is a nuisance. The decor is great and if it was quiet it could even be romantic. That isn't possible however since this is close to soho's many bars. Service was pretty good for London.Definitely recommend you go but get a reservation so you aren't one of the many groups being pushed back out the doors.Also the doors are weird. Pay attention when you open them.",1,-1,1,,
1235,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,3,Only reason this place gets a 3 star is because of its decor and ambience. This place is well lit and is beautiful. The food here is not as good as the decor. For someone who is from India or knows taste of some traditional dishes would agree with me. Their undhiyu was sweet and had ripe bananas in it which was a dealbreaker for me plus it was super oily I couldn't even eat anything after that. Their grant thali is ok but the worst part was when we asked server which vegetables are part of the grand thali she mentioned completely different vegetables from what came as a part of meal.

As any Bay Area person I looked for a place nearby in Yelp and found Masala Zone. It was the perfect ambience to have a nice meal alone. It was nice, but totally acceptable and not awkward to dine alone. I ordered the smaller size Thali w/ lamb. It also came with lentils, and a delicious broccoli dish. It was all soooo good.",1,1,1,,

It quickly filled, however, so I'd recommend a reservation (but it obviously worked out for us, so don't be deterred). They have a collection of curries that they serve on a platter with set sides, delicious chutney, and a few other things (called a thali). You can get a regular thali or a grand thali, which has a few more bells and whistles. You can add on another curry for a bit extra. We got the butter chicken (suuuuuper creamy) and the lamb curry (lamb was super tender). If you are moderately hungry, adding a curry to the grand thali would sufficiently feed 2. We didn't realize that and added the chicken kottu parantha. Kind of glad we did, though, because it was delicious. Spiced chicken with lots of veggies and delicious things. They warned us it would take longer to cook, but I thought it was served quickly.",1,1,1,,

My friend has made a reservation so we didn't have problem getting a table.I think the food was just ok. Definitely not the best Indian food I've ever had.I ordered the grand thali with lamb (I added garlic naan) plus a glass of mango lassi.The veggies dishes in my thali were actually better than the lamb curry (which suppose to be the star). The curry could be served hotter, it was a bit cold when I received it.Portion wise, it was big enough than I couldn't finish it.The restaurant is classier than regular Indian restaurants, the service was also good. The waiter checked on us several times, and in the end he asked us to fill the feedback form. I guess they're trying to improve their service level due to the bad reviews about it.Overall, I had a good experience. However, I probably won't go here if I really craving good Indian food, if you know what I mean.",-1,-1,1,,
1240,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,3,"Open concept and beautiful decor. Definitely should have gotten a reservation prior to arriving. Only waited 30 minutes at the bar. I tried the Chai Negroni which I didn't like but in the restaurant's defense, it was labeled bitter and spicy. I tried something new; they aren't all winners. The Narial Punch was the perfect amount of sweetness and creamy texture. As for the meals, the food overall was incredibly full of flavor with different levels of heat. I highly recommend the cheese naan bread. I ordered two for myself, it was that good. Now to the bad stuff. As an American, I am comfortable in cargo shorts and a hoodie. Just because I look casual doesn't mean I'm broke or a poor tipper. I had to ask several times for more water AND when someone finally brought it, it was as if I was inconveniencing him for even being there. The food was divine, I can't deny that. My thing is I felt judged for how I prefer to dress. I still paid in full and as the tip was included in the bill, I can say my experience didn't warrant the 12.5% already added. Normally I tip 20% for excellent service. 0% would have been more appropriate.  As I am zaftig, I have no issue spending money on food. So now, I judge the service here and hope future experiences with people won't feel as overlooked as I did tonight.",-1,-1,-1,,

The star was a punch that is a twist on a chai tea and served in a metal tea cup with crushed ice. There is also a take on a.

Carry on.""Not that it's a super fancy place, but it's clean, shiny, and you certainly don't smell that pungent oily fog of curry that permeates your clothes for days after. Many of us opted for the thalis, which is the usual order for indecisive people like myself. Why have one dish when you can opt for like nine things on a big silver platter. You have a choice of GRAND and regular, so being American, I of course supersized mine, so the thali gained kachumber (tomato & onion salad), raita, and an appetizer. Both types of thalis have a choice of meat curry, two veg curries (root & leaf), chapati, rice, and papadum.The fish curry was fine as my main, though it could have used a kick in the spice levels. The chutneys and side sauces were on the blander side as well, but still mighty tasty.

Since Masala is large and spacious, we were quickly seated.Based on Yelp photos, I decided to opt for a curry. I forget what it's called, but it was spicy (two chilies on the menu) but with nice coconut-y undertones and with large pieces of dark meat chicken. The curry doesn't come with rice, so I ordered some Yellow lemony-Jasmine rice which was perfectly seasoned, spiced, and I even found a roasted lemon rind mixed inside.I tried my friend's Butter Chicken curry, which was a different type of spicy. Not in the sense of hot-spicy, but more like a flavorful, almost sweet spicy. She ordered garlic naan on the side, which came out slightly fluffy, fresh and warm. Other friends ordered the Thalis, which are definitely meant to be shared. I sampled their small side dishes - the lentil stew was mediocre but everything else was great.

1263,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,4,"Came here on the recommendation of Rick Steve's London guide. Mind you, he's not that type of a traveler that knows good food. However, taking his advice on this chain while being in the neighborhood was a pleasant suprise.Masala Zone are a chain of retaurants with various themes, this one having the theme of an Indian marriage with close to 100 vibrant puppets from Rajasthan suspended from the ceilings. Definitely a great conversation starter.Menu is vast, but I went straight for one of the Thalis combo. I love my favorite Indian place in Glendale that does a great job on Northern Indian Thalis, so I had to see if this one stood up to it. I went with the The Grand Thali, which is equal to a starter and main course combined. It comprises a CanapÌ©,  a choice of  curry, 2 vegetables (one green and one root), Dal (lentil), Raita (yoghurt), Indian salad, Papadum & Chutney, freshly-made whole wheat Chapatti (Indian bread) & Rice. You get to choose the meat. Be forewarned that when you say mild, it's VERY mild. You won't drip one bit of sweat at all. If you're like me and like to actually taste some spice in your food, medium should be good. Anywho, as noted on their website, the etiquette of eating a Thali is to spoon a small portion of food from an individual dish into the area next to the rice, and then combine it with the rice. Repeat this process in sequence. This enables the flavour of each dish to be appreciated individually. Do not either mix more than one dish simultaneously with the rice, or mix the rice in the individual bowls. Chapattis are eaten with the food by using a piece of chapatti to scoop the food from one of the dishes.For a chain restaurant, the Thali was great and a good portion. It's not ""home made"" Indian food, but it's food that's tasty and you can try different combos. After walking an entire day around London, this did the job for a casual sit down. Definitely make a reservation if you're going to eat at 6pm and after or be prepared to wait and wait at this location.",1,1,1,,

The food was excellent, including the kabobs, butter chicken, rogan josh, thali, pav bhaji, chaat, etc. however, I had a terrible experience at this location. Yesterday, I came to this location for dinner. After a wait, we were seated and I ordered a lassi and then lamb seekh kabob and garlic naan. After 20 min, the kabob came out but the naan did NOT. After failing to get a waiters attention, I finally flagged one down and told her about the naan. She noted it and then continued working. 15 min later, still no naan. I finally flagged another server and she said she'd get us a naan. 10 min later, the naan showed up. It was flat, doughy, undercooked, and there was NO garlic. If you order garlic naan and you are being charged EXTRA for it being a garlic naan, there better actually be some garlic! And this wasn't a naan! This was a doughy chapati! And I know Masala Zone can do better since I had a good naan at the Bayswater location. I finally got the attention of the original server and asked him to send it back. He apologized briefly and offered to get me another one and check with the kitchen. 10 min later he finally came back and just said ""apologies for the naan"" and then went off again. We wanted the bill but the servers did not come by for another 10 min. Finally he came over and explained that he hadn't charged us for the naan and he had taken off the service charge. I was very disappointed by the customer service at this location and I probably won't be coming back. It's a shame.",-1,-1,-1,,

I ordered the Indian yoghurt drink and it tasted great. The food was amazing and everything was perfectly flavored. It was proportionate and filling. The service was good. A reservation is probably a good idea for this location since it was packed before 8 pm on a Saturday night.",1,1,1,,
1267,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,3,"Three stars indicates just ok, but let's be clear, I actually like the food here just fine. It's not your momma's cooking, no, but it's fresh, clean-tasting, and everything actually tastes different (you know the ol' takeaway curry joint trick of making a giant vat of bland base gravy and then just adding a dash of tomato paste, saag, spices, etc to make it into separate dishes, yeah? yeah, this place doesn't do that, as far as I can tell).I would say that the stand-out dishes are almost exclusively the veg ones. Chicken tends to be a little dry and tired; lamb tends to be only ok. The veggie offerings are really quite nice, with a good range of starches and pulses and some solid paneer-based offerings.Thalis are a good size.So why the three stars? Primarily it comes down to price. Yeah, you can come in, get just a veg thali (å£11.15) and their cheapest drink (tea or filter coffee, I believe, at å£1.80) and have lunch for å£14.57 when you add in gratuity. But that's an expensive lunch for Soho when you can get a solid, fresh falafel wrap etc for under å£7 with a drink around the corner. And let's be real, you don't want just the thali: you want to try the appetisers (all sadly overpriced and not good value for the size, also generally underwhelming in terms of taste) and have a drink (also expensive), and maybe tack on a second curry to pad out your thali (å£3.50). The last time we went (yesterday, actually), we dropped just under å£60--ouch!--for lunch: lassi, iced tea, thali with extra curry, a curry main, two appetisers, two desserts (both of which were awful), a tea, and a coffee.What gets my (roast) goat here is that the pricing always feels vaguely like a scam about to happen. It's always a little different; this time it was ""If you order a main and a drink, it's 20% off!"" Hey, that sounds really good-- no, wait. ""The 20% off is already reflected in the menu. If you want the full-price menu, we can offer it."" What even is this? Seriously, guys. It's not classy, and your poor servers have to keep explaining it like it's reasonable. Don't do it. Just admit your food is grossly overpriced and then offer a discount from the price you want to charge, if that's what you're after.Food also does take forever to come out. Granted, yeah, things are being made mostly to order, but let's be real, the kitchen doesn't hustle, and there's no excuse for dessert (pre-made sweets and a lump of ice cream) taking 15 minutes to appear. Basically, you can't just nip in for a quick lunch here. Set aside two and a half hours.I don't hate this place, though I do sort of hate how it's structured. But after this last wallet-searing experience, I'm done. I really am. So, how about it, fellow Yelpers: is there a decent Indian place anywhere near-ish to Soho?",-1,-1,-1,,

I head things like ""it's really good"" and ""there are clearly Indians making the food *and* eating there..."". I guess I should have asked for more elaborate descriptions.For a chain (famous last words), it's good. Better than just okay. You walk into the restaurant and it's undeniably aromatic, fresh spice and charred goodness emanating from the tandoor. Your palate whet with anticipation.My date and I dined on the Dari Puri and Goan Crispy Prawns to start. I didn't detect any chickpea in the Dari Puri, nor any chutney (perhaps it was the drizzle), but there was sure a mouthful of yogurt. The Goan Crispy Prawns were more crispy than prawn, and tremendously greasy. For our mains we had the Paneer Makhanwalla and Roghan Josh. Both mediocre, lacking the signature depth that we've all come to know and love from Indian cuisine, and falling a bit flat. The portion size was also slightly less than satiating.  Moral of the story: in a pinch, lack of similar alternatives, and need to get away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford and Regent, duck in here... it won't be offensive.",-1,-1,1,,

One of my friends is Indian and she thought the gol guppa were too tiny and were not filled with enough filling.  My favourite dish was the ghel, a puff rice and peanut salad.

Food which claims to be ""Street Food"", rather than the typical Chicken Tikka Masala.It's the only place I've had a salt lassi with herbs (and that isn't a type of dog).Tip: although the Thali is really cost-effective, you can easily fall into the trap of mixing everything up and getting an oddly featureless mush.  Discipline is needed to try to eat one thing at a time.  I've given up on that now, and go for the starter, main course, dessert route, to guarantee more distinct tastes.",1,-1,1,,

Thali is a medley of different dishes served on large platters.

The menu has a lot to offer and we ordered a butter chicken and thali with a coconut chicken base. Both were tasty. Other people at our table also got different thali meats, beef and veggies. Reason for 3 star was due to service. After we just sat down our waiter asked if we want an appetizer and we said no but ordered drinks. After 10 mins we got our beers and then ordered.  We ended up ordering an appetizer and the waiter made a smart remark ""oh now you want an appetizer"" we didn't say anything. After everyone dishes started to come out we got our butter chicken but no thali. We waited till everyone else at the table got their food and after a good 5mins I had to ask for it. The waiter grabbed his pad and doubled check everyone's order and said oh I'll get it now so it looks like the kitchen either missed our order or a runner brought our food to someone else. By the time we got the thali everyone else was done eating so we rushed to finished ours. We also asked for water 3 times and didn't get it till the end of the night.

The meat is cooked decently, never dry, and the curries have a great combination of flavours. The fact that the majority of your meal is in fact vegetarian and still fantastically tasty is testament to the chefs here (yeah, I'll say it, a lot of vegetarian food is bland and pointless)At full price the dish is decent value; at half price I'm planning my return trip on the way out of the door.Oh, one word of warning. Don't order the masala cola. Grim.Update on the taste london card discount: they no longer do it.

I had the tandoori chicken wrap which was filling but not particularly flavoursome. My friend had a small thali and she was very happy with that.

However when that chain has the parentage of the much respected Veeraswamy and Chutney Mary restauarants you tend to ignore that. Indeed as a 'chain' it has grown considerably but the quality of the food has not changed since there were one or two of them.Thankfully I have at least a good enough comparison of food having been to India and living in an area where there is a large Indian community and award winning restaurants. So I can say that this is very well done and very well presented food. The spicing is as it should be and pungently aromatic at times. Well priced for the West End and with friendly and efficient service, this is a favourite of mine.It can easily cater for couples or groups as they have tables of varying sizes. The menu caters for what they call 'street food' and is presented really as a fast food Indian experience. But that would be doing it down as these dishes are well worth savouring. It's not a restaurant to bring a romantic date nor is it one where the wine list will leave you breathless but for excellent and extremely tasty Indian food, well presented and efficiently served, you can't go wrong.",1,1,1,,

And the garlic baby spinach dish from the side order menu is a must have which we always share no matter what else we order.Don't let the fact it's a casual dining chain keep you away - Masala Zone is under the same ownership as the fantastic and upscale Veeraswamy on Regent Street (which you must treat yourself to at least once in this lifetime).",1,1,1,,

The chaat may not be as grand as that which you get in Delhi or Mumbai but it comes darn close.For mains we ordered the regular 'thali' and there wasn't one thing in there that we could complain about.

The Thali plates come with a bunch of little bowls filled with dal, various vegetables, yogurt, and other things that are great for dipping. You also get to choose a curry. I can personally vouch for the butter chicken, chicken mangalore, and the other spicy green chicken curry.The prices are already pretty reasonable, but if you want to have a very reasonably priced meal and there are two of you, try splitting a Grand Thali and throwing in an extra nan. You can also throw in an extra side bowl of curry.

Would you expect to be brought to a chain restaurant?  Let's just say I was mildly furious at the lack of effort. Let's also acknowledge that the term 'mildly' is an understatement. So I have to say the only curry I had before this was on a flight on Air India on which I was weighing the probability of statistical outcome on which would kill me first:  the shotty plane, the pilot that seemed to like to create turbulance where it probably didn't exist, or the botched airline food that came in containers, none of which I could identify other than the one that said ""water""... So this being my first ""curry"" and living in the land of ""curry or go home"" I expected to prepare and deliver some speech on how ""oh gosh, this is what I've been missing, I feel so cultured""  but instead I recited, ""hmm ok... well, thanks for ordering for me.""Maybe Indian food isn't for me, it was ok, I've since walked by what seems like zillions of Masala Zones and have yet to be tempted to go back in.  As my date pointed out, there were other Indian people eating there and that was a good indication, so apparently it's somewhere close to legit.  I've been taken to two other places since then, one was supposed to be the top top top amazing and one was apparently supposed to be ""pretty good' for Brick lane standards, and they all tasted and looked the same to me but had different price tags.  I say this with the caveat that I'm apparently not a curry-person, but if someone is making me go get one with them, I'd rather just go to Brick lane.",-1,-1,-1,,

However, since I only ever come here about once every year and it is pretty low on my list of places to go for an indian, I think honestly, the verdict is leaning towards ""no, I don't particularly like it"".  My friend and I arrived at peak hour- just after 8 and were asked to wait for a few minutes to be seated- however, during the 10 minutes we waited, there was a table close to the door that was free, and lo and behold! that was our table.  I guess this was to be expected as all the staff seemed very busy and in my personal opinion, the restaurant could have benefited from at least 1 if not 2 more servers this evening.  I was impressed that the staff were calm and friendly after running around in frenzy, although they did forget our extra order of poppadoms and had to be prompted for them.We both had the butter chicken thali and the chicken was good, spices were well balanced.  The chapati was a large round pita/ naan without substance rather than a traditional chapati, so I was a little disappointed as I expected well, a chapati.  Personal bugbear of highly spiced poppadom was here and the daal tasted like Chinese red bean (aduki bean) soup without the sugar, underspiced and under salted (total failure in my point of view).  Aloo gobi was ok and the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced.  Actually I take that back; the poppadom was so over spiced, I believed the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced- I am not entirely sure on that one.I really like the idea of a fast food type thali restaurant serving good quality Indian food at reasonable prices.  However, I also believe that good indian food is delicately spiced- i.e. bursting with flavor; you can taste all the spices but not all screaming bloody murder in your mouth at the same time, then replaced by a bland hotness.  Masala zone comes in a little heavy handed with their spices, and that is just not the kind of indian that makes me food happy...  I want to taste be able to taste all the different dishes, I don't want to just slop different types of goop in my mouth.All in all, I probably won't come back for at least another year, and by that time I would probably have forgotten what made me upset about the Masala Zone.

That and the fact that their food is quite good.Their focus is thalis, and in my mind, this really is the best way to serve Indian food if you're not into the ""all you can eat buffet"" kind of thing.  A thali is pretty much a complete meal served on a large steel platter.  The rice is in the center and it is surrounded by small bowls (katoris) of condiments, side dishes, and whatever the kitchen was in the mood for making that day.The ordering process is a little confusing at first, but easily understandable:Step 1: Decide on which thali you want, regular or grand.Step 2: Decide on your main protein or veg (e.g. chicken, prawn, veggie, etc.)Step 3: Decide on the style of your main protein or veg (e.g. curry, tikka masala, butter chicken, etc.)Step 4: Wait for your platter and chow down.Thalis come in regular or grand, and they're a pretty good deal ranging from 9-12 pounds for a complete meal.  Papadum are so thin, you can almost see through them.  Chapatis are whole wheat and have a nice texture too.Staff are friendly and eager to guide you through the maze of choices on their menu.Atmosphere and decor is hip and casual.Complain all you want about the chain restaurant thang, but I'd kill for a masala zone here in the States.",1,1,1,,

There is also a nice section of starters, which can be ordered separately.For me, the food is competent and the portions are generous but the flavour is average. Perhaps I'm spoiled by having the curry houses of Tooting so close to home. However, I do still return here when I'm in town and fancy a curry for one.",-1,-1,1,,

If you're ever unfortunate to walk into one of these places, might I suggest negotiating 10% off the menu price first. They usually oblige and you might feel a bit better knowing you salvaged something to go with that slab of ghee swimming in your belly.Masala Zone have thrived in part due to any lack of alternative choices but also through innovation (or modernisation), if I can call it that: Big, illustrated and descriptive menus; a bright interior; spacious seating; and well trained waiting staff that don't wear waistcoats. Most importantly of course is the food which I found to be a commendable effort. Previous visits with friends have taken in their renowned Thalis - a complete meal on a tray made up of several small dishes - and they've kinda dissapointed. The meat curry dishes aren't swimming in oil but at the detriment of any real flavours. Same with the vegetable dishes which were slightly on the cold side. At å£11 for a thali, I'd also question the value - sure the variety seems impressive but an espresso cupful of rice, some shredded onions with green bits and a pot of minty yoghurt does not fool the tummy.This recent visit with my buddy Nige saw us share: he, his lamb madras and I, my chicken mangalore. Supplemented with rice, chapatis and garlic spinach. For little more than a couple of thalis I'd say that it was a more fulfilling eating experience.The madras was delicious - heavy on the chilli and tempered by tamarind. Lamb seemed a tad overcooked but it could've been a bit too lean. The Mangalore chicken was just right in it's combination of spice and coconut, with ginger being most prominent. The chicken was a bit dry though and I'm finding this to be a common occurence in all their meat dishes.We decided on the Rasmalai for a sweet thing but other choices are standards - Golub Jamun, falouda (a sweet drink with colourful noodles) and kulfi almond ice cream. Rasmalai was a great choice - light, spongey, milky patties soaked in a saffron flavoured milk sauce and topped with pistachios went down a treat with the chai teas.Masala Zone is a pretty good Indian that provides a more contempory experience to the traditional restaurant and if they figured out a way of serving meat that isn't overcooked to a high turnover of customers then I'd say it'd be excellent.This was my second visit and it was a more positive experience than the first one.å£40 for the two of us which includes 2 mains, rice, chapatis, sides, drinks, desserts and chais.",-1,1,1,,

It helps that I live right next door but that isn't the only reason why I keep coming back. I love fresh food with flavor at bargain prices and that is exactly what I get here! How do I know it's fresh? Well, I see the delivery truck loaded with fresh fruit and veg everyday! Furthermore, I can smell the delish aromas of real Indian cooking creeping through the crevices of my windows and doors everyday! Typically my partner and I will order the regular sized thalis. The thali is basically like a set meal which comes with  sides of veg, potato, and lentils of the day, along with two sauces to eat with your popadoms, and then of course the main which is normally rice with whatever curry you choose. I usually go for the Prawn Malai. To me this curry is a perfect blend of creamy coconut milk based sauce with a barely there spice. My partner likes to get the Lamb Korma. I am a pescatarian so I cant personally comment on this curry, but I take it from the numerous people that have tried this dish that it is pretty damn good.  There isn't really any difference between the regular and large thali as you aren't getting larger portions with the latter. In fact, the extra bit is some naan bread, little salad, and small samosa. Regular thalis are about å£6-7. I definitely recommend this set as you'll get to taste a little of everything without spending more.  Dining in is also a nice option since staff are very congenial! The place itself is not posh but more casual. The look they're going for is maybe an underground clay like hut but creative and Indian inspired nonetheless. Compare this place to all the little restaurants on Brick Lane and Masala Zone would still come out on top for me.

1347,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,5,"Masala Zone is the little sister of the stalwart Chutney Mary and Veeraswamy. Voted best value Indian in Soho by Timeout magazine, it's a fantastic Indian restaurant that has a great location, feels like a proper restaurant (to people like me who're usually on a budget anyway!) and doesn't break the bank. Masala Zone is built in a split level kind of way and has a lot of room - but it is so popular, you may have to wait a few minutes before you get a table, especially if you visit on Friday or Saturday night. I don't think it is possible to book ahead. The decor is nice and uncluttered with none of the kitsch that afflicts most Indian restaurants. The kitchen is located behind a glass panel and you can watch the chefs put your food together from the dining room. The service is polite and friendly and very quick. The food is essentially North Indian with a lot of curry and rice combinations. The chilli factor is clearly indicated and quite accurate. Try the double chilli options only if you really like spicy food! They also have a nice Indian drinks section, with the yoghurt based lassi being the thickest, creamiest lassi I've had in this country. Nimbu pani is the Indian lemonade and they also do a mean masala chai among other things. They have a liquor licence so you can also order from a selection of wines, beers, and a limited selection of cocktails. Everything I've eaten here has been good but among the starters a special mention goes to the seekh kabab which just melts in your mouth. The curries are all good; I haven't tried the noodle pots but if they really are the Indian version of Chinese (which is NOTHING like real Chinese!), then they should be worth a try. Their thalis seem to be very popular and are great value for money. Thalis are basically a full Indian meal served on a large metal plate (aka a thali). There are options in terms of the number of items you want and you can choose at least one of the items but in general a thali contains 2-3 vegetable curries, an optional non vegetarian curry, a poppadum, some rice, a lentil dish, and some sweet chutney. They also do a special ayurvedic thali for diabetics though I haven't tried this. In terms of prices, considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's located in Soho, it's very good value. My husband and I have stuffed ourselves for å£55 for two people but we've also gone as a group of 4, and the bill has come to å£68. It's possible to have a good meal and a drink there for under å£15. So all in all, Masala Zone is great place to eat if you're in Central London.",1,1,1,,
1348,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,5,"masala zone. i love you.its funny. since ive moved here, about once a week i crave Indian food. some might argue that Masala Zone isnt that great, but for what it is, its pretty fantastic. its reliable, its fast, it tastes amazing. any questions?it serves until 11, so my friends and i often meet here before a night out. only once has the service been bad - and that time it was a nightmare - but the management took care of part of our bill with out us even saying anything, just reading the looks of horror on our faces. and hey, ive been back again, so...and their toilets are labeled ""Toilet Zone."" if thats not hilarious, i dont know what is....",1,1,1,,
1349,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,4,"Very tasty and great atmosphere. All in all, I really enjoyed dinner here and would definitely recommend it. The thali dishes are excellent- little tasty bowls of curry, with veg dishes, popadoms and sauces. The wine was very drinkable and reasonably priced. The restaurant was clean, toilets clean etc. Staff were friendly, but did forget to bring the tap water we requested with our wine.There is a variety of dishes available, so all tastes (and levels of spice!) should be catered for.",1,1,1,,
1350,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,4,"I'll go along with the majority of other Qypers who rate this casual dining, Indian restaurant very favourably. This is new generation Indian dining, a whole different kettle of fish than the after pub type places that don't make any effort because the customers are all trolleyed. Well spiced food, meat eaters and veggies well catered for. Not to much oil and I would guess no artificial colourings used. They serve beer. Stainless steel thali style presentation. Well spaced, adequately comfortable tables and seating. Contemporary decor. Top marks, fully recommended.",1,1,1,,

I was dubious at first and thought it looked like a standard chain serving bland food. How wrong was I?! Our very friendly and helpful waiter had us seated in no time and our order was taken equally promptly. The food was delicious and the portions weren't too big. We all had a great time and it set us up nicely for a good night",1,1,1,,

Once I even dared to complaine about a korma I had ordered in Goa, as I found it sour tasting. The chef was not impressed and I got the feeling I wouldn't be welcomed back The Masala Zone in Soho leaves me without complaint, and no matter how hard I try to find fault, I'm always left hushed. Every dish on the menu is mouth watering, the starters are gorgeous and the mains are divine. If your lucky enough to have any room in your tummy left then indulge in an Indian desert of coconut ice cream, probably the nicest thing to come out of Asia since silk. A meal for two with drinks shouldn't set you back more then 30 pound.",1,1,1,,
1354,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,5,One of the things we wanted to try when we visited the UK was Indian food.  Masala Zone did not disappoint!  It was some of the best food we had on our European vacay.  Everything on our thali plate was delectable!  It was a great dining experience and a nice way to end our trip.,1,1,1,,
1355,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,3,Nice restaurant deco....except the day I visited the air-con wasn't working and it was extrememly hot.  I had the lam and the mint apple juice.  I love the apple juice.  The food was decent and has a nice selection of sides.  This places emphasis is on vegetables.  Decent food but average for Indian food.,-1,-1,1,,
1356,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,5,very tasty food. price is also good compared to the portion size. nice staff and atmosphere. i'll going to this place again!,1,1,1,,
1357,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,4,This is modernized Indian food at its best. Clean restaurant with more mainstream type dÌ©cor. It can get quite busy on weekends but the service is quick so that's usually not a major issue once you get a table. The staff are friendly and sincere and food was delicious. The menu is extensive and the vegetarian options are excellent. Highly recommended.,1,1,1,,
1358,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,2,"It was one unfortunate evening when the restaurant we had planned to go for dinner was not what we expected, and without a table reservation we ended up wandering along the streets of Soho with no luck of finding a restaurant with table  for six persons. Masala Zone was the only one welcoming us, and hungry and thirsty we were just glad to get into a any place.The impression I got from the restaurant is that they offer fast food with Indian influence. My dish was actually very extraordinary mix of potato and banana (yes!) in a curry sauce and not bad at all. Creative at least! My friends experiences varied, but overall the food was ok. It was the service that gave us the empty feeling. The waitresses were really fast, and little too effective, and gave us this in-and-out fast food restaurant feeling. You know as soon as you lie your fork and knife on the empty plate, it vanishes! We felt like we were pushed out as by that time there was already queue to this restaurant as well but that just left us a bit disappointed by the experience.",-1,-1,-1,,
1359,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,3,"Good quality curry house that also opens on Sunday nights, unlike a lot of Soho restaurants. My girlfriend loves the thali, but I have one big problem with the place: they don't like people with nut allergies. Mention that you have a nut allergy in here and they present you with a bright yellow card informing you that if you eat one of their dishes and they happen to have chucked a brazil nut in it, then it's your own fault if you end up dead. Ask for the nut-free menu and you get a list that's barely one-eighth of the full menu. Is it too much to ask to eat something other than lamb rogan josh? Apart from that, the restaurant is both clean and speedy.",-1,-1,-1,,
1360,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,2,"I didn't find this to be an enjoyable experience overall. The time I went it was noisey, a bit too noisey and I couldn't hear the waiter properly but he didn't seem much interested either. The food seemed to be favouring heat rather than flavour and we both felt disappointed especially as it came on a good recommendation. I would have to agree with another poster here it did have a McMasala feel to it. Not somewhere I would go again as I prefer somewhere with a more intimate feel.",-1,-1,-1,,

For that reason I believe i'm hard to please.I have heard these people has something to do with Camelia Panjabi, an indian cook living in London. I bought her book and I thought the recipes were rubbish. The same book they promote for the web. Irrelevant? let's talk about the restaurant then.Masala zone looks like of the interior decorator of Macdonalds came to advice them. It's indian and so cliche that feels really unnatural. You could feel the chainish effect in the waiting system, in their uniforms.then10 minutes for a Masala coke, which is great, but 3poundsand gosh, is just lemon juice, mint and coriander (i reckon) with coke.food? I do better butter chicken. Roghan josh was of sorts, so was naan. service was unhelpful.With so many indian restaurants In london i certainly can't see the point in McMasala, Try little restaurants in esta London. they always deliver",-1,1,1,,

I was a little unsure when my mate at work told me about Masala Zone as I thought it would be another restaurant that serves unauthentic indian cuisine. I was so wrong. It's the best indian food is found in people's homes, in india. The menus present an exciting combination of flavours and offerings. we have something for everyone- freshly prepared. The quality of ingredients, the presentation and quality are not compromised by the price level. Meal for 2 person, without alcohol comes to about å£15 per person. Value for money.",1,1,1,,

This is especially good for those of us who can't decide as it offers a bit of everything in small bowls. Okra, Chicken, Fish, dahl and rice all in one big combo dish. THey serve Kiran beer at a reasonable price and the waiters are extremely friendly and helpful.",1,1,1,,
1366,indian,ye849AFuZlwSvdZ7KuOpYA,Masala Zone Soho,1,"A definite no no. A while back I don't doubt that the quality of the food was good but the freshness of the food is somewhat questionable, probably due to the fact that the restaurant was pretty much deserted.On entering we had to wait in the entrance for 15 minutes (timed - no exaggeration) before being seated. Fine. Bad service doesn't particularly bother me - if the food is good, I couldn't care less.My friends and I ordered vegetarian thalis. On reading the terrible reviews before my visit I had braced myself for the worst, but it was worse than I could imagine. The starters were okay albeit overpriced but as they were cold starters it was bearable.The thali was the worst indian food I was ever tasted.The poppadums within 1 minute had become soggy and there was no liquid on my plate but they tasted stale and were not crisp in the slightest, instead they had the texture of wet cardboard. The curries were COLD and I don't mean tepid, I mean COLD! They were completely lacking spice which is fine, I don't particularly want to eat food which has me running around screaming for water, but there was absolutely no flavour. So I had been presented with poor service, stale poppadoms, old cold tastless curries and at a price which is certainly not unbeatable!!Don't make the mistake I did in just taking a chance, because I can assure you it will not pay off!",-1,-1,-1,,
