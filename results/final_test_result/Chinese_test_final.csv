Yeah alright, let's go.+ probably one of the nicest staffs I came across in the city+ it's like a low-grade Panda Express with their set up+ Shit was bangin' and delicious+ Had the sweet/spicy chili chicken, oh shit it was delicious but...+ Had an authentic feel to it- sweet/spicy chili chicken was spicy affffffffI sat outside and had a couple people walk by and ask questions about it...in turn, I told them it was amazing and they went inside...so I wasn't the only customer that was happy at that moment.",1,1,1
1,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Who goes to London and has Chinese food? Me of course. I've been to London a few times and I don't always want to have fish & chips with mushy peas, I decided to come to this place for dinner to stuff my face with Chinese noodles.The place is located in a place that has lots of foot traffic, the restaurant itself is not that big, there will be a lot of people outside waiting for seating so one of the girls comes out and gives out menus so you already know what you want, when you've decided what you want, she'll take down the order and at the same time try to find you a table.So now you come to your table, your finish ordering and they get to work, they're fast with the orders, I ordered some noodles with roast pork I believe and also some dumplings I believe, I have to say, the taste is amazing, full of taste, you can taste the spices, the meat and the consistency, delicious!If you're in London and want noodles, yes, this is it, beware, it gets full but be patient because at the end of the wait you will be rewarded with a bowl of noodles that is big and plenty with great flavors all around.",1,1,1
2,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"My family and I visited London for a few days and were looking for a nice noodle place we could visit for lunch. We were in the Covent Garden Area and were looking for somewhere close and saw Lanzhou Noodle Bar through Yelp. The reviews seem pretty mixed in that some people don't recommend because of the service, but our experience was wholly positive.We were seated very quickly downstairs which was nice for us because it seemed cooler than the upstairs area. We ordered two water bottles straight ahead and sat with the menus to decide for a little bit. My mom ended up getting the fried noodles (G1 on the menu Dao Xia Mian), and my dad and I ordered the mixed beef noodle soup (G21 with Dao Xiao Mian). I wouldn't recommend the G21 if you're not good with intestines and stuff, but if you like it then I highly recommend it! We also got the pork and chive dumplings which was so great !All the food was really delicious and super filling! Could've ordered less probably since we came for lunch, but did not regret ordering! Everything was also very cheap and it's 10% off if you pay with cash! A must try if you're in the area!! Go try!! (Side note: not sure how this compares to actual Chinese hand pulled noodles because my family is Korean, but the hand pulled noodles were delicious to us! )",1,1,1
3,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"This place is so unassuming and very easy to pass by because it looks like a bad Chinese buffet, like the ones you see on the main strip in Chinatown. But actually it's probably one of the best places to get a decent bowl of noodles in all of London, not least because they pull and slice the noodles by hand. The menu is actually quite vast but I would skip the rice dishes and just pick a noodle dish. You can't go wrong with lanzhou beef in either la mian (hand pulled) or dao xiao (knife cut.) get it with a soup and you're golden. It's like being in China. The service is FAST because the chefs never stop. Literally almost the second you order, the food will arrive. Turnover is quick but there's no pressure to eat quickly. You'll probably want to dash though because the place is small and not very relaxing. å£8.5 is about reasonable for central London. My previous favourite (Bao Inn Š¼¼¾¡ÔŒÉÂ__•_äincreased their price to å£11.5. Needless to say... We're no longer on speaking terms. Check it out if you're nearby. Better than most places in Chinatown.",1,1,1
4,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"It's a small and cramped little hole in the wall, the noodles are hand made a few feet from where you will be seated. The noodles are fresh, the service is efficient, and there was a huge line out the door waiting for a seat.The food itself was rather mediocre, nothing crazy different then other handmade noodle shops I tried in Vancouver.It was worth a bite, especially if you're in the mood for chewy noodles.",-1,1,1
5,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"Don't get me wrong, I love noodles. I love all types of noodles. If I had to choose between noodles and rice, I don't hesitant to pick noodles.So I came here thinking I'll have the best noodles ever. This wasn't the case. This is your hole in the wall type of establishment, it's small, crowded, loud busy. Your tables are pushed close to each other - it reminds me of Asia in many ways. In terms of the food, it wasn't all that great. It was just okay. I suppose the noodles were satisfying but I don't really care enough to come back. If the food was better, the ambiance wouldn't bother me as much. Usually, if it's a busy, crowded establishment, I would expect stellar food but this is not the case.Why is it so crowded? Not really sure why, maybe people like this type of atmosphere or they are satisfied with the mediocrity of the food? This place may have a lot of reviews and hyped all over the internet but I don't believe it.",-1,-1,-1
6,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"Worst meal of my trip.We ordered two chicken noodle soups and a sweet and sour noodle with tofu. The soup was a big mistake. The chicken was flavorless and had a rubbery consistency. The  tofu noodle dish was just ok, and it took FOREVER to come. In fact, we were about to get the check and just leave when it finally came.I really don't recommend dining in due to the small size of the restaurant and the slow service. Don't recommend for takeaway either.",-1,-1,-1
7,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Tiny place with great noodles! We stopped here after traveling for over 12 hours and beef noodle soup was the perfect comfort food that I needed after our journey. I've had lots of hand-pulled noodles but the texture of the ones here is definitely near / at the top of my list. The soup was good as well, but the noodle texture is what really stood out. One star off for service / experience - we shared a table with another couple and, when I asked about the super-thin noodles (you can ask for different thin-ness of noodles), the waitress told me that the regular was just fine (which, how did she know that? I'm into super thin noodles so I felt somewhat miffed...) Luckily the noodles did turn out to be good, hence the four stars, but I'm pretty sure I would've loved the super thin ones too. Skip the other food - we also had an eggplant appetizer and curry chicken and they were both meh. Just get noodles!",1,1,1
8,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"A good place for a reasonably priced meal in the expensive city! I had a sudden craving for noodles and was content to find this place where they have hand made noodles! I got the handmade noodles with roasted duck. The bowl was just enough to be satisfied. The broth was pretty light but still really flavorful. I happily slurped up my noodles as they were really chewy, just how I liked them. The duck was okay. It was good but nothing amazing. Surprisingly, I didn't get super thirsty like I usually do after eating at a Chinese restaurant. Definitely a plus!",1,1,1
9,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Went at about 6:30 on a busy Saturday night.  Despite only having a few seats, I was seated in less than 5 minutes.  Food came out in less than 5 more.  They key is they have an employee passing out menus and taking orders while you wait outside.  I ordered the Dan Dan noodle soup.  Excellent!",1,1,1
10,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"I came here craving for Chinese hand pulled noodle soup after reading decent reviews. I was really let down by both the service and the food.First of all, the servers rushed me in to sit down and then gave me almost no time to even look at the menu before approaching me for my order. I later ordered a chicken dan dan noodle, which was not as described at all. The dan dan noodle broth was watery and plain, when the authentic version of it should be thick, rich and peanut-y. I had to add a lot of hot sauce to make it more flavourful. The noodles were the biggest disappointment as they gave me soggy rice noodles, when I was under the impression that it should've been a thicker hand-pulled noodle. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing on the menu. Overall I was disappointed.",-1,-1,1
11,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,Legit noodles here that are made by hand. Small but worth the food. Expect good food and nothing else.  Recommended !!!!,1,1,1
12,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"After a week in Italy, I didn't know how much I would miss eating vegetables until I found myself shoveling bok choi into my mouth from the delicious vegetable la-mian soup. They make the hand pulled noodles on the spot. While I can't guarantee that the broth was vegetarian, it was very flavorful and the noodles were just perfection!My boyfriend, deciding to maintain a veggie-free diet, ate the fujian special mix peanut sauce on la-mian noodles and the flavor was just through the roof. So delicious and so cheap! Perfect little spot to go to if you're looking for cheap eats in Convent Garden.",1,1,1
13,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"The food is okay but not great. Had langzhou or xi'an noodle in a few US cities and this is at most  average.The space is very small and underground. They had to move the tables to squeeze me in and I sat super close to many other people. The person eating facing me in the tiny table made a lot of noise eating. The table was greasy. With many people packed in the tiny space I felt difficult to eat.No idea why so many people come to eat...",-1,-1,-1
14,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Hard working people literally pounding away at your hand made noodles as you wait. They have downstairs seating so don't get discouraged if you don't see any seats.Extensive menu! Go for the noodles. It's giant.",1,1,1
15,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,Hand pulled noodles made in front of you. This tastes like Hong Kong. The broth is delicious. Servings are quite large. I wish I had more space in my belly to eat. Seating is super small and is usually crowded.,1,1,1
16,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"When I was walking around, I was wondering if they had pho around here in London. The closest pho place was too far from me so I found this place on yelp. There's definitely a huge difference between Chinese noodles and pho but this place makes it taste similar to pho. The broth was pretty good and the noodles are thick, just the way I like it, also my soup had a good amount of chicken as well. Thankfully though it was just me eating inside there and I say that because it's really small and tight there, it's not a type of place you go to with a group of friends.",1,-1,-1
17,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Cheap but authentic Chinese hand pulled or knife cut noodles. I doubt you'll find a more real experience anywhere else in London.First, everyone working here is Chinese from the little lady barking seating instructions at the entrance to the cooks eating their own wares while pumping out dishes in no time.I think it was the comedian Russell Peters who joked you get your food within seconds of ordering at a Chinese restaurant. Here, the joke plays it in real life as it is comical how quickly your orders go from kitchen to table. I had one arm out of he sleeve of my coat when our entire four person order was in front of us.We had the beef noodle soup (knife cut noodles) and the stir fry char siu noodles (knife cut). We also had their spicy Chinese cabbage (which was just kimchi lol) and the potato shears dish. Had a few egg rolls for good measure but they were only ok.Everything here is quick, cheap, and is legitimately Chinese comfort food. Our parents thought it lacked quality flavor though and the broth and ingredients are definitely on the cheaper side. But where else in all of London will you find good knife cut noodles for less than 7 pounds? They accept card and your whole party must be there to be seated. Cramped tiny space so be prepared to be elbow to elbow with your neighbor. Water is an additional charge.",1,-1,-1
18,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"You may easily miss this hole in the wall but you would be sorry. With a large menu that has something to please everyone, you will surely find something worth eating here.Space is limited but I managed to get a shared table in the back with a friend. We both got noodle soups - your choice of noodles with proteins either dry or in a soup. The fried pork chops were flavourful in a clear broth. It came with Chinese greens and herbs. My friend enjoyed her choice of braised beef noodle. Simple and delicious!We also shared the red oil wonton. Wontons were cooked perfectly in a spicy and tangy sauce with garlic and chilli oil. I would order this again.Cheap and cheerful is what it's all about here.",1,1,1
19,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,Delicious noodles and dumplings. We went for the dry noodles with minced beef and fried noodles with sliced pork.,1,1,1
20,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"I was desperately craving noodle soup after spending 3 days in London eating the typical british fare (fish and chips, curries, etc). I need something asian and tasty so I decided to come here. I was not disappointed! I ordered the beef noodle soup with the thinner noodles. They have both types here, thicker knife cut noodles and the thin ones and they are both hand pulled. You can also order them with or without soup. I also decided to add a pickled egg to mine.To me, the broth really makes the soup and it was really flavorful without being salty. I also didn't taste any msg in the soup, it tasted homemade. The beef was also very tender and tasted amazing with some of the chili sauce provided at the table.I was traveling only for a couple days in London so I decided to pay the extra 15% to use my credit card versus paying with cash. Note: this is a small, hole in the wall type place so you might need to share a table.",1,1,1
21,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"Hand made noodles, prepared and cooked with the worst quality ingredients imaginable. The food is stored in a Panda Express-like display at the entrance, which was pretty off putting. We came expecting fresh, traditional Chinese food. Upon entering were seated on the lower floor, a tiny cramped space with a few tables pushed so closely together that you bump elbows with other patrons around you. The walls are painted neon yellow, and there are no windows. Not one to be scared off by a diver interior, I was still hopeful, and happy to find plenty of vegan options on the menu. I got a Stir Fried Vegetable Noodle, which was disgusting. It tasted like cheap two day old Chow Mien. The noodles were overcooked and rubbery, tasting only of soy sauce, and the vegetables were soaked in oil. My boyfriend got a beef noodle dish that was equally inedible. We shared the Vinegar Cauliflower, which had good flavors but was nothing special. I have no idea how this place is so highly rated. Perhaps my standards are too high, having had great authentic food in China and the US. However, the lack of quality and flavor in our food here leaves me to strongly suggest dining elsewhere. I give two stars only because the food was dirt cheap-å£18 for three large portions (which we barely touched, but still). Avoid.",-1,-1,-1
22,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Lanzhou Noodle Bar? More like mama's home cooked noodle bar.I've come here maybe ten times now and every single time there is a different combination of food that I am ingesting. From lamb kabobs to spring rolls to dumplings to beef soup to egg & tomato cuts  - lanzhou is awesome.And perhaps most people's least favorite parts is one of my favorites - getting to squeeze in with your compadres at tables made for 8 seating 6 different parties ordering at different times just slurping the noods into your mouth.Hats off to you Lanzhou for bringing a bit of light into a gloomy city.",1,1,1
23,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"I have ascended to Valhalla. I have glimpsed what lies beyond this realm of mortal men.And it's all thanks to Lanzhou Noodle Bar.~ Atmosphere:Tiny, dingy, and extremely chaotic. They only have a few long tables that they pile everyone on so get comfy because you'll be squashed up next to complete strangers. Getting out of the restaurant is a nightmare as well since the place to pay at is right by the tiny entrance way where loads of people are coming in and out. Basically, this restaurant is as close as you'll get to actually being in China.~ Customer Service:They were really quick and efficient. The food came out at the speed of light. Not friendly, but they get you what you need.~ Food:Terrific. Can't say enough good things about it. I recommend you skip ordering the non-noodles though, to be honest. In addition to our noodles we got a plate of steamed pork dumplings and spicy wontons. Both of those dishes were OK, but my partner and I both came out of the experience wishing we just ordered another plate of those glorious noodles instead.TIP: Order 'Dao Xiao' noodles aka knife-shaved noodles. The texture is out of this world and the springy texture from the noodle being freshly made is a perfect 10/10. I've had knife-shaved noodles a million times before but never had it as fresh as this.---If you can get over the dingy atmosphere and the fact that you're eating right next to strangers communal-style, you'll reach food nirvana like I have. Trust me - this place ROCKS!",1,1,1
24,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,This is located close to Chinatown and has 4 tables in the entire establishment. Be warned that seating is very limited! I tried the hand-pulled dan-dan noodles and some duck and both dishes were just OK. I know London isn't well known for its Chinatown like some other big cities but you are definitely not missing much if you skip this place.,-1,1,1
25,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Sometimes the best meals are completely spontaneous. Experiencing the moody, unpleasant British weather was inevitable, so when a torrentuous downpour suddenly began, we ducked underneath an awning to shelter from the rain. We spotted a growing line a few doors down that piqued our interest. Although the exterior of the restaurant makes it look like a takeaway place, think of it as the middle ground between takeaway and eating in. This place is a total dive: the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, the service is close to nonexistent, and the cramped elbow-to-elbow communal seating probably violates the fire code.But I'd be lying if I said the handmade noodles didn't make all of that worth it. Trust me, I'm from San Francisco, a world-renowned hub for authentic Chinese food.An employee stands outside next to the line to take orders so the kitchen can start working on them before you're even seated. That way, your food will practically be ready for you once a spot frees up for you inside. This unassumingly authentic hole-in-the-wall serves delicious hand pulled noodles (seriously, you can see them being made right in front of you) in broth for lower-than-London prices.",1,1,1
26,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Right in the heart of Leicester Square, Lanzhou is a clutch venue for lunch or dinner. The interior is cramped with minimal seating upstairs with a similarly tight downstairs dining room. Prepare to dine with tables pushed together and almost overlapping. It's claustrophobic but seems to add some authenticity to the experience.Wife and I both did dao xiao mian (hand cut noodle) soup with stewed beef. The food came out fairly quickly and the flavors were excellent with huge portions. Service was quick and efficient. Overall, this was a great hidden gem to grab some cheaper, filling food.",1,1,1
27,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Ignore the takeaway in front of the restaurant.  Asked to be seated inside or downstairs where the food is great and authentic.You have a choice of pulled Noodles (very thin - angel hair pasta sized to thick - udon sized) or cut Noodles - thicker and chewier that pulled Noodles.  You can choose the to have the Noodles served as part of s soup or dry.  The soup or dry Noodles can be served vegetarian, seafood or various types  of meat including Char Su Pork, Stewed Beef, Chicken Dan Dan etc....I had the Cold Stewed Beef with very thin pulled Noodles.  This dish was wonderful. The soup was a delicious chili infused broth that had a pleasant tang, hint if spiciness with just the right degree of umami.I also had the Braised Tofu dish - highly recommended.A hidden gem near Covent Garden, London.",1,1,1
28,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"This little restaurant is right outside of Chinatown, and I came here in search of knife shaved noodles. I got the half beef half tendon noodles for takeaway. They separate the noodles and soup so the noodles don't get soggy. The menu for noodles is very big as they are known for their noodles. The portions are pretty big, and prices are okay. The beef was very soft, and the tendon was chewy. I would've like some more spice or flavor in the soup. They also skimped on the vegetables and only gave me a little. The noodles were not authentic knife cut noodles, but they were still good. Lanzhou is an okay noodle place, good for when you're hungry and passing through the area.",-1,1,-1
29,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"We came here on back to back nights...it's that good. Even with the cramped communal seating in the small space, food was enjoyable. I prefer the Dao Xiao noodles (knife cut) over the La Mein (hand pulled) noodles, thicker chewy texture. I also prefer stewed beef over sliced (Chunky cut, both are lean).Lamb skewers are cumin flavored and excellent. My husband liked their wonton soup, handmade and meaty.(Written by husband)",1,1,1
30,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"This place is not worth it people!!! I've had my fair share of Chinese noodles...and this place was so-so. I didn't have the knife noodles but this place's soup was so unimpressive even if the knife noodles were good I wouldn't go back. Lanzhou is renowned for their noodles. This place uses the name to lure you in. The inside serves a mix of different Chinese foods. You're also allowed to customize your noodles. Hint that it isn't authentic!! If I had seen the menu first, I wouldn't have gone in.My husband and I shared a bowl of beef tendon hand pulled noodles. Soup lacked depth. The chili on the side was good and the saving grace. I ended up dumping two tablespoons into my bowl. I also had two lamb skewers. It was pretty good. I almost wanted to order more. All it was missing was the good ratio of fat. Their skewers were all meat. That's not a bad thing but it's definitely better with the pieces of fat in between. The lady taking our order was so distracted by the girl next to us who wanted to change her order last minute that she failed to put down our order of roast duck and bbq pork. We had to ask someone to follow up. The guy we asked was the same one I saw watching horse races on his phone... He then proceeded to tell me they don't have roast duck so I said Ä¤Žü_ (roast duck in chinese) and he goes oh yes ok. That's when we found out she missed our order. So we order and wait... The bbq pork was so dry I  had to spit it out. My husband was super disappointed by the food coloring. It's supposed to be red but we were disturbed how it wasn't just the outside, the red had died random spots on the inside, likely from when they were slicing. If you normally have this, it's red on the outside only... no transference of dye people... The roast duck came drenched in a sauce... I'm pretty sure they were trying to serve the duck cantonese style because it was a Ä¤ŒÔ_ (A style of roast/bbq meat)... It was not accurate!!! Both were too sweet. Especially the bbq pork. Friendly reminder Hong Kong, located in the south of china, was a British colony. These roast meats are very common in HK. Also, Lanzhou is not in the south... I was disappointed this place was true to no region...Everyone was pretty nice except the guy who helped us at the cashier. Didn't ring me up stared at me. So I thought the number on the register was what I owed (28.10 pounds). This fool rang me up (22.50) while I was grabbing my money. So when I gave him 30 he gave me  5 back and waited for me to give him change or exact instead. Really?",-1,-1,-1
31,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"As a study abroad student in London for the summer, I was craving noodles and found this place close to my school! Have been here twice and ordered different dishes; both were delicious and worth the buy. Service was good too; right when you walk in the door, they'll ask you how many people are in your party and seat you right away (given that space is available). I recommend trying the knife-cut noodles, which are hand-shaven when you order. You can watch them cut your noodles. The beef noodle soup was very good--the broth was not too heavy and there is a good amount of both veggies and beef in it. Well-priced, about 7-8 pounds for a pretty big serving! Will be back again for the remainder of my stay in London! *NOTE*: Cash only if your order is under 20 pounds. I believe you can pay with card if it is under 20 pounds, but there is an added fee, so bring cash!",1,1,1
32,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"YUM! I've been craving real asian noodles and this delivered.

34,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"This place definitely does not live up to the hype. Maybe it's because I've had a lot of good Chinese food back in the states and in China, but this really did not satisfy my craving for Chinese.There is very little seating here, so you basically have to share a table with a bunch of strangers. It feels very tight and crowded. Not very pleasant.The actual dishes are not well prepared and feel like they came out of a Panda Express. The stir fried meat is dry, but the bok Choy we got was nice, but you can't really mess up bokchoy. The only I can really consider worth trying here are their noodles, and that's only because they handpull them. The actual noodles are quite nice. They're bouncy and have a good texture, but the broths that complement them are waaay too rich. The first few bites are great, but I couldn't even finish my bowl because of how much fat was in it.And if it was hard to take in the food, imagine what it was like to get rid of it. Let's just say, I was in the bathroom for half an hour after this.Anyways, disregarding that, I would not come back to this place, there MUST be a better Chinese place out here in London. Please fellow yelpers direct me to it.",-1,-1,-1

I usually eat Chinese food at home but when you are on the go you have to find a quick Chinese place to eat. I really like their beef noodle it's better than what I have in the city of Cupertino. The ingredients they use are of good quality, you don't just taste the food you taste the homestyle feeling of eating in Shanghai or Beijing. The staff that served me is real friendly! A nice lady knew what I wanted from my observations of other local and non local people in the restaurant. The best Chinese food in London Drawback: it can get real noisy here. If you are not from London this place can be real loud during the high season. If you are a tourist and you need to ride public transport here commute at your own time.",1,1,1
38,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,This is the real deal beef noodle soup spot.  Located in London's Chinatown district.  Walked in the restaurant and nobody speaks English.

39,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"Tourist here from Toronto! Went here with my gf and her family, ratings is 4 stars. Unfortunately, Overrated even for a cheap eats place. Food quality, average - noodles were okay, soup base was too sweet. Tasted like instant noodles. Ambiance is average, but expected for a cheap eats place. Dining experience, average for a Chinatown. Upside, orders came quick. Downside, service was limited, didn't even serve water. We had to ask. The restaurant charged an auto 10% service charge and gave VERY minimal service. Would contemplate going back!",-1,-1,-1
40,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"Went here after seeing all the reviews on yelp and reading about it on timeout. Good food at a great price. Only concern is with cleanliness.Very tiny restaurant with limited seating. We were a group of 4 and it was quite crammed at the table. We were seated in the basement which looked dingy but that was okay, we were here for the food not the ambiance. We each got a bowl of la-mien noodles which were quite good but broth was too salty. Service was what was expected for a cheap-eat Chinese restaurant. I ordered the sliced beef noodles and they brought out the wrong order but was still tasty (picture attached). Cleanliness is concerning which is why I'm rating it 3 stars; we asked for water and it was very obvious that our water came in styrofoam cups that have been washed with hot water and reused.",-1,-1,-1
41,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"After a long day of traveling yesterday, we ventured out for some good food this afternoon. After seeing reviews for places in the area, we decided to give Lanzhou Noodle Bar a go. It's a tiny restaurant that's run quite efficiently. We browsed through the menu during our 10 minute wait, and were seated quickly. Hungry and excited, I started to dig into my food only to be terribly disappointed. I ordered a chicken curry plate with steamed white rice; the chicken pieces had a strange texture so I started to take a closer look...RAW/UNDERCOOKED chicken... Are you kidding me? People can get really sick! I stopped eating immediately. Before leaving, I pointed out that the chicken was raw/undercooked and the employee rolled her eyes as she grabbed my plate to re-cook the dish (I'm assuming). But I told her it's fine and that we were on our way out. We paid for our meals, crossed our fingers hoping I don't fall ill and no one else does either.",-1,-1,-1

44,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"It's a bit of a dive, but it feels very authentic. The waitstaff bantering in Chinese, sitting elbow to elbow with strangers, and the rhythmic slap as they hand pull the noodles. Like others have mentioned, this is not the place to go on a romantic date but rather for a generous homemade bowl of noodles. The hand cut noodles which I ordered took longer and most of the other patrons looked to be ordering the la mian which came out almost instantaneously, so that might have been the move.",1,1,-1

48,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Big fan of hand pulled noodles. The first time I walked by I was kinda skeptical due to their hygiene score (a few months ago). However, on a subsequent visit they have improved their score so I decided to give it a go. It was a Friday night and this place was bustling at 11pm, from the drunk/clubbing crowd. There was a line and it was a short 5 minute wait as they quickly turned around the tables.You'll be dining communal style (we're kinda used to it) and sharing a table with other people. This place is pretty fast and you can see them make the noodles in front of  you. I ordered the beef stew hand pulled noodles. It arrived in a matter of minutes and was sooooo good. Be sure to put plenty of that hot sauce in your soup for the best experience. I shared a table with two girls that barely ate their appetizers. They clearly ordered too much (3 appetizers and two soups). Don't do what they did... Total waste. Most of the people eating here are locals and I was the only tourist (or so I thought). It is near Leicester Square which has a bunch of tourists but not too many of them appreciate the fine art of hand pulled noodles. Soooooo good.",1,-1,-1

I tried asking questions about other menu items where I was given little response and pushed quite vigorously to place a new order. I'm not even sure what chicken dish I ended up with. I ate it because I paid for it but I definitely didn't love it.,-1,-1,-1

(Not kidding)Let me be straight: The venue is small as f*ck, not cozy and overall poorly designed. BUTThe food is simply AMAZING: You can watch live how your noodles are prepared by the chef, who must be some kind of martial master, because damn son: He his beating up this noodle dough like a pro. The food comes really quick (because of the mentioned martial art master) and is delicious.

Hidden in the bustling streets between Covent Garden and Leister Square you will find this tiny restaurant that will absolutely blow your tastebuds to another dimension.Look for a long line of (mostly) youngsters eye-eating  the menu as they wait in the sidewalk for a table. Busy servers will take your order as you stand and once a table is ready and you are seated, your food will follow within a minute (or less).    Noodles of all size and shapes, boiled, souped or fried, generous pork dumplings, all sizzling  from being super fresh made. The Dao Xiao Mian noodles are SUPERB, tender moist and chewy with a subtle almost sweet taste. I had them fried with roasted duck, and served with a good heap of hot oil with chili peppers. Seated in a small table along side a very friendly couple (who found the place and were visiting for the third time in two days), this was a trip to the exotic in the middle of the eclectic. Just found another excuse to return to London, if you are in this touristy area of London, don't fall for the chains or the ""best British fish in chips"" find this place, get in line and enjoy.You are welcome.",1,1,1

The street level seating area is very limited just as tight as the basement level quarters where patrons are squeezed together so as to maximize the tiny space.  Though the service is a bit rushed, staff members get the job done and rather swiftly.  The food choices to select from isn't bad as my family and I ordered lunch items--house fried rice, roast pork and roast duck with steamed rice.

You can completely tell when you slurp them up that they are freshly made. We asked our waitress to recommend some dishes. We shared a beef la mian soup which was super tasty. We also ordered an aubergine and potato stir-fry which was delicious. You never get potato in Cantonese cooking so this was a nice treat. We also ordered the chill chicken which came with Sichuan peppercorns. This was also very good. The meal came to å£23.50 for 2 which is a total bargain!  You pay at the cash register but please leave the wait staff a tip. They were on top of things and you could tell, working very hard. This isn't a place to linger and the tables are communal and crowded.

Also because I'm obsessed with handmade noodles.After asking the guy next to me what he was eating, I ordered the same: stir-fried knife-cut beef noodles. We also ordered the ji dan jiu cai he zi (egg and leek ""pancake"") to share. My plate came, gloriously heaped with noodles. I reached for the clay pot full of hot chili flakes in oil, dumped a copious amount on my noodles, and dug in.The cramped noodle bar, with its communal tables, fluorescent lighting, and cooks making noodles two feet away from where you're sitting reminded me a lot of noodle shops I went to while in Hangzhou, China.The food was no frills, authentic Chinese at its best.

With how overcooked it was, it might have been the previous day's leftovers. The knife-cut noodles were too inconsistent. Usually, knife-cut noodles are good because of the little inconsistencies in thickness, and therefore, texture, but these were too widely ranging. Most of the pieces were too thin, which made it like eating little bits of noodles the thickness of dumpling skins. The remaining pieces were extremely thick, which made for lots of QQ, but also just too doughy. I would normally always recommend the knife-cut noodles over pulled noodles, but I say go with the pulled noodles here.Stewed beef la mian (pulled noodles)Beef was very tender and tasted marinated, noodles were good. Broth was good. Stick with this one.Cash only.7.50GBP for soup with pulled noodles. 7.90GBP for soup with knife-cut noodles.

I was in Paris a couple days ago before I tried this place and I was really craving a bowl of noodle soup right when I got to London! They have an extensive menu and the price is reasonable considering the conversion rate of pounds to USD. 7-8å£ for a bowl of noodle is probably the most reasonably priced meal I had in London. There was a line when I went around 6pm on a Friday. But we got seated within 5-10 minutes. They are pretty efficient because you can order while you are in line so by the time you get seated, you only have to wait for another 5 minutes until you get your food.I got the noodle soup with roasted duck and vegetables. Their handmade noodles taste amazing! They have this hot chili sauce that you have to add to your noodle! It adds so much flavor and a kick to it.

87,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Finally made my way to Lanzhou Noodle Bar for some fresh hand pulled noodle soup. It's what they well known for yet I can't help but feel sad when I see tourists or people unfamiliar with the cuisine going for a cheap container of their pre cooked buffet section.  Take the hint and order the freshly made hand pulled noodles instead.The place felt like I entered a nursery with their bright colour walls of yellow, red and green and laminated printout of the food. Staff were efficient and quick but without the friendliness, which is very typical of a Chinese restaurant. With that in mind and the small canteen style restaurant, condiments on the table, short plastic and wooden stools, it was very reminiscent of canteens in Hong Kong and China.House special vermicelli Oh my beautiful zingy garlicky vinegary salad of thinly sliced cucumbers, carrots, coriander, vermicelli and the novelty of frankfurters too. It was so refreshing, loved the crunchy texture and marinated perfectly. The frankfurters actually worked well adding some meaty sweetest to the dish, to balance out the sourness.Chicken sour spicy la-mian noodles. I didn't expect the broth to be so umami and flavoursome. It had depth and a nice balance sourness as well as a good punch of spice from the chilli without being numbing. The noodles was full of bounce and generous, made long so it provided a really satisfying bite. The wood ear fungus gave a crunch to it and this was contrasted with the softer tofu. The chicken was a bit dry but that was the only compliant I haveStewed beef Dao Xiao Mian (chopped noodles) in soup. The broth was delicious and complex, once again full of flavour and depth. Sadly the noodles weren't as satisfying for me being short and doughy. It felt I spent more time chewing on the noodles than the enjoying the broth with it. Next time I might have it with the La Mian as the beef was spot on being incredibly tender and fragrant, with strong notes of the sweet soy braising marinating sauce. Nice addition of pak choi for a refreshing green taste and crunch.Steamed pork and chive dumplings These were poorly made. The dough was too thick and chewy masking all the flavours of the meatball and the broth inside it. The meatball itself was nice and sweet, well marinated and juicy.Fish ball BBQ skewer and lamb BBQ skewer These were lovely and fragrant. It had a nice kick to it from the spice. The lamb was meaty and lean which was nice compared to all the fatty ones we've had. Fish balls were soft and bouncy with good umami flavours. It was great not to have a minimum order on them too like most places that sell skewers.Chive and egg pieThis was very moreish. I love the doughy thin pastry, pan fried for a little bit of crisp around the edges. It was a bit greasy too but that kept it moist. Inside was a delicious filling of peppery chives mixed with silky eggs.I left so satisfied with Lanzhou Noodle Bar. For just å£6.50 for each of the noodle soups it makes me question why a simple miso ramen can cost double that. It's cool how you can see the noodles made in the open preparation kitchen by the chef and the skilled involved. Menu is actually quite extensive covering mostly northern Chinese food so if you're hungry you can always add it along to your noodle as a side like what we did. Looks like I will be back soon.",1,1,1

I was excited to see that they served garlic and pepper marinated cucumbers, which is my favorite appetizer of all time. They don't serve water which is fine if you're getting a soup with noodles. The restaurant is cramped, yes, but it feels pretty authentic that way. The crampness reminded me of many of the street restaurants I have been to in Asia and honestly, whenever I am in Asia, I prefer street food over fancy restaurants because it tastes way better. Lanzhou is also one of the rare places that take card (yay!).",1,1,1

90,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"I'm still not sure how we ended up eating here on a Sunday afternoon, but what I will say is that I was actually really impressed with the noodles that this place offers. They are made fresh  and super tasty (that's only if you are planning to be seated with a menu + order from the left side of the noodle menu). For a brief moment sitting outside at the only table on the pavement and with one of  the chefs munching away on is own dinner next to us, I felt as if we could have been in Beijing. This noodle bar is right opposite Leister Square station, so not the most atmospheric place in the world, but definitely worth the experience.",1,1,-1
91,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"Hectic place and rude service. The noodles are not bad but the flavor is way off from what you would get in China. Below expectation.",-1,-1,-1
92,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,1,"I wanted so badly to love this place as I had seen it show up on many lists for London's best cheap eats. Yes, it's cheap for ~6.90 for a bowl of noodles in Soho. Best? Far from it! The bowl is packed with so much MSG (flavour enhancers, you'll know it's jammed with the bad stuff after you go running to find a drink after dining here!), fatty cuts of meat (stewed beef is the recommendation and 80% of it is fat) and I counted one slither of bok choy (yes, one!). Most of the bowl is filled with broth that's way too oily to drink. The handcut noodles are impressive and lives up to the hype. If you're not a fan of MSG and really oily/fatty food, I'm afraid I couldn't recommend Lanzhou Noodle Bar. Service is inattentive and poor. The minute you put down your chopsticks, there's already a table standing next to you waiting for you to dash out ASAP. I understand that seat space is tiny and cramped, but it'd be nice not having to climb over bodies to exit the restaurant. You'd be better off paying an extra å£5 and grabbing a bowl of ramen nearby. Can I suggest Kanada-Ya? They have rad ramen and it's a consistent five stars from me.",-1,-1,1
93,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,Lovely noodles place with tailor hand made noodles..spicy sour soup with the variety of topping.

94,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"After a month of gallivanting around Europe, my cravings for Chinese food were at an all-time high. Found this place on Yelp and was super excited to finally get a taste of the homeland. This noodle joint is a tiny hole in the wall, super casual with cramped seating, but it wasn't anything I didn't already expect. My boyfriend and I ordered the stir fried hot and sour beef la mian (hand pulled noodles), as well as the pork sparerib dao xiao mian (hand cut noodles) in soup. Food came quickly within ten minutes and was super fresh. The hand pulled noodles were definitely the preferred style between the two as they were more al dente and retained a light bounce. I normally really like dao xiao mian, but I found that since they were in soup, they ended up getting overly doughy/overdone quicker than I anticipated. The pork sparerib was crisp and well executed, and the hot and sour beef had a nice level of acidity and spice. Overall, a quick cheap eat that hits the spot. Just bear in mind that it's definitely a no frills type of establishment.",1,1,1
95,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"I'm still a fan of this place but the honeymoon period is over, sadly. The noodles are still fantastic and the service will always bring me back to the quality of service in China. I'm taking two star off of my original review because while the noodles are fresh and amazing, their other dishes are less desirable. I ordered the Mu-er cold dish as it's one of my favourite things to have in China. As I was digging into it, we saw not one, but 2 very long strands of hair. They were nice enough to make me a new one, but I was rather put off from the initial dish already and probably nothing could have actually made the situation better. In hindsight: Go for the noodles. Maybe try the lamb skewers. But stay away from the cold dishes.",-1,-1,-1
96,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"The food was amazing but I don't care how good you are - you need to treat your customers with respect.I was shouted at several times just for trying to get a picture of the noodle making. Then they told us off for not being finished even though we'd barely been there 10mins and were sitting uncomfortably at the bar, so not even prime real estate. Then they tried to add on a charge to pay by card without warning in advance so had to trek off to go get cash and come back. There's no warning of this charge also when you're queuing for a table - which is when you're most easily able to pop off to get some cash.Yup, damn good noodles but somehow was left with a bitter taste in my mouth from the p**s poor service.",-1,-1,-1

I actually went here twice during my stay and the beef noodle soup wasn't as good as the ground beef noodle (G19, if I remember correctly) but I have lower standards when it comes to cheap, Asian food.",1,1,1

100,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,1,"I just moved to London and was craving some good Chinese food. Initially I was really excited to have found this place but the customer service has always been awful. I thought I could just deal with it because the food is decent but yesterday was a new low.My flatmate and I both ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup. The only difference is that she wanted the thin noodles and I wanted the thicker noodles. We also ordered pig ears with cucumber and some fried dumplings. When they brought the noodles my flatmate's order was correct but mine was wrong. Instead of a noodle soup they gave me greasy fried noodles. I wasn't upset at all, I used to work as a waitress and I totally understand that mistakes can be made. I informed the waitress that it wasn't what I had ordered. She started yelling the name of the order at me and insisted it was what I ordered. She eventually took the plate of noodles and carried it around the restaurant looking for the waitress I had ordered with. In a bit the waitress who brought my noodles and the waitress who I ordered with came to speak to me together and insisted that I had ordered the fried noodles. I told them over and over again I had ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup, not fried noodles. I'd eaten at this restaurant at least 5 times at this point and I always order the same thing so I know I didn't order incorrectly. At this point they started to yell and roll their eyes at me. When they turned around and started going up the stairs the waitress I ordered with began to talk badly about me and scream profanities in Chinese as she walked up the stairs. I don't think she realized I speak Chinese because I have a perfect American accent. At this point my flatmate and I were kind of upset that she had rudely screamed about me in another language just 2 feet away from our table. I was debating whether or not to leave or go but I really didn't want to start any drama so I decided to wait and see if she would bring me the correct order. She came back really quickly (maybe 2 minutes tops) with a bowl of noodle soup. I was so relieved when I first saw it because I thought the drama would be over. When I looked down I was really confused because the broth was extremely dark and the noodles were brown as well. I realized that what the restaurant had done was pour hot water over the fried noodles to make it into ""noodle soup."" It was really gross. I turned to her and asked her if they had just poured hot water over the fried noodles. She looked at me and said no that's just beef broth. Beef broth is not that dark. I pointed to my flatmate's bowl (which is the same exact order as mine) and I said that her broth was clear. I also said I had eaten here many times before and I know what the soup and noodles are supposed to look like. She continued to lie to me and insisted that they had used beef broth for my soup and that's why it was a darker color. At this point I realized arguing was futile. I told her my flatmate and I were going to leave but I would still pay for her soup and the appetizer we ordered (even though we had barely touched them.) When we got to the cashier he didn't charge us for my soup but he tried to charge us for the dumplings that we never received. I didn't even really care about the money, I was just upset with the consistent lies and scheming. I told him we had never received them and asked him to take it off the bill. He eventually did after arguing with us and the total for food we barely touched was 18å£. I paid that and even tipped too.The food in this restaurant is decent but the service is not. The lack of honesty and integrity in the dining staff is very disturbing. They were willing to feed me anything just to save some money and to avoid correcting their mistake.",-1,-1,-1
101,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"A small hole in the wall Chinese restaurant serving up handmade noodles! I stopped by after class with a friend and shared a sliced beef la mian, spring rolls, and fried pork and chive dumplings. The noodles were delicious as everyone else have pointed out, though I feel they skimp on the toppings. Put some of the spicy sauce in it and elevate the soup to another level! My friend loved the spring rolls and I loved the dumplings. They reminded me of home, with a thicker, homemade skin holding a juicy pork and chive filling. The reason for the low rating is for their service. The servers never had a smile on our face and all faced the door instead of at the customers inside the restaurant, making it quite difficult to catch their attention for anything. There was also one server that was picking at his ear very intently for about 5 minutes which makes me question the cleanliness of this place haha. Definitely doing takeaway next time!",-1,1,1

103,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"It's not the most comfortable, or easiest to figure out, but if you're a bit prepared and feeling brave, the Noodle Bar is a good choice for a cheap, tasty dinner!We each had the fried noodles, thick ones. I had char siu and my husband had the sliced beef. Mine had a lovely flavour but was a bit fatty. The beef though was really tender and tasty.Sure, there was probably too much noodle for the amount of meat/veg, but neither of us could finish it anyway! The noodles had a nice bite and flavour. I really liked the dumplings we had on the side.I was a bit put off by the hygiene rating, but with the location in central London next to a tube station, it's not a surprise, really, that they had a rodent problem. I assume it was all sorted since they were reopened, and I didn't notice anything disgusting, or get sick, so, a win!There's no phone reception at all if you sit in the basement.",1,1,1

Only wish I had enough room to try the cut noodles too (I ordered ""wrong"" but it was still phenomenal)Also this is a divey hole in the wall and the staff will not offer much hospitality. You're welcome to come and eat what you like and they will offer little guidance. You'll have to deal with it and enjoy the crap out of the food. Ps My spring roll looked boring and average but how the heck was it so great? Fresh out of the fryer...that's howPps make sure you try some of the spicy sauce with the fried garlicPpps when you think you're too full...drizzle some of the black vinegar (you'll think it's soy sauce but it's not) onto whatever you're eating.  That should cut the fat just enough and if you like vinegar like me, it just takes you to another world of flavors.",1,1,1

Incredibly fragrant with freshly handcut noodles.Yes, as some other reviews mention, you'll likely be jammed at a table next to strangers.

Why is this place not in Chinatown? I assumed it was in chinatown but apparently not. Okay so the front of the restaurant are for those uneducated americans who like americanized chinese food or those that actually know its americanized chinese food and still like it.

It was cheap, cash only i think (if i remember correctly) ....but they can't compare to the price and noodles you can get in taiwan. But still pretty darn good. My one problem is i hate sharing tables, and here, you have to share tables -_- ugh, i know its traditional chinese style but no, just no lol.

It is damn good. It is, however, imperfect. For starters, it would be quite easy to mistake this place for your average cheap Chinese takeout place, order some pre-prepared sesame chicken and be on your way. Do not let the giant piles of pre-made greasy late-night food, distract you. YOU ARE HERE FOR THE NOODLES. I would highly recommend the stewed beef noodle soup. Or, the stewed beef noodles in any way it is offered. They are so expert and perfectly prepared, my mouth is watering thinking about them. Be warned, this place is intense. It is perma-crowded and filled with locals and tourists alike. Be prepared to elbow your way in and push to be seated and allowed to stay in your seat. My friend was here a few weeks ago and didn't eat as quickly as her companions. They were asked to sit outside while waiting for my friend to finish.

On top of that, it is located right by Leicester Square Station and so ordinarily I wouldn't even think about entering an establishment here; most of them are tailored to tourists. And in fact, the first look at Noodle Bar confirmed my worst nightmares: brightly-coloured sweet & sour chicken in the counter and other shiny dishes that many people think if as the epitome of Chinese cuisine. However, for a while now I had followed the reviews on this place and I was especially enticed when ""Asian-food experts"" such as Yee Gan, Rob H, Katie B and Rachel Z gave this place such good ratings. By coincidence I ran into Rachel Z an hour before our visit at Noodle Bar and she was so kind to write down (in Chinese characters) the things that we should order. And that made everything so easy!When we got to the place the waiter led us downstairs and all of the sudden we were transported away from touristy Leicester Square into what could easily be a noodle bar in Hong Kong or Shanghai; not the least to judge by the fact that we were the only white folks. Having said that, don't expect anything glamorous. People come here to eat and not to socialise. They go about their business and leave. And that's exactly how the waiting staff treated us and there's as well. No kind smile, no niceties or pleasantries exchanged - only boom bang here's your food. Luckily we had the written instructions from Rachel Z (see picture uploaded) and so at least the ordering was done in a breeze. What we got was the following: one order of very garlicky marinates cucumber as a starter (delicious) and each of us then had a variation of the noodle soup: 1) had-pulled noodles with cooked beef, 2) sliced noodles with cooked beef & 3) sliced noodles with stewed beef belly. Next time I will go for the hand-pulled noodles with the stewed beef belly. All in all it was a great treat. I loved the whole experience and the food was very good as well.

Lanzhou Noodle Bar is as authentic as it gets.  You are greeted (more like reeled in), given a seat (sharing only pls., if you want to stay in the ground floor) and given a menu and some hot tea.  On the way in, I noticed the chef/cook making hand made noodles.  Right there, I knew we were in the right place.  I ordered the Beef Noodle (regular. like spaghetti) and my wife ordered the Roast Duck noodle.  And for good measure, a Pork Rice topping of some sort.  Well, after the noodles, we didn't have space for the rice and pork, so take away we did. Now on to the noodles, they were aldente, you can feel the gluten break as you chew on the noodles, the broth/soup was seasoned just right (I dont do spicy but, heck if you need spice, they have the real spicy oil -'La yiou', sprinkle to your hearts delight!).  And much as it wouldn't be anything special in China or most parts of Asia, it was extremely special in London, where it hit the spot and all my weary muscles were soothed away.",1,1,1

Lanzhou Noodle Bar Is a tiny little Chinese restaurant tucked away on the outskirts of china town and is across from the Angus steak restaurant, If you're in town STOP BY! Just keep an eye out for the restaurant with bold orange letters that says noodle bar. ( I spent over 40 mins looking for a place that said ""Lanzhou"" but it was in Chinese -_-) Noodles made right in front of you BY ORDER. And my God is the broth flavorful. It's a little hectic and cramped but it's definitely worth it!",1,1,1
133,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"Being in London, I just had to have a meal in Chinatown. I've been living in Copenhagen for 4 months and have been craving a hot bowl of soup noodles. It was too easily accessible in New York City. For about 6-7 pounds, you get a huge portion of hand pulled noodles and a topping. if you want an extra topping, it was an extra pound. (no pun intended) It was quite chilly the day I was there so this bowl of noodles was excellent.** I asked if the door could be closed because it was cold, and the lady said ""no because we are cooking"" Well then... Anyways, back to my noodles. I doused it with 2 spoons of chili (my favorite) and it was delicious! I ordered the wonton noodles with an extra topping of vegetables. Perfect combination in my opinion. My friend had the char siu with beef. She didn't think it was good, the char siu wasn't tender and was lacking flavour and the beef tasted old as if it was not eaten for a while and left sitting. You get 3 stars for the great portion size, for satisfying my chinese food craving and for having a clean bathroom (well it was clean when I went).",-1,1,1
134,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"There was no hype or social provoking on Twitter that urged me to to try this place. Just seeing a steady flow of satiated customers going in and out every time I went for my predictable Pret nearby, was satisfaction enough.For tourists it must be a such a tough case of pot luck when picking your Peking delights if you don't know where to go or what to order when you get there. Panic not and pick a winner. You don't have to settle for lousy, if you settle down in Lanzhou. You'll be served promptly and if you have to queue when you arrive, you can order whilst you wait outside. What indeed awaits inside are big fat flat noodles that slap and splash you in the chops with hot broth as you slurp from the wide rimmed bowl bringing comfort nourishment that is utterly reviving. Man alive, these noodles are good.It's always packed with students, young families and local office workers, loud old ladies on old lady dates cackling away around you. It's a vibrant place; it has the feel of a 'caff' like-cafe but with chopsticks. There is black vinegar in ketchup bottles. They even serve green tea in Styrofoam cups to add to that effect. I normally shy away from eateries in Chinatown who's preprepared foods lay out displayed in rows of bain maries; tedious steaming trays of sweet-and-sour chicken or irk inducing oily chow mein. That's totally fine if you like the Anglicised version of things, but behind the off-putting buffet in the window is the theatre of hand pulled noodles being stretched out, thwacked and spun with pure skill. So if you're stretched for time, either at lunch or pre-show; show up here, grab a bowl of something hot fresh and delicious and be on your way. They'll be glad to have you out quickly. Have you not seen the queue forming outside?",1,-1,1

Especially if you had enough of dry bread and craving hot soupy noodles in the cold season. Food - 3/5Decor - 2/5 Service - 3/5Value - 4/5Space - 3/5Their noodle bowl is huge for 7 pounds! You will not need to order anything else. However, although it is flavorful, it is definitely on the salty side. What I noticed is in general the food in London is much saltier than say NYC or Boston. The noodle itself has pretty good texture (chewy and just-right).The interior / decor is mediocre at best but the store is nice and warm in the winter next to a few boiling pots where the chefs are kneading dough which then turns into strands of noodles after twisting here and there (like magic) and cooking them next to you behind the clear half-height plastic wall. I'd skipped the unpopular / small plates on the menu because they are most likely left in the fridge for far too long and tasted bland. Service fee is waived as there is no water or any other accommodation besides bringing the noodle out to us. We offered to tip anyways but they refused to take money without providing the standard service.",-1,-1,-1

137,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"SO GOOD!I've always loved noodles, and I get especially excited when I go to restaurants where they hand make their noodles. At Lanzhou Noodle Bar, you can see them tossing and hand pulling their noodles, which is both 1) a sign of quality, and 2) endlessly amusing.It was pretty cold when I was in London, and their beef noodle soup absolutely hit the spot. It was tasty, delicious, filling, well-priced, and reminded me of home. :)Seating is not so great--I sat at a long, slim table against a wall beside a friend and a stranger, but I still really enjoyed the meal. Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a great, quick lunch in London!",1,1,1
138,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"This place is authentic to the core. Except the location. It would make more sense if it was in China Town, but I'm not complaining.My wife and I showed up to the tiny storefront and it was pretty crowded. They said they had a table for two downstairs, so we walked by the guy making the noodles (super cool) and down into the basement.There were no empty tables. But there was a table for 4 with only three people it. They grabbed a stool, sat it next to the table, and told us that was where we were going to sit. Cool! And kind of crazy--the other people at our table only spoke Chinese. But that was actually kind of nice because then my wife and I could talk and feel like it was our own private conversation still.We ordered some fried noodles ( I don't remember how to smell the name). It was 7.50 pound each, which was reasonable. The food came out fast, and was really good. There was some chili sauce at each table which was tasty, and all in all it was a really fun experience with really good food. I'd go back.",1,1,1

They were out of the duck which was what I was looking forward to2. The wontons were okay, overall should've had another meat in my soup3. Hard to understand and didn't understand my questions4. Tiny place - has only 3 tables, which are communalAll in all, I would definitely come back to this place (but early enough so they don't run out of duck).

But when I entered I was proposed the ""meal deal"" : 5å£ for 2 choices of meat + noodles or rice.So that's what I took. And don't get me wrong, it was a very generous portion ! But the flavours were too intense and it was overwhelming. Later I saw a girl eating a big bowl of noodle soup : Damn I should have stick to my plan.Next time ?Oh, and the place is really small, so go there for a quick lunch or take away.",-1,1,1
141,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Mixed feelings about this place. Service: Got a takeaway, but the guy at the door was pretty good at telling us which dish to order and we could order through him, then pay at the till. He spoke Mandarin to me, spoke Mandarin back to him. All fine and dandy.Disgusting fact: No wonder they were shut down by health authorities in 2014. They had a mice infestation. But just today while I waited for my takeaway outside the door, I saw the chef start cooking squid. He had a huge tub of it (like those washing tubs) and he dropped some on the floor. Yes you guessed it, he picked it up from the floor and threw it into the wok.Taste: Yes, their noodles are made fresh. Yes their broth is really good with lots of flavour. I ordered the beef brisket (most people on yelp seems to have done that) as it was recommended by the guy at the door and I though there was a lot of noodles, there was enough beef that I was happy. They only gave me 2 pieces of veg though and I really wanted more of that.Price: å£6.50 for beef brisket hand pulled noodles. Not bad for the price. I was confused why so many people think this is cheap though. This is pretty standard price for China Town lunch meals.",1,-1,-1

Didn't have to wait too long, but during the wait, it was great watching the hand drawn noodles get made. I will definitely be coming back and eating in the restaurant next time.

Then this week it's been closed with a hygiene emergency notice to say there is a serious mice infestation and dirty conditions with poor structural repair resulting in a very high risk of food contamination. They had moved the buffet display that is at the front window and there was what looked like piles of mouse poo. So disgusting. I was going to complain about the plates because they had chips on them (very unhygienic) but this really tops it.I would really recommend not eating here, they do not care about the safety of customers.",-1,-1,-1

They seated us with two other parties of two at a table in the very back, and within about 10 minutes of butt-to-chair we had our food. Service Note: The lady who took our order seemed very good-natured, if rather curt. But the noodles! I had the Roasted Duck Soup Noodle and it was excellent! The broth was super flavorful, obviously made from scratch, and had just enough of a white pepper kick to feel really authentic. Also, super super plus for me was that the broth wasn't too sweet. I can't always handle that note in Cantonese soups, but this broth was managed to pull it off beautifully. The one bad thing was that there were only about four pieces of duck topping, but I guess that's about as much as 6 pounds will get me.",1,1,1
145,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"Actually having been to Lanzhou, I am VERY picky about their noodles, cause I've had some of the best and some of the worst. This place was actually recommended by my father, for he heard about it through its reputation.In actuality, I found it to be just mediocre. Granted I got takeaway, and I don't think that I got the full experience in that form. The broth that came with the noodles didn't resemble the exact flavor of the broth in Lanzhou, but that could probably be attributed to the differences in water. The noodles themselves were fine and the beef that I got with it was tasty as well. There were some elements missing, such as radishes, that I usually saw in Lanzhou noodles, so that was slightly disappointing. Next time, I'll make sure to dine in, so that I can get it in a bowl.

The noodle soup was very flavorful.  Drool.When I was looking for this place (thanks to Yelp), I almost missed it.  It doesn't say ""Lanzhou Noodle Bar"" anywhere (that I could find).  It does say ""Noodle Bar"" or something like that, and it's next to a souvenir shop.I went at 3pm and there was no queue and enough seating.  Very cozy spot.",1,1,1
147,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"So I came here based purely on the Yelp reviews - and I was not disappointed. Not being Asian, it's slightly daunting to enter a restaurant like this. For starters, the sign above the door is in Chinese (I presume!) and just says Noodle Bar in English. So we walked past it on the other side of the street to start with. Then to say that we stand out once inside is an understatement!That being said, with Yelp on our side, we were confident that we were in for some good eats. We avoided the offer of the buffet and opted for the hand pulled noodles instead. There were no seats upstairs so we went downstairs, and we moved around to our own table eventually. We both ordered fried noodles, one plate of char-siu pork and one sliced beef. In the end, we couldn't work out what was better. We also got a side of pork and chive fried dumplings (we went for everything fried - it was blue Monday after all). These were also really good - and you get a crazy large portion for å£5. In the end though, we couldn't finish any of the plates of food despite it all being delicious.A great ""hidden"" place that we would never have visited without Yelp, and now I feel like I had some proper Chinese food for once. Great stuff. So two massive plates of fried noodles, two cokes and a portion of dumplings came to just under å£22, a real bargain for the area.",1,1,1

Go in, get a seat (if you can) and just order the noodles. What size, shape, flavour etc doesn't really matter, but I'd be pretty happy to take on any combination of what they have on offer and walk out paying full price for it. You can see the noodles being hand made, and the service is quick and food tasty. Better than your average plate of noodles in Chinatown for sure, but given how crowded the restaurant gets and how variable the service is (par for the course in Chinatown), 4 stars overall!",1,-1,1

Heaps of delighted tourists loading up plates with gooey orange meats at the all-you-can-eat isn't quite what I'm looking for.Glad I checked Yelp and popped into this little noodle shop (err, bar?). There is indeed a final station of hot counter food to ensnare you, but walk on by that and be astounded by the noodle soups they do at the benches in the back.I noticed all the other Chinese folks were getting the knife-cut noodles with slow cooked beef, so I knew I couldn't go wrong. Watched the chef slice and dice 'em up fresh, and after a few dollops of the chili sauce, the steaming bowl of noodles was perfect. Big chunks of meltingly soft beef with a hint of tendon, and the broth itself isn't just a faceslam of MSG.A meal on the heavier side, but great to warm you up! Definitely coming back, and the prices are reasonable (around å£6 for everything).",1,1,1

The noodle soup is particularly good. Hands down the best Chinese-style noodles in central London. Generous portions, efficient service, and you can watch them making the noodles if you sit at the front. Pro tip: Only bother with the noodles and dumplings.

And I'm shocked because Noodle Bar is a hole-in-the-wall on one of the most touristy, high-traffic areas in Leicester Square...which is the last place you'd expect cheap, authentic Chinese soup.As soon as you walk in, you're rushed to a communal table in the back. The air is filled with the clanging of pots and the slapping of dough against the counter as the noodles are made fresh. Within minutes, you are face-to-face with a piping hot bowl of deliciousness.I always get the La Mian noodle soup - either beef or bbq chicken. Add a little red chili sauce and vinegar = PERFECTION. The steamed pork dumplings also rival ones I've had in Chinatown SF. Whenever I'm in London, I come here at least once a week. I'm usually one of the few non-Asian peeps up in here, which is always a good sign that a place is truly authentic.I miss you Noodle Bar!",1,1,1

Very convenient to the tube. * Food preparation. Was served fresh, came out steaming. (They did make the noodles fresh, as advertised.)Cons:* Taste. I hate saying this since the good had tons if oil, and yet it lacked dimension. I shouldn't have to add black vinegar and chili to make the dish interesting. * Gyp-factor. Want water? That'll be bottled, and it'll add å£5 to your bill for two small bottles.

I just took the average here, but it really depends on which component you value more.I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance to today for lunch. When I got there it was already pretty busy but there were still a few seats left at the counter (and maybe downstairs?) so I got seated there right away. Within a minute, the menu was thrown in front of me (yes, THROWN). They have a fairly extensive list of options but clearly their specialty is noodles so I went for the vegetable noodle soup. After ordering with a very curt waitress, I asked another if I could get a glass of tap water. I'm not sure if there was some sort of miscommunication or what, but she brought back a fork...And then when I asked for tap water again in Chinese (thinking there was some sort of language barrier) she just stared for a bit then turned and walked away...Huh? I know I'm not a native Chinese speaker, but I'm not THAT bad. So after my noodles came I flagged down another waitress and asked for tap water, and guess what I got as a response? ""Sorry, no tap water only bottle."" Wait, how is that possible? Maybe this is just me, but never before have I encountered a restaurant that didn't have tap water. At this point I was pretty whatever about my whole experience and just hoped that the noodles would be good - which they actually were. The noodles were fantastic and clearly homemade, and the soup base/vegetables were great too. Not salty at all and incredibly fresh! So overall, even though the food was good (and the value too - I paid 5 pounds flat for the vegetable noodle soup) I'm sad to say I will not be coming back. I value service a lot in a restaurant experience and this place was just ridiculous.

If you're having trouble, ask one of the wait staff. They're more than happy to walk you through their menu.They have food in heating trays for take-away as well. I didn't try it as it didn't look all that appetizing.It is important to note that if you eat in, it is communal style.

I triple checked that it was the same 'Noddle Bar' that I had walked past multiple timesHowever, they gave me the key to the secret kingdom here, which I'm going to share with you. The good stuff is in the back. So, you have to puff up your chest, look confident and stride past the trays of ready cooked food and either ask for a table in mandarin or point to the back in an assured manner. Then, they'll let you eat inYou'll have a menu thrust at you, which has a bewildering choice of dishes and on my first visit, an impatient waitress tapping her pad almost as soon as I had sat down. There are useful pictures on the walls and on the menu but perhaps, the biggest clue as to what to eat here is in the name of the restaurant - noodles!Another clue comes from seeing the chefs at the open plan kitchen, hand pulling and hand carving fresh noodles in front of your eyes. These can be served in soup, fried or cooked probably in any way you wish and served with different meats or vegetables. I've enjoyed both soup and fried noodles, both for very reasonable prices.The place is tiny and you'll have to share tables but to find fresh, authentic food in the heart of tourist central like this is a goldmine",1,1,1

The taste was the same as the noodles you can find on the roads in Shanghai, I mean yes I do get this is authentic and so on and so forth, but the dish per-se it's damn boring!

Its a very small place to begin with and we soon found ourselves a bit squished as people were coming in and out of the place.  I also realized why the wait isn't that bad, they serve you pretty quickly, the noodle soup is very good so you slurp it up pretty fast and the place is cramped, you want to get out of there as soon as possible.

And a must try is their hot sauce in those big brownish jars with a cover, they add a nice kick to your noodle soup !",1,1,-1
167,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Found this place on Yelp as cheap dinners in Chinatown. Small lace but bench seats and bar to sit at and plenty of takeaways ready to go. We sat at the bar and ordered Bok Choy, half roast duck and sliced pork noodles for two. It was plenty to eat and just over å£25 which is a bargain for Covent Garden.Delicious quick meal - only thing is cash only. Highly recommended!",1,1,1
168,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"I would give this place five stars if all that mattered to me was flavour. The food was simply amazing. I visited the bar with a Taiwanese friend who has eaten her fair share of noodles and we both agreed that the noodle soups we ordered were absolutely delicious. I would go back in a wink to eat another bowl of that liquid delight, not to forget the freshly pulled noodles that were absolutely divine. For the price you pay, you really get great food value.But when I go back, I'll make sure I'll go alone. The simple reason being that the restaurant is rather anti-social. We were asked to move places three times, which is simply odd when you are eating. On top of that my friend and I had different eating paces. When my friend finished her dish she was asked to pay and leave right away, while I was clearly still in the process of eating. We refused. Not only was I stared at for the remainder of the dinner, my friend also perfectly understood the less than friendly comments that were made about us by the waiters in Mandarin. So when you go, go for the food. Don't go to socialize.",1,1,1

Lanzhou Noodle Bar was a reco from a friend and it definitely satisfied my noodle cravings and more. They have hand cut and hand pulled noodles (each of them equally delicious) and their beef stew was just juicy and fatty enough to melt in your mouth. It gets super busy and packed here so don't be surprised if you have to share a table with a stranger. The line goes by pretty fast as customers go in and out quickly, and you can entertain yourself by watching the chefs make the noodles right before your eyes in the front of the restaurant.",1,1,1

176,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,Best noodles I have ever had in my life! Bok Choy  with garlic was awesome. Strange experience though. They claimed to have run out of rice and then wanted us to buy fried rice which I turned down and then they appeared a few minutes later with some white rice. It was the worst white rice I have ever tasted. What Chinese place runs out of white rice and what Chinese place doesn't know how to make white rice. (I'm Chinese so I guess im a bit picky) noodles were to die for though would of gave 5 stars of the rice wasn't that bad!,1,-1,-1
177,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,The place gets fairly busy and the restaurant is pretty small. The service is okay but they move pretty fast that you feel really rushed. It's cool that you get to see the noodles made. I enjoyed the charsu  pork but felt that the soup base could use a little bit more spice instead of msg. It's good for a ramen fix if you're ever craving.,-1,-1,1
178,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,The noodles are good. They make it fresh after you order. The soup could use some flavor. The place is definitely a hole in the wall.

I was expecting stuff like orange / lemon chicken. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The noodles are indeed hand drawn and it comes out real quick. Perfect for a late night grub or if you need to squeeze in a quick bite before a show with a packed schedule. If you looking for a legitimate Chinese noodle experience, I really recommend stopping here.P.S. If you are curious what the Chinese characters say - they're ""Authentic Nan Zhou Hand Pulled Noodles.""",1,1,1
181,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Great tasting noodles, fresh and fast. Some of the broths weren't as tasty as others (I'd recommend beef over chicken). The service was top notch aside from needing to ask for a drink of water.",1,1,1
182,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"This non-descript place right by the Leicester Square tube stop is amazing. It's nothing to look at but if you want to look at pretty things, you're in London. Go to the Tate Modern, the NPG--whatever. If you want delicious made on site, hand cut or hand drawn noodles this is the place I'd go to. I went for the noodles and had the hand cut noodles with stewed beef. The small runs 6 pounds but is massive! I scored an outside table which was less crowded. This place is so much better than so many of the places in Chinatown I've been to. the staff are charmingly indifferent to you, so if your egos bruise easily go to Pret an get their cold noodle salads which will undoubltedly have edamame. But if you want good, soupy, delicious hand cut noodles, this is the place to go.",1,1,1
183,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"I spent about a week in Europe before I started craving authentic Asian food and according to Yelp, this place was great for that so I went here in desperation on a Monday afternoon. As a solo diner, I was seated at a crowded table next to seven other diners. The guy next to me seemed displeased at his lack of personal space but I've spent a fair amount of time eating at food stalls in Taipei so this was nothing to me. I ordered the spicy + sour beef noodle soup with the knife cut noodles - it came out within a few minutes! (Although a party of four next to me didn't seem to have the same luck as they seemed to be waiting for a bit).The actual food: great taste value for my broke American college student self struggling to adapt to the British pound (my dish was 7 pounds but I thought it was 7 dollars while I was ordering it - still it's good value compared to most other places). The soup was savory without being too salty. I very much appreciated the spicy sauce provided at the table. The noodles were thick and fresh. The beef wasn't the best but I'm also spoiled by my mom's cooking. Service was efficient and fast (all I can ask for...and all you should really expect at these prices). Anyway, I will definitely be stopping by here on my grocery trips in Chinatown.",1,1,1
184,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"I was craving spicy hot noodle soup with meat, came here and got exactly that. La mian noodle soup with char-siu and added pork-veggie wontons (for an additional cost). The food came out within 10 mins and was burn-your-mouth hot...just the way I like it! There's a jar of chili flake paste on the table you can also add to make it spicy. So duh, I had to. The tables are like picnic style with benches and you sit with other parties, but I didn't mind. They don't cram you in or anything...you'll still have elbow room. If it gets more people in faster, then it works. The place is really small though, there are only 3 picnic tables I believe, so it's good that they get people in and out fast.",1,1,1
185,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"Dropped by after reading all the reviews and was a little bit disappointed. My main complaint is the taste of the soup noodles. The noodles definitely contain more than just flour & salt, I couldn't pinpoint what the weird flavor was. Ive had Lanzhou lamian and knife cut noodles countless times in China & the US and Ive NEVER tasted anything like this. So be warned.Noodles aside, the broth was a bit light but the meat and vegetables were just fine. Their takeout food is very basic and the same as any other. I will definitely come back and try their fried noodles & other dishes though!You will be sharing communal tables with others, group over 4 people will probably find it hard to get an empty table.",-1,-1,-1

187,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Absolutely love this place! I feel like I walked out of London and into Hong Kong except they speak mandarin instead of Cantonese. The place is a little small but for the most part it's clean.The best part about this place is that they have hand cut noodles.. Amazing!! Get the pork sliced noodles NOT the cha sew.",1,1,1
188,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"I wonder if this is associated to the Lanzhou in Manhattan Chinatown, which also serves hand pulled noodles. Maybe just a coincidence. Noodles and broth on point. This place is no nonsense Chinese place. Great food. Shared tables. Cheap for the area.",1,1,1
189,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"I've both eaten in and gotten take-out from here a number of times. Probably one of the cheapest meals I've had in London. Also, one of the tastiest and most authentic. These are legit hand pulled noodles and we are so happy we found this place!When you walk by it on the street, most people wouldn't even take a second look as it has all the makings of really bad Chinese. From the window you can see a steam table with a bunch of dishes. You know, the classics like fried rice, chow mien, orange chicken, etc. Don't be fooled. Walk in and you will see that there is a man making hand pulled noodles right behind the steam table, and there are a few tables for eating. Sit down, get a menu and order one of the noodle dishes! Also, if you're looking for some type of ambience, you won't find it here. This is no frills, the long communal tables in the back (yes, you might be sharing a table with strangers) are just there so you can eat your food and then get out. We're all about the noodle soups and I love both types of noodles. If you like thicker noodles, get the ""dao xiao mian"" which is knife cut noodles. If you like them thinner, go with the ""la mian"" which is hand pulled - though you can get the la mian in different thicknesses as well (skinny to fat to flat). They're all good and always perfectly al dente. They have a bunch of different noodle soups but we usually get the stewed or sliced beef. They are both our favorite. If you like it spicy, add some of the hot chili sauce on the table, so good! The only misstep we've had (and why it is 4 instead of 5 stars) is the fish noodle soup. It was incredibly bland. The noodles were good but the broth had no flavor. In our opinion, the beef options are where they shine!If you want to try some of their other dishes, we've had their mapo tofu - definitely a no. It comes with peas and carrots and isn't the slightest bit spicy. Their dumplings actually didn't fare much better as the skin was way too thick. The one standout that we have had would be the pig ear with cucumber. Totally refreshing due to the immense amount of garlic (don't eat this if you're on your way to a date, dancing, um, really anything that involves close human contact) that they mix everything in along with some vinegar. While pig ear is definitely not for everyone, I actually really enjoy it and Lanzhou makes a very good version of this classic dish!Lastly, the best part is they are open SUPER late. If you're out in Soho for the night and want something to eat other than a kebab at 2am, this is your place. I don't know about you, but this is my perfect end-of-night meal. :)",1,1,1
190,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Difficult to find but enter a small world where you see only Chinese people sitting here and eating. A very good sign. In the small cramped place there are two picnic tables sitting up to six and one long wall table seats up to 3. Be prepared to cozy up with others as the chefs slam down the noodles as the twist and contort it.  Fresh before your eyes, verified. The food came out quickly and ordering the stew beef noodle soup and my friend ordering the plate noodle with slice beef. It was heavenly.  I was saying oh my God as I was eating and that is when I know I found something amazing.  This is authentic.  Prices are great. Absolutely would find my way here next time I'm in London.",1,1,1
191,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Great food, very tasty broth. We went there for a late night snacks, we liked it so much that we returned for dinner two days later. Roast duck soup noodles and spicy soir beef noodle are both pretty good. I only wish the staff wasn't standing next to me waiting for me to order though, I kinda feel pressured lol",1,1,1
192,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"Who doesn't love hand made noodles?!?I don't think I would ever have tried this place, but after seeing the great reviews we decided to give it a go. Any place that has a nasty looking buffet near the window is a big X on my list. Once you wonder in, you notice a couple of guys pulling and knifing dough non-stop.We tried the char sui fried la mian, seafood dao xiao mian, pork and chive dumplings, and the salt pepper fried chicken. The noodles and dumplings were pretty good but the chicken pieces were small and there was not a ton of meat. Fortunately, there were no fried fat chunks though.Food came out reasonably fast except for the char sui fried la mian which seemed to come at least 15-20 minutes after the rest of our food had already arrived. Cash only!",-1,-1,-1
193,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Now THIS is a find worth mentioning. Among busy and tourist Leicester Square, this place at first does not look what it is (I passed by so many times not noticing and thinking this would be yet another rip-off ""Asian""restaurant in the area). Having lived in China for a few months, this place hit the spot immediately and I felt I was back in the country of cheap yet mouthwatering delicious food.Just go straight for the simple noodle dishes with meat. I had the crispy pork belly which was incredibly good. Staff is all local Chinese with little understanding of English which makes this place even better and more authentic. In for a quick bite before your theatre and up for REAL Chinese food (which is hard to find, even in Chinatown): go here and you won't be disappointed.",1,1,1
194,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Even though not all my experiences have been great here. The noodles are one of the best in London and the cheapest eats in town. Yes, you get the typical waitresses flagging you down at the door and you look over and see vats of sweet and sour chicken but look past that and you'll see a heck of a lot of Chinese people inside slurping noodles as the noodle chef is making them! They do both traditional Lamian and dao xian mian for about å£6.50. A big bowl of soupy beefy goodness and homemade noodles. The soupy noodles are so mic better than the dry ones. And the service is Icy at best. I properly feel like I'm in china. The last time I went with Isabelle the mainland Chinese female customer next to me kept pointing and staring at my noodles as I ate. Because they are shameless. I mean keep it subtle no?",1,1,1
195,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,3,"I located this noodle bar on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot since the reviews were a mix of average to amazing. First, as we arrived to check out the menu through the glass window--since there is not an online version we took our time reviewing (I didn't want to go in straight away because it often takes my children a long time to decide what to eat). We were stared at without a greeting by a host person for a few minutes, which didn't bother me too much, but just felt odd. Upon entering we were asked how many (again even though this person had been staring at our family for nearly 5 minutes, he asked), and then promptly seated in the back on a picnic table (next to a sink full of dirty dishes). Although Yelpers had stated the restaurant takes card, I wanted to verify, and asked the host. He stated ""only å£20 more. Don't have, leave, get."" Estimating that our family would easily surpass this guideline, we stayed seated. Not a big deal, but they serve both Pepsi and Coke products (å£1 for a can, 20p more for Coke? Strange, but okay). Now came time to order or so we thought. The waitress was friendly, but was really pushing with regards to the menu ""noodles are specially, you order noodles,"" she took our drink orders, and walked away. I totally get it, noodles are the thing here. She returned with the drinks a few minutes later. The majority of our party went for noodles. Of note, the one dish that was not noodles, was served with steamed rice (some good parts, many parts were hard and clumped). However this dish was Kong pao chicken, and the chicken/sauce made up for the lame rice. Back to the other dishes: noodles were amazing, we had a dry chicken dish and sour/spicy chicken noodle soup. No issues with these noodle dishes at all. We also had very good crispy spring rolls! Yet, back to the issues of service. Having never been there before, we were unsure of where to pay/how to pay. I got up and asked the host, and he only pointed me to the cash register, then screamed across the restaurant at the cashier. I never received or was even able to review my bill. I attempted to follow the addition on the register (everything seemed to line up until the last items), this is where a mysterious å£5.20 was added to the bill. I asked, and the cashier responded ""VAT, card charge."" Card charge didn't make sense as I was never notified of this when I asked before, but not willing to argue, and ready to go, I said nothing further. Yet, I suspect this is the main reason many people can't give the restaurant better ratings: the interactions. I want to see my bill. It was a good meal, and I'm willing to pay for it, but if you cannot explain to me why I am paying xå£ for my food, I don't want to return. Sadness.",-1,-1,-1
196,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"It's cramped and very, very Chinese, so it's not at all a great place to take guests, but I do anyway because the noodles are amazing. Walk straight in and avoid the Westernized Chinese fare that's out for takeaway in front, and ask for a table (in Chinese if you can). They'll seat you wherever they've got room (friends and I got plastic stools handed to us at one of the outside tables once...) and when you're ready, order your noodles. The classic beef noodle soup is amazing, as is the thicker cut beef stir-fry noodles. Their vegetable dishes are done well, too. One note - they only sell bottled water or soft drinks. No complementary tap here, but hey, it's cheap enough that the bottle doesn't add much onto the bill.",1,1,-1
197,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Best hand pulled noodle outside of China.I visited the noodle bar on a Friday night at 7 pm.  This was literally one of the first restaurants out of my first trip to London and I was REALLY REALLY excited to see some authentic Lanzhou noodle place outside of China.  Although the restaurant was in a touristy area the small group of chinese customers waiting outside of the restaurant convinced me that this must be a legit place.  I was first a bit intimidated by the line but it actually moved pretty quickly.  Even from my place in line outside of the restaurant I could see the chefs pulling the noodles by hand.  Wow that was a sight I have not seen outside of China.  The broth was very authentic and I snorted that bowl in 15 minutes.  No wonder the line moved  so fast haha.  I then proceeded to visit that noodle place every night for the next 3 nights.  Even my caucasian bf admitted that this was one of the best noodle places he's ever been to and we frequently visit good chinese restaurants in the San Francisco area.    The service was very efficient but honestly pretty nice compared to the standard good chinese restaurants in the bay area (US).  Also - most importantly, tipping didn't seem to be a thing in that restaurant so I really don't understand what everyone is complaining about.",1,1,1
198,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,2,"It's almost never that I don't leave a tip, but I swear that if they had added one to this meal, I would have removed it.Service: perfunctory. He wasn't particularly rude but he was zero on the helpful scale. After getting the meal we were on our own.Seating: we were taken downstairs, a tiny table by the stairs with a stool and a chair. Apart from being uncomfortable, if you sat there you'd have people brushing by you constantly. We said we'd wait, then they found found us a better table and gave the other one to the next sucker.Food: maybe we ordered the wrong thing. Of course we got the noodles, one of each type, but I got mine 'dry' not realizing that dry meant flavourless, and that it only comes in a wide noodle. My g/f got the other noodle, fried, wide; that one tasted OK but big lumps of pasty flour tasting noodle where it obviously wasn't 'pulled' correctly, or cooked long enough. Putting enough chili oil on both made them tolerable. Mine was with duck, a tiny portion of duck. My g/f got chicken, a ton of chicken. Both meals were huge, so if you are just going for quantity you probably won't be disappointed for the price.tap water: they don't do tap water! That's right, the only restaurant we've ever been to that wouldn't give us tap water, even though they served some other people some kind of drink in a polystyrene cup so it's not like they couldn't have managed it.Most people were getting the soup, so maybe that was the better thing to order, but it doesn't matter to us because we won't be back.",-1,-1,-1

That's about it. I tried following my nose towards a good option, but nothing really popped out as a great option.Thwarted, I walked towards Leicester Square station with my head hung low. However, as I crossed the street, a certain aroma hit me. Spicy. Meaty. Something was calling me towards this small, unassuming shop with a queue full of Chinamen. An auspicious turn of events to say the least.The weather wasn't the best, but I could see that I'd have to wait a while if I wanted a seat inside. But I had no problem sitting outside in the cold. I asked the waitress what the big deal was and she told me, ""Beef noodle soup. Very good."" How could I say no?Fortunately, she was completely on point. Hand-pulled noodles made en masse all day is the star here. Like having al dente pasta with a hearty broth ( a broth which didn't have too much MSG if any).Needless to say, I came here literally every day I was in town. Not on purpose of course. It just happened to be around when I had a craving.

213,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"My daughter and I were visiting London for 10 days this month and we went to Noodle Bar twice. The food is so very good!!! Really amazing. What you should know before you go:If you plan to dine in, prepare yourself for an up close an personal experience with your fellow diners. The dining area is very, very small with few tables but they are insanely busy!! You will be seated shoulder to shoulder at communal picnic styles tables and bench seats with perfect strangers which most of us aren't accustomed to. It was uncomfortable for me at first until I embraced it as an experience I'll always remember. It's loud and it's hot in there too. The second time we enjoyed Noodle Bar food, we did take away and ate in our hotel room. The food is remarkable! Really wonderful when you're hungry in a town where the food is weird and expensive :)",1,1,1
214,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Recommended by a coworker - quite tasty! We had the dao xiao mian and it was quite nice, if I came back would also want to try the la mian.",1,1,1
215,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,Hand made noodles were amazing! I got the chicken dao xiao mian and got to see them roll the dough and make the noodles super fast whole slicing it into the pot! The noodle texture tastes amazing and the chicken had a lot of flavor! The price is super affordable and the portions are huge! I would definitely recommend it to people who crave Asian food or want to try legit noodles!,1,1,1

217,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"I'm always skeptical of places beckoning customers to come in, and also front window buffet displays that contain congealed food.But for this gem, I will happily squeeze myself between all the patrons at one of the 3 tables in the back, and eat all the noodles there are here.  We ordered the Tomato and Egg, and Pickled and Egg, bowls of thin noodle soups, and were bowled (hardy har) over by the amount of egg there was in here.  We could have shared just one bowl, and it would've been more than enough.Aubergine was a bit oily, but it was addictive. Cucumber in garlic sauce was wonderfully garlicky.Whole meal cost us 25 quid, not bad for a filling meal for two. Remember it's CASH ONLY",1,1,1
218,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Came here after watching Miss Saigon so there wasn't really a wait. My wife had the beef soup pulled noodles and I had the beef soup knife cut noodles. We went in with low expectations as different people have different opinions on what's considered authentic/tasty. But we were happy that the Yelp reviews this place received were well deserved. The only reason this place didn't receive five stars is that the cucumbers were a huge let down. I love me some Chinese cucumbers, but I felt as if this place cut up some cucumbers and mixed it with a pinch of salt and dribbling of vinegar. For the price, they could have put in a bit more effort. However, with that being said, I would definitely come back, but forgo the cucumber next time.",1,1,-1

I ate it.It was delicious. It was cheap. It was awesome.",1,1,1

228,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Yum Yum Yum, came here 2 nights in a row and still walked away full and happy! I came here with Yinnie one night after watching The Pride (which was fantastic BTW, courtesy of Yelp!).  I stuck with my usual stewed beef la mian soup noodles.  Broth was tasty, beef was still tender, with lots of cilantro, just how I like it!  Yinnie had the Fujian Peanut Sauce noodles with La Mian (å£6) - it was a dry dish with a peanut sauce overtop.  I'm not usually a huge fan of dry noodles, so I personally didn't think it was that appetizing to me.  We also shared an order of the garlic cucumbers soaked in Chinese dark vinegar, which was just OK.  I think they key to this is that the cucumbers need to be soaked a bit longer, and the seeds need to be removed - otherwise the vinegar gets watered down which is what happened here. Onto the 2nd night! We had 4 people with us and ordered the following items:Salt and Pepper Squid, å£7 - 8 large pieces of squid, nicely fried, better than any other Chinese resto I've hit up in London. Could have been a bit more spicy, but was easily remedied with their massive pot of chili oil!Stewed Beef Frried Dao Xiao Mian, å£7.50 - nicely done, thick chewy noodles fried with chunks of tender beef and sauce. Dan Dan La Mian in soup, å£6.50 - it was just OK, couldn't detect much peanuttiness in this dish.  I probably wouldn't order it again.Fried Pork and Chive Dumplings, å£5 - 8 pieces of pan fried dumplings, really good value and tasty! Make sure you dip it in the chinese dark vinegar with chili oil Mapo Tofu, å£6.50 (with rice, å£2) - spicy tofu dish with some veg in it, sauce wasn't too thick, could have been a bit spicier, but overall a decent dishBeef Tripe in Red Oil, å£6 - Just cooked beef tripe sliced thinly, with hot chili oil drizzled on top.  I've had this cold appetizer several times before, but its generally not my favorite. We all ordered a few drinks, and it came to å£14pp, and rolled away full! Again, decent place, would come back in a heartbeat to try other adventurous things on the menu.  Don't expect much on their service side.. they are pretty efficient in how things are done, our dishes rolled out very quickly, but have an eagle eye watching you, because once you're done, they will tell you to settle the bill up front since there's usually a table waiting.",1,-1,1
229,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,Great cheap food that's served up quick and fresh. There was a line out the door when I visited today (a Saturday) for lunch. Had the steamed pork dumplings and sliced beef noodle soup. Would recommend both.,1,1,1
230,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Wow I felt like I was back in China when I stepped into this little hole-in-the-wall. It's very narrow and there's tight seating in the back and downstairs in their little basement. The kitchen is at the front and you can see the staff making the noodles, pulling and sketching the dough. It's very fun to watch and to know that your noodles you're about to eat are authentic. I got the most popular dish, which is the beef noodles; my friend got the pork belly noodles. The portions are enormous and it was difficult for me to finish the whole thing, but it was incredibly tasty. It was only 6.50. Definitely coming back, I want to try all their noodles!",1,1,1
231,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Outstanding pulled noodles. Fried rice not bad either. Atrocious service. Still gets 4 stars, that's how good the food is.",1,-1,-1
232,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"It is authentic enough to have it outside Lanzhou. If you want the noodle to have more flavor, you should choose thin or regular. If you want your noodle to be more chewy, thick will be a good choice. Try to avoid of lunch or dinner time if you don't want to wait in a long line.",1,1,1
233,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"As always - it depends on what you're here for. If you ever swing by this joint, please ignore the å£5 (or whatever it is) box of pick and mix of pseudo-Chinese food and make your way through to the back. You'll be doing yourself a favour. Although if you find me cramped enough on a table - please come back another time.It's all about the soup noodles here, whatever else you had on your agenda when coming here, throw it away. I've had a few of the noodles here, my favourite is probably the hot and sour soup with beef slices and knife cut noodles. It's warming, big and satisfying in every way, the price tag is also music to my ears. Sometimes I order sides of dumplings or tofu and although it's nothing to write home about, home being Hong Kong, in this case - it's good enough to compliment the noodles.I can see coming here in the summer being an infrequent occurrence, but I will endeavour to try as long as the price doesn't go up, this place has a firm place in my heart for it's authentic Chinese noodles - I always leave content.",1,1,1

Their portion is huge but because the handmade noodle is made so well that I did not find it fattening. In addition, the price is so cheap!!!! Definitely recommending everyone to try this place",1,1,1
236,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,1,"We're in London and we have a craving for Chinese noodles.  Nope, disappointed.  Broth had no flavor.  Both are noodles dishes lacked flavor.  Place is dirty and cramped.  We sat so close together to the next guests - literally like sardines.  It was a fire hazard.",-1,-1,-1
237,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Don't be fooled by the neon orange chicken in the ready-made buffet by the window. Nor be bothered by its too too convenient location right outside of Leicester Square Tube. Do notice, however, the queue of Asians crowding the very narrow entrance. Ok, I DID notice that they assumed that every non-Asian walking through the door probably wanted chow mein and neon chicken. Is this racist? No, not really, because in my time sitting in the restaurant, pretty much every person that came in that wasn't Chinese-ish looking DID order neon chicken takeaway... Hmm. Be brave. Beat their assumptions. Come in, say you want to order noodle soup, and they will seat you in the small communal tables in the back. Legit la mian with char siu. I didn't like it quite as much as the minced pork la mian from the Brick Lane La Mian Stall, but this is probably the second best Chinese noodle soup I've had in London. If you are a fan of noodle soups, definitely check this place out. Nom nom on a chilly London day.",1,-1,1
238,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"The first person to discover honey probably looked at a beehive and thought, ""I bet those bastards are hiding something delicious in there"".  I think I had similar (less offensive) thoughts when walking past the innocuous-looking Noodle Bar, which features a buffet in the window.  All you need are the two magic words 'noodle soup' to give you access to the La Mian list.  The place itself is dinky - there's barely enough room to hand-stretch noodles in there, and there are only 4 small communual tables, so you may find yourself being asked to move up halfway through your meal (they'll even move your bowl for you mid-mouthful - such attentive service!)Despite all this, the staff have been pretty friendly towards me, and the La Mian soup noodles are pretty good - the noodles are freshly made on the premises and not overcooked; so far I've had crispy pork and stewed beef as 'toppings' (yeah, the crispy pork thing kind of seems a bit pointless in soup as it gets a bit soggy, I just don't like HK-style char siew very much).  The stewed beef was ok, but I prefer the one from the La Mian stall on Brick Lane.  A big positive is the tub of chilli on the side, I just can't resist the stuff, even if it makes my nose drip and my brow glisten.At å£6.50 a bowl, you can't really go wrong here.  It's a good bowl of noodles, fairly filling, and generally fast.  Their menu also claim to open at 9 on most days, so it's become my breakfast noodle venue of choice by default.",1,1,1

241,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,4,"Hidden behind the bright glow of the sweet and sour chicken, sitting on the gross looking buffet in the window, is delicious noodle soup. The menu is long, with mostly crummy looking dishes, but when you get to the end you find a list of hand pulled noodles with the option of soup or not. You can get la mian and dao xiao mian -- from my understanding some are noodles that are pulled and all the same, rather than ones that appear just torn up pieces of noodle.It gets crowded, so prepare to sit in someone's lap, or their table and don't expect good service. It was slow, but damn was it worth the wait. I opted for the pork slices, Char Siu.. I also saw the crispy duck which looked phenomenal. This is truly a hidden gem.

The char siu and la mian noodle soup is fragrant with a hint of star anise and garlic with well balanced broth (not too salty or weak or too dense) and I always love hand pulled noodles. A large portion with plenty of noodles. Spring onion and coriander added to the slices of char siu which had the right flavour, not quite as tender as I have had at some other places but still great. You can also enjoy watching the cook swinging loops of noodle dough back and forth between his outstretched arms to make hundreds of strands of doughy noodle goodness in the tiny open kitchen.Pretty extensive menu with many options (soup noodles are just one section on the menu). Great if you want to eat quickly and be prepared to squeeze up with fellow diners on cramped tables because it's always crowded but come here for the food. It's unpretentious and it's great value too at å£6.50.",1,1,1

The hand pulled noodles that I got were a bit thinner than the guy's across from mine but it still tasted amazing. I didn't drink much of the broth because there was a lot of msg in it.

245,chinese,VZqEzifhvtYAxkWw6AuiCg,Lanzhou Noodle Bar,5,"Great noodle place! The noodles are either hand pulled (la mian) or knife cut (dao xiao) and you can put all sorts of meat in there. The broth is pretty good and for only å£6.50. It's definitely a steal since I have not had anything like this in years!!There are only 2 tables that seat 6 people each and then a bar area that seats 3 people. You will likely be forced with people that aren't in your party, but it's a great way to get to know people. I was seated at a table with a party of 3, party of 1, and party of 2.Even better is when it rains, they give you some napkins to help dry off and the service is super quick! I ordered, got my meal, ate, and was out in about 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend trying this place.

Simply amazing, and If you can handle them make sure you get their mixed beef/intestine/tendon noodle soup, all their other BNS varieties are excellent. Their hand-pulled noodle is made per order (128 noodles per bowl, we counted), and the beef was cooked to perfection.

Noodle Bar is on Cranbourne St inbetween the twin hells of Leicester Square and Covent Garden and their USP are their Lanzhou-style hand pulled noodles aka la-mian. I stood transfixed watching the noodle maker convert a block of dough into la-mian to go into a bowl of soup with roast duck. Sadly, the roast duck was a bit tired and soup was full of MSG but frankly standards are lower when you're drunk and besides the noodles were a work of art. The other guys I was with couldn't wait for a bowl of noodles so they went for a selection from the buffet counter where lurid sweet and sour pork, beef in black bean sauce, and other take-away classics lurked. I must confess I went for a giant spring roll whose greasiness soaked up yet more of the booze. I need to go back here one day when I'm able to walk in a straight line. eatlovenoodles.blogspot.‰Û_",-1,1,1

Alternatively you can get a Tonto size portion of food from the Buffet for a fiver and eat in  that's great value for that area.

I had high hopes for this place because of the great reviews I read, and being a noodle enthusiast I have to try all the (good) noodle places in London. The place was packed, and I ordered their ""signature"" soup, the beef la mien (not to be confused with the Japanese ramen), when the order came, the noodles were coagulated, and beef slices were tough and chewy, and the worst part was the soup, it was full of MSG, and full of sodium too. I asked for a glass of tap water to relieve the yucky taste my tongue and throat, and the answer I got from the rude waiter was: we don't sell tap water here. Although the noodles were ""cheap"" by Leicester Square standards (å£6.50), I found it to be a giant waste of my money because I couldn't bear to eat the rest of my soup/noodle.",-1,-1,-1

But these are some of the best and most authentic Chinese noodles I have found in London so far. The place is a bit cramped, the air conditioning leaks on some tables in the lower floor, and the place in general is very small. But in a way this makes it even more authentic. The only real downside is that, as many other restaurants in the area, they don't accept credit cards and you have to bring some cash with you (or run to an ATM if you forgot).",1,1,-1

I was part of large group that wandered into this tiny gem just around the corner from Chinatown and thought ""oh crap, this isn't going to be good.."" that was after being led through the main dining room/restaurant, down tiny, steep stairs, and into a second, closet-like dining room in the basement. We all wondered what we were in for, but after a few rounds of tsingtao we were game for anything. Having filled my stomach with beer, I ordered the breaded sauteed mushrooms.. and OMFG, best mushrooms ever. Seriously. Even people at the table who HATE mushrooms were picking off my plate! Others had noodles (which were freshly pulled as other reviews have mentioned), some had soups.. all in all, everyone agreed that it was fantastic and that we were wrong to have thought we were in for a nice dose of salmonella (which no one had, lol).

All of the food was FAR too salty besides the duck which was cooked perfectly. The only thing I would order again would be the duck.

283,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,5,"My husband and I found ourselves wandering around Chinatown shortly after seeing a musical in the West End.  Many of the restaurants had menu boards outside.  Most of them were open late and we were interested in a snack.  I had a terrible time deciding where to stop.  I'm pretty picky about my Chinese food after doing a study abroad in Shanghai a few years ago.  However, when we came upon Golden Dragon, all signs pointed to ""here.""  First, there were about a million Yelp stickers on the window and I love yelp, it rarely steers me wrong.  Secondly, Golden Dragon is the name of our favorite Chinese restaurant back home.  Third, my husband saw the ducks and knew that was exactly what he wanted so in we went.  My husband debated over which version of the duck to get and eventually decided on the duck with rice based on the recommendation of the server.  He LOVED it.  He said it was one of the best things that he ever put in his mouth.  It was by far and away his favorite meal in London, but one of his favorite meals of the year.  He wouldn't shut up about it the rest of the trip.  I ordered egg fried rice which I know sounds really boring, but it sounded incredible to this pregnant lady.  My stomach is super out of whack these days so I wanted something simple.  It was also very late so I didn't want to eat anything too heavy either.  I don't think the photo I took of my rice does it justice.  It looks really boring, but it was actually super delicious.  It had great balance of flavor.  Finally, the prices were reasonable and the service was fast and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place.",1,1,1

No surprise some places do that. But then I looked over at someone else's table and their version looks like it's ready for a tv commercial. The waitress told me it was because I said I wanted soft noodles inside of crispy. The bbq pork looked like it was days old, had no red outer glaze, and was inedible. I asked the other waiter if he would eat it and he paused for a good minute making an awkward smile then replied no. Nothing was done to resolve this.  The other dishes we ordered were ok at best.FYI - Service fee of 12.5% is added to your bill automatically. The table next to us was screaming about it",-1,-1,-1
287,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,3,"My girlfriend and I luckily stumbled upon London's Chinadown while taking a stroll around Piccadilly Circus. Although there were plenty of restaurants to choose from, we rolled the dice on Golden Dragon after seeing their decent Yelp reviews. It was no surprise that about 95% of the customers were non-Asian and, from the looks of it, were probably tourists, but don't let that deter you from thinking the food was not legit. Once we got inside and were seated, we actually could have easily mistaken the restaurant for any Chinese restaurant we had been to back home in New York. In addition, we were greeted by employees that spoke to us in Cantonese, and in a way it made us feel like we were home. As for the menu and food, the menu selection was huge and very detailed. Every legit food that we could get back home was on the menu for all to see. All of it in Chinese and English. The only gripe we had about the menu ... the prices! Everything was much more expensive here.After mulling over the menu, we decided on the Crispy Sucking Pig, Orange Duck and Tofu with green vegetables. When the dishes came out there was an obvious observation and that was that the dishes were kind of small for family style type food. The flavors were OK, but nothing like we hadn't had before. However, it wasn't a bad thing either because we now knew that London had a Cantonese food scene that we didn't realize existed prior.Bottom line: The restaurant was huge (with 2 floors), the employees were fairly nice and spoke good English, the menu was legitimately true to Cantonese style food and the flavors were average compared to what we had experienced back home.",-1,-1,1

I dare not offend, but yes!My mates and I were just craving some Peking duck and this restaurant, filled with yelp stickers on their window, served us exactly what we wanted. I would say I have an average knowledge of Peking duck around the world. Beijing tends to be really fatty and oily because that's how they like it. Hong Kong tends to serve the skin and aerate it so it's crispy and light. London, on the other hand, serves it crispy and light but cuts off loads of meat so we can eat the meat too!We also ordered some other side dishes as well. Roast pork, Pei Pa Tofu, Kung Po Chicken, Garlic Kale. They were all very tasty and I can see myself trying other things on the menu in the future. I'm making a mental note to try their Dim Sum in the new year!In terms of service, I felt that it could be better. Like any Chinatown restaurant, I find that they're a bit pushy. They wanted us to order food as soon as possible, eat and leave. I'm use to that. But I don't see why they need to be that pushy when they still have extra tables for customers.",1,1,1

I was made slightly uncomfortable by the fact that the staff circled the dining room and I felt like I was being watched throughout my entire meal.

This place is in the heart of Chinatown in Soho and while it was very busy the night I was there, it took less than ten minutes to be seated.  Taking a tip from other reviewers I tried the crispy duck appetizer, then some wonton soup, followed by a crispy beef with chili main course.  Overall the food was quite good and I did not find it too salty as some reviewers have found it.  The duck was the best and I would not hesitate to go back just for that dish.  The soup was overflowing with wontons which was great, but the flavor was mild.  I expected the crispy beef with chili to have some heat to it, and it may have, but this was cut by its sweetness.  Reminded me of General Tso's chicken I have had elsewhere, which would have been fine but I was expecting a more savory and hotter dish (this was no fault of the food or it's preparation, just my expectations).",1,-1,1

Piece of shit!!,-1,-1,-1
306,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,4,"I came here with a couple friends on a Tuesday evening (around 6 pm) and the place was already fairly packed. The wait wasn't too bad though - no more than 10 minutes. For food we went for three dishes - sauteed prawns with vegetables, monk vegetable dish, and honey barbecue pork (I don't remember the exact names) - and three orders of white rice. After we ordered, the lady taking our order indicated that she thought three dishes wouldn't be enough for us - this was fine, but what bothered me was how when we said we would order more later if that turned out to be the case, she said that if we did that we would have to wait 20 minutes for the next round of food...I also didn't appreciate how when we got three orders of rice (for four people) and I asked how big the rice portions were, she said they were ""very small"" and ""only for one person."" Both of her claims turned out to be wrong, however, as the three dishes were perfect for feeding four people, and the rice portions were HUGE.Anyway, I was very satisfied with the food. My favorite dish was the prawns, which I thought was very light but well-flavored. I also liked the monk vegetable dish, which came with stir-fried tofu, mushrooms, and other greens. The honey barbecue pork though...I wasn't a fan - it was very difficult to chew and was too heavy on the sauce, in my opinion.Overall, I enjoyed my meal here (despite the service in the beginning) and the food definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food. I've been to a couple other Chinese restaurants in the area, and this place has definitely been my favorite so far in terms of both food and service (overall).",1,-1,1

It didn't take long before we were seated, at first we were told to go upstairs, but the lady saw we had luggage and didn't wanted to hand them in the ""wardrobe"" so she found another spacious table for us close to the door. We ordered a couple of things and got our chinese tea pretty quickly. 1 teapot were charged for 5 people and I see the same teapot everywhere it doesn't even depend on how many people were drinking from that. Our orders arrived pretty fast and before we thought about taking picture of our first dish, it disappeared quickly since we were so hungry! It looked delicious but I miss a bit taste to it, the others at the table agreed it was the fried beef ricenoodles. Then our fung chao arrived, there was nothing to complain about it. The charsiu buns were also fine! We also ordered 1/2 duck, it was perfect but a little bit raw since the meat was a bit too rosy. We also ordered charsiu cheong fun and it was smooth and delicious! Last but not least, we know that in London there's always a discretionairy charge so we were fine with it, but the waiter never came back with our change, at least if he was expecting tips, he should have come back with our money first, BEFORE TAKING WITHOUT ASKING.

We had:- Baked crab with ginger and scallions:  this is a classic Cantonese preparation of crab although I'd never had it baked.  The crab was perfectly cook and the flavour was spot on.  They used a bit too much cornstarch to coat the crab though and brown crab and coating generally was gloopy because of it.  Still tasty but the consistency could have been less viscous.- Gai lan with oyster sauce:  again, another classic Cantonese dish.  Unfortunately, the gai lan was overcooked.   The stalks should have been still slightly crunchy but instead were very soft.- Salt and pepper pork chops with chillis:  very tasty seasoning which was great with rice.  The pork chops were unfortunately not served on the bone and were slightly overcooked.The food was good but could have been slightly better.  However, I'd still come back here for a meal.  They do good dim sum if you are around at lunchtime.",-1,1,1
312,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,4,"Dim sum in London? Look no further. This place is it. First of all, the dim sum menu (like most Yelpers said) is super friendly - with pictures for each menu item served so you know exactly what you are getting. I'm Chinese but my Chinese is shabby so I always somehow manage to order a wrong dish when faced with a menu with no pictures and just text (even when it's translated into English). The wait was under ten minutes for two people at 2:00pm on a busy Saturday. We got: shrimp/chive dumplings (good), bbq pork triangular pastries (a must get, there's a reason this menu item takes up one FULL page of their dim sum menu - it is definitely one of the hottest centrefolds I have ever seen), chicken feet w/ black bean sauce (really good), scallop cheung fun (pass, I have had better), fried shrimp dumplings with salad cream (pass, I have had way better), beef chow fun (good), taro croquettes (good), duck tongue (good, if you are into that stuff--my date was), and steamed spare ribs w/ black bean sauce (portions are too small but they are good). As for the spotty service, we didn't experience any. You get different servers who bring you what you have ordered and some of them are smiling, some of them are not - but who cares? I feel like people who leave bad reviews just because not every server smiled at them when they put the food down is just looking to get their egos stroked. The food is piping hot, fresh and delicious. When you ask for water, it comes fast and when you want an extra plate of chili oil, it comes right away. Tea pot out of hot water? Flip the top up and put it on the edge of your table - it is a Chinese standard way of telling the servers you are in need of a tea refill. Tea is å£1.50 pp but it has unlimited refills, and the refills come fast, which is surprising since my date and I  were seated in a dark corner - we thought they would forget about us, but that was far from the truth. I'm a generous tipper but don't like to be ambushed with the mandatory 12.5% service charge when handed the bill. This was the first dim sum place in Chinatown to have that mandatory 12.5% - so I took one star away. Other than that, I recommend this place and would take my parents here if they ever come visit me in London!",1,1,1

314,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,2,"I decided to try this place rather than opting for my usual picks in China Town.I ordered duck and pork as i normally would do to see if they make it any better. It did not take long for us to be served nor did it take long for the food to arrive either.. But that was the problem, fried squid was too salty and soggy, not at all crispy. Portions were not as impressive as some of the photo reviews i've seen either - maybe because it was a Friday night, who knows.Upon receiving the bill i asked about their discretionary service charge - waitress was quick to defend and in her words ""you sat down, we served you.."" Quite forceful like I had no choice but to pay it.Whatever, I was going to pay it anyway i was only asking. Needles to say, she did not come back to process my payment and had to call over another waiter.",-1,-1,-1

The eel was very well cooked, not overcooked which is easily done.  The Roast Pork and Suckling pig was great.  The vegetables was cooked to perfection.  I can testify that it still is as authentic as food I ate in Hong Kong, the service is efficient but impersonal.

318,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,5,"For my first dim sum experience in London, Golden Dragon was a jaw-dropping and belly-gratifying opening salvo, so I'm glad my mates invited me along!We started with half a roast duck, dripping with nutrients (see: fat), and the flavors were so rich, I wasn't even really tempted by the usual orange sauce. My mouth just kept flashing DUCK, MM, DUCK into my brain, which was more than okay.Then the waves of steamed dumplings started washing over us all, and there were serene moments of the eight of us just chewing and sighing at how good it was. Big fan of their Shanghai soup dumplings actually, and the boiling soup didn't have that MSG tang when it hits the back of your throat.Other highlights were their aubergine clay pot (get some white rice to soak up all juices, folks), the sticky rice packets, and the spicy chicken feet.Staff was rather friendly! We had an OBSCENE amount of decadent food, and it came out to å£17 a person.Come check it out on a Sunday afternoon with your eating dress on, and then go curl up somewhere for naptime before the dim sum sweats start.",1,1,1

Instead, she said ""10 pounds minimum.""  I thought this was a bit rude, but I was starving and missing Asian food, so I sat.I ordered the following:  1 cup of hot and sour soup (decent, not great), salt and pepper soft shell crab (very good), and crispy noodles with seafood (decent, but the sauce was clumpy), and 1 glass of water.  My food was served efficiently, but the service was never friendly.To top it all off, the bill was 23 å£ - and yes, they added the 12.5% for the ""service"" I received.  The most offensive part is that they charged me 2 å£ for my small glass of still water.  If they were going to charge me for my water, they could have (at the very least) left me the bottle on the table!

There were only the 2 of us, so, we were going to order 4 dishes. When we finished placing our orders, the waitress said, ""Minimum order 6 dishes!""

It is not necessary the way they cook are different,  but it is just the fact that you can't get the same fresh meat and seafood in the UK compared to China.  Especially for Cantonese cuisine,  the freshness of the ingredients are the soul of the dishes. Similar to Italian cuisine,  if the ingredients are not fresh,  u can't copy the taste in Italy. But this Restaurant is surely perfect for family as they have lots of space!!

We ordered tea, --the waiter poured out hot water, caught himself halfway through the pour and came back with actual tea a few minutes later.  Beware the food takes time coming out; the appetizers came out timely, the entree dishes took another 45 minutes & we were served finally only after we asked a waitress -- our original waiter had disappeared --  whatever happened to our order about 30 minutes in.  She checked the order computer then came back and assured us just another 10minutes.  It was another 15minutes, and I was a bit tired and grumpy at that point, but okay let's blame it on the disappeared waiter.  btw London Chinatown itself was hustling and bustling and fun for people-watching on a Wednesday night.

Their beef chow fun was also probably the most authentic I've had in London so far.The funny thing with Chinese food is that everyone has different standards and tastes.

It is my default recommendation for anyone looking for dim sum because the quality is consistent and well above average, plus the location is central. I know Chinatown restaurants seem to get a bad rep, but I go by my taste buds.The dim sum menu is really friendly, with pictures so you can point if you're a newbie. The service is ""Chinatown standard"", brusque and efficient, sometimes a bit hard to get someone's attention, but only a little rude. They only have one kind of tea, unfortunately.Must-gets: baked pork puff, taro croquettes, prawn and chive dumplings, egg tarts for dessert. Their specialty is sesame balls, which are sweet, and I haven't quite figured out when to order them because they take some time to prepare (unless they're sold out). The time is variable: 15 minutes to an hour(!). Sometimes I order them with everything else, and then they come before we're ready. Sometimes I order as we're finishing, but then the wait is too long. It's a mystery. But totally worth it.Fine: cheung fun, steamed pork bun, beancurd prawn rolls, Chinese greens (hard to mess up). I once tried the crispy seafood noodles, which were a little disappointing.They don't take reservations for Sunday dim sum, so just show up at noon. By the time we leave, there's always a queue out the door. Last time was just under å£13pp with 7 people, including tea and service charge.",1,-1,1

It was like a war of chopticks and forks when everybody dived into their food. The roast duck with steamed buns took longer to arrive and by then, we'd already placed an extra order of fried rice, because, Asians LOVE their rice! the boys each had a bottle of Tiger beer to round out the greasiness of our food. I stuck with good old black tea.Decor is typical Chinese resto with wooden accents and year round Christmas tree lights. The tablecloths were tattered looking but the plates are clean. Service was so-so and we had to flag our waiter down for our bill which was 100 quid with tips.

A bit chintzy. They charged us about 3.5 British pounds- that's over 4 US dollars-for a small bowl of white rice!  The worst part of our experience was that we had 2 grand-babies with us. While the 3 y.o. quietly ate her small bowl of plain white rice, the 2 y.o. was getting restless so we let him play with the small salt shaker where he put salt into a bowl, so he doesn't throw a tantrum or food around. The short man, whom I found out was the owner, marched over to our table in anger and scolded us for wasting his salt. He looked visibly angry. We spent 37 BPs ($48) for the light lunch, so I am sure we more than paid for the 5 cents worth of salt my grand-baby wasted.  As we were leaving, he lectured us about controlling the children.

Great balance of sauce and sear, succulent pieces all.  This was 5 stars all day and worth the vinegar, err, ""wine"" I was forced to pair with it.  Now they had other wine choices, but I wasn't about to tempt fate for 25-30 pounds per glass.  If i ouwld have skipped the toast and had a better glass of wine, this was 4-4.5 stars all day.

Furthermore, in order to get our last plate to come out, we tried to flag a waiter down several times, only to be either ignored or unseen. One of the members of my party had to get up and talk to one of them in order to get them to bring the last dish out. Our water glasses were unfilled, nobody came over to ask if everything was okay, and the portions were fairly small.

The latter was stiff and not juicy at all. Whereas squid was tender and not at least rubbery.Shame they don't have any side salads, but you can order broccoli with garlic sauce which is nice too.The place is good for groups - they have large tables that can accommodate up to 8 people at a time.Service is good: they would explain the difference between the sauces & dishes and drop an occasional joke.",-1,1,1

Sweet and sour pork was very tasty along with our beef with peppers. Only complaint would be the service at the establishment. Once our food arrived, we never saw our waiter again.

Just going by their conventional menu GD appears to be no more touristy than the next.Having visited for dim sum several times before booking Chinese New Year dinner, both of GD's on- and off-menus are, in terms of breadth and regional focus (soups, seafood and veggie dishes of the Cantonese persuasion), very much congruent to what one would find in major U.S. cities with a size-able Chinese population and, arguably, Hong Kong itself.  Most tourists and locals would for the most part opt for the BBQ items dangling from the shop window, but it's clear just looking about the dining floor that Chinese customers are calling up steamed sea bass, lobster on egg noodles and single-serving specialty soups.Like anything else in the city, eating out in London can be quite expensive and Chinatown is no exception.  When it comes to dining happiness is key, and to some degree so is value.  GD isn't the only game in town but certainly places in my Chinatown top 3.",1,1,1

He was apparently offended and yelled at us ""why did you come inside if your friend is not here?! Go out and wait till everyone is here."" That was so rude and we were just shocked. We left and we will never come back again. Worst experience in London.",-1,-1,-1
369,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,2,"For food I would give this place a four, but for service and price a 1.I have been to London several times and have seen all the major tourist stuff and one of the tour books had a suggest day walking trip in the west end/SOHO area and seeing I love SOHO and was staying in the west end decided to do that on Thursday.I went to several businesses recommended on the tour and they were all great.   It recommended Golden Dragon for lunch and that was an awful recommendation.The server was the rudest I have ever had at any place in London.   I ordered the number on the menu and she got nasty and said she didn't know the numbers and I had to tell her the item on the menu.   I had bought a pair of shoes in one of the shops that morning and had the bag sitting beside me out of the way and another server walked by and gave me a nasty look and picked the bag up and threw it on the empty chair next to me without even asking.When I ordered I asked for a diet coke and she asked if I was sure I didn't want tea and I said no diet coke and I could tell she was offended.   If you don't want your customers drinking diet coke and only tea, then don't offer diet coke on the menu.The chicken dish was good and it was grilled sliced chicken instead of the deep fried stuff you get in the US.   I cant eat rice with chopsticks and when I asked for a fork was told they didn't have forks and I was in a Chinese restaurant and to use chop sticks.By the time I got my lunch my diet coke bottle was empty and I asked for a glass of tap water.

But happy to make an exceptions when friends are in town, especially when aromatic crispy duck is included in the deal ...Gold Dragon was busy with a good mix of people, ie not just tourists but also large groups of Chinese families, and staff were extremely friendly and efficient.But it is the quality of the food that makes a great restaurant, after all. Perhaps we would have enjoyed everything more had it been a bit hotter. The pancakes served with the duck weren't even luke warm but cold with the main courses arriving on plastic plates - what happened to the old-fashioned tradition of hot plates?I am also not a big fan of MSG and all dishes were heavily reliant on this additive. Some of the sauces actually tasted as if they came straight from a bottle - all very underwhelming.Never again.",-1,1,1
374,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,3,"The dim sum here was quite tasty on the absolute scale of dim sum tastiness, but I'm finding that London dim sum is quite good in general, so I can hardly recommend this place over others on that basis alone.The service was appallingly slow (at like 3pm on a Sunday so it's not like they were that busy) and they lost track of what we ordered and what we had received. They don't keep the checklist at your table like other places do. We were served ice water that was absolutely funky, tasted like watered down rice wine. It probably wasn't alcohol, but maybe some result of a dirty glass?",-1,-1,-1
375,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,2,"On previous trips to London, I've walked past Golden Dragon, thinking it looked too touristy.  But I read some good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try.I walked up next to the cash register, waiting to be seated.  Many employees were rushing by all around me, apparently busy.  Finally one noticed me and seated me.The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (hoe yau gie lon) and the rice arrived at the same time.  They were both tepid.  With electric rice cookers nowadays, which can keep cooked rice fresh and hot for 24 hours, how is it possible to serve tepid rice?The tofu and seafood hot pot (dung gong dau fu boe) did arrive hot and steamy.  It had generous pieces of tofu, some pieces of squid and shrimp, some mushroom caps, and very tender but not overcooked baby bok choy -- all in a broth.  This is a standard Cantonese menu item.  Here, however, the tofu had been stuffed with shrimp and deep fried before being put into the broth.  I wondered, why go through the bother of deep frying something and then putting it into a broth?  And why stuff the tofu with shrimp when this dish already has shrimp in it?  Then the thought crossed my mind that the deep fried shrimp-stuffed tofu could be an ""overstock"" dim sum item.  This dish (dung gong dau fu boe) is typically made with regular, plain tofu.The service was not friendly, but it was efficient.  It was easy for me to flag down a server and ask for some hot sauce.  (In some Chinese restaurants, this is impossible.)My beverage was Chinese tea.  The bill came to å£24.40.  It was not itemized.  I added a 10% tip.  However, I was just re-reading some of the of reviews for this restaurant and they mention that the gratuity was included in the bill.  My bill had nothing broken out.",-1,-1,-1

I never get their main entrees and just stuff my face full of dim sum so can't comment on that (although my father had a beef entree there which was huge and that he enjoyed).  Downside of this place, like most of the restos in chinatown is that it looks a bit run-down, easily forgettable decor for sure, and the staff is not the most attentive or gentile buuuut, I don't think I've ever been to a Chinese restaurant where the staff cracks a smile so I'm going to assume it's a cultural thing and just shove another dim sum in my belly.

There's none of your Ping Pong pretension here -  presentation is average, but the dishes are reasonably priced, generous and taste divine. I absolutely love the Prawn Cheung Fun and the Char Siu. The place is big, sprawling and I often wonder whether they have a hierarchy system in placing people upstairs or downstairs. I'm still trying to work that one out as it all seems rather random. Service is typically unfriendly but fast and efficient. I've spent hours here over lunch, catching up with friends and slowly becoming more whale-like. It's definitely easy to keep eating.

379,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,2,"At most, just your average dim sum based on the Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) and Siu Mai and the Siu Long Bao that I got. Maybe because of the rave on YELP and also an auntie we met on the road that said this place is quite well known for its Dim Sum in the area, so I thought it was going to be good but turned out to be sub par. Pretty average dim sum in my opinion. Nothing really stood out. Not elegant, no unique taste.Taste BreakownHar Gow: it was ok. just your typical taste, typical sizeSiu Mai: there was a piece of shrimp on the top. feels a bit like the taste of har gow more than the typical siu mai which is more of a pork taste.Siu Long Bao: no juice inside. did not even make my mouth water (not hard to do when I'm hungry).I thought the price was ok since I have had more expensive ones and also cheaper ones but maybe in London, this is cheap. I saw another table ordering actual dishes and those look quite good so maybe their other food might be better but based on my own experience on the Dim Sum... it was sub par and therefore the 2 stars.",-1,-1,-1

They serve good teas. I love their Pork Congee with those black colored eggs in it and some of their deep-fried dishes were super good too.

384,chinese,SR_EikaYqs2PiNGPLLWPhg,Golden Dragon,4,"Bollocks! A Yank beat me to it! Haha... Well, I agree with his assessment of Golden Dragon. This is a top notch establishment frequented by many ethnic Chinese. That is generally a good sign of a restaurant's authenticity. If you wander out into the West Midlands or worse, Essex... You'll be hard pressed to find a Chinese restaurant of this calibre.The red barbecue pork buns (Cha Siu Bao) are fluffy and flavourful. Do NOT give into the temptation to dip those perfect white buns into the soy! It ruins the balance of the flavour and the pork is already a bit salty. I also enjoyed the chicken feet. As strange as they may look, they're delicious. They're steamed in some soy sauce vinegar broth, reminiscent of Filipino Adobo. Bloody Hell, I could mong out on those feet for ages; and the best part: you can pick your teeth with the little claws.Now, for the bad part. For traditional Hong Kong dim sum, this place is rather spendy. You can easily shell out 35 quid a person, especially if you accompany your meal with a Tsingtao lager. A similar feast in the States would cost you just about half, but don't think about that. You're an ocean away from New York, and in Jolly England, this is as good as it gets.

Guests are asked to leave their name and number of guests and are then called out. I have never waited longer than 15 min. They have an excellent dim sum during the day but not in the evening. The quality of the food is excellent and decent value for money. If you do not like the hustle and bustle downstairs ask to be seated upstairs. A word of advise: This is an extremely busy restaurant so sometimes it can be a challenge to get the attention of the waiters. Some of them can be quite rude. The breakdown of the bill is written in Mandarin, so try to keep track of what you ordered. Service charge is included in the bill, do not let them charge you twice. Verdict: Good quality food for decent prices in a very touristic area.

They have two large floors that are constantly busy with people, so much so that it's sometimes hard to get a waiter's or waitress' attention. There are so many tables on the floor that they can quickly accommodate especially large groups, something many other Chinese restaurants in the area struggle to do. All of the dim sum dishes are always consistently good, and if anything I highly recommend people try the black sesame dumplings for dessert. It's a little bit of an acquired taste, but when you bite into those warm, white dumplings to intercept the tasty black liquid that fills it, there's just nothing like it. One word of warning is that sometimes they ask if you want to put extra service on your card, when it's already been included in the bill. Sometimes it pays to double check the items you order as you end up having to decipher Chinese characters to validate your bill.",1,1,1

Dishes are moderately priced and you certainly won't be doing your taste buds a disservice. Must-tries include the prawn rice noodle rolls, lotus leaf-wrapped glutinous rice and their mini egg-custards (a sweet alternative to the British nutmeg-laced treats). Be aware however that the staff have a tendency to impose a minimum dish order not levied against linguistically able compatriots. Still, the main menu has much to offer also, and will appear much less daunting if accompanied by an aficionado of Cantonese cuisine. As with most high quality Chinese restaurants, sharing is the key to a rounded meal, particularly given the generous portions afforded for main dishes here. The ambiance encapsulates the fervent collective, both large dining areas ornate and joyous in their decoration, typical of the nation's favoured depiction of prosperity. The service is efficient without being overly boisterous, but do note that as much as they would like you to believe otherwise, the bill summary does include a standard service charge (you can always check the total against the detailed list, albeit written in Chinese). The highest accolade I can bestow upon this restaurant is the simple fact that the three generations of my girlfriend's family (originally from Hong Kong, and including a retired chef), have selected this as their Central London point of convergence.

The beef in the beef noodle soup was absolutely sensational and the pork bun was sweet and perfectly soft.

Standard dish and solid here- Tong Choi - stir fried greens in garlic. They did an awesome job of cooking these; they weren't slimy from overcooking and had the right amount of salt and broth- Curry octopus: the octopus are so teeny and adorable you may feel bad about eating them. But then you take a bite of the tender body and all bets are off- Sticky glutinous rice - my date loves this dish. Sticky rice steamed in leaves; I don't think he counts it as dim sum unless he orders this. What was DIFFERENT about this one was the filling. Huge chunks of meats are inside! One inch+ chunks of pork, fat cuts of Chinese sausages (not the teensy eensy cubes) Dishes are cleared quickly, without feeling like they're rushing you. Teacups are continuously topped off, and all around, the service was far above what I'm used to.All these dishes were under 38.00 GBP. Wicked deal plus the quality (and service!) means I'll be heading back here.",1,1,1
414,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,1,The food here is not authentic. Salted fried rice is too salty. Found hair in our food. Dim sum over cooked. It's all froze and reheated.,-1,-1,-1
415,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"A great spot for dim sum in Chinatown!I was in Leicester Square with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and came here for dim sum after a quick search on Yelp. Most dim sum restaurants had lines but we were seated almost immediately at Joy King Lau. The restaurant is multi-storied and we were directed to the second floor upon entering.Menus were already at our tables when we sat down. You'll see two menus - the dim sum one is laminated and has pictures of all the dim sum they serve, making it really easy to order. If you wanted other Chinese food, you could also refer to the full menu. My friend and I ended up getting thai style chicken feet (cold), shu mai, dough stick cheung fun (jar luen), yam croquette, char siu croquette, and preserved egg and pork congee. The food came shortly after we ordered, and they were delicious and in my opinion, closer to HK standards compared to other dim sum I've had. The yam croquette and char siu croquette are fried dim sum but they were not greasy at all. The shu mai and jar luen were flavorful!Overall, Joy King Lau is a fantastic place for delicious dim sum. Everything came out to be under å£15 per person too, which makes it pretty affordable. I highly recommend getting your dim sum fix here!",1,1,1
416,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,2,"I was discriminated by my own kind!  =OThe moment you walk in, I feel like they vet who stays on the main floor and who they send upstairs to the second floor. I noticed if you're coloured, you're on the second floor.I had the equivalent of what is considered Cantonese fried noodles. It was unimpressive. The meat was cheaper, like fish balls, cut in half. There was 1 shrimp. The portion wasn't a lot. Maybe I'm used to the Toronto standard (i.e. Congee Queen)?They also charge for tea!!!  å£2.10 per person. It's hot water with a few tea leaves. Come to Toronto. Chinese food and dim sum is much better and cheaper.",-1,-1,1
417,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"I take back what I said before, I love this place! You just need to come for the dim sum, forget the rest of the menu (which I reviewed with just two stars). I think dim sum is served until 5pm  and it is served steaming hot and delicious. The prawn dumpling is my favourite but the prawn cheung fun is also really good and very satisfying. This place is seriously yummy in my tummy and is my go-to spot for good dim sum in London. The room is a nice place to sit down and I like going upstairs here to enjoy a leisurely weekend afternoon of dim sum in a spacious room with endless refills of hot tea and good company. The service is good and I would say this is my favourite place in Chinatown.",1,1,1
418,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,3,"Would go 3.5 if allowed. We were two of the very few non-Chinese in the restaurant. A real positive in my book. We were looking for Peking Duck and other dishes pre-theater. The (half) duck we shared was very good -not Great - but very good. Very thin steamed pancakes, good amount of skin and meat along with traditional garnish. We also had cashew chicken (a bit bland but with tender chunks of chix) and Sichuan Green Beans (quite good). Very limited in their alcohol selection but not unusual for a Chinese restaurant. We had Tsing Tao beer (icy cold). Service was attentive but my wife was bothered by the cleaning of the men's toilet in her full view while we were dining. Given the location I'd say the value was fair.",-1,-1,1
419,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,1,"What a rip off, food was only $22 and they managed to add all sorts of charges we end up paying $31 and the worst part is the food isn't even good",-1,-1,-1
420,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"We really enjoyed Joy King Lau.  It was as authentic as you could get.  The restaurant occupies to what seems like 3 floors of dining.  It was packed for lunch, but they got me in pretty quickly due to the size of the restaurant.  All of the food looked and tasted excellent.  I ordered a duck noodle soup.  The duck was excellent.  They didn't remove the bones or cartilage, so don't order if you can't handle that.  The beef brisket soup was quite good as well.  They had a large dim sum collection which was extremely popular with the other diners.  For an authentic China Town lunch this is a great place.",1,1,1
421,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,The best cantonese restaurant in London. Don't miss the steam chilie sea bass and stewed lamb brisket taste like heaven!,1,1,1
422,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"Dim Sum is one of my favourite meals and Joy King Lau has a very competitive offering.  Had been here many years ago but for some reason had not come back.  Went today and it was quite good.  The stand out was a fried garlic and prawn spring roll.   While these are often rather generic this one stood out, primarily because of the garlic.  I ordered the other standbys (Prawn/Pork dumpling, char siu bun and prawn cheung fen); all were good, not greasy and hot.  The only thing I didn't love were Shanghai dumplings but it was just an opinion, they were well prepared and interesting.  Overall, a good option for dim sum.",1,1,1
423,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"I'm happy to report that this place is Excellent. Much better than dumplings legend (which kind of makes me sad bc I've been there many times)It's not lively and it's on a side street but the quality of the 3 dumplings we had was very above average.Need to go back to try more. Mostly did steamed.I should deduct one star as the waitress was AWFUL. So mean!! But whatever, the food was fast and good.",1,-1,-1
424,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"Nice yum cha place with a lot of choices, nothing fancy. Service is not the best, had to ask 4 times before they would serve me my Diet Coke. Come early to be sure to not queue to get a table as it gets really crowded after 12:30pm. Salted egg yolk custard buns were to die for!We paid å£45 for two.",1,-1,1
425,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,1,"**They don't serve dim sum at night. Hot and sour was extremely sour, it was like drinking vinegar. Service was subpar - they had 5 or 6 servers but I wanted water half of the time we dined there. Egg noodles with prawn had a very confusing taste and the noodles were over cooked. The veggie dish we got was soggy. Don't recommend for dinner.",-1,-1,-1
426,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"I ate here because the view from my hotel room was this place. I didn't know what exactly they had, but after seeing a picture list of dim sum from a distance I said why not.They didn't have the carts rolling around, but they had an extensive dim sum menu. I walked in about 5 minutes before they were going to stop serving dim sum and I was able to get a few items. I tried the shu mai, bbq pork bun, beef meatballs, and black bean pork ribs.This was some of the best dim sum I've ever had, and for about 15 pounds. Everything seemed like they made it fresh in house, and the portions were slightly larger than what i'm used to.",1,1,1
427,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,Wonderful and attentive service.  Efficient without rushing.  Authentic Cantonese cuisine that ranges from common dishes to specialty cuisine.  Very flavorful dishes.  It's so wonderful that we went back twice during our short stay in London (once for dim sum and another for dinner). I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for authentic Chinese food in London.,1,1,1
428,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"Best dimsum I have ever had so far (Compared to all the dimsum places I've tried in Boston and NYC). The two staples of dimsum, har gao and shu mai, are amazing and made with the freshest ingredients. The har gao had ""real shrimp"" taste, not like the frozen shrimp used in the states. The shu mai was completely different (a much better different) than anything I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was made with pork but it was perfectly flavored and had great elasticity (many people don't get what I mean by that). But the most breathtaking item on the menu had to be the DEEP FRIED CUSTARD BUNS. These custard buns went from 0-100 real quick in the fryer. The outside layer was a beautiful golden brown and it was the perfect toasted crunchiness achievable on a bun. Definitely making the trip back here when I visit London again!",1,1,1
429,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"This is a review of the dim sum at Joy King Lau.Over 3 days, I ate at Yauatcha, Joy King Lau, and Beijing Dumpling back to back. Joy King Lau was the most authentic tasting Chinese dim sum out of the three restaurants, and the best, in my opinion. I've eaten a lot of dim sum in my lifetime all over California, and this place is a solid ""I would take my family to eat here if they visited London"" recommendation. The cost to eat here for 2 people was less than half of what I paid at Yauatcha. I will be coming back to Joy King Lau, but never returning to the other place.Recommended:- Har Gau (steamed shrimp dumpling). Delicious flavor, fresh-tasting shrimp- Pan fried turnip cake. Nicely fried with crispy edges. Very little Chinese sausage in it though.- Beef rice sheet rolls",1,1,1
430,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"Best place to get dim sum in London, HANDS DOWN. I don't care what anyone else says Joy King Lau is the best. Always packed for dim sum lunch on the weekends but they know how to move people to seats quickly and you're never left waiting too long. Extensive menu and staff are knowledgeable for the inexperienced! My favourite is definitely the cheung fun with shrimp and chicken bao. DIE DIE MUST TRY.",1,1,1
431,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,Decent place for dim sum. They offer most of the traditional dim sum dishes. Prices aren't too bad either.   They also have picture menu which make ordering dim sum easy.,1,1,1
432,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"Dimsum was so good! I tried shrip dimsum, scallop with shrimp dimsum and soup dumpling(shanghai style dumpling?) and service was so nice. I think it was one of my best meal in london",1,1,1
433,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"I've heard frequently that Joy King Lau has the BEST dim sum in Chinatown. This is not true. They do decent dim sum that is better than a lot of Chinatown, but still not the best. Where Joy King Lau really shines is the cooked noodles/rice dishes they do, which have a great fresh flavour, aren't too oily and are good sized portions for the price. We came here as a large group and booked a table which was a pleasant surprise in itself, and were pleased with not only how quickly the food came, but how polite the service is. Friendly waiters are not generally the main aim for when you go to Chinatown, but it's good to know that it isn't entirely gone from the restaurants here! I'll definitely be coming back here as the food is pretty good and cheap, plus the service + reservations means extra high points from me. It's not my first choice for dim sum in Chinatown, but the chefs change regularly at all the establishments so it's hard to keep up!",1,1,1
434,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"Best Roast Duck in Chinatown! Great service. Awesome egg fried rice to go along. Look around, and you'll see stars of the theater eating here... Truly a gem in the area!",1,1,1
435,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,2,"We stop by for dinner early one night and we sat on the second floor. Its a very small restaurant and the seating areas are divided into different floors. I wasn't really impressed by the food that they served. For some reason, I felt that it was lacking flavor to it and it was true for all the dishes that I had. We had two different waiters that waited on us. The older gentleman was very nice and polite and helpful when ordering food , but the older lady that was there at the same time tends to ignore you. I've asked her for extra rice and salt and was ignored and she never brought it to the table. Weird. Be aware that they automatically include the service charge. Sneaky We ordered a Chinese watercress cooked with shrimp paste which was above average , it lacks a little salt in it which I probably wouldn't have mind if I could have gotten my waiter to bring me some salt. Per the waiter's recommendation, we ordered a tofu with seafood plate which had a decent serving with a lot of seafood in it. The food was a little cold. I don't know why. It's not freezing cold but just luke warm. I prefer my food to be hot , straight off from the wok. Maybe it sat on the dummy waiter for a while before the brought it to the table.",-1,-1,-1
436,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"We only stopped here for a quick, light and cheap dinner. As we stepped in the front door, the aroma of food just reminds me of home and comfort food. Everyone seems to be feasting on hotpot and I didn't want a big and elaborous meal. I was surpised that the place seemed to be smaller than it looks. We just had a portion of dumplings and noodles to share. The dumplings, I was not so keen on but those noodles in broth was irresistible. I could not stop myself from having more. The sweetness, spicy, tangy and saltyness were very well balanced. It was definitely my favourite hot and sour noodles in town. Highly recommended!it was cheap, light but not as quick as I thought. It was not necessary a bad thing, just expected a quicker service.",1,1,1

I liked how you order first and then it's brought out to you, where as in the United States, most places have the carts that get pushed around from table to table. The food was hotter this way when we order first and then had it brought to us. There's many options to choose from, and I tried about half of the dim sum menu. Order just about anything and you won't be disappointed.",1,1,1
439,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"I had to dim-sum when I was visiting London, since there are a lot of them at china town I had  a hard time picking one. But fortunately I picked the right one!They have everything you want when it comes to dim-sum. The menu is both in Chinese and English, the staff also spoke those languages (Cantonese). The food was delicious and nothing really to complain about.The restaurant might seem small but there is a second floor, so don't be intimidated if it looks full. The interior is generic Chinese restaurant, a little bit dirty and rusty. The only bad thing really is that the restaurant is very tight, you don't have any privacy and people will bump your shoulders many time if you don't face your back against a wall.If you are in London and looking for dim-sum then this is the place!",1,-1,-1

442,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,3,"Short story: Meh.Long story: If there's one thing I'm crazy about it's going to Dim Sum on weekends. I almost never get to that, so I when I do, it's always super exciting.We got to Joy King Lau through Yelp reviews. Here are the points worth noting for other lovers of the genre:1. Get there on time minus 10 minutes. They start letting people in at ~11:50.2. There are no dim sum carts. You get a special menu and order from that. The menu includes most of the solid favorites. 3. The crowd in this restaurant is mostly Asian, but not only.4. Prices are average. For 2 semi-hungry people we paid å£37, 10% service is included here. 5. Food taste is okay. It's not bad and it's nothing you'll remember later/think to come back for. Personally I would have wanted to have a better tasting meal at Dim Sum. Apparently there are 2 other good spots in London's Chinatown area: Wan Chai and Beijing Dumpling that are similar as well.",-1,-1,1
443,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"Wow, just amazingly good.  Walked in on our way home. Dim sum was outstanding was mixed seafood hot pot, the vermicelli was a little weak but the mix of seafood was outstanding as was the overall flavor",1,1,1
444,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,5,"If you're looking for the best(!) and freshest(!) Dim Sum in Soho - look no further! Joy King Lau on Leicester Street (adjacent to Lisle Street) offers a fairly large menu of steamed & fried dim sum, including some more exotic varieties - and a selection of cheung fun, of course.Just returned from London, where I always have dim sum several times during my stays. So far, I mostly frequented the Wan Chai Corner (on Gerrard Street) for its broad selection and solid quality, or Beijing Dumpling (on Lisle Street) for its absolutely freshly made dumplings. The two I will still recommend strongly - but Joy King Lau is different. All the dim sum are made freshly and have a better (firmer, more al dente usually) bite to them than those of the competition. Also, they're about 15% cheaper in comparison to the other Soho establishments, which also makes this restaurant great value! The regular dim sum are just UKP 2.80 per dish.Three times I had lunch at Joy King Lau in early to mid-August of 2015 - three times I chose 5 or 6 different dim sum each. This might seem too much for the average single traveler, but I wanted to sample as many different dim sum from this place as possible, having read some rave reviews on the Internet (the reviews here are mixed, which I don't quite understand). Expect 3 or 4 dim sum per person for a tummy-filling meal. They made only 1 mistake, as they served me the regular salty fried squid instead of the squid cakes I had ordered.The atmosphere is quite typical for a Soho Chinese. It's always rush-rush-rush - this is no place to linger with friends for a party, or with a large family on a get-together. OTOH, for a quick lunch or early dinner with a friend or wife, it's great. You can always hang out for chit chat at one of the many pubs in the neighborhood (there's a good Fuller's pub a stone's throw away on the same street). Having said that, the waiters *never* forced the bill on me after I'd finished my meals - I had to ask for it!The fact that Joy King Lau is also a small(!) restaurant tends to add to the atmosphere of slight chaos and rush.What's less typical is that the service is very attentive - they're always around to fill up your cup of Chinese tea (which you'll get automatically once you've been seated - so pay attention if you don't want tea!). Sometimes too attentive - there are so many waiters and waitresses around it can happen that one hands you the menu, then turns away, then another one steps up to ask for your order - 30 seconds after you've been seated! It may sound like pushiness - but it is not. The waiters just don't pay attention to what the others are doing.If a little chaos does not deter you, the traveler looking for first class dim sum, then you shouldn't hesitate and include Joy King Lau in your Soho roster of Chinese joints. See the photos for the variety of steamed and fried dim sum I had (not a fan of cheung fun, so I can't comment on those). Particularly recommendable are: the pork & prawn dumplings with Chinese mushroom, the fried skin of chicken filled with four delicacies (just called ""Chicken with Four Kinds"" on the menu!), the beef with spring onion and ginger, the spicy beef tripe (not quite so spicy, actually - it's made with ginger), the siu mai (a standard dim sum, but of higher quality here than elsewhere!) and the chicken with Chinese dumpling (Warning: the chicken here is on the bones!). But ALL of the 17 ones I had were of superior to excellent quality.The bill includes a ""mandatory"" 10% service charge. With 6 dim sum + chinese tea + service I ended up with a UKP 20-21 bill. Very reasonable considering the quality.Dim sum can be ordered up until 5 p.m. (17.00), which is customary in Soho.Almost all of the other guests during my three visits to Joy King Lau were Asian - I always consider that a good sign. Make sure that when you want to have lunch there with 3 or even 2 people that you show up at 12 noon when they open on weekdays, because the small restaurant will fill up quickly.Please have a look at my photos, which also includes snapshots of the menus.",1,1,1

Lots of Cantonese speakers around and the in-laws felt like they were back in Hong Kong.We had jasmine tea for the table and washed the utensils as you would do in Hong Kong. My wife ordered a good variety of dishes, both fried and steamed, for the table to share. The food came out fast and all was as expected.

The Rice Lasagna stuffed with prawns, the wrapping is so much lighter than those I have had in the Chinatown in DC.  The pan-fried pork dumpling is home made, with thin wrapping also.

The Sweetcorn and Tofu Soup was all right but the Aubergine with Garlic and Chilli was irresistably yummy.The restaurant is visited by lots of big groups of Chinese who sit around round tables full of sharing platters. So the atmosphere is quite agitated and casual.",-1,1,1

We went there with a group of friends.As we entered we were directed to the (2nd!) floor. Yes as you go up you feel you are walking in the hallway of some traditional English townhouse. And yes, that means it's fairly packed there. While we were waiting for our table on the 2nd floor landing (yes it looked like a landing :) I had to let people in and out of nearby toilet.The venue itself looks elegant but it's not a kind of in-your-face decor. We had a great Dim Sum there, particularly I remember trying a fermented egg for the first time and it was a delight! The service was very professional and quick. Overall, it's a very decent place and the food is worth its monetary value.",1,1,1
457,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,3,"Perfectly decent dim sum. A little pricier than my current chinatown favourite Young Cheng just around the corner. The room is a little more spacious here however and the staff extremely attentive. Ensuring items get to your table in as few visits as possible. There were only 2 main visits to our table and we had all 8 dishes we'd ordered.Nothing was stand out delicious, and whilst the chicken's feet were very nice and meaty, the sauce left me disappointed. And this was a case for quite a few dishes. Portion wise fantastic, but taste wise, extremely lacking. However this this instance you can normally expect the chilli oil to save the day, and save it indeed. It was excellent.So I have no quibbles recommending this place if you're after good value dim sum. However just don't expect anything to surprise or tantalise your tastebuds. This place has a large number of regulars so they must be doing something right in terms of consistency, but sometimes that is at a price and for my it was the lack of that any one unique dish that you absolutely must go back for.",-1,1,1

Even the worst restaurants I've had in LA and NYC are better than this place.  The portions really small for what you were paying.

We got the usual har low and shiu Mai along with curry welks. All were freshly made to order and came out piping hot.  The aromatic crispy duck was great and retained its crispy skin.   The only thing we didn't enjoy was the wonton noodle soup which was a little bland.  Overall this place is great and highly recommended.",1,1,1

My friend and I, nevertheless, were impressed.  We weren't really hungry and therefore shared a quarter crispy duck from the appetizers with plum sauce and pancakes with a side of bean sprout noodles and it was the perfect amount of food.  The duck was delectable and the noodles were perfect - it had just enough grease without feeling too heavy.  The final price was alarmingly cheap.  Even though we didn't order much, it did fill us and we didn't even finish all of the duck.  The service was good, although we had a bit of a wait for the table, even though we had a booking.  By the way, this place gets jam-packed, so I do recommend reserving a table, particularly before 8 PM because the queue was out the door when we left.  I would definitely come back!",1,1,1

Then menu was pretty extensive, but we restrained ourselves and ordered har kow, char siu cheung fun, sticky rice, spare ribs, and stuffed tofu skins. We found the prawns in the har kow to be fresh with a nice crisp to them and the cheung fun was really similar to what we have experienced in other restaurants. The sticky rice was not too gloopy and was prett flavorful. The service was friendly and prompt. We were seated and able to pay our bill without difficulty. We were seated in the back of the main level and the air conditioner was almost too cold, which just made us drink more hot tea to warm up.

We can always go to New World, but let's at least have a look from the outside...ok?A: Mmm...if you really want to...but...In any case, as you might have guessed, we ended up having dim sum at Joy King Lau and believe it or not but even A ended up liking the food very much:A: Yummy...their food is really tasty! And even the chicken feet, which are my ultimate test for a place, are delicious!So, even though I'm yet another Caucasian reviewing this place, I was accompanied by two very picky Taiwanese friends and they both have approved of this place! By the way, as for ordering dim sum, I particularly liked the BBQ pork buns, the sticky rice in lotus leaves, the tarot croquette and the meatballs.

Their do miu ended up being just the tops of the more mature plants - I draw this conclusion from the fact that there were no stems, and the leaves were much heartier (yet still tender) than the veggies I'm used to.Pass on their Shanghai xiao long bao. Whilst they're satisfying and have the right taste, -none- of the dumplings that came out in our steamer tray had the 'soup' part of 'soup dumplings' going on.

Having said that, the price was VERY reasonable; having had our full share of dimsums, each of us ended up paying only 14pounds.

I would recommend Joy King Lau for lunch rather than dinner as their dim sum is the highlight. Everyone has their favourite dim sum or yum cha dish, but I always order the chicken feet, prawn & chive dumpling, sui mai, prawn/bbq pork cheong fun, beef balls, beef rice noodle (dry or beef hor fun), turnip cake and a plate of stir fried vegetables (gai lan, dou miu, or choy sum). You can also book in advance if there is a big group of you, but just make sure that everyone arrives on time.

We are back from a trip to Asia missing it, and I am from asian background, but being served defrosted poor quality dim sum when you crave and dream about yummy original ones is really frustrating!! We ordered classic things, such as Har gao, Xiaolongpao, cheung fun... really bad sorry. Nothing tasted like original homemade. The cheung fun was made of three poorly defrosted old prawns stuck into an insipid dough sheet. It was not even cut into pieces, did not even have the onion, and the prawns inside were disgusting. The har gao strongly felt like a poor quality ready made from the freezer with weird dodgy mushy shrimp, and the appaling xiaolongpao was made of a disgusting dough, if I don't mention the inside! Please bring Din tai fung here! Aside those, we also had vegetable dumplings, with veg inside tasting almost like they were not good to eat anymore...I understand it can be difficult to manage offering such a huge choice of dim sum on the menu, so that not everything can be homemade and fresh, but I am shocked that none of the things we ordered seemed homemade. Especially coming to standard choices.On top of that, staff is really cold and not welcoming like it can be the case in some asian restaurants, but still if only they were serving good food!",-1,-1,-1

485,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"Wasn't sure whether to give this place 5 stars or not. After reading some of the other reviews some of the criticisms are justified so in recognition of that, perhaps 4 is more conservatively just - that said some of the criticisms are the very paragon of asinine ignorance (mainly those complaining about yum cha only being served until 4.30).Ive been eating at this place for almost 20 years (since i was around 15). So it's fair to say it has a special place in my heart. That said i wouldnt have kept coming back if the food was sh*te. Not that it's always mind-blowing, but it is consistently tasty, well prepared and of an authentic high standard. Also due to it's location in chinatown the prices are competitive. Over the years i have brought hundreds of friends here, all of whom have been converted to adopting it as their regular yum cha place in central.These days i mainly go here for yum cha (dim sum). I truly believe that along with Yi Ban (docklands) and Lotus (Canary Wharf) it is one of the best ""dim sum"" places in London - head and shoulders above the overpriced and often underwhelming and sometimes rubbish Royal China, or Phoenix Palace.By way of exemplifying the caliber of this joint - a close friend of mine, whose old man who owns a couple of chinese restaurants in Chinatown, eats here with his family.",1,1,1

488,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,3,"Finally came here for dim sum. It is one of those multi-floor monstrosities that Chinatowns are known for. Where the guy at the bottom (at primetime on a weekend) manages the queue via his cohorts upstairs on walkie talkies. From there, they send you to a floor and tell you a table number.You get to your designated floor, and flag down a waitress running around who then barks at you (in a way oh so familar and even sort of cherished part of Chinese customer service at places like this) to just wait. Who cares about the table number, they never asked for ours. We waiting another several minutes at our floor level (always feeling in the way between the staircase and the women's loo), then when a table finally left, were seated. I think you have to be a little bit assertive (like, stand visibly in the hall), or they might forget about you. There aren't any rolling carts or pieces of paper to write your dim sum order on... you just order like at a standard restaurant. The menus appear in both Chinese characters and an English 'translation', i.e. 'roast pork bun' or 'shrimp lasagne' and you just have to sort of guess to figure out what you want if you know it by romanized Chinese (i.e. Char Siu Bao). That said, the Char Siu Bao were good, as were the 'mixed croquettes', and the 'egg custard tarts'. Once we ordered, the service was prompt and really, really solid. Tons of food for two ended up around å£28.Oh, also, we were pretty sure they added on a service charge without telling us. Sneaky.

I can't really compare this to other dim sum places in London, for some reason this is the only place I've been too but from what others have told me it's really authentic ""chinese"" dim sum (I don't know that either since I've never been to China).I can't really be helpful to tell you what to order either as I don't know the names of most of the food I ate but the shrimp dumplings were divine and they have this kind of noodle ""lasagne"" that is out of this world.

Instead, the sauce added a nice counterbalance to the blandness of the noodles, while the pork flavor still came through. The prawn and pork dumplings and seafood dumplings were also nice, as were the minced pork and mushroom dumplings. The last of these looked really pretty repulsive sitting in the basket, with the mushroom sitting like a lump on top of a ball of pork, but the flavor more than compensated for the crazy appearance.My favorites, though, were the char siu bao and the veggie dumplings. The roasted pork flavor was not too overwhelmingly sweet (as can often happen), and there was the perfect amount of pork in the bun. The veggie dumplings were so subtle and so nice - I'm not even sure what every vegetable was in there because we wolfed them down so quickly. The service bordered on surly, but wasn't bad - the dishes came quickly, the tea pot was always full, and the check arrived right when we wanted it - so I can handle a little surly in exchange for this kind of dim sum!",1,1,1

We had to wait a long time for our order to get taken. Roast DuckIt came being almost cold. I asked the waiter kindly to heat it up, but it came back just as cold. It was very fatty and only little amounts of the meat were actually eatable. Tasted a bit old. Sweet Sour TofuWas very bland, nothing special.",-1,-1,-1

I got beancurd in blackbean sauce.  It was so average! I wanted to join in with all the good reviews :( I am so sad, I was looking forward to a good chinese, but I have tasted much much better. Maybe next time I will have to try the dim-sum and hopefully I can update my review =D",-1,-1,1

It's off the main drag of Gerrard Street and so must rely on quality to draw repeat custom rather than tourist drop-ins.As Tom E has mentioned, you can be passed between floors - they're lacking the customer manager with walkie talkie that some other multi-floor establishments have!As you're in a generic albeit high-quality Anglo-Canto establishment, you might as well give your friends the standard British experience of crispy aromatic duck, crispy chilli beef, beef in black bean sauce and chicken with cashew nuts with egg fried rice! If you fancy venturing a little more off the beaten track, the crispy oysters are lovely as are the lamb dishes.I hear good things about their lunchtime dim sum but yet  to sample it for myself.",1,1,1
511,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,4,"If you come at a busy time on a weekend night it can feel like one of Asterix's Twelve Tasks to get a table here. Not because it's difficult to get a table but because it's such a mind-boggling system.Do you have any tables?Ground Floor: ""Hmm, try upstairs""First Floor: ""Go upstairs""Second Floor: ""There are some downstairs""First floor: ""Try upstairs again""Ground Floor: ""Sure!""But it's worth the hilarity of going up and down the stairs to your own mind's Benny Hill music - because the food here is really top class for Chinatown and you can have a great time here with a big group on one of the large round tables. I'm a big fan of the starter here that comes with lettuce leaves for you to wrap the food in, but more than anything it's the MaPo Tofu here that makes me come back. It's simply the best in London.

If that doesn't say authentic I don't know what does.To top it off the bill came to 11 quid a head including a beer each, talk about icing on the cake, I only wish I lived in London so I could come here more often!",1,1,1

The chicken with nuts (whatever it's formal name) that my brother ordered was good, but I do not recommend the seafood lettuce wraps- tasted a bit like mush, and seafood mush is not a good thing. Way too expensive for what they offer.",-1,-1,-1

The place has a very interesting appearance on the inside, merging both Traditional Chinese ornaments and general setting with very modern yet simple furniture, giving it a very laid back feel about it. The service is terrific the waiters are all highly experienced, I know, because for the past twenty years I've seen the same waiters in different restaurants all over the West End. The food is Amazing, however it does help if you get to know the staff or you do know a little about Chinese food because they are not scared to make things that are not actually written in the menu. I was once told that this is the restaurant that the majority of the London Chinese community go to when dining , and many of the other restaurants in the City especially China town are filled with tourists or those who don't really know the cuisine too well. The food comes in reasonable time and the portions are generous, Joy King Lau is a perfect spot for group dining, with tables that can fit two families on. On many occasion have I been a part of a banquet here, where the entire floor is booked for our Tai Chi group, the waiters seem to double in their attentiveness.Finally something many people ask... the price range! Now despite being a fan of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant (two things which are most important to me in any resaurant) and the friendly staff. I also like the fact that two families of five can eat there for slightly over a hundred pounds, which comes to just over ten pounds per head which is not bad for a restaurant dubbed ""The place of choice for the London Chinese""     All in all I give it top marks Joy King Lau ? certainly As Good As It Gets",1,1,1

A large variety of dim sum and dessert choice in addition to the ala carte and set dinner menus.It is worth waiting even for over an hour on the Father's Day last month.One thing I dislike is that it is lack of customer attention but you have to pay a compulsory 10% service charge while many other restaurants in the China Town London the service charge is optional.",1,1,1
518,chinese,bUDiKk8_xgwsXnqRhFBBOQ,Joy King Lau,3,"Authentic chinese food in the heart of Chinatown. Very reassuring when we entered and there were more tables occupied by customers speaking Cantonese with the servers and ordering from Chinese language menus. Service was not what you could consider friendly, in fact they asked us within a few seconds of being seated what we wanted and when we asked for another minute seemed irritated. When the third server approached to ask if we wanted to order I just pointed to what the table next to us had and asked for that. We also ordered a chicken in a spicy chili sauce, steamed dumplings, and veggie soft noodles. I would get all but the noodles again. In fact, the best item we had was the pork dish that I had seen at the table next to us. I would recommend giving it a try but go in knowing that you may need to ignore the brusque almost rude nature of the servers.",-1,-1,-1

We came on Tuesday afternoon and were seated immediately. We ordered xiao long bao, prawn dumplings and half an aromatic duck.The xiao long bao was mildly disappointing. The soup was thick and slightly bland. The pork was as expected. One order came with 8 dumplings for å£8.The prawn dumplings were mediocre, nothing exceptional yet still very satisfying. One order also came with 8 dumplings for å£8.Surprisingly, the duck was the best part of the meal. It was crunchy and extremely flavorful. I'd compare it to carnitas in texture. Accompanied with thin pancakes, cucumbers, green onions and brown sauce, it was just an amazing amalgamation of flavors.The service was great, very quick and friendly. Price point was also great, I can't complain about 8 dumplings for å£8. But considering we went here to try some of the best dumplings in London, I can't say my expectations were met. For better and cheaper dumplings, I'd recommend going to one of the smaller dim sum shops right down the street.",-1,1,1
522,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,2,"It was getting late in Chinatown and we were craving dumplings. We saw that this place was full of people so we decided to give it a try.Food: We ordered the Spicy Pork Siu Loung Bao, steamed prawn dumplings and Shanghai-Style Fried Noodles. The spicy pork Siu Loung Bao was nothing more than chili sauce and it was way too watery. The steamed prawn was the best of the three but the skin was thicker than I would have liked. The shanghai-style fried noodles was over sauced.Service: Outside the door said ""10% off the bill of you pay with cash Monday-Thursday."" We asked the waitress about it and got an eye roll. We paid for meal in cash and got multiple one pound change. We then went to get dessert at a near by place and tried to use to the change we received. We found out that the change was older currency and they would not accept it. So, we did get the 10% only to be SCAMMED a few pounds. Terrible service is one thing, but you can tell they aren't very trustworthy people by the way they acted. Price: Overpriced subpar chinese food that you pay for sitting in a nicer restaurant. This place didn't impress us and we don't appreciate them giving us old currency. I don't recommend this place at all. Don't be fooled that this place always looks full. There are plenty of other food options nearby.",-1,-1,-1

I should have just gone without. I ordered the shrimp toast, the crispy duck and one order each of their 4 varieties of XLB. The shrimp toast was ok. The duck was so over cooked and dry that I sent it back. But the real sin was the XLB - about 1/3 we're broken when they brought them. The rest were literally touching each other so you couldn't remove one without breaking the one next to it. Out of 32 Bao I found 6 with soup in them. If you don't know XLB the whole stinking point is that there is soup in them!In a neighborhood with close to 100 Chinese restaurants, you can safely skip this one.",-1,-1,-1

Probably helps being in the center of London's Chinatown. We ordered several dishes- XLB's, peking duck w/ pancake and bbq pork over rice. They were all fantastic, wish I could say the same about the bill but 40% of the cost is for picking a place in the center of London lol.(This is a late review from November 2017 btw)",1,1,1

527,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,4,"Let me preface this review by saying that Xiao Long Bao is my LIFE so I have extremely high standards for it. I'm not entirely sure about the standards of XLB in London so I'm definitely surprised to hear that Dumplings' Legend offers some of the best in London after my meal.I haven't tried other XLB to compare but I'm sure this city must have more amazing XLB to show! Overall - 4 stars because the XLB were great, don't get me wrong, but they weren't out of this world and this city definitely deserves better!~ Atmosphere:Incredibly hectic. The place was packed FULL, overall not too pleasant of an atmosphere to eat in.~ Customer Service:I've had a different experience to other reviewers - the customer service here is great. Very attentive and quick with their service. The food came out at the speed of light.~ Food:We ordered both pork and pork and crab XLB - both of them were really great and juicy, but the broth inside was just OK. I much preferred the pork and crab to the pork-only because the crab added an extra dimension of flavour that took their XLB to the next level. Overall, I liked their Xiao Long Bao but if you're a self-proclaimed XLB connoisseur like me you should keep searching.Downsides: Ordered their custard buns, it wasn't custard but salted duck yolk (which I like, but definitely not custard so I don't know why they advertised it as such). Also, they don't offer Chinese hot oil at all unfortunately, only soy sauce and vinegar. Not too great if you're into hot oil like I am.---I like Dumplings Legend. I would say that they're more of a 3.5 stars, but I'm happy to bump it up to a 4 because I don't think it's quite there to justify a 3. The food was great and I'd definitely come back here again, but the search for the best XLB in London continues on.",1,1,1

531,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,2,"This place was not that good, and it kind of grossed me out.The bathroom is dirty, and while this places stresses soup dumplings, they were some of the lower quality soup dumplings i have had. In fact, most of them were stuck to the paper on the bottom so it was impossible to actually get any of the soup from the soup dumpling. The bottom would rip, the soup would come out, and we'd be left with just some filling and ripped dumpling dough.On the flipside, the staff was friendly.The hot and sour soup was okay, a bit too sweet.If you're in a pinch, don't feel like waiting, and want some Chinese food, this place will do the trick, but I can't really recommend it beyond that.",-1,-1,-1

The crispy aromatic duck wasn't crisp at all. The meat was dry and the skin was greasy and mushy. The shrimp toast was tasty but for the rest no. I'd venture over to the Golden Phoenix for good crispy duck. Still haven't found a soup dumpling in London as good as I have in Boston but will update if I do.",-1,-1,-1

Everything was good, though nothing wowed me. Interesting take on the prawn dumplings, as they had veggies inside which I had never seen before. On the plus side, the portions were generous for all the dishes.Service was good and prompt. Note that you get a discount if you pay in cash. Ambience was generally clean and spacious.

When I sat down, a gentleman at the table next to me (and you know how those tables are inches apart!) kept complaining to his friend about how their dim sum hadn't arrive. They were American (I am American). A French mother and daughter two tables away from us as well as this table of American men repeatedly flagged down the waiters for waiting a long time for food.  I thought they was just unfamiliar in the ways of Chinese service, nope!Our food began arriving because I ordered all over the menu. However, it became apparent that the complaints of my fellow patrons were true. First off, the runners couldn't even tell us what they were dropping off and argued that a dish on the table was tripe. Tripe is my religion. My boyfriend knows tripe--he's basically a butcher. That wasn't even the same color or texture as tripe. I returned from the bathroom and my boyfriend tells me the two guys next to us left and it was a huge drama because they refused to pay for any of their food or drinks because they waiting over an hour and their dim sum never came. Around this point, the mother and daughter received theirs, they waited more than an hour and unfortunately only ordered one type of dim sum.2 hours into our experience, 4 dishes hadn't arrived. But! This new server came out of nowhere. He was so lively and friendly compared to the woman who took our drink order and actively avoided everyone in the dining room despite being the only server on our floor. I asked him if the plate in front of me (we tried to eat it but it was so dry and cold), was tripe. He laughed and said no! And very quickly and efficiently took that and our missing food items off the bill. THEY STILL HADN'T EVEN MADE THEM--otherwise we would've boxed them. He saved our entire experience. He even said not to worry about the service charge. No man, you deserve all the service charges. That second star is just for him.

While waiting you can already check out the small dumpling-kitchen where thousands of dumplings must be made daily.The menu is a bit confusing and not completely consistent with the DIY order list but if you don't know what or how to order just ask the staff. If you want something special and you know the name but you cannot find it on the menu just ask and probable they will just bring it. It would actually help if you know a bit  what you want or otherwise just try to be seated next to some (Chinese) locals and copy ;-)I was graving for dumplings so only had a nice variety of the fresh dumplings but I will definitely come back soon to try the dumpling soups and the steamed filled buns which looked amazing at our neighbours tables.",1,1,1

We were three people and they sat us in a table for five, which was fine for us. A little after we ordered the food and received our drinks they asked us to move tables, but to a table that could barely fit two people. In our previous table they sat a group of six kids, and from their look I can assure they were not happy, it was obviously too small. The dumplings were OK, I have had better dumplings there in the past so I was not very impressed. Location wise, the place is great, right in the middle of Chinatown and only a few blocks from Leicester Square station.",-1,-1,-1

We were shown to a table near the window and given a menu and a dim sum check sheet, there were some specials on the table too.The dumplings were well presented and tasty and the soup dumplings were filled with broth, but there is a definite technique to eat them or you will lose your soup! I recommend scooping them out with a spoon then attacking them with chopsticks, unless you are really good with chopsticks - which I am not.  We also ordered one of the specials prawn toast, this has to be the best prawn toast I've ever had! It had full prawns with tails layerd on top of toast with sesame seeds.  If you see this one on the menu definitely ordering.Looking forward to completing my Dim Sum list, but this is definitely a place to go.",1,1,1
553,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,4,"I had the pork dumplings, steamed ribs and chicken feet for dimsum. They were all REALLY good. Filling was flavorful and wrap texture was perfect. The other items were also well done. But the item I LOVED was the spicy beef soup!!! Meat was tender and there was lots of it. Noodles were chewy and cooked perfectly and the broth was so tasty and spicy and full of fresh herbs!  I'd go back just for the soup!",1,1,1
554,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,4,"For me, Dumplings' Legend has to be one of the better dim sums in Chinatown. As per usual, don't expect incredible service, but the food here is really good, their Xiao Long Baos are probably some of the best in London and if you pay by cash on most days at lunch etc, you get 15% discount (which effectively knocks off the service charge). The XLB's are tasty, fresh (you see them rolling them out in the window), packed with flavour and you get a fair few in one order. The crayfish ones are really good, but you can't go wrong with their classic pork. Just remember, all in one bite! Don't try and do it in halves because then you'll get precious bao juice all over yourself you messy pup! Service is fast, efficient though not particularly happy or friendly. But really, what did you expect? But probably most importantly, is they present you with a genuine receipt. Like, fully itemised, and not just a couple of wiggles on their classic order paper. You'll never get ripped off again! Yay!",1,-1,-1
555,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,3,"This restaurant does not necessarily scream Chinese with its decor like a lot of other ones in the area do, but fans of dim sum and dumplings will have a decent variety of fillings to choose from. We tried several of them (too hungry to take photos at that point) and they were all quite good. I particularly liked the prawn dumplings. If you, like myself, like to eat a lot, I would suggest getting a couple of the mains to share with your group as well.The only drawbacks were that they did forget to bring one of the dishes and we eventually canceled it and also that the music was on repeat (there's only so many times I can listen to Let it Go in one sitting). I do not think it is a place I will choose to go again myself but if friends want to go I am not going to mind terribly.",-1,1,-1
556,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,5,"This is my favourite place to eat in China Town!! I have no idea what all these less than stellar reviews are going on about. I have been here several times and have always been super impressed with the food. The food is beyond excellent. This place is famous for their dim sum and dumplings, which are very good. I usually get the crystal prawn, and their broth infused dumplings in the spicy pork. Beware though! When eating the broth infused ones you have to gobble it down in one bite otherwise you will get it all over yourself! I also like to get the crispy duck and pancakes, and I'll admit that this dish isn't the best you'll find in Chinatown but its still lovely. The chinese broccoli is also a top dish for me, as well as the pumpkin and prawn dish which is totally different from anything you would find at other places.The venue is so clean its virtually spotless. Everything is white and clean and the glass partition where the dim sum makers work is wiped down several times a day and is always looking great. This is such a nice change from the other places in Chinatown, which seem a bit moldy with old sticky carpet floors. This place is also huge and I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to be seated.The service could be better, but its not any worse than the other places in Chinatown which aren't exactly known for their exceptional service. You do have to hail down your waitor, and be very clear when you order otherwise you will get the wrong thing. But all in all this is totally worth it as the dim sum, dumplings, and everything else there is incredible.Tip: Order the fresh squeezed apple juice, they literally squash an entire apple into the cup and it comes out all foamy and fresh.",1,1,1

Then you see Dumplings' Lengend. Never actually noticed this place before in the day, its stark white exterior and interior with white table cloth dining is out of the ordinary in colourful chinatown. Midnight dumplings it is! They had a (very well dressed) bouncer at the door, which was kind of funny. Service was good, there were surprising quite a few people there for late night dumplings. The food was great (yes, I was sober) ordered the crispy spicy squid, mixed dumplings and the prawn dumplings. All tasty. Would def come again.",1,1,1
559,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,3,"Kind of mixed on this place. One of the less externally scary looking places in London's small Chinatown for those of you that may not appreciate hole-in-the-wall ethnic foodie dining experiences. Inside it is clean, modern, bright and even a little hip with some artsy images on the wall and music playing with a vibrant beat. The staff speak passable English (and while this is really not a great sign for an authentic Chinese dining experience, it is, after all, located in the heart of London so it is necessary), the menu has a fair amount of interesting dishes including a list of about 120 dim sum items and noodle soups. I had prawn and chive dumplings and a clay pot rice with minced pork and salted fish. The food is tasty but a bit more expensive than some of the other dim sum places in the area and the real reason I am not as enthusiastic about this place as I should be is that they did not have steamed tripe on their dim sum list. I love that dish and use it as a baseline to measure dim sum joints around the world. It is a very basic, readily available ""famine food"" (offal made delicious so poor people would eat it during tough times) dim sum dish and this is he only dim sum spot I have ever been to where it is not available. If they start offering tripe, this place goes to 4 stars.",-1,-1,1

So when we arrived in London again, this was our first choice for dim sum. Unhappily the results were not good. To begin, the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. Staff helpful. Waited 15 minutes for a table. Each group is seated individually. Not family style. We ordered only dim sum. Started with wanton soup. Broth tasted like dishwater, no flavor. Colored water. Wantons large but not cooked enough.  All the other dishes were under cooked. The barbecue pork buns were over flavored with hoisin sauce and undercooked. The Chang-fen with prawn , again undercooked. The Cantonese shrimp dumplings. Same issue. Fell apart trying to serve. Minced pork and crab soup-Mai tasted like shrimp instead and pork undercooked and grizzly. Perhaps in their haste to get food to many customers, did not bother to finish cookingOther customers who did not order dim sum looked like they were having a better experience. Would not return for dim sum.",-1,-1,-1

After handing over our order the server said we had to order more food if we wanted to eat there, so we checked off a few more items. Then the mgr came over and said that we didn't order enough. So again I explained to her we just wanted dim sum, hence the sign outside said they served dim sum. Yet there was no sign that said we had to order a certain ""amount"" to dine there. Mgr was very rude about the situation and said we had to order food from the main menu on top of the dim sum menu.. so instead of causing a scene I told her to her face out loud that this was unexceptionable and I've never been anywhere in the world where I was treated this way. Yes I get that she wanted to make more money from us dining there. Shame on you I said as we walked out.",-1,-1,-1

The staff were all pretty friendly here, but seemed not to want to accept that there was a cockroach crawling on the wall behind my friend.

563,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,3,"Totally fine.  By London standards; this is my fave dim sum to date.  By dim sum Alex S has consumed over her lifetime standards; this is just fine.Dumplings' Legend is best known for its soup dumplings, of which they have several varieties.  Go for the standard pork which - despite a too-thick skin - is still delicious and, well, ""porky"".  It bugs that we don't get our own containers of vinegar to douse each dumpling ourselves (just a tiny little ginger-and-vinegar dish given to each diner ordering dumplings) but, well...they bore through my requests for more with a smile, so points there.I know it's unfair to compare and yet, well...I do.  Compared to San Francisco, New York, Toronto: all far superior dumpling cultures, and Dumplings' Legend falls flat in that ranking.  And for the price, these are not cheap dumplings.  And they're not stellar.  So...womp.  Craving for soup dumplings fulfilled, yes, but with a little side of ""ugh"".  I mean, sure, I'll likely be back, but I'm totally on board with Leighton S who summarized so well: (paraphrasing) dumplings tasty, service friendly, not a bad option, no rush to return.  Yelp note: really lovely clean and multi-stall bathrooms which, well, deserve a special call-out.

Went there alone once,  took a friend who's very picky about xlb there twice, and everyone was happy with it. They have many options for xlb, including a very special one -- spicy xiao long bao. This is the first time I tried something like this and I am a fan!  The stuffing is soupy and flavorful, I could eat 2 orders (16 xlbs that is) all by myself.5 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus tube station, and not too far away from Covent Garden. They also open till late almost everyday, great for late night cravings after musical/opera/shopping. As for other dishes, I didn't even bother to try. I know they have a big menu, but when a place is named ""Dumplings' Legend"" and has a window that shows live dumpling making, you simply stick with the dumplings.",1,1,1

Dumpling Legend had an advertisement where if you ordered more than 25å£, you can select a small dish for an additional few pounds. Our selected dish was the spicy salted prawns. The XLB is no where near what you can get at Joe's Shanghai in New York, but we were not expecting that. They were about average. Not the best nor the worst.  The assorted meat and vegetables had a good variety of chicken, prawns, and scallops. The beef and rice noodles were comparable to the US and the table next to us ordered the same dish based on staring at ours! The spicy salted prawns wee nicely salted and a great deal(about 8-10 prawns) for only 2å£ more! The price here was a bit high at 35å£, but after being exhausted from a long day of sightseeing, it was ok.",-1,-1,1

Perhaps to call their dumplings legendary is stretching it a bit but they were definitely the best part of our meal. The xiao loong bao had thin skin encasing the soup, which was flavoursomeSadly, this was the highlight of our meal. The Peking duck promised much as it was carved tableside in the traditional way. The skin was served with pancakes, cucumber, spring onion and hoisin sauce. The meat was fried up but there was only a tiny amount to share between usThe main dishes were forgettable but the real kick came when the bill arrived. å£45 for Peking duck and the extortionate amount we were charged for rice means this tourist trap only scores 2 stars",-1,-1,-1

Be prepared to get your order mixed up, reorder, ask where your food is several times.

It's hands down the cleanest bathroom in a chinese restaurant, especially of that price point, that I have ever visited.The prawn dumplings are great. The soup dumplings (xiao long bao) are ok. Not the best I have ever had but they are still pretty satisfying. All of the pork pastries are perfect hangover cures.  The cheung fun is moreish. Etc etc. The chilli sauce is also good. This is important. The only thing I had ordered so far that has been 'challenging' was the duck balls found under 'dumplings'. For the adventurist eater only ( I was a fan).  I really don't think you can go wrong though. They have all sorts of lunch special '2-4-1's with dumpling dishes and drinks.

In fact, they're actually quite soupy and the flavour is also very good. As for the rest of the dishes...let's put it this way: they should stick with making dumplings!What is really off-putting as well is the amount of tourists that come into this place...it just feels like a factory more than a true local place. The whiteness of the clientele is then only exasperated by the awful white interior. In fact, I was here with two Asian architects, who simply could not help but complain about the awful design!So, let me recap: do go here for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao)...and maybe also have a couple of appetizers, but I cannot really recommend any main dishes...",-1,-1,-1

I know, you might be thinking why bother with them, but if you're with a veggie that wants to see what the fuss is about, this won't really demonstrate anything other than a mild disappointment.

I was actually really surprised on the small selection of dumplings on the menu.  I thought naming a restaurant ""Dumplings Legends"" you'd have more variety.Other stuff - Spicy pork belly and spicy chicken something.  Both were good but forgettable dishes. Beef tenderloin - I've never had anything like this but I wasn't thrilled at all.  Seafood ho fun - probably one of the better dishes.

Dumplings are better from my local shops on Clement Street in San Francisco.In short, go across the street to Golden Dragon. This place isn't worth the trip unless the food is free.",-1,-1,-1
587,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,2,"Just no. (That's a short review in itself but read on if you are curious.)PRO - I really don't know. I think we came in this establishment because we were starving and saw a lot of people sitting by the windows (READ: they purposely seat as much people as possible by the windows to make it seem like they are busy, smart and cunning!). CONS - RUDE service! I asked a waitress what the other table was having and she pointed to an item on the menu and I ordered it (it was an entirely different item by the way). When it came, I told another waitress that was not what we ordered, she kinda just shrugged it off and walked away (we were later charged for the wrongful recommendation). We asked another waitress (third different waitress now if you are keeping track) for extra sauce and she gave us attitude (come on woman, it is just sauce!). Prices were average (as compared to the other dim sum joints around Chinatown that we should have went to instead). The Xiao Long Bao (what they were apparently were known for) was also average. They had a spicy Xiao Long Bao version -- BAD. They basically shoved a spoonful of hot Szechuan peppers (including the numbing spice) with their usual filling and it tasted just spicy with no depth of flavor! CONCLUSION - The scallop rice rolls and quail egg shu mai were decent (but I'm sure I will find better ones in the other dim sum restaurants) but the snotty service will keep me from coming back. Oh, the bathrooms don't have soap so think of all the employees handling your food - RED FLAG!",-1,-1,-1
588,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,1,"I'm a bit torn on my review for this place.  The soup dumplings (xiao long bao, or XLB) were decent.  Just remember that you have to have light fingers and a spoon in hand when handling the XLB without breaking it! And break the dumpling skin just a bit, so you can slurp out the soup - otherwise you will probably sear the skin off the roof of your mouth.  No, I'm serious. Anyway, their XLB - sure, decent, delicious, soupy and not dry.  But anything else on the menu?  Just don't bother.  Its way overpriced for what you get, and I don't think there were any dinner dishes that were decent.  The service was quite shoddy as well.  I don't know how many times we had to flag someone down, only to be ignored.. but when we were able to get our orders in, we had to repeatedly remind them that we were still waiting on something.  This is my first time having Peking Duck in London, and it was å£45.  I nearly had a heart attack.  I'm not sure if this is the standard, but seriously... ?????  I couldn't.. i just couldn't wrap my head around that.  It better have been some fantastic duck, but it wasn't. There should have been some fresh hand made roti-style pancake to wrap the duck.  Instead, we were given WON TON wrappers.  Again. WTF?????  They are trying to pull one over you if they are giving you wonton wrappers.  I know others didn't see it as being a big deal.  Its like ordering an expensive burger, to be given some meat sandwiched in between 2 slices of white bread.  Or given cheese whiz instead of real cheese.  Yes, its a big deal.I get that essentially its supposed to be 2 dishes - the second is a lettuce duck wrap.  Which was so small, that there were only enough for 5-6 people.  Complete rip off. We also ordered a bucket of rice, should have been the equivelent of around 6'ish packed bowls of rice.  We had to ask 3 times, then it finally came at the END of dinner, in a large sized soup bowl.  We ended up being charged å£26 for that. 26 !!!!!!!!  around 2.50 per person, and we had 11 people.  But I know for a fact, there's no way there were 11 bowls of rice in that bowl.  Total kick in the face.  I'd rather go elsewhere for food, and for XLB for that matter.",-1,-1,-1

The turnip dumplings were definitely the best I ever had, and the beef hofun really hit the spot. Two friends had the set menu, which looked ok but with rather small portions. However, we weren't given the time of day for at least 20 minutes after we were seated. I tried to catch the eyes of various waiters - smiling, glancing, waving - on a number of occasions; what finally did it was all of us standing up and preparing to leave (which brought over the manager right quick but unapologetic).

Dude has been holding out on me. I'm not gonna say these are the most authentic and delicious soup dumplings in London, because I have nothing to compare them to. But I can tell you that I wrestled down 11 of them on my own, no problem. I can tell you that they are full of a fresh ginger/lemongrass/pork flavor that makes them an absolute delight to eat.

But honestly, the xiao long bao is just as good (if not better) in Los Angeles, where the cost is 1/2 of that. We ordered 6 orders of XLB, 1 eggplant dish, 1 rice dish, and our total came out to $104!!!! In LA, the same order would cost less than $60.  Each order of XLB averaged 6.60 - 8.5 eur. CRAZY. This place is posh and modern, and you can watch a billion chinese dumpling chefs wrap dumplings while you're eagerly waiting, but it's hard for me to give them a superb review bc LA is so much cheaper. It is what it is.One thing I didn't like was the staff. We told them that we had a party of 4, thinking that a baby doesn't count. When we finally got called to our table, we asked them for a high chair. ""Oh, 3 adults and 1 baby?"" ""No, 4 adults and 1 baby."" The skinny bartender got involved (don't ask me why....) and yelled angrily, ""is it 4 or 5? 4 is different from 5 and 5 is different from 4! Which one is it?!""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! He wanted to pick a fight over numbers?! This is a common mistake. So what if we said 4 and now we have 5? That's just more business for them! If the 5th was a real addition, I'd tell them to go eat at a competitor's.  The hostess (NOT THE BARTENDER) should have just asked for clarification, not yell at the customer and [figuratively] spit in our faces. People like that bartender give Chinese people a bad name. They should fire him, not only for charging an arm and a leg for cheap alcohol, but for his rudeness and lack of bedside manners.

The interior is sleek and modern, very neutrally white but feeling a bit soulless. We of course ordered a basket of 8 xiao long baos, and were not disappointed - they were good, although nothing extremely special. Having dined at Leong's Legends round the corner, I think the xiao long bao there are better - with a richer filling and thinner dumpling skin. We also ordered beef noodles and pork chop noodles to go with the dumplings, and were really disappointed with them. When the noodles came they looked pathetic - a big bowl of tasteless broth, with some noodles and limp stalks of vegetables swimming inside. The pork chops were average (again, Leong's Legend was better). The beef soup came in a separate bowl to be poured over the noodles - the bowl was way too hot to lift to pour, so we had to resort to using the spoon to slowly transfer the soup and beef over. Overall, a very disappointing experience, and we shall definitely not be going back again. The noodles gets a 1 star from us - the xiao long bao a 3 star rating - averaging out to two stars. Reviewed by The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",-1,-1,1

Given this is 9 pm, I gave they a pass since it still tasted OK. Then the horror begins. Hot and sour soup looked like a bowl of thickened dark vinegar. The string bean with minced pork was way too oily and salty. The only decent dish is the tofu with minced pork.In addition to the bad food, the service was just horrible.

You can almost be sure, you're not getting much in terms of quality / freshness in Chinatown. Here was one place that proved it totally wrong.

Xiao Long Bao are large steamed dumplings - a bit like classic dim-sum  with the robust and earthy flavours of salted pork, turnip and spring onions. There were many Chinese diners there, often young, but also prosperous and (I imagine) either students or workers in Chinese enterprises setting up in London. That's the sort of place Dumplings' Legend is  at once homely, but also aspirational in style  an expression of where China is at now.We ate there in the evening so used the evening menu, but I gather there is also a good dim-sum menu earlier in the day.Food & ServiceWe were pleasantly dealt with and seated after a few minutes (the restaurant was v. busy). Unfortunately we were seated right next to the washing up station for small porcelain bowls and spoons  the noise! That small negative aside, the food more than redeemed our faith on choosing Dumplings' Legend.We started with cucumber in chilli and Sichuan style WonTon  both delicious beyond belief and a masterclass in blending various types of soy sauce, sugar and oils to create super flavoursome relishes. We moved on to Venison in Ginger Wine, Malaysian style Chicken Curry, Salt and Pepper Tofu (stuffed with minced prawn), and Choi Sum with garlic  with one bowl of rice between us. All the dishes were delicious and a world away from the brightly coloured sticky pastes that seem to pass for 'Chinese' food in indifferent places across the land. This food absolutely sang with flavours.We washed the lot down with Orange Juice and Mineral Water.We didn't try the Xiao Long Bao, we will next time though :-)FacilitiesI can see what's being reached for here  a kind of modern Chinese aesthetic; clean, modern and confident. And by and large that is what the facilities are, but there is a sense of things starting to look worn (stair carpet) and cluttered (all those notices haphazardly stuck to the walls at the waiters' ordering terminals). What's needed is a Mary Portas style ruthless makeover  keeping the best of what is there and improving what isn't so good. Toilets are upstairs so not disabled friendly, and access to the restaurant is up three steps too (no ramp).PriceWe paid approx å£32 each  not expensive, not cheap  but a fair price for what we had. We didn't feel we had been taken advantage of.OverallI like this place. I will go back to try the Xiao Long Bao and soups!",-1,1,1

636,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,2,"I've recently read a good review about this place and since I've walked past it so many times I decided to give it a go. I went with two friends for dinner a couple of days ago and I was left more than slightly disappointed. Given that the place was named after dumplings, I was eager to order some to show my friends what traditional Chinese dumplings were like. To my disappointment, they didn't have dumplings on the menu, instead they had Xiao Long Baos, which are stuffed Shanghai buns. Was it that difficult to get the name right? Dumplings are dumplings and buns are buns, they are different things. Dumplings originated from Beijing whilst Xiao Long Baos are from Shanghai, they made in completely different ways. It's like calling a haggis a Cumberland sausage this has already got me started on the wrong note. I scanned down the menu and was left confused because most of the dishes were Cantonese, but there were some Malay curries and some Szechuan cold starters. I really didn't know what to order, so I suggested we order something my friends haven't tried before. So we ordered vegetarian Xiao Long Baos, drunken chicken, Malay chicken curry and a vegetable dish. To be fair, the vegetarian Xiao Long Baos were nice  they were well made, nicely seasoned and had tasty filling. But rest of the dishes were just bog standard China town. I had hoped with the opening of places like Bar Shu and Empress of Szechuan (though both Szechuan style food) signalled the arrival of more authentic Chinese food but Legend just felt like a step backwards. (sigh.) To finish the meal off, when the bill came it was headed Golden Harvest  seriously could you get anymore careless I at least expected the name on the bill to say 'Dumplings Legend' not the old Chinese restaurant that was once here and had shut down two years ago! My friends were left unimpressed too and had set me a challenge for a better suggestion next time  sorry!",-1,-1,-1
637,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,4,"For pictures, see Greedy Diva @http://greedydiva.blogspot.com/2010/11/dumplings-legend-chinatown.html  Sometimes you just need to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon eating dim sum. Last week, I wrote about Leong's Legends, a decent Taiwanese restaurant in Chinatown which recently opened a dim sum offshoot, Dumplings' Legend, just around the corner on Gerrard Street. Reading comments on my post about LL's excellent Siu Loung Bao (or Xiao Long Bao) brought on cravings. It was time to investigate the newbie's offerings. On the site of the former Golden Harvest, the downstairs room is large and airy with white walls and minimalistic touches. It's fresher looking than some of its neighbours - quite like an Asian St John's in terms of decor. We were lucky to be seated at the front, where the whole wall is a window and the sunshine flitted in over our lunch as we watched the characters of Chinatown amble by. Upstairs is more poky, but does the job. We arrived about 2pm - prime time it seems. The dining room was packed and a small queue was growing rapidly. However, 3 dumpling makers were at work behind a glass panel at the entrance, rolling, folding and stuffing delicate dumpling wrappers. It's mesmerising to watch while you wait - although I do wonder how long it takes before RSI sets in. ""Whatever"", you say. To the food, the food... Our knobbly cheung-fun arrive first - three generous, slinky, slug-like noodles stuffed with ample slices of sea bass and picked vegetables. A fair price at å£3.30. The next table orders the spicy stir fried cheung-fun which looks good and appears to be a popular choice around the room. Steamed sticky rice in a bamboo tube is delicious but so thick it borders on congealed - a decent set of biceps is required to scoop it out (å£4.50). Barbecued pork buns are excellent - fluffy and filled with big, juicy splashes of sweet, red barbecued meat (3 for å£2.50). Crystal prawn dumplings are small, pretty things, sweet and plump - but nothing which stands out above the norm here (å£2.50). Chicken wrapped in banana leaf with Chinese is a highlight - deliciously moist, with satisfying chunks of chicken and Chinese sausage (å£2.20). Finally, out come the pork Siu Loung Bao, for which Leong's Legends are renowed (å£6.00). At Dumplings' Legend, they're also fantastic - the little smurf's hut shaped wrapper is quite delicate and so you have to be careful not to pierce it, spilling broth onto the table. It snuggles a parcel of meat within as well as a warm soupy broth which explodes into your mouth on first bite. These should be an essential part of your dim sum order here. The accompanying soy sauce contains thick slithers of shredded ginger - a lovely touch. We finish with a serve of 3 tiny egg tarts (å£2.20) - these are TPG's thing more than mine. They're nothing special, but I quite like the fact they don't taste overly eggy, Service is efficient and friendlier than you might experience at some Chinatown restaurants. We paid around å£15 per head including tea and service, although we could have done with 1 less dish and 1 less pot of tea (at å£2.20 each) had we not been feeling so greedy. Both Leong's Legends and Dumplings' Legend highlight their ""highly recommended"" dishes with 2 stars on the menu. Interestingly, ""Legends specialties"" are distinguished with 1 star. I'm not sure what the distinction means. Dumplings' Legend is good, and it's already popular. I think it may become my cheap and cheerful dim sum restaurant of choice when those Sunday afternoon cravings set in.",1,1,1
638,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,2,Dumplings were okay but service poor. I returned the cold rice and the waitress use some excuse that heating more will make it yellow. come on you are talking to another Chinese. No one really wanted to deal with it and kinda looked not bothered. The place might look nice but definitely staff need to be better training.,-1,-1,-1
639,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,3,"This place opened in Aug, 2010 and is owned by Leong of Leong's Legends, so the food is going to be very similar.  The Xiaolongbao (shanghai dumplings) are good and so is the beef noodle soup.  Don't expect much from the ambiance, but the service is really good.  For better ambiance and better overall experience Leong's Legends around the corner is better.",-1,1,1

On to the next one. But their soup dumplings were good.  Gotta give it to them.  Din Tai Fung in LA is my all time favorite place in the states but I must say, I think these might top them.  But still, not coming back. The service alone did the trick to turn my appetite off.",-1,-1,-1
642,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,4,Amazing dim sum and noodles! That is all I had but I enjoyed every bite and it was def a good surprise because I normally am not so happy after a meal in Chinatown! Must go if you want to go for Chinese esp dumplings!,1,1,1
643,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,3,"for a place that has Dumplings in the name, one would expect a menu full of just that: dumplings. and yet.there was far less then i hoped for. the food was pretty good, although several of the dishes tasted pretty similar, and there were not nearly enough sauces (in my world, everythign is a vehicle for sauce), the service was lack luster, but all in all it did hit the spot.a bit more expensive then i would have warrented, but whatever.",-1,-1,-1
644,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,5,"Having read through other reviews I'm really surprised at the level of disappointment of people who have eaten here! I have been here several times in the past couple months for lunch and each time the food has been great  having said that we only normally order from the dim sum menu which is served before 5pm.As it seems that most are disappointed in the evening menu I would suggest instead of giving this restaurant a complete miss to just come here for lunch instead and as a group of 4+ so you can order lots of different dishes to share and get a taste of lots of dim sum. Definitely try the soup dumplings and the turnip cake  it's awesome!",1,-1,1
645,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,5,"Currently writing this review from the restaurnt. We came in here 4 days ago for the first time at about 11pm. Service was slightly absent, especially for a chinese reataurant but the quality of the food more than made up for it. These could be the best xiao long bao i have ever tried (definately better than shanghai) comaparble to hong kong quality. The other food was good too. Highly recommended. We drove over 60 miles for this treat.",1,1,1
646,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,2,"There are so many choices on the main street in Chinatown, that if a restaurant is slightly not up to the rest of the bunch's standards, it is very noticeable. Dumpling Legend is one of the restaurants looking pricey/pretentious on the outside, and when you take a closer look at the menu you'd perhaps gulp and think about how your wallet would suffer if you were to have a filling meal. With all the other competition around, it is difficult to stand out from the crowd. Dumpling Legend has achieved this by a modern, high class looking exterior and eye-popping prices of food. Chinese food is not cheap when it's in a serviced restaurant. Especially Chinese food in Chinatown which is most authentic compared to your local Chinese takeaway. Yet I do not see the reason of visiting Dumpling Legend when you can walk opposite and go in any other Chinese restaurants (which to be fair, look much more authentic). I feel that Dumpling Legend would like to market itself as top end Chinese (fusion) restaurant. But any person who eats out in Chinatown often can tell you that the more 'ghetto' places are perhaps more tasty with reasonable prices. If it is a special occasion that you are celebrating, DL could be a good choice, with a sophisticated decor and everything, and perhaps a less authentic menu (more like fusion). But otherwise I would urge to try out some other Chinese restaurants in that area.",-1,-1,1
647,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,4,"Love this place - so many kinds of Xiao Lao Bao! It's definitely on the fairly pricey side for this kind of food. I haven't had anything here other than dumplings, but I have been to Leong's Legend (which has the same owners) and the food is good there. The place can be quite busy on weekends - so be prepared to wait.",1,1,1
648,chinese,4vFipSchGkH-ZcqDWSZh3A,Dumplings‰Ûª Legend,3,"For photos and more:http://hungryinlondon.com/2011/02/dumpling-legend-chinatown/  In celebration of the Chinese New Year I met Mr. Noodles and some other friends at Dumpling Legend in Chinatown. This evening turned out to be not only a feast of some delicious and some not so great food, but was also hugely educational as I learned a lot from Mr. Noodles about Chinese culture, food and restaurants. Dumpling Legend which is located in the heart of Chinatown has opened some time last year and specialises, as the name promises, in dumplings. To experience the extensive dim sum menu, you have to come before 5 pm (dim sum are traditionally eaten for breakfast and lunch). I refer you to this mouth-watering review by Greedy Diva for more information about eating dim sum at Dumpling Legend. The restaurant is extremely brightly lit. This is good for taking pictures but not that flattering for teint and wrinkles (not that I have any of course!), so I would not necessarily recommend it for the first or second date to be honest. The menu depicts a happy Chinese dumpling with a little crown. Without wanting to be mean, if I had a restaurant I would not entrust my marketing campaign to the people who created this cheerful ball reminiscent of an onion As Mr. Noodles and I are both working hard in our non-blogging related day jobs to be able to afford eating out all the time, we only managed to meet up in the evening and therefore had to choose from the evening menu with a limited dim sum selection. Mr. Noodles pointed out that Dumpling Legend does not appear to specialise in a speficic Chinese cuisine, as the dishes on the menu stemmed from Canton, Sichuan, Malaysia and Taiwan. Mr. Noodles chose the dishes. He ordered a very interesting mix of starters and mains, however, we got them served all at the same time. I didn't like this at all. Firstly, you expect dishes to be served one after the other when they are stated as 'starter' and 'main' in the menu (otherwise why bother doing this?) and secondly, we really had to rush to eat everything while it was still hot/warm. The meal therefore started with a huge minus for Dumpling Legend In summary, the dishes were a rather mixed bag of delicious, OK and not very good. The supposed starters: I rather enjoyed the Cucumber in Chilli Oil (å£4) which is a typical Sichuan dish. The fresh and cold cucumber and the hotness of the sauce provided an interesting contrast. The Sweet Potato Fried with Salted Egg Yolk (å£4.50) did not taste very Chinese in my opinion and was strangely addictive. Somehow reminded me of the zucca fritta at Zucca. Very successful were the Sichuan-style Spicy Won-ton (å£4.50). The delicious savoury filling was wrapped into light won ton skin and came with plenty of mouth-tingling chili sauce. We did fight a little over those A real Chinese specialty are the Pork Crab Meat Siu Loung Bao (å£6.50). When I ate Siu Long Baos for the first time at Leong's Legend I burnt my mouth terribly as this type of dim sum contains not only solid fillings but also hot soup. The version at Dumpling Legends did not look very pretty but tasted heavenly. Mr. Noodles taught me how to eat them and I want to share this knowledge with you to save you from injury. You grab one of the dumplings with your chopsticks and bite into it holding it over one of the big Chinese spoons. Then you can enjoy the dumpling and afterward savour the soup collected in the spoon. A real disappointment were the Steamed Prawn Dumplings (å£6). Again they did not look very appealing but in this case this also applied to the taste. The skin was too thick and the filling tasteless. Stay away from these! The dishes we had wanted as mains:I have never eaten Taiwanese Three-cup Chicken (with soy sauce, sesame oil & rice wine) (å£9.50) so I did not have much comparison but for Mr Noodles this was the most disappointing part of the meal. According to him, this dish, if done well, is extraordinarily delicious. This one clearly wasn't. The chicken was kind of slimy, the sauce tasted only of soy sauce and I could not pick up any sesame oil. Overall this dish lacked any redeeming qualities. You wouldn't think that something as delicious as the Seabass Fillet Steamed with Soy Sauce (å£17.50) can come from the same kitchen as the unsuccessful 3 Cup Chicken: Wonderfully tender sea bass with Chinese spring onions and ginger in a light and tasty soy broth was my favourite dish of the evening. I had a similarly delectable Chinese sea bass at Goldfish City close to Bank. The other two mains clearly did not rock my boat. The Stir-fried Choi-sum with Garlic (å£7.80) was not too bad but did not leave any lasting impression. Celebrating the Chinese New Year you have to eat noodles as noodles represent longevity. Also when you go out with Mr Noodles you have to eat noodles, but I think you would have guessed that much :) . The Fried Wide Rice Noodles with Beef (å£7.50) were boring and insipid. I mixed them with the chili sauce coming with",-1,-1,1

I swell up and get a bad headache if I consume too much msg.  I swelled up and had a bad headache right after eating here. Just coincidence?  I think this place should only be visited by people who are not sensitive to msg, salt, and taste...",-1,-1,-1
