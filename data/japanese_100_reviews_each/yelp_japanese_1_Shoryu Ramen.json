This was despite asking various servers multiple times to place an order and always being deferred. The place was almost full but not really busy so the poor service was pretty inexcusable.\nAfter eating (tasty food), our bill had major issues twice (once it was just unrelated; the second time it had a number of extra items). Finally, a manager had to help correct the bill. We had to ask twice for the service charge to be removed.",

Itadakimaaaas!\nI peeked over the door noren and I see this place is packed already. I guess I wasn't the only one mad in the brain to eat hot ramen on a hot day. Anyhoo.. I held up 4 fingers and the hostess seemed to know I meant .. table for 4.  So she led me to the tiniest of tables, crammed next to 2 of the tiniest of tables, and with a quick Hai Dozo.. I was left there.  But,... but.... I cannot possible traverse the tiny space between the tables to get my seat on the inside.  I mean.. people were already eating , and their bowls of ramen was perched on their tables, and I would most def, either knock their table over... or even worst.. go past the tables sideways and put my butt right over their table.. So I gave the hostess a helpless look.. ehh...sumimasen... but she looks away.  Fine.. be like that.. so I proceed to wedge myself between table and takes seat.. So uncool. Tho my wife rolled her eyes at me.  \nI needed ramen, I needed something to restore my center.  The walking and sightseeing and meal decisions while visiting London has been exhausting.  I needed ramen to get back to basic.  We got us, Dracula Ramen, Regular Tonkotsu, I think there was Spicy Miso too.  tldr;- None was spectacular. It wasn't bad.  But it lacked an identity.  The noodles was text book, the broth standard, the chashu pedestrian, the toppings bleh.  In a sea of ramen.. Shoryu ramen did not stand out one bit.  \nService was so-so.  I don't expect it at a Ramen-ya anyway.  So I was fine with bare minimum.  \nI don't know if there is better Ramen in London.  This isn't bad, but I would search harder the next time for something better.",

Stumbled upon this place since we couldn't find the place we were looking for but, we love finding new gems.  Food was really good, broth was very tasty.  The calpico mojito was very refreshing since it was blistering hot in London.  The chicken karage bun was good but I loved the tonkotsu ramen.  I would have had another bowl of just the broth.

                "description": "After a cold day walking around London, the idea of a hot bowl of noodles sounded great. There was a bit of a line to get in so that was a good sign. Turns out this is a chain. To some, that's off putting or inauthentic. But when done in a respectful way - and tasty way, who cares? When you finally get called for saying they hit a drum and yell something that's supposed to be in Japanese. Cute and sets the Japanese motif. \nI like that you are able to request noodle doneness for the ramen. In general, I found the ramen (we tried two different ones) to be a little bland but otherwise really good. It had the nice soft boiled egg (but with a slightly reddish yolk). The BBQ pork bao was pretty delicious with a substantial piece of meat. The Soho platter was a pretty posh sampler of food including sashimi, tempura, and Kara age chicken for two. They even had a near-frozen Asahi beer that really hit the spot against the fatty broth of the ramen. We skipped the cocktails but they looked really delicious.\nWe skipped dessert but overall, it was a pretty good meal and surprisingly inexpensive vs. expectations. Would definitely recommend this place for ramen cravings!",

                "description": "It was our last night in London....and knowing that we had a long night ahead of reluctantly packing to head back in Atlanta....Hubby and I opted to stop by here for a simple warm dinner, and romantic walk under the Christmas lights on Regent street. \nShoryu came highly recommended by friends and yelpers. It was a cold night so a warm bowl of ramen seemed like a perfect option. We hopped in a uber and arrived with no reservations made prior. Luckily, it was not too busy despite being a Friday night. We were able to find cozy two seats at the front right corner so we could people watch (very fun on a Friday night). \nI love the detail of purse hooks under the table. \nThey offer specials such as seasonal set menu, Bun Monday, and Happy Sake hour. \nShoryu Ramen started in Nov. 2012 and recommend in the Michelin Guide since 2014 (you still see the sticker at the entrance). They specialize in Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (aka, rich-thick- white pork broth with straight ramen noodles). Ricky and I both ordered the same Shoryu tonkatsu ramen ....and the broth was amazing! You can tell it has been cooking for many hours with great quality ingredients. And do not forget about the noodles made from fresh Shoryu flour! Fresh, bouncy, and chewy. You can request different textures to your liking. The ramen comes with the traditional toppings of a soft boiled egg, pork, and veggies,and nori. All the toppings were excellent as well.....but I am a BIG soup and noodles person so those are the items that grabbed by attention the most. \nThe gyoza is supposed to be really good here but unfortunately no one told me -_-. I didn't find this out till after I left the restaurant. The uber driver asked me if I got the dumplings on the ride back to the hotel. We got the takoyaki instead which was so-so. \nAnother popular item is the HIrata Bun. Hubby got the wagyu beef filled bun. They names it the Shoryu bun to bring prosperity to you when you eat it :) Very cute. \nThis location also has quiet an extensive alcohol selection. Def check this out. There was a reason everyone inside was drinking lol. \nHighly recommend. Great place for ramen.",

Then when we were ready to pay, there was a staff member talking to another staff member on her break at the table next to us. Completely ignored us although we tried getting her attention. Finally got the attention of our waitress (the only one serving the whole place), to ask a question about a discount we had. She gave us an explanation then walked away for another several minutes when we had to flag her down for the bill. Again, staff seated to our left acted oblivious. I don't know how they run a business here.\nFood: Very tasty, full of flavour and good portion size. I enjoyed my Dracula tonkatsu ramen. It was hearty and delicious. \nVerdict: I would return to another place gladly, given this poor service doesn't extend to all their locations. Clearly they have good food, they just need to work on hiring good people.",

They were still tasty but I would probably pass on them on any subsequent visit.\nThe ramen was quite good and you have the choice of how you would like your noodles prepared.

The Dracula Tonkotsu is filled with tasty garlic bits and flavour but may require an after-meal mint. \n3.5 stars overall.",

We stopped by shoryu, which was decently busy on a weekday late afternoon. We were asked to wait outside for a few minutes as they were cleaning the tables. \nI got the dracula tonkotsu and my fiance ordered the tonkotsu with the more intense/ thicker broth. We both enjoyed our meal - you can order the noodles cooked to your preferred doneness (standard, firm, etc.) and the egg that came with the noodles was cooked perfectly. My soup base was a little too garlicky for my tastes, but that was my fault since the description clearly detailed that it was for garlic lovers. My fiance said this was probably one of the better ramen places he's eaten at (and we've been to plenty in Chicago and NY)\nThe meal was a little pricey for what it was, but we were in the heart of London so I expect part of it was due to location so can't really complain there.",

I am delighted by these scallops that have a firm texture and full-flavor (being used to farm-raised ones).  The Ramen is not spicy and you can add chili oil and grind fresh sesame seed to taste.\nMy companions have the pork version that they love.

The noodles here are the thinner kind, not the chewy thick ones (I prefer the thicker noodles). The bowl was kind of small. Normally, when I eat ramen, I get a bigger bowl with more soup. \nThe soup was good, but nothing mind-blowing, especially when they advertised their soup to be 12 hour soup.\nThe service was quick and efficient. I really liked how if you asked for tap water, they gave you a whole bottle, even though I was only 1 person.  \nOverall, the ramen was good.

                "description": "Went to London on holiday came here, and now I'm depressed that I'm back home in Cardiff instead of being able to eat here every day.\nHonestly - if I lived in London and could afford to do so, I would eat here EVERY DAY. NO. JOKE. I'm STILL thinking about those perfectly seasoned eggs. No wonder they're on the Michelin recommended list two years in a row!\n~ Atmosphere:\nCute atmosphere - nothing fancy. The wall has a great description of the parts of ramen, if you're new to this amazing dish you can read up on it! Even though I'm a ramen fanatic, I still learners a bit about the ramen styles of different regions in Japan.\n~ Customer Service:\nReally lovely. The waitress who served us was very sweet and friendly, and our food came out at a decent time (not alarmingly quick like they do in Japan, but still at a relatively decent time). They also provide fresh garlic you can crush right into your ramen if you're a garlic fanatic like me.\n~ Food:\nThis where the 5 stars comes from. Everything else could be literally GARBAGE and I would still give this place 5 stars. We ordered Pork Belly Buns to start off with and they were fantastic. I'll be honest - I've had better baos elsewhere so next time I come I'll probably skip on the baos and go straight to the ramen just to get a better taste value for money.\nI ordered the Dracula Ramen (garlic tonkotsu ramen) and it was out of this world. You can order extra toppings so I opted for an extra seasoned egg. After I finished my first plate of eggs I wish I had no shame and order an extra plate. You're also allowed to ask for extra noodles or meat - all at a price of course but I'm definitely glad they had that option available.\nChoose the firmness of your noodles and you're ready to go - the result? The most AMAZING ramen. The depth of flavour of my ramen was immense and you can definitely bet that I slurped up all the remaining broth after I was done. If you're a ramen snob and here to compare Shoryu to the other ramen powerhouses of the world, I would say that the broth is what sets this place apart. The char siu was forgettable, but the broth and eggs were UNFORGETTABLE. I'll be thinking about this ramen for years to come.\n---\nDo yourself a favour and get to Shoryu Ramen. Probably the best in London.",

They announce each groups arrival with a beat of a mini Taiko drum.  \nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen made with a 12 hour Pork Bone stock.  The bowl of Ramen was served with Nitamago - soft boiled egg well executed, Kikurage - wood eared fungus adding a good crunch, Nori - seaweed - adding crunch and umami flavor, generous amount of fried Shallots, a bit of spring Onions, a dollop of red ginger with a sprinkling of Sesame Seeds.\nThe Pork Bone Broth had the requisite umami flavor, without being too salty.  The Ramen Noodle were excellent- the Noodles were al dente and the Noodles captured the flavor of the broth well.\nThe best part of the bowl was the BBQ Pork, thin sliced, delicious Perhaps a more generous portion would make the experience more enjoyable\nBottom line - This is a Ramen I could eat several times a week.  It was delicious, not overly salty, has a sophisticated home made quality to it.",

                "description": "Nice ramen joint in London. They offer the typical tonkatsu as well as some interesting varieties like seafood kimchi, white vegetarian and curry. I went for the double tonkatsu broth and had a side of the black sesame tofu as a starter. The tofu was inter sting and a very instagrammable dish but not a must order. Tasted like a black sesame jello as it needed a little more sauce/wetness to it. The ramen itself was very solid. Large portion and tons of noodles. Noodles are hard and perhaps the best I've ever had. The fact that you can pick your thickness is awesome to me and really gives each ramen dish it's own rather than churned out in a factory. Chasu was thick but I wouldn't necessarily call it pork belly as mine had virtually no fat. Broth was thick and meaty, but lacked spice. Even with the piri piri side sauce I was still hoping for more. The ramen did not disappoint and it's no surprise they've expanded throughout the city. Biggest complaint was that they charged for still water when all I want d was tap. An upsell like that hurts and seems very seedy. But food wise, one of the better ramens I've had.",

The Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu is fantastic here (the broth, the noodles, and the charsiu all taste great). Sprinkle on some sesame seeds and garlic, and your bowl will taste even better! Service here has also been consistently good, even when the restaurant is busy. \nMy only minor complaint is that their ramen eggs aren't as good as what I've had elsewhere (strangely they seem less flavourful?), but still not bad. Certainly not a big enough complaint to detract from the rest of the dish.\nI really don't have much else to say that the other 200+ reviews here haven't already said. Shoryu is probably my favourite ramen shop in London, and I will definitely return!",

This takes the great ramen we have had and bumps it into gourmet. Even what seemed like a boring choice, the origin tonkatsu, was surprisingly amazing, full of flavor. My 8 & 10 yo kids left nothing behind. (And they know their ramen.) I had the tan tan ramen as I always order at ramen houses and the egg is organic as evidence by the super orange yolk. The broth had depth and complexity. They use bones and you can tell. \nWe were here on Monday so we got the 2for1 bun deal. The prawn buns were the real deal prawn size! The buns were large too, big enough to hold the prawns. The only complaint is that the buns took a long time to come out.",

I had the most popular tonkotsu ramen  with supposedly extra rich broth. However, I had to add a little more chili oil and soy sauce than I would have liked in order to make it more flavorful. It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't the best and I'm not sure that I'd return. On the positive side, the guy who brought us our water was really nice and friendly :)",

We were hungry for Asian cuisine, the Shoryu Ramen was one of the few which close to us. Since we both like Ramen, so we decided to head to this one. The restaurant was quite close to Piccadilly Circus and located right on the main street, so quite easy for us to find it. Inside the place was also really nice, It gave me a really nice feeling, the place is clean and modern but also got a Japanese culture in it. Although the restaurant wasn't big, we just like it here. \nWhen we were here, it was quite busy. It is always a good sign for a good restaurant. And luckily they were still managed a table for two for us, that was nice. After we sat down, we got a look of the menu, wow, lots of nice food in there, I would like to order. Well, I just wanted to try out the Ramen here first. And I forgot that outside of Germany, it is quite common that restaurant will gave free water on the table. We ordered extra drinks, well, got more options anyway. \nI really like the Ramen here, it tasted really good. But again still something was missing compared those I had tried back in Asia, I couldn't really tell what. But again it tasted still really great. I got the idea why this place was well-known here. The price was alright, quite reasonable. I did remember that will recommend to give tips 18%, that was quite a bit much, I think. There was also WIFI in the restaurant, quite convenient for people who need it.",

                "description": "One of the better ramen places I've been to in the world, I stumbled upon it accidentally while returning some keys to a friend - proof that there's a silver lining in everything.\nThe first thing you should know is that this place gets very busy, so you might need to wait a bit. The second thing is that the waiters are going to explain the entire menu to you if you say you've never been there before, down to every last detail. It's kind of patronizing.\nI love spicy ramen and will almost always pick it over the others. Their menu lists a traditional tonkatsu, but then it also lists a Kotteri Hakata Tonkatsu ramen that has a richer and thicker sauce. There was an unnecessary amount of confusion when I asked if the spicy Piri Piri Tonkatsu was made with the traditional tonkatsu, or the Kotteri - the waitress explained to me what tonkatsu was three times in a row. So I just ordered it.\nIf you like spicy ramen, the Piri Piri is the way to go. The broth was smooth and silky and had just enough heat to make your forehead sweat a little, but not enough to burn your tastebuds into oblivion. The noodles were perfect, smooth and not overdone. I didn't like that they added raw jalapeno and ginger though. The ginger kind of threw off the rest of the flavor and I avoided the jalapeno because I didn't want my mouth to catch on fire.\nIf you're in London and have a ramen craving then this is your place. Just be prepared to wait and/or be spoken to as if you were a child.",

There wasn't a wait when I went but since the place is small - I wouldn't be surprised if there was one. \nThe pork belly buns were just ok - they put way too much mayo in the buns which took away from the pork belly itself. I'd suggest omitting the mayo all together.\nThe cucumber dish was alright - just a small cucumber with some sesame oil and hot flakes on top - super bland. It would have been so much better with a little vinegar.\nThe ramen itself was good - decent portions - toppings were limited and expensive for extras. The noodles were cooked well as was the poached egg. Soup was flavorful and came with good slices of pork. \nService was nice and friendly. There is free wifi which is always a plus!\nDecent place to get your ramen fix - prices are ok for the city - about Â£40 for a meal for 2",

We started off with a chicken bun each first -- they were great. A thick pancake with cucumber and hoisin sauce with a nice big piece of fried chicken in it. Next we both had a ramen dish, I had the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu -- which was a nice filling dish. We also had the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu, which was similar to my dish but spicy -- it was really good. If you like spicy food I'd chose this dish over the other one. A nice meal out, about Â£12 for a bowl of ramen. Not to bad of prices, seen though it's right down the street from Piccadilly Circus. Easy walk to and from the tube.",

Behold: Shoryu. The verdict? Better than Momofuku Noodle Bar, but just shy of Ippudo.\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\nOne thing I will say regarding the atmosphere is that Shoryu does an excellent job of walking the fine line between authentic and fusion. Many of the staff are clearly japanese, but the atmosphere is such that you'll be comfortable even if you're a local or a non-Japanese tourist. Seating is both varied and abundant, so you'll be good whether you're a larger party of just an individual like I was. While the ramen can take a bit of time to come out, know that's because it's made to order, and in the meantime you can dig into a pork bun, which you absolutely should. Star Granted. \nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\nPrices here at Shoryu are comparable to what you'll find elsewhere, with everything inflated just a bit to adjust for currency. Ramen? Twelve pounds. A pork bun? Just shy of a fiver. Considering that these portions are sizable, these are fair prices across the board. Star Granted. \nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\nI went with a mix of traditional and contemporary here at Shoryu, and the result was a classic pork bun and a more modern 'Peri Peri' spicy ramen. I ended up with a bit of a mixed bag, with top notch ramen and a pork bun that was good but not what I would call elite. \nFirst? The pork bun. Good? Again, yes, this was a good pork bun, but I was a bit surprised at the simplicity of the auxiliary ingredients. The lettuce was standard iceberg, and while the pork was good, the entire thing was drowned in a chipotle mayo of some source that cleaned out a lot of the flavor. Good, but not the best I've had (that's you Ippudo). \nNow, the ramen I will say was easily top tier. I have a pretty exceptionally high tolerance for spicy food, so when I was warned that the peri peri ramen was spicy I more or less brushed it off. Wow. A word to the wise? This is some spicy ramen, and when it came down to drinking the broth I had to stop shy of finishing off the whole thing on account of my throat burning with jalapeno seeds. Having said that, the chicken and seaweed and egg and noodles were phenomenal, and this was pretty close to being on par with the best ramen I've had over at Ippudo.  Excellent.

It didn't have a particular \"kick\" to it. It was too bland. The vegan option was interesting because the broth was made of soy. I got the original. It was good but it wasn't something that stood out to me. The meat, tho, blew me away.

They say they are recommended by Michelin in different years but I don't seem to find them on the Michelin website. I tried the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. I'm so disappointed. The soup is not think, the meat is bland, the egg is bland. They say they marinate the pork and egg for a long time but they don't taste like that. The takoyaki is different from the ordinary ones as they are deep fried. So it's crispy outside. It's Â£6.9 for 5 pieces but in each one, there's only a tiny piece of octopus. The rest is just dough. It doesn't worth the price. It doesn't worth the wait.",

We found out how odd that was after we went to washroom and found the entire back of the house empty. Oh well. \nThe food was delicious, hearty and warming to the belly. I got the spicy ramen and it was a little spicier than I anticipated but yummy nonetheless. The only thing I'd say I don't like is that the portions are smaller than any other ramen restaurant I've been to and the prices are a tiny bit higher, so the value isn't quite there. Usually, I have difficulty finishing my portion but I probably could've eaten a few more bites after I was done this time. Maybe don't come if you're starving but it's a good small meal if you're not terribly famished.",

This place is amazing if you want to try the original ramen and feel the taste of the rich broth they made. \nI've ordered the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu and was amazing! from the broth to the pork and the noodles were just perfect. You can also choose how you want the noodles to be cooked (from standard to soft to hard). Portion was big enough, staff is nice and friendly, place is not too loud so you can enjoy a chat before and after. This place is also located in a nice spot: not far from Piccadilly circus but not in the heart oh Soho = no queue! That made our Thursday dinner perfect!\nIf I want to be super picky  (as I am,unfortunately) the only cons is: only one toilet for the entire restaurant!You will see people queuing  in front of it which is not great as it is close to the tables so if you are not lucky enough to be close to the bathroom you could end up with people behind you queuing for the loo. \nApart from that, great experience and great food!Will definitely come back soon.",

Proceeded to rush into the bathroom with mud butt diarrhea and then vomit. \nAside from the bout of foodborne illness I'm currently experiencing, the food was less than mediocre at best. This was my first time here and I ordered the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. The tonkotsu broth is nothing to write home about (incredibly bland for boasting that it takes 12 hours to cook), the chashu was flavorless, and the noodles were... well, comparatively similar to everything else that's supposedly good about their ramen. When the ramen was brought out, the broth and egg were cold but the noodles were hot. At the end, I couldn't bring myself to finish the bowl and that's rare as I normally devour ramen instantly.\nOverall, 10/10 would AVOID this place like the bubonic plague.",

                "description": "I've been coming to Shoryu for years so this recent visit was extremely disappointing because I am familiar with their usual level of service and quality of food. \nWhen I was seated I sat there for maybe ten minutes before I had to ask someone for a menu, while other parties were sat after me and given menus right away. These same parties were also given the opportunity to order before I was. I made eye contact with several waiters, signaling that I was ready to order and they ignored me, continuing to chat to each other behind the counter. It wasn't until another ten minutes that I was given the opportunity to order. \nI ordered my usual prawn tempura shoryu bun and a piri piri tonkotsu. When the shoryu bun comes out, there is usually a wrapped wet wipe so that you can clean your hands before you pick up the bun but they didn't give me anything and I had difficulty getting anyone's attention again so I just gave up and ate the bun which tasted great, as usual. When my tonkotsu came out, the nitamago was really overdone to where there was no runny yolk quality, and about 90% of the yolk was a crumbling yellow rather than a silky orange. When I asked for another egg, the waitress asked what was wrong with it and I told her it was overdone and how it's supposed to be soft boiled (I had to explain to her what a proper nitamago looks like while I'm sitting in front of a chalkboard with the definitions of the different elements that make up a ramen, one of which is a definition of a nitamago). She came back with another egg that was still over cooked but better than the my initial egg claiming \"this is the best we've got\".  Other than the egg, the ramen was delicious. \nFinally, when I asked for my check they brought me the bill right away and I sat with my credit card in my hand for maybe 15 minutes before I had to again ask if I could pay. A new waitress came and asked if I wanted to pay by card, and I asked her if the 12.5% service charge could be taken off because out of all the years I've been here I've never experienced such awful service. She just sulked away and came back with an adjusted bill, not once making an attempt to ask why I felt that way or inquire as to what they could do to improve. She merely processed my transaction in complete silence and then walked away. \nI would also like to add that I was not the only one experiencing poor customer service. There was a six-top of Australian diners behind me who asked for water from at least three different waiters and also said they were ready to order, to which the waitress who processed my bill replied in a really harsh and rude tone \"it's coming! I've already asked!\" And another waiter turned up and told them \"you're just going to have to wait!\"\nI usually go to the carnaby branch so maybe it's my mistake for going to a different location but I've been to this location in the past too. I don't think I will return to this branch but look forward to going to another branch soon",

The place on Carnaby St was small, but cozy and pretty lively on a Sunday night. I was seated at the booth and started to chat up with the bartenders. It was my first time, so they explained that they specialize in tonkotsu ramen and went through the pretty large menu with a lot of different ramen options and side dishes. I decided on the Kimchi Seafood tonkotsu because I love spice. I was also able to customize the texture of my ramen (standard, hard, super hard) which I thought was interesting as I have never had that option given to me before. I also got gyoza (because obviously you should get that with every ramen dish) as well as a steamed pork belly bun to start. Also, if you like lychee, definitely try the pink lychee jasmine tea, you won't regret it! \nThe steamed bun came on the mini wooden steamer which I thought was super cute and the pork belly was super flavourful and the bun was also very soft and delicious. The gyoza I absolutely loved!! The crispy layer on the dumping as well as the filling were SO good and not overly salty. I definitely wish I ordered more. The ramen itself was definitely good, but I found the broth to be standard and definitely not as spicy as I wished it to be. It was very mild. I loved that they were very generous on the seafood and I had a lot of it in my ramen. Great sized portion and reasonably priced! \nWhile it wasn't busy, I found the service to be a little slow. Overall, I was pretty happy with the place and I probably would return if I could!",

We each had noodles and two of us ordered an extra half boiled egg each. You can have the noodles al dente, standard or soft.

Being relatively new to Ramen I was excited to try another place and another type.\nWe arrived and had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Be warned: You do have to wait outside for tables so maybe not the best option if freezing or raining but we were happy to wait as it was a mild night and it smelt so god damn good!\nWe were seated on a long bench by the wall, at first we were a bit disappointed not to have a proper table but in the end we quite enjoyed it.\nWe ordered the gyoza and pork and prawn buns to share. Then I ordered the curry ramen in the others section.\nThe sides came first which I was glad about being staring. The gyoza was freshly cooked and mouth-wateringly good. The pieces of meat inside were chunky and they just went down a treat!\nNow, to the buns, it was the first time I'd ever had a 'bun' and I absolutely LOVED them. Whatever that weird type foldy bread is, it's amazing and the toppings were superb. I particularly liked the belly pork! NOW.\nNext, the ramen. Gosh it was good - garlic, curried soupy goodness with bites sized pieces of friend chicken breast, veg, seaweed and egg floating within. Just perfection. The curry had an almost katsu taste to it which I enjoyed and with the extra clove of garlic, I was in a ramen dream. It was slightly salty but I am a fan of salt so no complaints here! \nService was fantastic and the overall ambience of the restaurant is relaxed and warming. We left full, satisfied and saying we'd definitely be back again.\nHappy Saturday!",

Ramen could have been out of preserved or dried packages, Kimchi was not especially tasty (probably made more palatable for unsophisticated western's taste) and the shrimps on the seafood's Tonkotsu seemed straight out of the refrigerator, they were cold inside the warm soup which was an unpleasant contrast.\nI finished ordering a Macha ice cream which didn't certainly taste artisanal.\nIf you want to get real Japanese ramen in Europe I'll suggest trying in DÃ¼sseldorf.",

I finally got a menu and realised there wasn't much veggie choice (which I guess is to be expected, so that's not a biggie) but I opted for a pancake which sounded intriguing. \nWell, we waited 40 mins for food, and only after enquiring were brought an undercooked and frankly bizarrely chewy dish, minus the advertised salad. I would normally have sent something like this back, but by this point we were in a rush and there seemed to be no point, so I just graciously ate, then tried and failed to pay using Apple Pay. I think this is just not for me, and won't return,,,",

The pork belly bun had a great flavor profile that was different from most that I have had. It had a sweet, smoky, and light spice to it.\nMy ramen was quite good except for the pickled ginger. I was not a fan. I ordered my ramen standard, but will opt for the firmer option for chewy purposes.\nIf you are in the mood for ramen then you can't go wrong here.",

As soon as you walk in you get this awesome sense of surrounding. The space is beautifully decorated. Very chic. We sat by the front to get a view of the street and the life outside. Our started was some pot stickers. They came out still sizzling. Very crispy and full. Great way to start. For my main I got the Origin Tonkostu. And wow. Ike nothing I ever tasted. And it was huge! There was no way I could finish it.....but I tried! By the time we left, our bellies were full and swishing. Extremely satisfied with our meals.

Their selection of dishes on their menu is wide, so you will find something you like. If you are not familiar with Japanese food, they also have a glossary on their menu in case you have trouble with finding out what you want and need a closer explanation. \nWe ordered a Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu, their signature dish with extra meat, and also some fried gyoza. We finished our ramen and also our beer, and waited long for the gyoza. So we had to ask, and it seems they had forgotten about this order. They apologized and made the food right away when we pointed that out, so it was not the end of the world. But normally the gyoza should have come before the ramen as gyoza is considered more as an appertizer. \nSo in short this a good place to eat Ramen with good service, but it is not the best Ramen place around this area as they have a lot of competition here.",

The meat was somewhat flavoursome, but a bit dry and sat awkwardly inside the bun, trying to escape as I bit into it. I don't know, presentation wasn't great and I felt there was little value for money. \nI had the traditional ramen with two lovely half eggs and bits of pork that were ok, but not mind blowingly good as the ones I had in Tokyo. The broth was substantial and nicely flavoured, but I must be honest and said I've had better here in London. The price is honest for what you get, though, and I've heard you can get a second portion of noodles free if you still have lots of broth left. For drinks I've ordered a frozen kirin but it came mildy warm and without the foam cap it was supposed to have. I was disappointed to say the least.\nOverall the food ain't bad, it's just not awesome enough to make me queue or even go for another visit. And I believe you could have better elsewhere.",

And also gluten free sides including chicken karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and steamed buns! \nI didn't go full GF as I got the Shoryu ganso tonkotsu but with rice noodles instead of egg noodles. For full GF you have the choice of two soy milk and white miso ramen. My ramen was so deeeelicious and the egg was just perfect. Really good pork too. All in all amazing. \nMy husband had the Dracula ramen...woah, he stunk so bad afterwards and we were going to the theatre, hahaha! And yep, it was even worse the morning after. Prepare yourself for the most garlicy dish ever. It was delicious though. \nWe also had the traditional Japanese chicken wings on ice for starter, just because it sounded cool. The wings were nice though I'm not sure why they are served on ice...\nMy husband also got the winter sake flight, 3 types of sake (35ml each I think) for Â£6.50 with an explanation of what each one was. A great idea to educate people about sake!\nThere were so many other interesting things here, the sides, the drinks. What a great meal! Will definitely be coming back...is tomorrow too soon?!",

I ordered their classic Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu and it was just delicious. Aghh buttery and rich and flavorful....aghh im salivating thinking of it all over again. It was about 11 GBP (around $16 USD) for a bowl which is a little more expensive then the $12 bowls I am used to in DC (I guess both are kind of expensive for a bowl of soup when you think about it), then again this is London and everything is expensive here.

(Â£7.5)\nThe fried chichen Ramen, is a large portion with several big pieces of Fried chicken (bland) that lost their crispness because of the broth.\nThe broth is flavourful but nothing compared to Ippudo.\nThe 1 star is for the location.\nThe minus 4 stars are basically more for the lack of service i got from the staff.  They are not motivated and not welcoming. I really was about to leave cause i felt i disturbed them. They were several empty seats/table but they offered the one very mext to the main door (bear in mind it is freezing outside and the clients are entering and flgoing out from this door)\nWhen i insisted to get the seat inside that i knew was free they told me no. I was abot to give up but eventually they gave me that seat after mumbling about me.\nThat is how my experience started at shoryu and believe me l, i was still expecting the food to be good despite the attitude of some staff.\nIt is very expensive for nothing and no need to say that i won't recommend it.",

I'm not complaining about its spiciness, but its size...\ngyoza. ehh.\nUS$33.75 for eating alone and leaving a little hungry... no thanks",
