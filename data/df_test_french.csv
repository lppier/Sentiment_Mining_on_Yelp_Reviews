french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The hype is real! This place is so worth it. The ambiance, drinks, and food = incredible. Famous bathroom and millennial pink interior. I can't wait to go back!
Simon and Valentin were wonderful hosts. They made incredible recommendations and Valentin's drinks are THE BEST.
Literally want to move to London. This was our final meal before flying Home and we are both so smitten. 
Highly, highly recommend!!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"11/5 dining experience. Hands down. 
Sketch was worth every single penny. During my recent trip to London, me and my girls knew that we had to have high tea. It was almost my birthday and my friend had recently just gotten a promotion, so we were in the mood to spend $$ and celebrate. Enter Sketch. 
Sketch has 5 different dining rooms, each with their own ""special"" experience and theme. Room 1: The Glade - Enchanted forest themed, specializing in lunch and cocktails. Room 2: The Gallery - Brasserie/All Pink Everything, specializing in afternoon high tea and dinner. Room 3: The Parlour, specializing in all day dining + live music and cocktails, Room 4: The Lecture Room - a Michelin star restaurant, specializing in lunch and dinner menus. Room 5: The East Bar/Pods/Bathrooms - a small modern space themed bar, also the bathrooms. 
We dined in Room 2: The Gallery for high tea. Immediately upon walking in you're taken aback by the beautiful pink decor and cute watercolour art on the walls. There are servers walking around in different uniforms, each with their own specific duty - ""caviar man"", ""tea expert"", and ""champagne lady"" to name a few. 
Our tea lady/main server came by and explained the menu to us. She asked if we wanted to upgrade our teas to a champagne tasting, and at that point, we said ""sure, why not?"". And so we upgraded. 
For teas, they had a large selection of delicious teas from around the globe. Along with the champage, we each got our own pot of tea. I sampled two different ones: a Sri Lankan Earl Grey and an Indian Chai. To be honest, I can't pick between the two. Both were the best teas I've ever tried. No joke. Added a little bit of milk and sugar to them and was truly blown away. And to think this was just the teas. 
On to my favourite part: the food. First, we had an appetizer: sea salt and butter breadsticks with caviar and quail eggs. I have never had caviar before, but I have to say, I was impressed. I see why people eat this stuff all the time. Paired with the creamy quail egg and breadsticks, I was in foodie heaven. Second, the mains: unlimited finger sandwiches, cakes, and treats. I can't even remember everything that was there, but I do know that I love everything that I tried. My two favourites: the curried chicken sandwich and the salmon and cream cheese roll. I had to get more of these because I loved them so much. I have much more of a savoury palette than sweet, so I preferred all the sandwiches to the cakes. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the cakes. The blueberry cake was my favourite! At this point we were so full and we had completely forgotten that we had a third course: scones and more cakes. We all opted for the plain scones, paired with butter and your choice of strawberry or plum jam. I'm not the biggest fan of jam, so I just stuck to the good ol' butter. I wish I had more room for this because it was SO good. 
One of my favourite parts about this experience? The bathrooms. You go through a pair of doors and up the stairs. When you look up the ceiling is covered in neon-coloured square lights. The bathrooms itself... are eggs pods. With each egg pod being one bathroom stall. Truly one of the best (and fanciest) peeing experiences I've had to date. 
All in all, I loved every single minute of dining at Sketch. Everything from the attention to detail to the beautiful decor, to the delicious food and presentation to the classical band playing classic tunes, everything was absolutely perfect and now no other high tea experience will ever compare. 
PS: Make a reservation because this place books up months in advance!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"After seeing this restaurant on Instagram, my girlfriend and I decided to make a reservation here a couple of days before our stay in London. Once we read reviews off here, we decided to go with Afternoon Tea at the Gallery. 
Visually, the space is beautiful. Upon entering, it's dark, quiet, and you'd never guess that the inside of this restaurant has whimsical themed rooms inside of it. Inside the Gallery, the walls are full of art, placed upon pink walls. Pretty much everything in the room was pink, but it wasn't anything overwhelming. The waiters and waitresses were dressed in suits and costumes while a couple of violinists played every few minutes. Of course, you'd have to visit the washroom - it'll likely be the most interesting one you'll ever visit. The ambiance of the restaurant was busy, but enjoyable. 
In terms of the food, it was pretty decent. We went with the cheapest option possible, giving us endless amounts of tea. We both opted for matcha and chai tea, which you can't go wrong with. What I didn't know is that if you enjoyed any of the cakes or sandwiches, you could ask for more at no cost. I was delighted to find this out because I assumed that I'd only be given the portions given initially! When looking at photos of the food from reviews, I thought I would be hungry leaving, due to the portion sizing. I can tell you that I left full, and satisfied. 
If you're interested in eating at Sketch, I would definitely recommended having Afternoon Tea at The Gallery. If you end up doing so, make sure you take many photos! I'm sure you'll never see anything like it again.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Top experience @ Sketch Tea Time! Service was impeccable and the quality of the food, tea and flow of this event is well worth it!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Worst, worst, worst!
I definitely do not have anything great to say about sketch.
My husband and I came here back two Saturday nights ago; we were both super hyped about dining here. Unfortunately the evening was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.
We arrived for our reservation at 10:00 p.m. and were promptly sat at our table. The server handed us our menus and said that she would be back.
We wanted to start our meal with a bottle of wine which we had to wait for the sommelier to come over to actually order(mind you we already were set with what we wanted) 
Finally it came time to order our meals. My husband tried to order the steak and was told they were out for the evening; he proceeded to ordered the lamb, and yet again we were told they were out of it! Why was this not told to us prior to placing our order?! We definitely would have left immediately. He ended up having to order the bone marrow(not great and lacked flavor)
I ordered the tortellini and was not overly impressed by the preparation of the dish(pretty Bland)
The final straw of the experience at Sketch was the fact that my husband had a half glass of wine in front of him and after we were finished paying the bill the bus person took the glass away without even asking if we were finished.
Sketch definitely has a lot of work to do before reaching the standards of a high end restaurant.
I come to London often and will definitely not be returning to this place.
Thanks for a horrible evening.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Advance reservation is recommended. We walked in the first time hoping to sit, quickly realizing that Sketch was booked for the weeks to come. Then we happen to be shopping in SoHo on the last day before leaving London, so I decided to try my luck again for any cancelled reservation. The host and hostess there were kind and were accommodating where possible. Second time around we were able to grab a quick bite in the forrest themed side of the cafe and really appreciate it.
Sketch has two rooms, one being the renowned pink room, the other being what I call the Alice and Wonderland themed room, both are extraordinary! We visited between 3pm-5pm when they offer afternoon specials. We ordered two sets of combos, one with regular cones and the other with sandwiches. The first came with tea but the second did not. In terms of tea, we had rose and earl grey, both were phenomenal. Rose was lighter than earl grey of course, which was perfect for me since I don't usually drink tea. It was refreshing and we asked for additional hot water to reuse the paddles and tea pouch. 
Sandwiches were unique as well. The four sandwiches were a mix of devil's egg, smoke salmon, cucumber, and curry. The small plate was filled with delicate creativity and the taste blended well. The cone on the other hand sounded like a standard afternoon tea side but was not nearly as impressive as the sandwich to me. The cone was a bit dry, though they provide a few fruit jams to go with it. Would certainly recommend the former combo than latter here.
Atmosphere and service needless to say was impeccable. Really gave us a comfortable while also classy afternoon tea feel. The pricing was also affordable in my opinion for such an experience. We paid around $50 for two people but were able to try a number of delicates while spending quantity and quality time with gourmet decoration in the view.
Highly recommend for anyone!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I personally think this place was worth the money. I came for afternoon tea. I was a solo traveler so I just made a reservation for myself which didn't seem that weird. Definitely make a reservation. I booked my in advance and I also booked the earliest available which was nice to walk around and take pictures easily. The attention to detail is amazing. From the hop scotch entrance, the menu, the bathroom... everything is so thought out and stylized. The bathrooms are so cool, they are a must to go in. The afternoon tea food was small but I was surprisingly very full when I was done. You also get some additional things like a biscuit and egg thing that were good. You technically get unlimited food but what they gave was enough, and I had about 3 pots of tea. The passion fruit one was yummy. If you're visiting it's a great spot to go to that feels very chic!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I had to come here after seeing gorgeous pictures of the dining hall for dinner. I made reservations online about a week before, and that whole process was super simple.
The atmosphere did NOT disappoint. The dining area is every bit as magical and beautiful as social media makes it appear. Normally I wouldn't try to take pictures of a dining area, but I was giddy and I just had to! Luckily, the staff is used to this and other patrons were doing the same thing; I wasn't reprimanded for my actions. 
So why the three stars? The ambiance gets 5/5 stars. The food and service is three stars at best. I got peppered steak and it was super dry and tough. It did NOT taste that great. It wasn't bad, but  I was really hoping for something better. I got the mac and cheese as a side, and it wasn't terrible--just different. I liked the creamy texture, but there was some sort of curry powder in it, and it took some time to get used to. My husband got the bone marrow, and he didn't think it was great.
Our server was a little odd. She forgot about us, and then she'd remember and hover--AS WE ATE. Awkward!
If I could, I'd skip dinner and come here for tea. The tea is in the same area as dinner, and I'd rather have subpar tea than a supbar meal for dinner.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"The ambience is nice, but the food is bad. We had lunch in glade. The only part we enjoyed were the desserts. The appetizers were especially bland. The fish was not fresh at all.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"You have to go for the ambiance alone! We went for high tea, as that was the only open reservation and we booked 3 months ahead of time. My advice book in advance or stop by in the morning to see if they have any last minute openings. The food isn't amazing but that's not why you go to Sketch! Don't forget to check out the bathroom",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"My friend has been raving about Sketch and how much he loves it everytime he comes back from visiting London. So on our recently short weekend in London, we made a reservation and came here for dinner and it did not disappoint. It's very modern and lavish with a very trendy twist. When you arrive, the walls are all covered in very modern and beautiful art.
If you are looking to come here, I would highly suggest you make a reservation prior to coming. We came over a weekend and reservations are super important as they were people being turned away at the door.
We ate in the Gallery Room that night, which has it's high and vast ceilings in a beautiful pink, with matching furniture. The walls are covered with vibrant and witty art work- the whole ambiance is a lot of fun but still very chic. The food we ordered was delicious and there are a lot of healthy options to pick from. The menu is also very cool, it looks like a modern cullinary pop up book. Make sure you remember to order some cocktails as they are very tasty... they have a few bar areas and each room is decorated vibrantly and differently- it's a visual feast and it's no wonder Sketch has some Michelin Stars under its belt. It's a great and beautiful restaurant/ bar/ lounge / club. 
Before your experience at Sketch is over, be sure to stop by the bathroom- they all look like eggs. If that sounds bizarre to you, just take my word for it and go see for yourself when you have the chance to eat and drink at sketch. Can't wait for my next trip to London, Sketch will for sure be on that list of to do's!
Gallery Room- Michelin *
Lecture Room- Michelin **",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Quirky and fun atmosphere. There are different themed venues within Sketch. Had afternoon-tea here and I couldn't stop taking photos. Don't forget to stop at the restroom to see the playful egg-shaped cubicles.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"1000th Review!!!!
When in London we knew we wanted to do an afternoon tea, I did some research and found the cutest place and knew we had to try it! The place I found was Sketch and I couldn't wait to go.
At the entrance is a hopscotch so you can hop your way in, me being uncoordinated thought it best I keep both feet on the ground lol
We walked towards the hostess desk for the Gallery to be shown to our seat, and when we walked in the gallery, I knew this was going to be a great experience, beautifully chevron floor, lush velvety pink benches and chairs, white linen tablecloths, soft pink walls, funky hand painted art on the walls, it was everything I expected it to be but so much more, and that's just from walking into the room, the experience just kept getting better.
Service was impeccable, everyone looked sharp in their uniforms.
We did the afternoon tea for 58 pounds. It came with unlimited choices of teas, I wish I remembered the names of the teas, but I did try a vanilla tea and Darjeeling black tea (one of my favorites). 
The afternoon tea comes with a lot, we started out with caviar and quail egg and cheese bread, next a beautifully presented tray came decked out with little finger sandwiches and sweets, everything was too pretty to eat, but don't worry, I did eat them. My favorites were the chicken and egg sandwiches. And we learned the sandwiches are unlimited, what? That's crazy!  Then we were treated to warm scones with fresh clotted cream and fig & strawberry jams. Is there anything better than a warm scone with fresh cream and jam? I think not!  But wait we are not done yet, but sadly we were full and asked if the dessert from the trolley could be packed up to go.
Everything at Sketch exceeded my expectations, I truly was tickled pink by the entire experience.  Even the egg pod bathroom lived up to the Instagram hype.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I went here for the first time about a month ago.
LOCATION: It's in Mayfair, which is a nice area of the city. 4/5
ATMOSPHERE: The ambience is amazing. We were in The Gallery (so I can only really speak for that), which is the most famous room of theirs (they have four main rooms). There's pink furniture and decor everywhere, and interesting/cool art on the walls. It's also very clean and pristine. I love it. Also, the iconic bathroom is super cool. So if you don't know about it, check it out if you go because it is an experience -- egg-shaped toilet stalls, colorful lights -- take an iconic mirror picture. So yeah, the atmosphere is definitely supreme. 4/5
SELECTION: So we went during dinner time when they serve their ""a la Carte"" menu, and not their famous afternoon tea menu. So the menu is fairly small, but I do appreciate the few labeled vegan options. However, I wish there was more, or at least a better/more unique variety, rather than a salad, a soup-type dish, and a tofu dish. Also, I was going to order the salad, but was told that I couldn't unless at least one other person ordered it too, I guess? That was a bit of a disappointment, but I dealt with the soup-type dish -- more on that below. 3/5
WHAT I GOT: I got their ""Green Le Puy lentils, button mushrooms, snow peas"" dish. It was basically like a soup. It comes out as a shallow bowl of lentils, mushrooms, and peas, but then they pour some sort of broth thing over it right in front of you. It was alright overall, but definitely not anything worth raving about. I liked that it wasn't oily or salt. And, the ingredients tasted fresh and good quality. But, it was very small and not filling. They make it seem like a bigger portion by serving it in a larger looking bowl, but it's actually super shallow, so it's literally like half a cup's worth. I know it's a nice, fancy dining establishment, but it's a ripoff to pay £20 for no more than like half of cup of veggies. They should at least put like some grains in it or use a deeper bowl to make it more sustaining. That's my opinion on the dish. 3/5
SERVICE: The staff seemed nice, but their service was kind of awkward. First off, when I went to the front desk to say that I had a reservation, the man said to wait five minutes and then come back to ask again. I came back five minutes later and still had to wait a bit, but then we were finally seated a few minutes later. Ok, so that wasn't too bad, but then it's confusing when you're seated because you have a waiter/waitress, and then a drink person to take drink orders. But, they don't really explain that. Anyways, after figuring that out, the waitress we had would either hover around our table or disappear throughout our dinner, which was strange. Or we'd be talking about the menu and she'd keep coming over, like asking if we had questions and whatnot a bunch. On to the drinks guy: one person I was with with ordered a Pimm's. Normally, you'd expect that when you order a Pimm's, you get the drink with the Pimm's, lemonade, and fruits. However, a glass of straight Pimm's, the straight liquor, came out. We tried Googling it, and found that the only thing it could be called was a Pimm's Cup, so we looked for someone who looked like they maybe knew about drinks better, and found a young guy. After explaining the situation and the different names and all that, he seemed to understand what we were expecting because about 5-10 minutes later it finally came out as expected ... I mean, whenever I've been to pubs and whatnot in the city, there were no questions asked, and a Pimm's comes out properly, with the lemonade and fruits mixed in. Maybe we're missing something and at nicer places you have to call them Pimm's Cups? Anyways, that was our experience with the staff/service. I'd still go back for afternoon tea though. 2/5",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Ok this place is a MUST go to for dinner.  It has two distinct rooms to eat in, the library and the gallery, 5 different and unique bar settings and the food, cocktails, and,wine list are superb.
Additionally the bathroom are a series of pod in a surreally lit room 
I really can't recommend this place enough for experience alone 
Portions are a bit small, but still filling and the desserts were a flavor parade 
If you are in London you check it out",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This place is MUST go when visiting London! (VERY Instagram worthy photo opportunities throughout the entire restaurant)
Let's start off by walking into the restaurant playing hop skotch while admiring the wonderful display of artwork. Sketch has 4 different rooms with completely different themes. My friend and I had afternoon tea in the Parlour Room and it was beautifully decorated with witty artwork and pink everywhere!
The service staff was great and the atmosphere gave me a comfortable yet classy afternoon tea feel. I loved that the owner had two things he was passionate about (art & high tea) and combined it into one of the most unique places I have ever been.
Make sure to stop by the restroom before you leave! When you open the double doors, you enter a white room with a staircase up to egg-shaped bathroom pods!
If you are looking for a unique experience in London, this is the place to be!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"My girlfriend and I came here Monday for dinner while we were in town. Overall it was a pretty good experience. To be honest, it was more of a 3.5 star than 4. 
Things got off to a rocky start when our waitress assumed I was male (spoiler: I'm not!). She profusely apologized which made it 
more awkward as other tables began to look over. Also, the bathroom situation is more weird and uncomfortable than cool. They are these bizarre white pods. The bathroom attendant tried to usher me over to the men's side, making things again extremely uncomfortable.
I guess women can't have short hair in the UK.
Anyway, on to food/drinks. 
I had the invisible cocktail which was delicious. It was more sweet than I usually care for, but delicious none the less. My girlfriend had a carafe of wine, to be honest I don't know which one, but she enjoyed it none the less.
For appetizers, we had the white asparagus which was pretty good. The best part was the herb veloute sauce it came in. We also had the Potato and Thyme bread which was yummy as well.
For dinner, I had the Aubergine and black garlic tortellini. It was delicious! The baby aubergine and zucchini that accompanied the tortellini were delicious. My girlfriend had the Veal Milanese and a side of mashed potatoes. I tried a bite of the veal which was tasty, but the mashed potatoes were dry and I thought I would choke trying to swallow them. 
Overall, I'm glad we came here. The decor and vibe is fun and trendy (we sat in The Gallery room) but the food is nothing to rave about. Although I will say it was one of the better meals we had while visiting.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Absolutely LOVED the interior. I was sad when I couldn't book a spot for the afternoon tea but at least I got a glance of the room on the way to the restroom. 
The brunch room is Alice in wonderland themed, I was in love with the velvet chair and the beautiful green decorations. They were playing ""live"" music from this automatic piano the whole afternoon, it reminded me of Westworld.
They had a good selection of cocktail, I went for the Bloody Mary and it was really good! The food was good too, I had the risotto and the boyfriend had some kind of pork belly dish that was really delicious. The beef tartare was just okay. The service throughout our time there was superb, the servers were friendly and attentive. 
Will definitely try to book the afternoon tea if I ever come back to London!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Arguably could be the coolest and most beautiful restaurant I've ever been to, with themed rooms and plenty of space to walk around.
The food and drinks, however, are quite rough around the edges. My wife and I were very excited for the food to be just as great as the place is stunning, but it's quite the opposite. Everything was dry, oddly-flavored, and ridiculously expensive. The drink selection is interesting... but that's about as far as it goes.
So if you're coming for the food, do yourself a favor and switch it to just come for drinks or tea, just to experience how incredible the place itself is.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch deserves the award for most adorable restaurant in the world. If I had a little sister, I'd take her here everyday. This would certainly make me broke though, so thankfully she doesn't exist.
From the couches to the walls, the dining hall is absolutely covered with cutesy pink decor. My favorite part of the restaurant, however, is actually the bathroom. The egg-shaped cubicles are these futuristic pods reminiscent of the movie Alien.
Oh, and the afternoon tea itself? Absolutely brilliant.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Sketch is beautiful and an experience for all your senses. I would recommend trying it at least once. After much anticipation I finally had lunch at the Glade. It was like being in a beautiful painting. It has a forest theme, which can be seen everywhere from the walls and ceiling to the carpet which actually looks like grass, to the food. 
The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the portions are really small and I think it's a little overpriced. However, the ambience makes up for it and the food is tasty. There were 2 of us and we had the 3 course lunch. I had the spaghetti courgette for starters, which was a great combination of flavors. For mains I had the steak which was a little chewy. It could definitely be improved. The dessert was by far my favourite. I ordered the chocolate biscuit which was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend it! My brother had the red fruits with red fruit sorbet which was refreshing and tangy.
Do go to the bathroom on your visit- one of the most creative designs I've ever seen! Overall a great place for a Sunday lunch.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I've never been to such a cool spot in all my life. Think ambiance multiplied a thousand times over. The French really know what they are doing when it comes to decor for an upscale cocktail lounge. The artistry and immaculate details that make up Sketch are mind blowing. Then when you walk to the bathroom thru the double doors you enter a white room with a spiral staircase up to cosmic eggs  that you open the door to with birds chirping in the background. It was surreal. The pink gallery room where you dine is surrounded by paintings all around with humorous ""play on word"" art. The service is impeccable with a twist of French flair and panache. The cocktails and food are secondary to the atmosphere, it's probably the only time you wont care how good the food or drinks are(they actually weren't all that good ), its that rare of a place.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"As a designer I love to doodle and draw, naturally Sketch caught my attention because of the Gallery art and pastel pink decor. While in London, I knew I had to stop here for a tea party, since I first saw the gorgeous interior that resembles a Wes Anderson movie set of the Gallery, and the bathroom of individual giant egg shaped potty's with bird sounds once inside, resembling Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: Space Odyssey from yes, an Instagram post by Kimberly Gordon of Selkie & Wildfox. 
All about the aesthetically pleasing presentation and tasty. It's not cheap, but it is worth it, particularly for a birthday or date ideal, very charming.
I arrived a bit early so I had a cocktail in the lounge, also cute lots of neon as I awaited.
I went for afternoon tea, I had the Oriental Beauty Tea, which was subtle and complimented the sweet deserts, pastries and finger food sammiches. speaking of design, the menu was adorable, and tells a story of each course, and item. The plates may seem small but I was full by the time the cake came out I could hardly eat it! favorite sandwhiches were my favorite.
I would highly suggest reservations are made ahead of time up to possibly two weeks in advanced, as this place books fast and might not have openings.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I don't even drink tea, but I drank it here for Instagram. The tea set was ADORABLE and I don't understand tea, but it tasted great! I'm getting ahead of myself tho!
I loved my experience at Sketch. Everyone who knows me knows that I am incredibly dedicated to my Instagram, so I was clearly excited to be able to go and dine here. The place was so artsy and perfect. The furniture, the art and just everything was so well-designed. I loved loved loved it. To my surprise, the food was also great, which is pretty unusual for pretty places like this one. 
Overall, great experience. Loved the place. If you go there, don't forget to visit the bathroom!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Went with some coworkers while in town for work.
This place is AMAZING. There was a bit of a hiccup with the service at the start (we just sat there for a bit) and had to be a bit direct about wanting to order drinks and such.
The drinks were EPIC. The whole group loved their drinks and some of us order more than one :)  I had the lamb mixed with this deconstructed lamb stew/rice (but like a mash? Not an actual stew)... it was amazing. I wish I had ordered two :)
The ambiance is super cool. They have new designers come in every so often, and every room (incl. the bathrooms) are really unique. 
Would definitely take people here in the future",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"My friends and I were visiting London for a week. Decided to check them out for lunch. All the pictures on line looks cute. We made reservations 2 weeks in advance.
Arrived at the restaurant 10 mins early. The host said that we were early and will not be able to seat us until our reservation time. Our reservation time came and went. They seated everyone else who came after us. Kept apologizing for overbooking. 40 mins into the wait, the host pointed to a small table by the entrance occupied by an old couple. Said as soon as they were done with their meal, they will set it up for 4 people. They did not look like they were closed to finishing. At that point, we gave up and left.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Is Sketch Lecture Room & Library really Michelin starred? It is and is truly deserved. Sketch is amongst the very best I ever tasted. (May be until the bill hits you where it really hurts but it is so worth it if taste matters to you as much as it matters to me). 
Just get the preset menu, forget about taking notes and trying critique individual courses. Taking notes would be an inappropriate distraction from a sensual taste experience. The drawback: My fellow Yelper cannot get detailed recollections, because describing heavenly taste experiences in words is not so easy - and probably impossible for me to express the wonders in words. 
Of course I also had wonderful company; friends from Boston whom we seem to run into in different countries. Remarkably, one of these friends has a seafood allergy - what a curse. But Sketch handled it better than any other place. 
We skipped the wine pairing. I was tempted (as always) but not everyone in our party was enzymatically capable. Hence, we got a Sancerre rose bottle (or two) which worked well through out dinner. 
WINNER!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"A must when visiting London!
One of my best adresses in the city. 
So original, go check out their photos and you will understand.
There are a few rooms with different ambiances. A restaurant, a bar, even cool washrooms.
Worth seeing. Beautiful design.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"When I thought of doing high tea in London, I imagined stuffy atmospheres with a crowd that wasn't my own. When I was told about sketch, though, I knew I found my sweet spot and dream spot to have my first appropriate high tea.
Sketch was Alice in Wonderland meets high fashion meets acid trip art...and it all went incredibly well together. We made a reservation for tea (this is a MUST!) and were seated in a corner booth that oversaw their entirely pink tearoom. From the couches to the paint to the waitstaff's outfits/uniforms, there wasn't a surface that wasn't touched with this color. With that and the quirky artwork on the walls, it really set the tone for what would be a unique experience.
We did the tea with a glass of rosé to add some bubbles to our meal. Admittedly, I was nervous about the menu because there items on it (quail egg and caviar, to name a few) which I never imagined myself eating, and I was so surprised by how every sandwich and dessert I had I liked. And not only did I enjoy every bite, but I left feeling beyond full; like, top button undone full.
The most important item to have liked would have been the tea and, needless to say, it was incredible. I had a black tea that had notes of vanilla to it and another tea that was lightly infused with rose buds. The latter was so good I ordered two pots of it. 
Overall, it was a brilliant high tea and I can't wait to fly back to London and return to Sketch!
Oh. And the bathrooms are like an episode of Black Mirror - slightly eerie but very intriguing. Can't say I've ever peed in a giant bird's egg before.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Coming from West Covina, California I can definitely say that I have never been to such an amazing/ artistic breakfast/brunch place. The whole experience was so unique and enjoyable. Why? Let me tell you why. It all started from walking through the streets of London, seeing all these name brand stores and finally getting to the cute artistic restaurant ""Sketch"". There were multiple rooms and through each room it was a different theme. All the waitresses and waiter has assigned uniform dresses and informed us that the theme of each room changes as well as their uniforms. Please do not get me started with the restroom, it was the most beautiful restroom I had ever seen, I went in there multiple times just to take more photos. It literally looked like walking into Heaven, which is funny cause it was a restroom. 
In the restaurant, there were 4 different rooms and each room had a different theme. The room we were in was more edgy, I was say. But, the room that caught my attention was definitely the pink room. The pink room was so cute, everything pink. The couches, the tables, and even the desserts! Not only was the place AMAZING, the people had such great service. If you ask me if i would go back, it would be an absolute YES!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Not just a beautiful place to dine, but delicious food as well! My sister and I came here for Afternoon Tea and were fortunate enough to dine in the gorgeous David Shrigley's Gallery. We were obsessed with India Mahdavi's pink velvet chairs. They were so comfortable to sit in too! Their tea sandwiches and pastries were all absolutely delicious. My favorite was their caviar and quail egg dish. Probably the best Afternoon Tea experience we've ever had. Service was amazing and everyone was so nice. My sister and I had such a fun time at Sketch and would love to come back.
Reservations are highly recommended since Sketch can be very busy! You won't be disappointed!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This is one of those bucket list places for me. When I was looking for places to go in London, I found this place because of all the amazing photos of their bathroom, pink tea room and entry way. When I walked in, the tea room and bathroom took my breath away. The service here is next level as they have multiple waiters to assist with setting up the tea. They also have an upgraded tea with caviar and champagne. My brother and I chose the upgraded tea and were promptly given champagne and our caviar. The tea options were great, they had the traditional teas as well as others that were different. The plate of snacks they give you is ample with the coronation chicken salad being my favorite. The waiter also slid us a few more sandwiches at our request. If you are in London, do yourself a favor and give an afternoon to Sketch",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This place is pretty interesting.  Lots of douchey people and it has a very club atmosphere.  It is most definitely an Instagrammers dream.  The bathroom is amazing, lol.
The food and drinks were good, but not worthy of the price.  But hey, you come here for the total experience and it is pretty cool.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Food is 3.5 but the atmosphere and decor is 5!! The whole restaurant resembles Alice in wonderland, with the pink decor, cute tea cups and waiters representing the characters in the story. 
The tea biscuits are meh for the price you pay. I love their sandwiches but didn't like any of the dessert - they also don't have the scones until the last.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This place is awesome. It has 4-5 different rooms with completely different themes, purposes and rules. Obviously, don't forget to check out the bathrooms (women are on the right and men are on the left, btw). We came here for afternoon tea and since we were here during the week of the royal wedding, it was a bit of a special edition. We opted for the champagne tea - note, everything (except the caviar and alcohol) are all-you-can-eat so don't be afraid to ask for more. Also, try as many teas as you can while you're there. 
All the food was fantastic, we were even served a small piece of the same royal wedding cake that Meghan and Harry had at their wedding just a few days prior! The service, however, was a little bit spotty. It took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come by our table after being initially seated. The waiter never came to check on us, only to serve us our different courses. He also forgot to bring the additional food that I had requested (I ended up being full by the end so gave up on asking for it). It ended up being about 250 pounds for 2 people (quite pricy IMO). The courses were spaced rather far apart and with that, and the waiter hardly ever coming by, we were there for about 3 hours in total (maybe 30-60 minutes longer than I would have liked). There's a couple other places for afternoon tea that I want to try, but I'm just hoping that we had a stroke of bad luck for our service and that wasn't the standard for this place.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"First time to London.  Great place for food and drinks and WOW what s celebration.  We had drinks, Appetizers, main course and dessert.  Service was splendid",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"As my friend describes it, this place is violently pink. 
I made a reservation during the Mayfair Flower Show, and the exterior along with the characters of the staff gave it a Alice in Wonderland feel. The afternoon tea was 80 GBP, and with the additional glass of champagne, the whole thing came out to 120 GBP per person, which is a bit crazy to be honest, but I figured this is probably going to be my first and last time here. The service was good, and the staff were in character. The afternoon tea was quite standard, but with the added caviar for starter. 
The toilets was another thing, it was very unexpected. Firstly you can't tell which side is for men and which side is for women when you enter. The toilets are in this egg shaped containers that has jungle music playing inside. It is the strangest experience, and I can't say I enjoyed it. 
Frankly, I think this place is only good for the instagram pictures, so if you want to pay an arm and a leg for a good gram, this is the place to go!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Really cool place to visit ! Alice in wonderland themed ... food was tasting ... service was good ... had a pleasant afternoon with friends. Bathrooms were completely different.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"A very enjoyable experience. Visually, the interior (of the ""lecture room & library"", which is the 2 Michelin star restaurant) was surreal with interesting modern touches, while still having substance in the decor. The bars on the lower levels are not up to the same care of decoration. 
The food was an excellent, a multi-course tasting menu, which was in the modern French style. Some dishes were more experimental in their flavors (eg. saffron ice cream), but there was a cohesive substance within the recipes that made the majority of courses work. My favorites were the salmon and foie gras dishes. The food reminds me of Abac in Barcelona, but not quite executed with the same level of orchestration. It was very good; truly an exceptional experience.
In addition, the service was very friendly and hospitable. At the end of the meal, I was given a miniature menu, which included a long list of ingredients used for each course. This was a very nice touch! I highly recommend trying Sketch for dinner.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Afternoon Tea Review:
Afternoon Tea at Sketch is certainly an experience. It's an incredibly fun, yet super relaxing way to spend a few hours. My husband and I laughed at the artwork on and off the whole time. It was great to sit in a room that had on and off live music (string trio).
The food -- 
I will say that I was very happy that once our waiter knew I was pregnant, Sketch made adjustments to all of the food items that can be risky to consume (caviar, undercooked egg, smoked salmon, and pate). I didn't ask them to do this; but when they came out with the food they clearly explained the substitute sandwiches and even put cauliflower rice balls on a spoon so I could pretend to eat caviar. Cauliflower is not caviar, but it was a kind gesture! 
I'm not sure how much you can escalate tea sandwiches, but this level of the 3-tiered serving platter was the most enjoyable for me. The presentation was perfect, yet nothing really blew my mind. I liked that you could get more of the sandwiches that you liked best. The deserts were fabulous -- even if I found some of them too rich/sweet for my taste buds. I should have saved more room for the scones. If you have a sweet tooth, this is a MUST experience. 
Yes, the bathroom was insane. I will say that I got completely nauseous walking in there after being in the pink room for almost an hour -- the sudden change in lighting and the mirrors over the sinks made me feel incredibly dizzy. It wasn't just me and my pregnancy -- my husband felt the same way. Just a warning!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Overrated & not that good. Don't book & pay for the pink room... you can see if from afar if you need. 
Go to the brunch room with the more green aesthetic - it's pretty great. 
Definitely go for a drink one night to check out the weirdo bathrooms -- they're currently decorated for spring in a quiet absurd way... also theres bird music while you're peeing...",-1

A
Visual treat. I love how each space is an entirely different aesthetic and mood. 
Capable and professional staff.
If you seek a feeling of exclusivity, this place is for you.
The bathroom ""pods"" are a trip and you should visit them.
Try to see each room if you can. A wild sensorial ride!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Let me start out by saying 1) I love afternoon tea 2) I'm a chocoholic 3) I love creative&innovative  decor.  The food was a 3.5 stars for me, while he atmosphere and ambiance was a solid 5! We came with a reservation booked 2 weeks in advance. 
AFTERNOON:
After you are seated you get a mini booklet of the teas, sandwiches and desserts you will get during the afternoon tea. 
+ 1st course: their take on a egg and toast with caviar 
+ 2nd course: 3 tiers  of sandwiches and dessert. The sandwiches were very artfully presented and quite yummy. The dessert were too fruity for me, as I mentioned I'm a chocolate and not a big fan of fruity desserts, as they are too sweet. Everything was raspberry or strawberry.  
+ 3rd Course: Scones with 2 different jams and butter. The butter was too hard to spread the other fruit jams were okay. 
+ 4th Course: Cakes from the Trolley. They had a chocolate shortbread cookie that I enjoyed. 
Overall, I wished that had include more variety in their flavors. It seems like there were two different dessert tiers - the other one looked better, to me. They should inform their customers of other options if they do. 
You have the option of trying as many teas as you like, but as a results the teas are less potent than I would like. 
SERVICE: 
Service was alright, not very attentive. As it does take awhile to flag someone down once it gets really busy. But everyone was really polite and friendly. 
AMBIANCE: 
Very princess and girly like theme. Everything is pink and white. But the highlight of this location is actually their restroom. The bathroom ""stalls"" are actually individuals pods with spring scent and sounds. The bathroom is spotless since there is a cleaning lady there the whole time cleaning after your ever move. haha. It's not very obvious, but the bathroom is separate by male and females. The blue light leading up to the left side is for males and the pink lights on the right is for the females.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Interesting place.  Seems so unassuming when you first approach it and then you enter in and it's a whole other world in there!  I almost don't want to spoil it for people, but there are several options for rooms to lounge in.  I was in a room at the back left which was themed like a forest as though I was going hunting or something.  The place is really big.
I came for drinks one night while in London and certainly didn't expect this.  They have coat check, and then you're pretty much free to wander around.  I have no idea what is up the one staircase as I didn't go there, but when first coming in, there's another room to the right that is a really great lounging area.  They had a DJ so it was a bit loud in there so we headed to the back.  Across from the room we were in was a room that looked like a pink 1950's American diner.  Past the doors through that room on the other side was the most unique bathroom I've ever seen.  I won't describe it, just go see it for yourself.
Fun place to get drinks.  Maybe I'll try the food on my next visit.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"If you're looking for afternoon tea, I'd probably look elsewhere, we had a ""Sketchy"" experience.
I was really excited to eat at Sketch. The decor was hip, modern, and cool!  The bathroom alone made the trip to the restaurant one to remember, but just being a ""cool"" place doesn't excuse numerous transgressions. 
I waited forty-five (45) minutes just to have a couple extra finger sandwiches delivered. I could have walked to Fortnum & Mason, bought some of their sandwiches, and walked back in the time it took me to get finger sandwiches from Sketch. No less than four times did we ask our server for them and each time both of them said, ""We're sorry, they are on the way.""  
When I bit into the pistachio cake, the first bite was great!  The second bite was a painful like biting on a pebble because they failed to remove a cherry seed!  Yes, I bit down on cherry seed. Have you ever bitten something hard and not expected it?  Perhaps an olive seed, or maybe a fish bone in your trout?  At least with olives and fish, I tread carefully. I didn't tread so carefully because I was eating cake. I received an apology from the restaurant and they said it's never happened before. Thanks. I guess that makes my jaw feel better.  They had an opportunity to provide some extra customer service and fail short.  
The variety of finger foods was mediocre. The food looked great, but the taste wasn't on par with what I'd expect. Even my lunch companion didn't care for several of the selections.  The visual appeal was there, but the taste fell flat. It was like taking home a girl you'd think was an absolute ""ten"" from the club at night, and then waking up with a ""four!""
I have no problem helping charities, but they automatically added £1 to my bill to their charity of choice. Why don't you have the balls to ask me if I'd like to donate instead of sneakily adding it to my bill?  Maybe I would have given more, I tend to be pretty generous, but if you try to sneak it in under my nose then you are deceitful and despicable.  I won't be back; plenty of other, better, places for afternoon tea.
The live string-trio was great!",-1

Always want to find an excuse to return to this incredible place",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"A magical experience from start to finish. A phenomenal place to people-watch -- to feel like you're breaking the fourth wall in a contemporary rendition of an classic movie, reminiscent of Breakfast at Tiffany's. I was seated early; the staff was not fazed by the fact that I was dining alone (my brief trip to London was a solo endeavor). During the course of my dinner, I was approached by a myriad of waiters, sommeliers, and a gentleman who I took to be the the floor manager. Each member of the staff was courteous, respectful, and helpful. I had the homemade bread, the bone marrow, Sketch's velvety-smooth take on a classically intense penicillin, and for dessert--as per the manager's suggestion--a chocolate creation paired with a cappuccino. A masterpiece the whole way through. Thank you, Sketch, for a beautiful evening!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Had a delicious afternoon tea here! The entire venue is gorgeous, but the Gallery room is just so pretty. We were one of the first people in and our waiter was so attentive. Their tea selection was amazing and my husband (who doesn't usually drink tea) enjoyed every tea we had.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This tea service was very pricey but it was also very classy. There was a huge selection of teas: Black, green and white with various infusions of fruit or flowers. The forbidden romance was my favorite. The staff is very attentive and courteous.

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Booked our anniversary dinner here as it is renown as a special occasion type of place. We arrived right on time for our reservation and were shown to the first table in the Gallery - not the best location given the traffic from the main corridor but decent for people watching. Loved the playful decor juxtaposed with elegant dining furnishings. 
Service was prompt throughout food service - we had water and drink orders put in immediately. He had a glenfeddich neat and I the Chattahoochie mezcal cocktail which was absolutely divine and had me buzzing through the appetizers. He got the chantilly lace lobster bisque which he graciously shared with me since my £24 scallop starter was underwhelming in comparison. His soup was heaven and something I would return for on its own - without a doubt it was creamy without the heaviness you might expect from so much butter. Again, the scallop scored high marks in presentation but was cold, underseasoned and lackluster. 
As it was the day to commemorate our wedding, we chose the duck to share. This was brought out in a cloche and unveiled for our inspection before being broken down. The plates were modest portions but delicately prepared with cranberry jus, and accompanied by a side dish of israeli couscous and other dark hare meat pieces. 
We ordered the napoleon dessert and waited nearly 10 mins before someone informed us it was no longer available; this ended up just fine as we were rushed to return to relieve the babysitter however it showed up on our bill. This had to be remedied and all in, we had to chase down someone to pay as this was extending long after we had finished our last course. 
As a result of this unceremonious ending, I docked a star for service and another for price points on some of the less than outstanding selections.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Definitely the highlight of my London dining experience. It was honestly such an amazing experience to have afternoon tea here. I'd encourage everyone to go at last once. My friend and I decided to do the simple afternoon tea (around 60 euros per person). 
Immediately upon being seated, you're given a great menu with many teas (I had THREE pots during my time there). After that a waiter comes up with an egg dish and grilled cheese cracker, and of course a spoon of caviar!! I was so shocked and felt like royalty. 
Of course then we got the platter itself. The food is unlimited but we honestly couldn't even finish what we were given. Everything was DELICIOUS. I especially enjoyed the chicken and salmon finger sandwiches and the scones. There's honestly so much food (and it keeps coming) that I left feeling stuffed. 
The ambience is also super cool! Everything is pink and there's some real cool artwork all over the walls. And be sure to visit the restroom, you'll be in for a (not so) surprise.
HIGHLY recommend going - you'll leave super full and happy :)",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Came to sketch for the afternoon tea set. The place is really nice and unique. When we came there was also live music in the gallery (pink room). The food was okay considering the price though.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Went online to make a reservation, hardly any open slots but arrived to the restaurant to find two tables in use. #fauxexclusivity Anyhow, it was definitely interesting to take in. The decor is quite dizzying. The flowers in the entry hall were beautiful. The bathroom up the stairs is hard to navigate without feeling your way as it's all mirrors. Stick to the pods. The food was mediocre; it's definitely more about ambiance. I ordered a relatively new item on the menu; it was a cereal cake with raspberry and soya milk. The most ridiculous thing to try to eat! Our server asked how it was as they were still testing it out; I hope it's not a permanent menu item. Staff were a bit frazzled but friendly. Overall: the various dining rooms are worth checking out.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"We were given this event as a lovely gift...
It is a unique take on English tea
Unfortunately, it was a disappointment
The fun, quirky nature was lost due to the staff's snobbishness
The restaurant was unwilling to accommodate guests since everything is pre-fixe and seating is pre-arranged
We were rushed from the minute we were seated, even though our reservation was for two hours and the restaurant was empty
Food grois served, which I do not eat and was not able to substitute out
The egg and caviar we're delicious and the server was charming and did a great job explaining the dish
Sandwiches were made well in advance, so the cucumber was soggy
Scones (American biscuits) are warm and fluffy)
Three string quartet was a nice touch
*The Restrooms: They are located through a set of  unmarked double doors (of which there  are four sets, and God forbid you ask for help - rude!) at the top of the stairs (also unmarked). There are men's and women's sides (also unmarked). They are incredible, though! They make up for the whole pretentious visit. I'll leave it at that.. (see photos)
Overall, the experience was overrated. Spend the cash on a traditional, high end English tea. Save this for a kids party or a baby shower unless you absolutely love mod toilets.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"All 3 stars for the ambiance and decoration of the restaurant. The pink interior was definitely picture worthy.  However, the dinner there was simply mediocre. We ordered the ravioli, lobster, and ribeye. The lobster came with an interesting purée that complemented the lobster very well. Other than that, everything else weren't too special, nor good. Afternoon tea here is probably more worth it, but probably won't be coming back for dinner here.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"I understand that coming from Seattle, I'm largely a stranger to unique European experiences such as afternoon tea. But this dining experience was literally SO far below our expectations that it was baffling. We only had a few days in London and we searched all over months in advance to make reservations at spots that seemed worthwhile to us. We thought it would be fun to dine in an art gallery after visiting the Tate Modern, and in that regard we were right. 
The gallery atmosphere of sketch is absolutely mesmerizing, with not a single detail ignored. It features the witty and comical art of David Shrigley on the walls and within the dining fixtures themselves, brightly-colored pink chairs, and the famous toilet pods (which I'm convinced are a large reason for many of their visitors' 5-star reviews). The atmosphere is incredible and warranted at least 2 stars. But unfortunately the rest of our time at sketch fell flat. 
We did the champagne afternoon tea, which we didn't realize only came with a single glass of champagne. That's fine, but based on the dramatic price increase we didn't realize that. (Maybe because we are heathens who normally drink cheaper champagne, but nonetheless it didn't feel worth the additional £34 or whatever it was.) The three tiers of savories and sweets for the tea *looked* absolutely beautiful, but there were only a couple of items that actually wowed us with their flavor while the others seemed like whimsical placeholders that tasted dull and unimpressive. 
Service was questionably slow and disjointed, which made no sense because we often saw wait staff just hanging around chatting with one another. We placed our tea order about an hour before we received it...long after our 3-tier snacks were consumed. This was frustrating. Flagging someone down was nearly impossible even though it was a Tuesday and the place was relatively empty. There was a live strings trio playing music that did NOT fit the vibe of the establishment at all. And that kind of helps to sum up our whole experience...I couldn't decide what vibe or what identity sketch was serving up to me, and I think somewhere with such a unique image should have a well-defined concept with background music that matches, service that is at least satisfactory, and food that blows you away. 
£300 later we were still hungry and largely unimpressed by the food and tea we had consumed. If you simply have money to blow I guess I can still recommend checking it out for the theatrics, but otherwise I would pick somewhere else.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Four of us had dinner at Sketch a few weeks ago in London. We all had the tasting menu. Two of our party were very sick later that evening and the next day. The two people who were sick had nothing else to eat in common, and had only met that night, so it seems unlikely that anything else would have made them sick, other than the meal at Sketch. 
We emailed the restaurant to make them aware that two in our party were sick and appear to have had food poisoning. They referred us to an independent consultant. That consultant asked what else we had eaten and if we had been to a doctor. As we noted earlier, both people had eaten other things, but not together, so it is extremely unlikely that it was anything but Sketch that made them sick. We made this point to the consultant. And noted that neither person went to a doctor for treatment. Though one of the people sick is a pharmacist. So she could clearly take care of herself. The independent consultant determined their investigation was inconclusive. Which is a disappointment. 
A restaurant of Sketch's caliber and reputation should take responsibility for its actions. We have no problem paying for a good meal. And the food was good and experience nice.  Other than their getting sick. But we don't want to pay to get sick. I'm disappointing in how the Restaurant disclaimed any responsibility. They should at the least have offered to refund the meal.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"I was sincerely disappointed with my visit here; and it was one of the places I was really looking forward to during my stay in London. Perhaps I can give it another try when I return for dinner on my next visit, but my first experience was not a pleasant one. 
The staff was exceedingly pretentious and unhelpful when I politely asked for directions, to look at the menus, etc. I had a few drinks and some food with my traveling companion in the bar (which was BEAUTIFUL, and earns the stars I gave!). The service was terrible; in fact, we were too polite to say anything, but the French guests next to our table walked up and demanded that the waiters attend to us, as they noticed how we were being ignored amidst the other guests. It was super bizarre, as we always bend over backwards to be nice to waitstaff, and were excited to be there. 
It took 2 hours for one drink each as well as a few small foods (nuts, etc.). 
The only thing that will have me return to this place is for a meal in the main dining room; I hope the second chance eradicates the bitter taste in my mouth.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Definitely a unique high tea experience to try at least once while in London. 
Before my trip, I booked a reservation a few weeks in advance for Saturday afternoon tea. I also did some research to confirm the correct room to book since there are several options on the website. The notable pink room is 'the Gallery'.
For the classic afternoon tea, it doesn't seem like the food would be very filling, but you can request more of any of the tea sandwiches, cakes, parfaits etc. and the staff makes sure your tea cup or glass is full. 
My favorite bites of the high tea were the caviar accompanied with bread sticks to dip in an egg-shaped cup with yolk in Hollandaise sauce; the curry chicken sandwiches with colorful garnishes on top and the pistachio and hazelnut mini puffs. The tea pot, cups and sugar bowl are amusing to read with random words or phrases and the pictures in the menu are quite cute.
After a filling meal, it is a must to visit the iconic egg-shaped bathroom stalls - just be sure to walk up the correct staircase since there isn't a clear divider between the mens' and womens' stalls.
The service was quite slow, but very polite and courteous - a lot of the waitresses were speaking French too. What was also nice was that there was live music playing in the background from a female string trio. 
A little pricey experience since it is at least £65 per person depending on which high tea option you select. Also as a heads up - they already add around 12% gratuity to the check prior to paying.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"So the ambiance was nice. The bathroom is very cool. The service was excellent. However, the food was horrid. If you decide to go to Sketch, just know you are going for the decor/experience. 
Despite that, Sketch is still a restaurant so I would advise them to redo their menu. The chips that came with my fish tasted like they had been forgotten in the back of the freezer for the last decade. The couples on either side of my table were equally displeased. From my perspective Sketch is trying to offer too wide an array of food. They have British, French, and Italian items on their menu. I would suggest they simply pick one type of cuisine and stick with it. The waitress was lovely and I felt bad she had to endure the customers to my right berating her about how bad the food was. 
So, if you have 40£ to spend on a subpar meal than you should absolutely go to Sketch and get a picture of yourself with their fabulous decor!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Worth every penny.  4 rooms, all distinctly and unique in their own way.  Have come here twice now for afternoon tea, once in the Alice in Wonderland themed room and once in the pink room.  The pink room is largest and my favorite out of all the rooms - with its modern and cheeky decor and huge vaulted ceiling.  What I love best about it is that it's essentially all you can eat - but they serve you so much food that you might not even take advantage of it.  Of course you MUST visit the bathroom here... the most unique and insta-worthy I've seen to date!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Came here for dinner. Reservations at 9:30pm. We arrived early on purpose to have pre-dinner cocktails. Hostesses were friendly, helpful and polite. Went to one of the 3 bars/clubs for drinks. Sat immediately, they were super busy so drinks came a little slow but they were made well and all was good. We were sat for dinner on time. And that was about it for the rest of the night. Our server was not great. We ordered cocktails and they took 30 minutes. I saw them sitting in the counter for quite some time. But our server was nowhere in site. Someone else brought our drinks. 50 minutes into our visit our appetizers finally came. By this time we were perturbed, yet still no server. We ordered a bottle of wine. Sommelier poured for us most of the time. Still no server. I finally had to find someone and complain about the service. Our server checked on us once. Other people brought out our entrees. why have a server when 5 other people pretty much did her job. One person too many on the team that was completely useless if you ask me. This place was a disco, at best, that just so happened to sell decent food. Who was the Michelin critique who judged this place? Because I'd like to know how many drinks they had before having dinner and giving their rating. It's not worthy of the prestige that is awarded a Michelin Star. It was average at best including food and below average in service standards/time. Very disappointed, and even If i were 19-21 looking to go clubbing, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"My absolute favorite in London!  If you like art and food, this is the place for you!  Personally I prefer savory food, so my best friend and I picked the lunch option at the glad room.  32£ for 2 course, 40£ for 3 course lunch.  When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by its decor.  Service is perfect, classy & elegant.  I do recommend to dress up a little, cocktail attire would be perfect.  I had the foie gras appetizer, lamb stew for main, and red fruits, red sorbets for dessert.  Everything is phenomenal!  If I live London, I would go every month!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"There's nothing like sketch, I wish we had this restaurant in North America.
Fast, prompt service, really courteous servers.
Amazing decor, pink everywhere.
Individual pod washrooms and great smelling candles. 
Drinks are 5/5!!!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,The tea was amazing. The decor is fabulous. Def a must do in London! We also went out for drinks there and the dj was great.  We had a great night,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"A must when in London. Great ambiance, service, and yes, food! This review is for the Gallery. Cocktails are super tasty, we sampled 4 and none disappointed. Wine list is extensive but to the point. Very happy with the Malbec we chose. I had the lobster bisque, can only describe it as rich yet sublime with a superb (live) presentation. Rack of lamb was a perfect dish as a whole, all flavors and texture were complimentary to each other. For dessert, I had the panna cotta, which was good but not what I expected in terms of consistency and flavor profile . You would like it if you enjoy sugary sweets -think bubblegum and cotton candy. I highly recommend any of the Sketch establishments, all are a treat in quality.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"If Kubrick and Wes Anderson had a love child it would look like Sketch. The bathrooms look like something out of 2001 Space Odyssey meets Clockwork Orange, meets Eyes Wides Shut (french maids and velvet curtains), with the aesthetic eye of Wes Anderson. 
There is a nice balance of hard and soft elements, naughty and nice, festive and dim, elegant and dangerous. The service was spectacular, the food was also elegant, delectable, perfectly presented. The ambiance was inviting. The decor perfectly picked out. Overall, there was great attention to detail. From the design of the menus, to the lighting, the color of the booths, the bathrooms! YES the bathrooms....Afternoon Tea at Sketch is not complete unless you include indulging in the trippy pod-bathrooms. 
Sketch is unlike any other place I've ever been to. There was beautiful live music that showcased both classical and current songs on cellos and violins. The food featured cakes, warm scones, caviar, finger sandwiches (that were made vegetarian upon request). They had many types of teas and you could try them all if you so wished. The servers were highly knowledgable about all of their dishes and made the act of serving tables an art, rather than a job.The overall price per person was not cheap, but considering the service, the quality of the food, the abundance of dishes, the creative ambiance, and the wonderful afternoon, the price is well worth it!
I recommend making reservations ahead of time. We were unable to make one and got lucky with a last minute cancellation. I will most definitely be coming back to Sketch, and I hope to bring everyone I know there. I lived in London for 9 years in my childhood, and had never heard of such a place, revisiting London after 20+ years, Sketch will now become a permanent London memory and must-do experience.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"My fiancé and I got the afternoon tea and were welcomed by a gorgeous flower display in the entry and the fabulous maitre d'.  The first half of service went swimmingly, accompanied by a violinist duo strumming pop hits.  The tea was prepared fabulously and savory bites were all extremely delicious, the custard cheese egg and the mushroom sandwich being my favorites.
Unfortunately, the sweet bites were all too sugary for my palate and they kept coming.  I wish the savory hadn't been outweighed threefold by the cakes and sweets.  When it came time for our final gluttonous duo of desserts, it seems the staff had turned over and we were left without service for an unfortunate 45 minutes.  We were trying to flag down members of the staff but perhaps the lunch crew was intent on leaving or setting up for dinner service and kept busy-bodying past us.  By the time we had finally flagged someone down, our appetite was long quelled and we were late for our next rendezvous.  Considering the cost of the meal and the high number of waitstaff, I was expecting a more streamlined experience.  We had the last desserts wrapped to go with little apology for having been forgotten and they weren't very tasty the next day. 
I would give sketch another chance since it was so promising for the first half of service, but would definitely request more savory bites and less desserts next time.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"""This is the first place I've ever been to, where as soon as I came in, I wanted to figure out who I could bring here so I could torture them."" - Quote from my husband.
Sketch's afternoon tea is ridiculous, but in a good fun way. I had a great time, and despite my husband's initial above statement after being seated, I know he did too. 
I ordered the afternoon tea option that included the infused tea champagne (£79) and he had the Exotic tea (£78.) The glass of Earl Grey-infused champagne was really good, but sadly no refills -- though the tea and main course offerings are endless.
We're served a creamy (comte?) cheese with petite breadsticks to start. The cute dishes have words and phrases on them. 
I'm taking in the infamous pink room and began to see a pattern of funny characters, from the interesting wall drawings to the rest of the staff themselves. I'm feeling all 'Twin Peaks.' 
There's this guy, see. Dressed in a ridiculous pink full tweed suit. He's their caviar mascot, it seems, handing you a scoop of their caviar for your plate before happily twirling off. Dr. Jacoby. Yes; he's like a young Dr. Jacoby. 
Next comes a guy that reminds me of the Giant from Twin Peaks, who would sometimes serve as well. We couldn't understand a thing he said, and you know: I felt like he knew it lol I know the gals next to us couldn't understand him. I'd like to think he was telling us clues 'the owls are not what they seem.' 
Later, I notice a patron across from me has his head unfortunately placed next to one of the drawings, and I can't help but get a picture of him. 
And then the main courses arrive! Curry chicken, cucumber, smoked salmon sandwiches at the base of the tiers. Above that, the Battenberg cake, chocolate caramel cake, pistachio Petit Choux, and at the tippy top, homemade marshmallows and rhubarb cheesecakes. It was good; I tasted all the desserts not finishing them. I'll say that I enjoyed the sandwiches more (the curry chicken was my favorite) so I ordered more of them.
Next course are the scones, with clotted cream and jam (his favorite thing always.) And last is my favorite dessert, the Victorian Sponge cake. 
There's a two-hour time limit to afternoon tea noted when you make your reservations, which I recommend doing as far in advance as possible. A notable thing to mention is that my husband loves tea. The variety is excellent here, and he ordered a few pots over the course of the meal. Two of the pots he had are from tea bricks (pu'er tea) and are normally £25 each serving there, but you can have it during afternoon tea. I felt it tasted like dust and prefer the pu'er we have at home.
One last thing: I couldn't not talk about the RESTROOMS. It really capped off the experience of Sketch. Through the room's pink door, up the pristine white stairs (a bar is in middle of the floor) you'll find the restroom pods. Men's = left staircase; Women's = right staircase. The pods are placed in no particular order, and sinks are found along the walls -- hiding behind pods. I felt like I was in Labyrinth for a moment, expecting Jared to come around the corner any moment as I searched for a sink. Everybody was taking pictures, which is kinda funny if you think about it.
You have to come; just to say that you did!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I almost never give 5 stars reviews but this place absolutely deserves it. 
Coming from a place like New York, where you get more than 1000 fun choices to lunch and dine and you can be amazed by some of the things you see, this place blew my mind completely.
Let's start with the staff, everyone was so polished, polite and their outfits were on point. Our waitress Cloe was a sweetheart who kept making sure we were 100% happy with everything that was being served. 
The sandwiches, desserts and were unbelievably good. But I must say that the ambience and decoration of the place is absolutely breathtaking. The bathroom was my favorite spot in the entire place! if you haven't been please do you'll never regret it.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Very disappointed by this place. Went for an afternoon tea and the food tastes very bad, like what you get in a very (very) cheap place.
Sandwiches are really awful, sweet stuff is just ok. 
Tea selection is not good either. I don't recommend this place to anybody, mainly considering the price. It's only for pictures, but not even worth the money or using your time to make reservation. I would say it's a waste of time and money.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"You've probably seen this place on instagram and remembered about it, mostly because of their very IG-Material bathroom. Now the question is: is it really worth it? And my answer is YES, Absolutely! I loved this place the second I arrived. It's very girly, modern and artsy. Each room has its very own energy and atmosphere. We sat at the pink gallery for dinner. With started with some fresh bread and butter (the bread was not the best, but i'm french si I have very high expectations haha). Then I had the lamb and it was VERY good! We didn't have anything to drink (besides water of course) but the drinks section looks pretty good. And of course, I highly recommend going to the bathrooms for a little surprise ;)! 
One more thing: their plates, bowls etc are all very fun with quotes in/on it",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"If you're ever in London, this spot is a must. Let's just say it is an instagrammers dream come true. From the entrance, the main pink tea room, to the pod bathrooms- you'll be taking pictures of something- guaranteed!!!
A bit on the pricier side, but you will get your money's worth.
Had the standard afternoon tea. The waitress helped me with the tea selection, which was nice. To start, they give you a piece of bread, caviar and egg. Pretty interesting combo, but good nonetheless. The sandwich selections are nice- not your traditional cucumber and mayonnaise sandwiches. And then the sweets- omg so pretty and yummy!! I was so full I couldn't even touch the top pudding and marshmallow. Don't forget the cake and scone. I will say, I wish the scone was a bit better, it was on the dryer side, but the jam and clotted cream made it.
And not to mention the live music performance by a mini orchestra.
Make sure to plan ahead with reservations!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Sketch is everything! The decor and atmosphere is absolutely amazing. The Gallery is where dinner is served and very picturesque. I ordered the Ribeye and it was juicy and seasoned very well. Though I was not a fan of the macaroni cheese (I'm from America and ours it different) I also tasted the fish and chips and onion rings which were also tasty. I recommend that any and everyone done here at least once.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Our first night in London and we had to check out Sketch! Such a unique concept and it really lived up to it's hype and our expectations. We had dinner reservations in the Gallery and got seated right away. The hostesses are so kind and greeted us with a smile. Our waiter also took good care of us and recommended a few of his favorites. For appetizers we ordered the soufflé and scallops. The soufflé was excellent--very rich, but also refreshing. The scallops were OK. This was probably my least favorite thing we ordered. For our main course we decided with the bone barrow, steak tartare, and sea bass. We loved every single dish. They're all my favorite and I recommend trying all three of them. All I could say was WOW and my stomach was definitely happy! All of our dishes came out fairly quick too. The only downside to our experience, was that, it took forever for our dessert to come out, but they made it up by not charging us for the dessert! It also gets a bit noisy and overwhelming, but our experience was still enjoyable. The restrooms are by far the coolest restrooms I've ever been to! I was amazed by the unique concept. Overall, such a fun experience and the dishes were all memorable and melted in my mouth. I would definitely come back!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Recently came here for afternoon tea in the Gallery. This place books up quickly so I suggest getting an online reservation as soon as they open up the dates which are usually a month out.
There is a set menu starting with caviar and champagne (if you choose for additional cost) then moving onto assorted finger sandwiches and pastries served with your choice of tea. You will also receive fresh scones served with cream and jam. These were probably the best scones I have ever had! Lastly they bring you a slice of cake. It was A LOT of food. Make sure you go hungry and give yourself after you finish before your next meal.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"I don't know what to say other than that I was seriously underwhelmed by this place. 
Yes everything is pretty and yes the toilet looks like something derived from science fiction but when it gets down to the most important bit (the food)... Sketch disappoints. On a major scale.
Aside from the stunning interior, not much else makes having tea here any more special than any other place.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Afternoon tea (59 pounds/person) was exceptionally dreamy and pretty much lived up to every pink dream I've ever had.
The ambiance was worth it alone, but we really enjoyed the food and tea as well. 
Perfect London experience!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"My friends and I were on a short vacation to London and made sure to add this to our itinerary after doing some research. Overall, we're glad we got to experience Sketch- but will most likely not return. 
Decor: The restaurant captures your attention as soon as you walk in with hip and modern design. It'll make you want to immediately pull your phone out and start taking pictures. We had the Christmas Afternoon Tea which was held in a beautifully decorated and very pink/purple room. 
Service: We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. We were all so excited and were busy taking pictures until we realized that 15 minutes had passed by without anyone coming to our table. We finally flagged someone down and they briefly explained their menu. This was a constant struggle- the staff was running around but it was so hard to get consistent service. Maybe they do this on purpose since there is a 2 hour time limit, but we were so confused how such a high rated place could be so slow on service. We passed our two hour time limit and a manager came to tell us we had to leave soon. The funniest part is that we had been waiting for almost 30 minutes for someone to come to our table so we could get a check. However, the waiters and staff that did attend to us were friendly and helpful. 
Food: The most disappointing part was the food. The display of the food is pretty so you will definitely get an ""insta"" pic, but the taste was subpar. The chicken salad sandwich was our favorite, but even on the second round we weren't impressed. The bread of the sandwiches tasted stale as if they had been out for a long time. They sell the unlimited food idea, but it is so hard to get your money's worth. 
Toilets: It is odd to say the toilets were a highlight of a restaurant experience, but it was. 
Special Occasion: We were celebrating our friend's engagement so they did surprise us with a place that said congratulations with a candle. It was just a piece of dessert already on the afternoon tea menu, but the thought was very kind.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Such a great posh dining experience. Do be prepared to spend some cash if you are planning on drinks and dinner. We made reservations in the gallery for dinner. Our evening began with bar service followed by a two course meal. Service was very knowledgeable and friendly!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Went here last year because I knew it was a London staple. Remember to book early to get the afternoon tea! I put it off and could only get a time at night. Would 10/10 recommend showing up drunk/buzzed and checking out the egg bathroom. Also pink everywhere and fancy (but expensive) dining.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Sketch is definitely a quirky and fun place for afternoon tea! We came during the Mayfair flower show so it was extra festive. Afternoon tea was pricier since it was during the flower show event. However the experience was worth that price. We were so full from all the sweets and food they endlessly offered. The service was impeccable and attentive. Don't miss the bathrooms and other rooms in sketch. The artwork and setup is out of this world!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This place totally exceeded my high expectations! It's trendy, chic and super unique. Every room was different, exciting and interesting. The bathrooms are obviously the best part, but the drinks from the cocktail bar underneath them are very good as well! I got wrath, as they have the 7 deadly sins as a them for some of their craft drinks. I showed up randomly, so I wasn't aware that the pink room is strictly for afternoon tea or dinner sadly- (which is a splurge if you just want a glass of wine in that room) but you can still admire it. The green room was just as unique, with different drink options and great service. I enjoyed all the different costumes the staff had in each room as well. They also have a charging station where you can leave your phone while you enjoy your stay if needed. 
Location is great, it was easy to find and I definitely can't wait to go back!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Great night out in London! Food was excellent, staff was a bit uppity in a not welcoming way, but the drinks were strong! The design of the place was extremely unique like someone let their wife do whatever she wanted design wise, ie an entire pinkish purple room (including the lighting, walls & seating) lol shaggy grassy carpet in the bar area with moving mirrors with red laser-beams being reflected and bouncing from mirror to mirror. The bathrooms are extremely unique seeing is believing! Everything is very 60s Barbarella style! I only saw three of the rooms, but it all seems to be in good fun! Alex the bartender, in the room by the bathroom was awesome and he made our night!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"We really wanted to like the place. The price didn't matter because we were paying for an experience. It started off pleasant because we came at a time where it wasn't the peak hours. Once people started coming in the service became non existent. Funny, because there are tons of servers. For the price you expect better service. I do not understand how service people can be so snooty. It is always better to treat people kindly, rather than act like you'd rather be elsewhere. It took us 20 minutes to try and get the bill and we were sitting right in front of the bar where ALL the servers walk by. We hailed someone down and she just forgot, even though we are right in front of her.
The ambiance is different than the typical high tea. It's more modern and of course looking at the bathroom you can tell. The bathroom is co-ed - I say this because it does not have a wall to divide between male and female and you need to guess which side is which. Let me help you not guess. Follow the pink lights ladies and follow the blue light guys.
The food was presented beautifully. Of course you will always have favorites but of the many choices we only really liked two items. The mixed drinks were delicious.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Food is mediocre, service is not bad. They put donation on your bill without notifying you. The place is overall a instagram spot rather than a restaurant.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch is an experience from start to finish. All the way down to the bathrooms, this is easily one of the most entertaining places to dine in London. 
Sketch was designed by a modern artist. Their are several different ""themed rooms"" you can dine in and like all of London, they operate heavily on reservations. I went for afternoon tea and sat in their most popular room...it's a ""whimsical gallery"" with a whole lot of pink. Their is no detail that goes unnoticed. The wall is covered in quirky art, the acoustics are perfect, pink and rose gold everywhere and the waitstaff dress like they're citizens from the hunger games universe. 
And I almost forgot...The Bathrooms. These are seriously from the future. Left is boys and right is girls but its' all the same room. You basically do your business in a space pod. Also, their are french maids hovering around cleaning up. Pretty immersive if you ask me.
Okay, not to the dining. So it's expensive but you go for the whole experience. Afternoon Tea is 58£ a person. Most other fancy tea places were about 35£+ so it's really not that crazy of a price but know before you go.
What you get: Unlimited tea, sandwiches and sweets. Go hungry but don't eat so much you ruin your day. I was very conscious of doing this since we had sites to see! All of the food is brought out on a beautiful desert tray. Personally, I liked the sandwiches more than the french inspired sweets. The sandwiches are amazing. And of course, the tea is great as well. If you're wanting to add a little extra you can pay a 20£ (ish) extra per person and get champagne added to the experience. They also have cocktails you can order a la carte. 
Overall one of the top three things I did on my recent trip across the pond.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"It might be basic but I loved this place. #noshame
After getting multiple recommendations to go here from my girlfriends and seeing the instagram photos on here....I knew I had to book a reservation to check it out. We went for brunch in the Glade room and it felt really whimsical and Alice-in-Wonderland-y. The couches were a little low but otherwise the room felt open and comfortable. 
I got the 9 Conduit St. black croque which was a croque monsieur on some sort of amazing black bread and the burrata and my boyfriend got the Black Pudding and Pork Belly. All of it was delicious and I thought the prices were reasonable -- but we were cognizant not to order drinks since cocktails were ~€20. I'd definitely come back to try the afternoon tea, though! 
Also, yes, the bathrooms are fun. Check them out and really, you can't take a bad photo in there.",1

Absolutely adore this place.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,We had a lovely afternoon tea here. Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant. The experience was awesome and worth the (incredibly) high price of tea for two. One of the hosts had terrible body odor that wafted through the room and did impact the ambience of the afternoon. All in all it's an experience I would definitely recommend - the tea room is gorgeous and the desserts were out of this world.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Such a fun and quirky place. I made a reservation online for the Glade room so I could eat brunch instead of having high tea in the Parlor room. The place is very Alice and Wonderland and perfect for those people who love Instagram! The food was pretty good, but not great, in my opinion. The bathrooms are the crazy part of it all. Each bathroom ""stall"" looks like a huge ostrich egg. Very cool. Definitely a place to go to for a girls day out.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"The experience lives up to the hype and you'll come away with social media post-worthy pics/videos for a full album. Each room is so quirky and vastly different from another. Be prepared to run into people having full on photo sessions in the open space pod bathroom. 
The hosts were beautifully decked out, as if straight from a photo shoot, and our server was so sweet and helpful. Our entire tea time reservation was a well-timed performance, but we were not complaining. Loved the live orchestral quartet playing in the main gallery.
While the food and service were hands down a 5 star service, the food itself was merely 4 stars. Our afternoon tea service offered endless variety of teas, scones, sandwiches, and cakes, but we were honestly too stuffed to even order more! It's a ton of food, which is good considering the price point. The desserts were mostly very good, but the sandwiches themselves were a bit bland. I suppose tea sandwiches are not that exceptional to begin with, but we found them to be just okay.
A very enjoyable experience nonetheless. I'd advise you to dress to impress as pictures will be taken! Now, if only we had run into Wes Anderson and Bill Murray on the way out ...",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Wow the fanciest afternoon tea I probably ever had during Easter weekend. The experience was five stars, the food was awesome, the decor very interesting, the bathrooms extremely different, and overall had a bloody amazing time!",1

Decadence, thy name is Sketch. This place is pop art, at a Mad Hatter's Tea Party in a wonderland of All The Whimsy. There are servers in silk dresses, maids in French outfits, tea masters, and a caviar man in a pink suit from the set of Great Expectations. 
Decor: We sat in the gallery; gold, pink, plush everything. The 'great room' of the establishment, with a bar of gilded gold, rose gold copper countertops and backsplash. Pink velour and leather seats. The gallery's perimeter walls are lined with whimsical and random black and white sketches. There is a trio,  or quintet (who counted?) playing Satie, and vaguely familiar music from car commercials and films. The parlour next door is another room from Alice in Wonderland. The walls are trees papier machéd in layers so that you are staring at dimensional paper woodlands.
Food: First, who knew tea sommeliers (masters) were a thing? We each selected a tea for our palates. The moods at the table were: Rose, Oolong and Green-all delightful. The dude from Great Expectations gave the condensed biography of our caviar: Russian sturgeon raised in Italy. These were ceremoniously served in mother of pearl spoons before the tea complements arrived in three tiered splendour. Then the tea cakes, scones, and sandwiches came in waves: chicken, salmon, tomato confit, duck eggs, cherry, pistachio and sponge. There was joy and also apricot cheesecake.
Tea accoutrements, the honey, sugar and such, came with clever witticisms marked on the pottery. 
Service: Their attention to detail is demonstrably excellent. The only downside to dining was the 30 minute wait before our orders were taken. And yet. Five stars. We filled the time with ogling the egg pod shaped futuristic toilets. Reading the randomness in the sketches. People watching the cross-section of society that came to experience the glory that is Sketch. This was transformative and immersive dining. Would do again, 11 out of 10.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"So going to sketch was on the top of my 'to do' lists. I wasn't sure what our schedule was so I kind of forgot about making a reservation. I arrive in London and tried to set one up online. Only availability was the following week. :( 
I went to Sketch without a reservation and had cream tea in the parlor.  I asked our waitress about reservations and she checked with the hostess.  They had one reservation available for the following day.
The pink room was pretty amazing.  The egg pod bathrooms are very instagrammable. My daughter got the kids tea set and husband and I both had the bubbly set.  It was such a fun experience. My three year old loved it.
Thank you to our waitress in the parlor room for checking and to the hostess who was so sweet to my daughter.  Two thumbs up!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Are you serious?  Go for Instagram. Then find a real restaurant to eat at.  This place has to be the worst!  Overpriced and filled with a bunch of wanna be social media influencers. 
I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.
Priced like fine dinning but really just a bad photo opportunity.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"One of the only things I wanted to do was have afternoon tea. My amazing husband did all the research and made reservations here. The decor is very a mix of classy and whimsy. There were all these interesting sketches on the wall with plush pink couches for us to sit on. Also, you need to visit the bathroom. We actually didn't know about it prior but definitely a visit is a must. 
FYI, you have a two hour limit. We were there a bit over an hour. The service was very on par given that it is a Michelin star restaurant. You have unlimited tea - you try everything if you want. Our favorite was the caviar, egg, scones, and mini sandwiches. The dessert was okay. You will be full. It is a bit pricey. It was our second most expensive dining experience of our 8 day London trip.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The sandwiches - amaze balls. The tea keeps coming. The champagne was on point. The desserts were great and the best thing is, is that you can just keep it coming! Make sure you have reservations!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Yes, bring your Instagram filters and a full bladder, but this place fell flat for me.  Full disclosure: I don't fully understand the concept of afternoon tea, but I just didn't feel like I got my money's worth.
There are DOZENS of employees milling about the place, but service was lacking.  We waited a long time for our actual tea, and the cocktail that was ordered.  And everything else for that matter.  This seems odd since there are, literally, no choices to be made (except for tea).  At some point, we should have received a gratis round of champagne.
Also, I requested a cocktail and was notified that only the four or so listed on the menu were available (because there wasn't a bartender available).
They had a trio of strings playing music, which was great.  Tea selection was amazing and they let you know that you can try different ones throughout the meal, but we were only able to try two each.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"A fun and cute place to visit but not a place to have a nice afternoon tea. 
Except the curry chicken sandwich, everything is mediocre. It is a must go for tourist but I guess definitely not where the locals would go.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Had some really cool cocktails, loved the ambience and decor, and we're impressed by how friendly the staff are. Highly recommended!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"This place was top on my to try list in London. Unfortunately I did not have a reservation for the gallery room but they do take walk ins at the parlor room. I would recommend doing that if you don't have a reservation, want a cheaper meal but still want to try out sketch, and if you want to see the bathrooms (opens after 12).
I had the poached eggs with asparagus cream and the 3 mini desserts with a pot of tea. The eggs were okay...kind of bland. The desserts were very tasty and if I were to do it again, I would come only for desserts and tea (10£) and eat lunch elsewhere.
Service was so attentive, despite the fact that some guests near me were so rude and entitled to the staff. The guest next to me even took off her shoes and stood on the chairs to take a photo...not what I expected in the middle of a nice restaurant.
Overall, I really think it is worth trying out but the food is overpriced and not that great.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Went to Sketch for the first time and did brunch. The meal and cocktail were expensive but I would say worth it just for the experience. The inside of the restaurant is unlike anything i've ever seen. Service was a little slow but I didn't mind because my friend any I were enjoying ourselves in the unusual setting. 
Definitely add this to your restaurant list for London.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I made a reservation online...or so I thought. They didn't have me when I arrived but the gentleman at reception helped me immediately and found me a spot for tea without issue. I'm sure this is not always possible given popularity but since I was solo,  it was greatly appreciated. The presentation is amazing , the rose tea was my favorite , as an American first timing having boiled quail egg and soldiers (toast). Taste was perfect. Atmosphere was  decadent with trio of strings playing while eating.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Not just dessert or brunch or tea or dinner... the list goes on... it's an experience!  Hop scotch your way into one of the dining rooms to enjoy an array of ambiances!  Ensure that you at least wash your hands to experience the bathroom bar and egg pods that are the toilets... it is as-if Alice and Wonderland invented space travel and became an infusion restaurant for a truly unique and memorable (night I add delicious) experience,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I had brunch here with my girlfriend in the Glade room. The first thing that strikes you is the atmosphere -- it sort of feels like you're in some kind of Alice in Wonderland movie with a sort of wild regal air. 
I ordered the traditional risotto with parmesan, creamed spinach, and a cocktail. Unfortunately I forget the name of the cocktail but it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. However, it was also one of the most expensive ones too, around 20 USD for a single cocktail. 
The risotto and the creamed spinach were amazing. The risotto's texture was perfect with the rice having just a little bit of bite and the richness was surprising; the dish was rather small but I was completely full afterwards. The creamed spinach was buttery smooth and delicious and lended a really good complement to the risotto.
Delicious food with a unique atmosphere but a pretty hefty price.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I had a late reservation on a Sunday and was a bit turned off by the front staff who was rushing me to my table. I couldn't even check my coat it. 
I ordered the traditional fish and chips, it was well presented and perfectly cooked. Also ordered the Charcuterie which is a meat platter with mustard ice cream. I know it sounds awful but it complemented the meats.  
The ambiance was very friendly and upbeat in the pink room.  It's definitely not a place I would go to on a weekly basis but for a special occasion absolutely.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"The atmosphere of Sketch is really breathtaking. My first initial thought when I walked into Sketch was: Wow, this place is huge! There are three rooms from what I saw when I walked into the doors: them being, the Gallery, The Parlour, and The Glade. The Gallery is where you can order à la Carte, desserts, and its famous afternoon tea sets. The Parlour and The Glade are where breakfast and brunch are served. Even though Sketch is famous for its afternoon tea, I actually did not reserve seats to try the afternoon tea, but to try their brunch. Surprisingly, it was really tasty. 
When my friend and I looked at the menu, there were so many options and we wanted to try all of them because they all sound so good; however, of course we did not do so. We ended up ordering two main plates and one dessert: fish pie nîmoise (£17.00), grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce (£21.00), and a victoria sponge cake (£6.00). The fish in the fish pie nîmoise was salmon and I thought the texture was kind of funny and interesting, but the dish was delicious! The salmon of the grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce dish was super juicy and well cooked. The dish I actually loved the most out of the three is actually the victoria sponge cake. It has raspberry jam and a few raspberries on the top of the sponge cake and a vanilla chantilly layer in between the sponge cakes. When I bit into it, I did not know what to expect because I was not too fond of raspberries. However, after trying that dessert, I immediately change my opinion on raspberries and I quite like them now. 
A downside of this restaurant is the service. Even though there were a lot of servers, we still had a hard time calling for them and had to do it a couple of times before they would come and take our order. However, the food came quickly, which makes the wait more bearable. 
Some may think that Sketch is too overpriced, but to me, I think these prices are inexpensive for the magnificent quality of food the restaurant serves.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I love this place so much - not because of the food, which is actually quite good, but because the wildly varying degrees of decor in the entire place just tickle my fancy so much. There's the main tea parlor, enrobed in rose petal pink, whose chairs look like ladyfingers and where you feel positively doted upon by all the servers. While you wait for your seat, you might have a drink at the spherical bar in the back, where seating goes around the perimeter and the ceiling is decorated with unconventional drawings. Their cocktails are good and not overly strong. The famous space-age egg bathrooms are above, and when you use one, a recording of a 1940s pilot speaking on the radio crackles through hidden speakers. Then you have the Glade, personally my favorite room, decorated like a woodland fairytale as if straight out of a Lorrain landscape. And upstairs, you find the trippy disco bathrooms that fascinate me even more than the egg bathrooms - a small, dark room filled with flashing, twinkling, revolving lights, accompanied with similarly twinkling music, that make you feel like you just walked into an acid trip. No matter what room you're in, you can be sure it'll be thoroughly decorated and every detail thought of.
You might think all the excess in decor is there to mask subpar food, but the thing is, afternoon tea more than holds its own here. For two people, you get a large three-tiered stand filled with delicate tea sandwiches of different flavors and several desserts as well. Is it the best food you've ever had? Resounding no, but it's still much better than you might expect for such an outwardly flashy place. When you finally stagger out, stuffed more than you thought possible from just a couple of tiny sandwiches and and tea, you'll come away with the sense of having had an experience you won't really find anywhere else.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Ya so it's p basic (some might argue gimmicky?), but I still loved it here. The decor is unlike that of any other restaurant I've been to. With the music and the lights, you feel as though you've been transported to some alternate universe. (Yes, also the bathroom pods etc. etc. - these weren't THAT stand-out to me, but I would be lying if I said I didn't take many photos...) It was such a fun experience.
My friend and I sat at the bar in the pink room and ordered drinks and apps. The food was whimsical, just as you would imagine. We had charcuterie with mustard ""ice cream"" (ice cream consistency but mustard flavor), burrata in some sort of bright pink sauce, and a delicious cauliflower dish, which was my favorite. The cocktails were beautiful and so, so delicious. 
It's pricey, but you pay for the great food/drink and the ambience. Can't wait to return!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I was invited to celebrate my anniversary in the main room. Decor and service were really super! It's expensive but worth the experience. Tables are far from eachother which gives that special deluxe feeling, most waiters were either French or Italian which gave it that high level feeling you expect from a Michelin awarded restaurant.
Top!",1

Each room has a different theme. If you go during the Royal Chelsea Flower Show timeframe, there will be flower draping in the most beautiful way. They change the decor of the front parlor every couple of months and I love it. It gives you something to look forward to and I really appreciate the happy memories I've had in each of the rooms.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"The Michelin-rated sketch has a great afternoon tea option, but the bill will be hefty.  3.5 stars.

// SERVICE // Slow but courteous. The host was very professional and welcoming.

     + Tea: aromatic, I leaned towards the very floral or fruity teas. They are more than happy to change out the flavor and add more hot water whenever you're ready.  
     + sandwich: refillable, our favorite was the chicken curry. 
     + dessert: unfortunately more pretty to look at then 
It was a good experience, but not sure if it was worth what we paid.

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Before I came to London, I heard about Sketch and their infamous pink room for Afternoon Tea. I made my reservation a couple of weeks in advance and alas the day arrived.
We were greeted about three times by different hostesses before we made our way inside the pink room. 
I saw the pics in advanced so I knew what to expect, however, it was still an exciting experience. I couldn't help but feel a Barbie, Willy Wonka, Alice in Wonderland vibe in the room.
The waiters were attentive, some of whom had sexy French accents. We had the champagne tea option. The food came out promptly, the sandwiches were delicious, and the sponge cake we were offered at the end was to die for! 
Take lots of pics, have a laugh at the drawings on the wall, and most importantly visit the bathroom...even if you don't have to go! Sketch is an unforgettable experience! Make your reservation and enjoy!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Very unique atmosphere.  We counted 4 different bars and a restaurant (could be wrong, we only got drinks in two of them).  Different vibe for each bar, too..interesting.  The drinks we ordered--a grape vodka drink--sounded interesting.  It was $18euro or so, and it tasted like grape soda and a drip or two of alcohol...lame.  We also got the ""pink ponytail"", which was stronger and delicious, however it was $22euro.  I would go there again for the atmosphere to hang out, but we will drink in our hotel before going in there, otherwise I'd be spending $150 to get a buzz.  
Note:  the bathroom ""pods"" are super cool.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Went for afternoon tea and it was really lovely. The ambiance of the room was trendy and alternative. It's a pink room and the walled and plastered with funny sketches :)
The afternoon tea itself was great value for money. The servers were attentive and always asked if we wanted more sandwiches, cakes and tea. The best thing about the experience is the sandwiches... some of the best I have ever had. The cakes are good. 
Would come here again when I can afford it !",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Fancy it is not , good quality it isn't either 
It's quirky and fun but it's also very expensive for what you get. 
We had the special dish which was a flavorless cut of meat with 3 fried onion rings and 3 cherry tomatoes 
The only thing that was decent was the wine and the bread basket at 4.50 
The wine was pricey but oh well you are in a trendy restaurant in a trendy city so get on with the program !!!!
The sides were vegetables and cream of corn purée not good at all none of these 
We passed on dessert 
Service was on and off ; some someliers are just too full of themselves but our waiter was amazing and the assistant somelier was pretty cool too",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"It had been two years or so since I visited Sketch and once again it was completely different. This time with dusty pink interior, I got the feeling like I was stuck in the 1960's- all I needed now was big hair and a classic pin-up dress to match.
Opening the menu, I was startled to see paper cutlery pop up, which was pretty cool! As a consumer, I felt like I was gaining an experience rather than just having dinner, I like that it has a museum feel rather that a restaurant.
To begin, I had thinly sliced tuna with Avocado, which was absolutely divine! By now, you should know that I am in love with Sashimi! This was accompanied by a glass of white wine- Pinot to be precise, although I did move onto cocktails in the latter, which is always a bad idea. (Bouji Tip: Never mix cocktails and fish based dishes!) British designer David Shirley designed the plates and his artwork can be seen throughout the restaurant- classic, monochrome, but childlike which is a great conversation starter.
For dessert, I chose Malabar, which has to be the best dessert that I have tried in a long while. I will definitely be back solely to have dessert and cocktails as this was just what my taste buds required; Lemon foam, bubble gum ice-cream, Panna cotta, Orange blossom and strawberry marshmallows. I felt like a little child again 
Oh and you must visit the toilets, which was the highlight of my night! Although that sounds rather weird, which it was, but the toilets are designed into alien egg spaceship capsules. Once inside, something strange happens, you can hear the sound of birds tweeting as you pee. How thoughtful of Sketch!
I never noticed at the beginning but there is actually hopscotch on the floor at the entrance of Sketch. I don't know what possessed me but I actually attempted to hopscotch on the way out! Live a little. Carpe Diem!
Price: £££",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"The place is cute, and they have 3 violinists playing, so it seems magical. But the food was literally disgusting. Who cant even make a decent scone? Its expensive, but I basically paid to take a cute instagram in their pink room, aka the ""Gallery.""  Its a place people go to take an instagram. The service was ill informed about the food, they did not explain anything to us for a 78 per person closed menu. I swear, every dessert was dry, bland or the wrong texture. The sandwiches were just not good, even their chicken salad sandwich had a massive lump of chicken fat. Also I had to pay 4.5 pounds for a bottle of still water BUT they fill your cup up a bit with it and take it back so its more like a third of the bottle, but you still pay.
1 star for gorgeous decor

Our waitress and everyone who worked there were very nice and helpful. 
Once we stopped gawking at the cuteness of literally everything, we ordered our tea and champagne. Again, we were not disappointed. The pastries and biscuits were lovely.
I definitely recommend this place and will be visiting again on my next trip! 
Oh... and don't miss the bathrooms!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"My second afternoon tea in London and it was perfect and more than good!
I was a bit worried about this place at first but I was disappointed at all. In fact, I'm always careful about all these trendy places where, sometimes, it's trendy, it could be nice but the food is not good. I wanted to try it, because I knew the restaurant was a two starred Michelin and was directed by Pierre Gagnaire.
The place itself is so funny and full of surprise: all the rooms are totally different and funny. The main room for the afternoon tea is pink everywhere! We tried to find a name for that style but we didn't success! No loud music and the atmosphere is pretty calm.
The service was great, even if we experienced one bad thing: our waitress was really nice, friendly and always wait to let me the time to translate for my parents who can't speak English. She took our order and a careful notice about my sister's allergy to mustard. But, the issue is, the kitchen staff made a mistake and some of the finger sandwiches contained mustard (fortunately, my sister just had one and it's not a too big allergy...) The waitress came to apologize as well as the manager and they did all their best to make our experience incredible (we almost forgot about this small thing :) )
The food was PERFECT! Everything was good, delicious and amazing from the finger sandwiches to the different cakes served. It's expensive but, the food worth the price.
I recommended this place for a nice, perfect but not too fancy afternoon tea experience!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I love Sketch. If I could go back every month, I would. But alas, I live in New York and we don't have a Sketch.
Is it a wee bit overblown re its reputation? Probably. But I think the hype is well-deserved. You walk in and the hostesses at the front (who, by the way, are designated for that area) greet you and walk you to the next point after you give your name on the reservation (MAKE A RESERVATION). The next group of hostesses/host then lead you to your table in this giant pink, modern, artsy, chic room. There are giant pink couches and hilarious white/black prints all over the walls. You get seated and a new set of waiters come to take your order.
It's obviously a set menu for high tea, but you can add champagne options (which we did). The food and tea are refillable - we definitely overdid it on the refills, but HEY, it's vacation. Where do I even begin? The sandwiches are delicious and the various different kinds are great for a diverse palette. The desserts are also not too sweet and everything just looks amazing to accompany the great tastes. 
When you're there, don't be ashamed of taking a million and one pictures of the food, the decor, and the people you're with. 
Take a selfie in the strange pod-rainbow bathroom - everyone else is doing it, too. Even if nobody else does it, you do you and you take that picture!

I have to say the decor of the gallery i reaaally liked.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Sketch creates an enchanting visual to lose oneself in; the dining experience here is all about the esthetics. A chalk-drawn hopscotch at the entrance announces the restaurant's whimsy; you're not only here to eat, you're here to have an eye-gasm. Ascend the white staircase & feast your eyes on egg-shaped pods & colorful ceiling aka their co-ed bathrooms. One dining room -- a forest of teals & greens; another room -- pale pink & gold & ultra femme. 
Apart from the adornments, Sketch offers very little in the way of an exquisite dinner. His sirloin was tough & flavorless. This isn't the place for a quality steak. As for my cheese plate, there were interesting bits & bobs such as a creamy brie & an accompanying green apple gel, but nothing screamed unique or amazing -- sadly, a stark difference to how Sketch's surroundings made me feel. 
My advice to those curious & intrigued -- indulge in every online pic you can find of the restaurant, immerse yourself in the fun, artistic details...& then spend your pounds wisely by having dinner elsewhere. Entertaining decor impresses me, but a great meal impresses me much more.",-1

So we went over and they were kind enough to let us in without a reservation. We had a really nice time in their stunning bar. Everyone was wonderful, the cocktails were amazing, and the atmosphere was so cool and chill. Can't wait to visit again when we're back in London next year! Maybe we'll be able to experience their afternoon tea!",1

Sketch gallery is the dinning room of a michellin restaurant placed between two different themed rooms for drinks.
The gallery rooms itself is a piece of art, full of David Shrigley artistic touches.

Having a 3 course dinner, I would say that food didn't meet my expectations. 
I would expect much more  from a 2 Michelin stars restaurant, especially when it is so overpriced.
Regarding service, everything was fine.

They also did a fire alarm drill during our visit (at about 5:40pm). This lasted a decent amount of time as well.
Overall an unpleasant experience. Took a £15 cab ride to get here also.
The mango tart was really good though. I gave it an extra star for that alone.
The tea was okay - nothing spectacular in my opinion.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Food was good. Tea was good. The problem lies with the presentation of it all and the service. We opted for the champagne afternoon tea which came out to 108 USD per person with no additional add-ons. For this price, we would've expected impeccable service especially considering this is afternoon tea. The service was fine, but again, nothing for the price. We had to ask multiple times for more water, more tea, etc. and were never offered it, but always had to ask. Finally, the last ""course"" of the tea was a slice of cake, which our waitress first asked if we would like to split one piece -- a strange thing to ask when we are paying so much for the afternoon. Finally, it felt as though we were rushed out of the table. Again, afternoon tea is meant to be drawn out and to not feel rushed in the slightest, but before we were even done with our cake, without asking if we would like anymore tea or anything else, the check was brought.  We didn't feel as though we ourselves were eating or drinking quickly, and we actually tried to take our time, but they had us in and out in under two hours. At the end of the day, the value was poor and the service not up to the standard one would expect. I would not recommend.",-1

Came here 2 years ago to what was the best tea experience in London, beyond the ambiance, the food was amazing (we got seconds of everything) and the tea selection was great. This time however we were left feeling scammed.
They've changed the menu for the worse. The tea selection seems not as special, just your run of the mill teas you can find anywhere rather than the rare & exotic flavors from our first time. The desserts were inedible, the only one eaten was the blueberry cheesecake, otherwise they were all artificially sweet with ZERO texture to them. Even the macaroon, shabbily stuffed with runny icing was left untouched. Overall everything had either a bland or too sweet taste. Even the poor Victoria sponge was dry, it made me wonder if they've hired a kitchen full of first time chefs. 
I would suggest saving your money for a nicer (and undoubtably cheaper) experience at literally ANY other tea salon in London.",-1

Outstanding service, the design is impeccable and the food was delicious. 
I'll never come to London without going to sketch.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Came here one day while on holiday from the states. One of my highlights of my trip, truly. Prices are definitely not the cheapest in town but the experience was excellent. The place was decorated in a very unique and oddly cute way. There were multiple rooms but we dined in the pink one. All the dishes and flat ware were equally adorable. We had afternoon tea which was about 59£ each (minus alcohol). The food was excellent. We didn't know that we could get free refills on sandwiches, pastries or teas, which was a bummer. The tea selection was amazing. We had the mint and the red dragon, both excellent. Although it is a bit pricey, I would recommend and go here again. Experience and food are an A+ in my book! Also, the restroom are super adorable and again, oddly cute. Definitely an experience you'll need to try if you're in London !",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I've eaten dinner in The Gallery several times and always enjoyed it - the food is delicious and the whole atmosphere is very tongue-in-cheek.  The champagne coupes are larger than your face, the plates have cheeky labels, and the bathrooms are a surreal experience.
Put on something funky and prepare yourself for an unexpected twist on fine dining.  And make sure to visit the secret cocktail bar tucked below the restrooms for a nightcap.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Meh...unless you're a devoted Instagrammer/Snapchatter/design obsessive (or you happen to live in or spend tons of time in London and money is no object) I can think of many better places in London for afternoon tea.  In fact my favorite parts of the experience were the bathrooms (I had no idea so they blew my mind) and the floors...requested a nut free dessert and was punished with an inedible array of mystery gels and fruit leather.  And I'm not kidding about inedible, even my vegan daughter couldn't eat them.  The sandwiches and scones were fine but I've had better.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,I booked the sketch Afternoon Tea about 20 days before the experience and had a great time there. Soooooo gorgeous surroundings and the food was also very delicious. The  service  was  good  and  you  can  ask  them  to refill  if  you finish your  sandwiches  or  scones and  wanted  more，as well as the cakes from the trolley. There was also live music played by the musicians. It is a great place for girls to take pictures and have reunions. I would definitely go there again and recommend it to my friends.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This place is worth visiting just for the interior design, let alone the food. As an art lover I really wanted to see the layout of this place, and I was so pleased! We didn't come here for afternoon tea but I definitely would if I ever go back to London. We had no reservations but we're still seated for breakfast immediately. We came back late at night for drinks too, and they make amazing cocktails.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This was such a fun experience! My sister and I did the full tea service here during our first trip to London. The tea room is so cute - everything is pink- and the art lining the walls is quirky and sometimes hilarious. There was a group playing live classical music while we were there, which only added to the elegant experience. The servers were very attentive (always ready to refill your tea or bring more food) and friendly. There were so many delicious sandwiches and desserts and teas to choose from! It was really a magical time and I hope to return one day - even if it's just to see those crazy bathrooms again!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,This place has an amazing breathtaking ambiance. I hear the decor is curated by various designers/artists whom switch out and rotate after a few years. I'm in AWE!  And the food is to die for!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Snack/Tea:  My wife and I tried many of their different snacks.  None of them stood out.  I had their black tea, which had a nice hint of orange to it.
Snack/Tea rating:  3.5/5
Service:  Service here was decent
Service rating:  3.5/5
Price:  Expect to pay about 45 euros ($65) per person.
Overall:  This was my very 1st afternoon tea experience.  It was very interesting decor, with good tea, but the snacks were pretty dull that is not cheap.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"My boyfriend and I had brunch here. Unfortunately, our reservation wasn't for the typical pink room or the bathroom that everyone takes pictures in, but regardless the food was amazing. I ordered the granola bowl and my boyfriend got the eggs with parmesan cheese. I definitely loved my boyfriends eggs more! A little pricey but you go for the ambiance/decor of the place.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"My wife and I were visiting London this week and were advised by a friend that we had to have afternoon tea at Sketch. We made a reservation a few days in advance and were not disappointed when we arrived. We were shown to our seats in the basement gallery room and offered a drink, I enjoyed a Matcha Bellini and it was a wonderful way to start the sketch experience!  Our first food offering was a small plate with slices of toast, a small serving of caviar and a ceramic egg with some kind of yummy cheese, my wife did not want the caviar and instead was offered a veggie version.  Next we were brought a 3 tiered tray of yummies, one tier of lovely finger sandwiches and 2 tiers of sweets, they were all quite delicious! They give you the option to order extra helpings of the food but be careful because there is plenty more to come! Next we were offered a choice of scones, with or without raisons, these were accompanied with wonderful clotted cream and 3 choices of jam. After the scones were were offered Victorian Sponge cake and Banana Toffee cake, the sponge cake was the winner as far as I was concerned.    We enjoyed 4 or 5 pots of different tea and they were all very nice. Overall it was a wonderful experience, the ambiance was very nice, the servers were very friendly and helpful. As wonderful as it was I would say it was a bit of a novelty, something that would be nice to do once a year or so. Be prepared to pay for the experience, this was not an inexpensive meal but to do it every once in a while it is well worth it. After a few pots of tea you will of course have to visit the toilet which are quite memorable at Sketch, they look like giant eggs or pods, I called them Disco Poo Pods for obvious reason, well obvious to me anyway. All I can say is that Mork from Ork would feel at home sitting on one of the poo pod thrones!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"It is most beautiful to visit, but I did not find the food that amazing.
I had the lobster bisque served on a bed of black basmati rice.  I was not a fan of black rice, and found it very liquidy, than a great broth.
The veal promised, lemon and capers, and it arrived deep fried and dry, sparse capers, and a lemon curd.  It was very disappointing and I left it behind.
They charge you to order bread $4.50 pounds,  really?
And the hostess kept pushing cocktails on me, even after I told her I was not drinking, she came back with a wine menu just in case I changed my mind.
The Yelp reviews rarely mention the food, and now I know why.,",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Absolutely divine! This place has an all green room sprinkled with fur and deep purple accents that allow you to imagine an Alice in Wonderland experience. Adjacent to the green room is the all pink room with suede pink furniture and David Shrigley artwork circling the space. Sketch offers breathtaking space, from their two main bars, to the mini bar in the bathroom, to the bathroom itself, and even the coat check.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I remember the hype when Sketch first opened, and it speaks for the place that it is still just as special and buzzing more than ten years later.  If anything it has got better, each room has a special feel to it which is enhanced by Sketch's well thought through strategy of using art and music.  And while the pods are no longer a secret, a trip to the Sketch bathroom is an experience in its own right.
I didn't stay long enough to sample any food on my last visit, just sipping a bespoke cocktail at a private function on this occasion.  Mind you, the sheer number of reviews here and the consistent high rating speak for themselves.  Sketch is no longer a mere sketch but an Old Master at making a visit to a restaurant an experience to remember.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Seems like Sketch is one of those places where everyone is in town for the first time has to go to, at least for a picture of their infamous toilets. Long story short: it's a beautifully designed place indeed, with really average food and cocktails, and service is a hit and miss. In two words I would say: overrated and overpriced. Would definitely not come back.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Easily one of the most unique and fun spaces I've been to. Incredibly kind and hospitable service, which was a little unexpected for such a trendy place. The environment is just delightful - pictures cannot capture how beautiful and weird the dining rooms, bars and bathrooms are. Worth your while to check out in London. 
I came here for dinner (unfortunately missed the uber Instagram-friendly high tea) and had a lovely time. We had a delicious drink at the bar before moving into the pink dining room, and the service was absolutely fantastic - the bartenders were friendly, accommodating and knowledgable. 
Dinner was also very nice, though the service was not quite as on point as at the bar (likely because they were very busy). The food is good - not mind blowing - but fun and quirky, like the ambiance. My favourite was the Tchouki dessert, which was fluffy, lemony, marshmallowy, bubble gummy, ice creamy... super hard to describe, but totally one of a kind.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This is such a fun place to go to! It's quite expensive, so I consider it a place to go to for a special occasion. The atmosphere is just amazing, the furniture and lighting is just so cool and the service is impeccable. The food was all delicious and so inventive. We ordered the duck and it was the perfect plate to share with my date! They first cut out one part of the duck and with the rest they make a paté. Everything was spot on and it is totally worth it going.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This was definitely a decadent experience. But I knew that I wanted a splurge on my visit to London for mine and my friend's birthdays. I managed to snag a last minute reservation in the pink room.
The decor, in all pink, plush, and gold, made the experience unique and whimsical. The staff were all polite and friendly. Once we were seated, we were greeted by the Champagne Popper [yes a person who's sole role was to pop open bottles of champagne!] who sold us on ordering their Rose. His recommendation was solid and we enjoyed it [despite the price tag on just the one glass]. 
Then we had the caviar guy come over in his full pink velvet suit with a top hat! And after him, our tea master came over to introduce herself and offer recommendations and answer any tea related questions. Finally our finger sandwiches came out and we put in our orders of teas.
I tried several different pots of teas and I became full despite barely touching the sandwiches and cakes. And of course, took several trips to the restroom to experience the pods! 
Overall, the entire time at the Sketch was an experience from beginning to end. 
They also had a trio of violinists playing as we had our meal!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"It was fun to explore the menus at the three different places decorated in different ways at Sketch. We had brunch, afternoon tea and a late night drink 2 days in a row. The food was pretty tasty. But what impressed me the most was the bathroom with the most creative design. This place should be a must for whoever in town.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,If zero stars was possible I would put it. The portions are extremely small and the food is deplorable. The fairy forest just looks like the rain forest cafe not to be rude but I wouldn't recommend.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Really enjoyed the ambience of this place. The bathrooms are great, high tea is an experience, and the food is actually pretty tasty. Definitely go at least once to make your London experience complete.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"We went on a Thursday night and had a table for 2. To be honest, the food was OK. I expected it to be better according to the value for money. of course it is known for the interior and I totally understand why it is not known for the food. Overall we had a pleasant night but the food just didn't fulfill our expectations.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This place is super trendy. The reason people are attracted to this restaurant is the inner decor. I came with my friend on the first night and was curious about modern European food. We we're seated by the bar, and they didn't care about our dress code that much, of course, try to dress nice to fit in. Plastered in square ""sketches"" all over their pink, very dim room with lounge-esque tables and chairs and a bar (we sat at the bar) It's a lot to take in. We tried to read as much of the sketches/cartoons as possible. People literally come for egg pod toilets. Unisex and elevated on another level by the stair case, this place takes a bathroom experience to a whole new futuristic level. The elevated level felt like a nest for these eggs. I had some risotto that was covered in green sauce and mustard ice cream for dessert. All the flavors are dynamic and interesting. Not something you would find anywhere else. For a trial run, I would highly recommend this place, but honestly, the food palette surprised me so much and I didn't love the food. Maybe come for brunch or cocktails at night to take in this places interior designs.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"AMAZING!
This place was beyond. Food was great, drinks were great, vibes were great...everything.
This place has a lot of rooms and somewhat secret rooms that are all decorated so nicely, all have bars. The bathroom is where everyone takes pictures because its so futuristic. Will be coming back to London to grab afternoon tea at Sketch!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"UM yes go here! 
Good food, drinks, service and man the ambiance is just too cool! 
Rooms I saw with my own eyes:
- gallery (big pink room) 
- glade (really cute fairytale-esk room) 
My friend and I ate in the gallery, it was so pink! But we loved it! Everyone we encountered at Sketch provided exception service and they must have a great hiring process because these people seemed genuinely nice too! 
The food, as I write this, I'm debating if I have time to go back for another meal during my short 4 day trip to London. Yes that good.  I highly recommend the veal and the cauliflower gratin and of course for dessert the sketch chocolat. 
As for cocktails just ask them to choose one they're all good!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"If you are going for unique and very quirky...Sketch is your place. You are greeted by hop skotch when you enter and some very different and entertaining art in the parlour to the right. If you head on straight through you see some of their other themed rooms which are also a sight to see. At the end are the famous egg shaped toilet stalls which make you feel as if you are in some sci-fi or futuristic show.
The desserts in the parlour were pretty good but the food was so so. This wouldn't be high on my list of places to eat in London  but it was fun anyway.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This place is epitome of what an afternoon tea should be.  When you walk in, you are welcomed by lavish curtains, dimmed lighting, and pink walls to set the perfect ambiance to sip tea and converse forever.
On our visit, we had afternoon tea for 2. It comes with layers of assortment of goodies from macarons, chocolates, meringues, and finger sandwiches and much more.  Quail egg finger sandwiches were to die for! Had couple refills, which is complementary along with the tea.  I ordered the blackberry herb tea and the color and taste was just so me, pink! I adored this place!  
This was my last stop during our 6 hour crammed day trip in London and it was one of the best part of the day! Not to mention that my online reservations weren't showing up in their system... I was literally about to have a fit if we weren't able to experience it. Luckily one of the host sat us, during the reservation chaos while the other host was asking me to scrimmage through my email to find the confirmation on my almost battery drained, dying phone with bad data connection. 
For this I couldn't give this place 5 stars.  Some staff were a bit too snobbish for their own good, including our server...  Lighten up, maybe they need a tea break as well.  
Do visit the bathroom during your visit.  It's pretty fascinating and bizzard that people are taking pictures in front of the bathroom.  Guilty of taking pics as well, bathroom is pretty unique with their individual white egg pods that simulate wilderness sounds that reminds you of being in jurassic park museum before things went sour.  But in the end, it's a fancy porter potty!
Oh, and be ready to cough up some $$~
Wasn't friendly on your wallet, but will always remember this visit! Who knows when we'll ever go back to London.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"I went here for high tea with some friends. It took us 40 minutes to get someone to just give us water. It took another 30 minutes to place our tea order. In short the service was abysmal! I was so disappointed and so were my friends. The scones were not warm and they forgot to give them to us- and we had to remind them. 
I will not be returning, and I have heard from others they have had the same experience.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Incredibly overpriced for the food they deliver.
The drinks were good and the service was excellent. But the portions were small and there was nothing imaginative or especially high quality about the food that would support the price point. On the way home I eyed a Nandos and seriously considered going.  Hoping they fix the food OR lower the prices to make this a better experience for diners!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"The service was downright awful. Although the servers were pleasant when they did finally show up, we felt invisible all night.  Including when we had to request the bill 3 times over more than half an hour!  The food was fair, certainly nothing to brag about. We had been a year ago and everything was so much better. The decor and ambiance are still fun, but all in all not worth the cost or aggravation.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Here on a honeymoon trip, our last night in London. We were so excited to see Sketch. We had the best time in London at all of the other top restaurants and bars and expected the same here. 2 hours spent here in total, with about an hour and 15 mins of just waiting. We sit down,l and  no one came or offereds us water for 20 mins. I dont think you realize how long 20 mins is until you just sit there at a restaurant. It also took us 30 mins to get our bill. As in, we looked around for our waitress for a full 30 mins. She could tell we had terrible service our entire meal and did not do anything to try and end our experience on a good note. If you want to eat here, go for it but I'm sure you will not want to come back. Our dinner was at 10:30pm by the way, so not during what would be considered ""dinner rush"" either. If this restaurant wants to keep repeat customers, you need to staff more wait staff to keep the tables turning. They're still basically full with the exception of a couple of tables so you should not have two or three waiters for the whole room. The decor is quite beautiful and you get pretty photos, but we all have Google for that now. Save yourselves $120 (for two people, we skipped apps as we were starving by the time they got us our water and cocktail menus). The quality of your hospitality and service is everything at a restaurant. I'm sure we will be back to London for business and pleasure, and I'm pretty sure we won't be back here.",-1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I was hesitant on the number of stars to give this place because it is very dynamic. ATMOSPHERE: 100%  five stars, every room is like stepping into a parallel universe. I am sure most people have seen the bathrooms on social media, but everything from the coat check to the tea room is instagram worthy. MENU: cute, yummy, but overpriced, 3.5 stars. SERVICE: 2, very nice people but very unorganized. It was not a busy day and we waited forever for just one drink and a macaroon. We were not even sure who our waiter really was because 3 different people approached our table.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"This review is for the Lecture Room at dinnertime with the tasting menu and vegetarian tasting menu: 
I recently visited The Lecture Room with my boyfriend for a nice dinner while on holiday. Making a reservation was easy. I did mine online, got an email confirmation, and then also a phone confirmation the day before. 
Upon arrival, we were greeted outside of Sketch by a very polite gentleman who showed us inside. We asked to have a drink at the bar because we were early for our reservation. I had the Cable Car (I think that's what it was called) and it was delicious. It smelt strange because of the egg, but it was quite tasty and very flavorful. 
After I finished my drink, we went back out into the main hallway and were escorted through a roped off set of stairs up to the restaurant. The door was opened for us and our chairs pushed in at the table. We were seated in the room closest to the street. The chairs were incredibly comfortable and the ambiance was nice. It was quiet and nobody was ever very loud. I did feel like I had to speak more softly than normal, despite the distance across from my boyfriend being rather wide. 
I ordered the vegetarian tasting menu, while my boyfriend ordered the regular tasting menu. Both had the same amount of courses and the same timing, although mine was about 20-30 pounds cheaper. We were offered champagne but we declined. This was our first ever Michelin experience and we were very excited to start trying the food. 
Each course was mostly timed well. It gave us time to digest in between, although toward the end we were so full it became hard to finish the courses. Rather than go through every course we had, I'll just speak in generalities. 
Before eating, I had expected that this would be one of the most flavorful and best meals of my life.  While the courses were indeed flavorful, none of them blew my mind. I hardly do fine dining, but I can still recognize amazing flavors and great taste. Most of the courses were good, but again, not life changing. My favorites were the asparagus ice cream/soup dish, goat cheese ravioli, strawberry dessert, and chocolate mousse (not sure what all was in it) dessert. My least favorite was the very dry pancake. All in all, I would rate the food about a 7/10 in taste, 8/10 in unique combinations and flavors, and 9/10 in presentation. 
Service-wise, everything was great for the first 2.5 hours. Our waters were always filled (not free water btw), napkins folded when we left the table, doors opened for us on the way to the bathroom, courses explained (sometimes hard to understand the thinker French accents), and chairs pushed in for us. Around the 3 hour mark, our service began to decline. Some of the people who arrived after us and were on the same eating pace as us began getting their courses ahead of us. We waited quite a long time between the last course, the desserts, and the petit fours. 
Also, after we were clearly finished with the final petit fours, we sat around and waited for 30-40 minutes to get our check. That really was the worst part of the evening, as it was nearing midnight and we were ready to leave. It's like everyone just checked out and forgot about us. We were the last to leave in our room, despite having finished our food at the same time as everyone else.  
Service for the first 60% of the dinner: 10/10. Service for the last 40%: 6/10. Should have been amazing the entire time. 
The food was good, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't go again because nothing was very memorable or mind blowing as I had expected. Perhaps my expectations were too high for a Michelin experience, but I just wouldn't spend the money to eat here again. Overall, the experience was great and the food was sufficient.",-1

I've never felt quite so classy and girly in my life and I loved every minute of it! 
~Decor~
While visiting one of my favorite gal pals in London we stopped in at this wondrous spot. All the rooms are decorated in different ways but they all hold their own charm. The main room is this fun pink land with hand sketched art showcasing some occasionally dark humo(u)r.
Sketch is probably most known for their unique bathroom. A clean white room with individual ""pods"" for use, stained glass ceiling panels, and FYI it's co-ed.
~Food~
My only regret is that I couldn't eat more of the finger sandwiches. They were all so good, although a special call out must be made to the *Mozzarella and Pesto Panini* GET IT!
~Tea~
Amazing variety of choices, everything from Green to Herbal to Black. Honestly though I think I only tried one; would love to go back and split many teas among a large group.
~Service~
I'm almost positive everyone who works here is French...I can't prove it but I highly suspect it. Service is amazing and not just that; the uniform for both the men and women is v. classy and makes you feel like you are fine dining.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Really enjoyed Sketch for afternoon tea service. The reservations for the main room were fully booked but there are two other rooms (not quite as fancy but still really nice) that are first come first serve. One is an enchanted garden theme and the other one is a French patisserie. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. All of the food was delicious and they will refill sandwiches or tea you enjoyed. It is a splurge at 45 pounds a person but that is the average price for afternoon tea. Definitely a quirky place for a different experience. PS check out the bathrooms, each stall is a giant egg",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Coming from New York City, this has to be the most disappointing place I found in London. The food is average at best (especially seeing as I paid nearly $50 per entree). Also, when they ""offer"" you bread and olives, SAY NO!!!!!! THEY CHARGE YOU NEARLY $7 FOR EACH! Place is quite awful. Would never recommend to anyone, especially for this kind of price. It also attracts an older, not very trendy crowd, so if you're looking for that definitely do not come here. At lease the bathrooms were cool.",-1

I would say the service was insanely slow though and I had to waive them down several times to get the check or order.  Surprised by that since your paying for the experience and it's not cheap.  The bathrooms were pretty wondrous, check those out!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"***FOR AFTERNOON TEA ONLY***
I had heard of Sketch many times before, primarily for their different designed rooms. So having scheduled to be in London for only 24-hours on my recent trip, I made the effort to book reservations at Sketch for quintessential afternoon tea. I made reservations online approximately three weeks in advanced and easily booked the designated time I had wanted for the Gallery (the pink room). 
Afternoon Tea is preset for person at £36. It includes sandwiches, scones, and desserts, at minimum one piece of each item on the menu for the number of people at the table, and a pot tea of your choice. Any additional cocktails or champagne is outside of the set price.
Don't under estimate the sandwiches and desserts! It's all very filling! The pesto panini is the only warm sandwich on the menu, so it's suggested that you eat it first. Service is oddly quick. The scones are wonderfully crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The earl grey macarons are great too. My favorite sandwiches were the panini and the salmon with cream. If you happen to like more than the rest, you can ask for more! We sure did with the panini sandwiches. 
For anyone booking late in the afternoon, tables have to be returned by 18:00. I had reserved a table for 16:30 and the hour and a half was easily enough time. Beware - there is a cancellation fee if you don't show up! Its just as much as afternoon tea per person(£30)!!!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I absolutely adore this place. When I walked in, I knew that was my type of place. It's super girly, whimsical, funky and well decorated. As an event planner, this is a perfect place to throw a party and a great place for girls get together. 
The bathroom was definitely one of the coolest I have ever seen. I must confess it's the first time I ever took pictures in the bathroom cuz the design is just so unique.

Little confusion over the champagne.  They will send over the ""sommelier""  and you may sit there stumped like why is he here. Here is why he is here. KEEP READING. 
If you are planning on ordering more than one glass of champagne between two people go ahead and get the bottle it's cheaper but they won't tell you this.

It's best to see the price as an art gallery ticket plus high tea. While you're at it, splurge with a champagne! It completes the experience seamlessly.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,This place is breathe taking. I love everything about it's futuristic modern style. Amazing themed rooms and awesome staff. The food was just scrumptious. You will be pleased. A must go if your in London.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Definition of ""Tourist Trap."" I went for high tea. The most redeeming quality is the (theoretical) unlimited tea and the trendy, photo-worthy bathroom. If you've seen a picture, you've had plenty of the experience. The food is subpar and overly sugary. The service is quite slow. Though they say you can order unlimited tea, good luck getting your server's attention when you want more. It's a fascinating gallery, but for high tea in particular, I don't want to pay 70 quid to look at art that a 10 year old could have made while constantly struggling to flag down my server. I would recommend a more classic place for high tea, where you actually get a traditional experience and your money's worth.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"We booked in advance for afternoon tea and I must say I was pretty eager to sit at that beautiful pink room. First time we showed up there hoping for a walk in, ""no could do"": we were offered to take the same tea in another room, but I decided to just place a booking for another time because I needed to inject a good dose of pinkness on my instagram feed. :)
The pink room is as beautiful as you can imagine, a bit darker than I expected but it certainly improves the ambience, as bright lights in restaurants just kill the mood. Crank up your camera's ISO and you'll be fine. :D The service is impeccable; smiling and awfully polite staff as it should be. Soon after being seated I was informed that they were having a ""special"" afternoon tea event  (extra charge). I didn't really understand but didn't complain; I was just looking forward my treat. But I do recommend checking carefully before booking as the surcharge was substantial.
Teas were delicious and you can chose from an interesting selection. The crockery fun and it's available to buy, if you can afford it. :) Usually the weakest part of an afternoon tea for me are the sandwiches, the same boring classics your nan would've put on your lunch box, often dried out bread + meagre fillings. Not here: the offerings are interesting, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I was indeed very happy that they give you refills. The scones were nicely done, warm and the perfect texture; the cakes were more like desserts, not the classic slices you'd get at traditional places (and not the best part, in my opinion) but tasty enough and very well presented. thankfully not a tacky cupcake in sight here. 
In the end we were offered one extra sweet and then finished our teas at leisure. We left satisfied and recommending the experience to our friends. please do pop to the loos at some point, as like everyone here pointed out they're worth having a look.",1

However, they literally looked like they didn't want to be there and acted as if any questions we asked were bothersome.

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"It's taken me a while to write this review (possibly due to the ensuing sugar coma) but I took my uber cool sister to afternoon tea here for her birthday.
I knew from the moment we stepped inside the red-lit entrance hall that I'd picked the perfect place for her - my sis is creative, arty and trendy in that 'I'm-not-even-trying' way, and the woman that greeted us looked like a work of art herself. I actually had to do a double-take as she stood even taller than me, wearing 4-inch platform heels, cropped trousers, statement necklace, bright lips and a completely bald head. I had to stifle an embarrassing gasp as she stepped out of nowhere, almost android-like, and referred to her iPad. I was simultaneously relieved I'd made an effort with my own outfit and excited about seeing the rest of the place after this start.
It didn't let me down - we were seated in the outer garden-themed room by the bar, which was open and airy thanks to the skylight and decorated with leafy vines and greenery. It all felt a little Alice in Wonderland (though without a mad hatter in sight) as we sat on cutely mismatched garden furniture; I took my usual spot next to the bookshelf :)
Tea was delicious - though be warned it's heavily biased to sweet over savoury versus other teas in London. The sandwiches were fine but over quickly and it's two tiers of sweet tooth heaven from then on. The key component to impress me on is always the scones, which arrived separately and were fabulously soft-not-crumbly here and nicely warmed through, with generous amounts of clotted cream (always a must). After that, the third dessert chapter was also delicious, but - and I can't believe I'm saying this - possibly too much?! There's 2 full tiers of little cakes and dessert pots which are all so incredibly sweet that it's difficult for even a seasoned after tea-er like myself to finish everything they offer you, let alone any refills.
The service was attentive and friendly throughout, and I was glad we were seated in the light garden room, particularly when I walked through the larger inner room which had a different feel completely - more cave-like and much dimmer. That walk led me to the now-legendary toilets here, which reminded me of that scene in Godzilla when Matthew Broderick finds the eggs in Madison Square Garden. Only with multi-coloured lights on the ceiling and very bright white 'eggs'. In fact each pod is a toilet cubicle complete with its own sound system - mine seemed to be playing an old radio broadcast whilst my sister's played animal noises. It's a little confusing (still not sure whether there's separate guy/girl pods) but makes going to the loo an adventure in itself!
It all added to the slightly wacky arty vibe that shows they have a sense of humour behind all the serious art on the walls, and meant we were very happy to while away a few hours sipping tea refills, people-watching the very well put together crowd, and trying to find more dessert stomach space. It's a relatively reasonable price tag of £35 for the full package you get, and my fave for a slightly quirky afternoon tea in London. They rotate the artists and room themes too - yet another reason to go back again :)",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The Sketch is an amazing place. 
I was visiting London for the first time and afternoon tea was a must during my visit. I made a reservation online for afternoon tea in the Gallery Room about two weeks prior and there were a lot of openings. When I first arrived, I was greeted promptly by the friendly host.
When you first enter Sketch, you're already in awe because of its decor. Each room has a different set up/theme....even the bathroom! It is gorgeous!
When I first entered the Gallery Room, I was simply amazed. The decor totally sets the tone for afternoon tea with a loved one, friends or family.
Service was beyond my expectations. Our lovely server was super attentive, friendly and helpful. Other members of the staff came by to help and they were all pleasant as well.
The finger sandwiches and desserts that come with afternoon are all delicious! You can get free refills on all of the items, so do ask for more! My favorites were the finger sandwich with quail egg and caviar on top, the strawberry/raspberry cheesecake, early grey macaron, and the chocolate cake. I ordered the Black Currant Hibiscus tea and that was lovely. It was sweet and very flavorful. 
Overall, my experience at Sketch was beyond my expectation. I would definitely come back here again when I am in London. 
Tips:
--Sketch is walkable distance from Piccadilly Circus Underground Station. It's about a 8-10 minute walk.
--Make a reservation. They usually are fully booked o the weekends. 
--You can get free refills on all the sandwiches and desserts that come with your afternoon tea. 
--You can try another tea for no additional charge. 
--There is a 2 hour maximum.",1

I have to say, the food was just above average but the presentation, decor and atmosphere skyrocketed. Several 'themed' rooms to try out. It was a perfect night to a not-so-perfect rainy evening. The White room that has another bar and an endless staircase that takes you to the restroom area...which was an experience all by itself.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Sketch is quirky, it's imaginative, and it's thoroughly fun - both in terms of food and atmosphere. For example, the food ranges from strange dishes to classics to re-inventions of classic dishes with a cheeky addition of something you would never add but sort of works. My club sandwich had beetroot jelly and crayfish in it. Usually I like a club sandwich with chicken, bacon and mayo in it. My tastebuds were shocked but not in an entirely terrible way.
We visited the parlour, which is less formal than the other two eating rooms in Sketch. You can order what you want when you want, unlike the other two rooms which are more suitable for lunch, dinner and afternoon tea. As you walk in, you see a bar with lots of delicious looking and colourful cakes stacked high. Try and avoid that temptation. We couldn't! After my club sandwich I had a chocolate and coffee tart, which was heavier on the coffee side than the chocolate. That disappointed me a bit as I don't think you should ever have less chocolate in your life...
In the room, I was mesmerised by the different types of people. There was a fabulous old lady near us who had come in alone for a martini and cake and was reading a book. I want to be like that in a few years. There were some bloggers taking pics of their cake and cocktails and there were groups of friends. For some reason, there were very few men in the room. Maybe that's because the portions are on the small side or maybe it's because men don't appreciate  the quirkiness - they come to eat, then leave.
If it were for the toilets alone - individual cubicles shaped like eggs where men and women share the same wash basins it would get five solid stars. Six if I could give it six. The cubicles play bird song music, for goodness sake. But it is expensive for small portion sizes, my desert wasn't chocolatey enough and I'm still not convinced they needed to tamper with a classic club sandwich.",1

 The staff is extremely attentative!  They talk you through what is on the menu and make recommendations.  
The downside was mostly the main course.  I ordered he chicken frikasse.  It seemed the the,chicken was undercooked.. Not ideal for chicken.  The texture was interesting as they had added popcorn to the dish.  All in all, it wasn't a great dish. The dessert was very small but tasty.  I tried the hazelnut and praline dessert with brandy sauce.  
The Virgin cocktails were delicious!  
I would expect top notch food for a place like this considering how expensive it is.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"It seems the main reason to visit sketch is for the ambiance, and I love that each room is a work of art. The 'forest room' is a great spot for an evening drink. The Gallery is lovely although they keep it a bit dark for my liking, and the pink sofas are looking a bit tatty and could probably be reupholstered. The bathrooms are definitely the highlight- they are just so unique and gorgeous!
Afternoon tea: £45 per person and the food was delicious- my friend and I especially loved the savory sandwiches and the scones. The tea and food is unlimited, so if you're feeling especially hungry you can ask for more of everything! We definitely requested extras of our favorite sandwiches (grilled cheese, smoked salmon, and coronation chicken) and only felt slightly cheeky doing so. The service at tea was superb. Everyone that works in The Gallery is incredibly nice and helpful and they always made sure we had plenty of food and warm tea. We left feeling very stuffed and content! 
Drinks: I returned another evening for drinks at sketch and was not as impressed as with the tea. We explored each of the rooms until settling on the forest room for some cocktails, where a waiter showed us to a table but then promptly ignored us for quite a while. When we finally flagged down someone to take our orders, they were friendly enough, but took about 20 minutes to bring over the drinks. The cocktails were fine but nothing special. Given that we had popped in for a quick drink before dinner elsewhere, we ended up only having a few minutes to finish our drinks by the time they finally arrived, so it was disappointing to feel rushed. 
In conclusion- I'd recommend sketch when you want to treat yourself to a nice afternoon tea, but would probably skip the cocktail rooms.",1

Came here once for a set menu dinner too which turned out to be too good to be true. Food was strangely just not up to scratch but maybe that was just a one time offence. I forgive you Sketch.

This tea is on the pricey side but worth every pence. It includes unlimited tea and food service within your two hour time frame and you don't have to be embarrassed at all when asking for seconds. As chic and cool the ladies are here, they are very nice and accommodating. They are also very patient. I took pictures of everything and held up service. Yes, I was one of those people but who could blame me? Sketch was meant to be photographed and social media-ed out. Actually, you really have to experience it yourself. Its an amazing place.
We really took our time and enjoyed our tea, sandwiches, and sweets. And when we were done, we walked all around the Gallery to giggle at the very witty sketches. As the British would say, ""Absolutely brilliant.""

Upon our arrival, the receptionist led us to walk through a hall way, passed the giant dinning room then to our tea room. Walking in the tea room,you would feel that you are Alice in wonderland !!! The high tea was lovely with assorted finger sandwiches. The sandwich with quail eggs and caviar was my favorite. I also like the one with sliced asparagus/ cucumber on top. The scones were soft inside and crunchy on the skin. They made a perfect match with jam and clotted cream. The selection of pastries were fantastic.

I walked in charmed by the atmosphere, and my door was opened by one of the employees. To my left, I saw the Alice in Wonderland room and to my right, I found the pink room where I would be having afternoon tea. 
I was underdressed. I'll admit I just landed in Heathrow hours before, and so appearing in jeans and a decent blouse they thought I was a tourist just wondering in. They asked me if I was lost. I was baffled, but found it quite funny. As soon as I relayed that I had a reservation, they brought me to my table of 1. In the background, I heard a duet of violinists playing covers of popular songs. It was beautiful. The food and presentation was also fabulous! You had endless refills of everything except the champagne. Sad, eh?

Pink velvet chairs, that reminded me of packs of sausages, and so comfortable, it feels kind of like an old fashioned ice cream parlour, the walls lined with artwork. Every room in this place is dramatic. You can sit in the pink sausage chairs feeling all jazz age and have cocktails brought to you by charming waiters and waitresses (there's a cocktail bar tucked below the loos, but the egg shaped loo pods filled with trilling birds is a whole other story).

I wouldn't be surprised if this is the most instagrammed room in London - it was absolutely beautiful.
There was so much attention to detail - everything from the menus, to the crockery - even the uniforms for the waitstaff (which I would wear in a heartbeat).
As for cost, it's a little on the steep side, but for the location, and the wow factor of the venue alone - combined with the sheer amount of food, I do believe it's worth it. Not something I'd do every day, but definitely worth popping in for a special occasion.
You get a lot of food - unlimited refills of tea, sandwiches, cakes and scones, the latter being the best part of the gluten free menu.
Even the bathrooms were outstanding (to the point where I was slightly concerned that they were toilets at all, instead of part of the artwork).

I originally intended to have dinner at the Gahban O'Keeffee-designed, two-Michelin-Star rated Lecture Room & Library, menu devised by the renowned Chef Pierre Gagnaire, yet an evening reservation with Dinner by Heston Blumenthal overruled. Nevertheless, I am ecstatic with my decision to have afternoon tea in the ethereal Gallery.
The pastel-pink color scheme and eclectic wall art made for great conversation. The prix-fixe afternoon tea menu featured a nice selection of tea choices, along with assorted finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries. This is an ideal venue to relax and catch up with friends over the course of an afternoon. See below for a more complete review.
Reservations:
Having originally held a booking for dinner in the Lecture Room and Library, we decided an afternoon affair would better suit our schedule; I made a booking for late afternoon tea. 
Décor:
Sketch is located on the lovely Conduit Street. Upon noticing the oversized menu and illuminated red Sketch sign, we made our way inside and walked on a hopscotch board outlined on the floor-- I knew the afternoon would be filled with fun and good food. The soigné hostesses greeted us with exceedingly pleasant vibes and lead us to the Gallery.
Our eyes immediately met the vibrant pastel pink walls and couches. The walls are also covered in art by David Shrigley-- examining each would take quite a while, but I encourage you to look closely and carefully-- some are more interesting and risqué than others. This overall nouveau style created a chic setting for an enjoyable afternoon.
Tea Selections:
There are opportunities to order and sample a variety of teas. As with most afternoon teas, selections include green, black, white, oolong, herbal, and puerh. The teapots and cups feature intriguing thoughts and words.
Finger Sandwiches, Scones, and Pastries:
Some of my favorites include the cucumber and ricotta sandwich, sultana scone with traditional clotted cream or strawberry and fig jam, and chocolate mint cake. By the end of the afternoon, you'll hardly be able to finish the selections, even though the staff will continually bring more of whichever item you desire.
Service:
The staff was pleasant, yet in typical British fashion, maintain an overall hands-off approach, which allowed us to enjoy the afternoon with minimal interruptions.
Summary:
We had a fantastic time enjoying Afternoon Tea at Sketch. From the splendid, unique décor to the delicious selection of finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, Sketch provides an enjoyable afternoon outing. While most likely no longer a secret, you must visit the bathroom or, as they referred to in the UK, the toilet or water closet-- the egg-shaped pods and psychedelic rainbow roof elevate the overall Sketch experience. 
My Recommendation:
Go. While Afternoon Tea at Claridge's is still the ultimate afternoon tea experience in my opinion (see my review on Claridge's London), Sketch offers a great selection of afternoon treats and teas amidst an intriguing atmosphere. I will certainly return for tea in the Gallery; I also hope to return for dinner in the Lecture Room & Library. 4 Stars

For anyone who is not familiar with sarcasm, it's a restaurant with fancy toilets.
Sketch is definitely an experience.  We arrived for...brunch?  I believe it was too late for breakfast so it must have been brunch.  Might have been breakfast.  Gonna just keep talking to myself.
We were seated in an area which was decorated in a very...hipster way.  That's the best way I can describe the design aesthetic that brings us such brilliance as ""Hey, let's put a goat head on a guy in a suit"".  Lighting seemed a bit dim.
My wife and I ordered what was essentially a take on the traditional cooked breakfast (I can't remember what they called it, something fancy).  The food itself was all very good, especially the black pudding and sausage.  The desserts were also quite good.
Speaking of desserts, I am compelled (externally) to mention the eclair my wife got. It was just a simple eclair with a vanilla custard filling. I thought it was good. She was obsessing over it for the remainder of our trip, pining for it like a drug addict.
It's difficult for me to judge the prices and portion sizes since I'm not a local.  Being from the States, I'm used to massive portion sizes and have a general feel for what a meal should cost.
But yes, if you come here you should really check out the toilets.  I've never seen such fancy toilets in my life.  Do people really need that much luxury to poop?
(Just adding this down here to the last word in my review won't be ""poop"", but something else)",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I had very high expectations for afternoon tea here after reading all the Yelp reviews and doing some research online. My expectations were met in terms of food and ambiance, but the inattentive service was enough to ruin the whole experience. 
We were seated immediately at our reservation time and promptly instructed on how the afternoon tea would go. The menu looked delicious and there was an abundance of teas to choose from.
The bad experience started when a food runner brought over our food on a tray and placed it next to our table for our waiter to then place on our table and explain what each item was. Except, the waiter never came...not for at least 15 minutes. Our food was just sitting less than an arms distance away from us unable to be touched. 
The waiter finally came and instructed us to eat the warm cheese sandwich first, but of course the sandwich was no longer warm. Other than that, the sandwiches, pastries, and scones were all soooo good. I only wish I had a bigger stomach to eat more of them.
Had our service been better I would have given this place five stars. The place is freaking gorgeous and the food is beautiful and delicious as well. Of course, you can't forget about the crazy bathrooms. That was an experience in itself.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Came for Christmas high tea with friends, and was so much fun. My first experience with British afternoon tea, so I wasn't sure what exactly to expect. The room was very pink, feminine, and had a mid-century feel, but lovely nonetheless. Christmas time meant there was a group of carolers for entertainment, which was very nice. My favorite tea was the Christmas chai, spicy and sweet. Their hot chocolate is also incredibly rich and delicious. The best part was of course the tower of sweets and snacks. I particularly loved the brie and black truffle and smoked salmon sandwiches, and all the little pastries towards the top. Its a set price for unlimited food/drinks, so its great to just sit, relax, and eat/drink as much as you fancy. Seems like a tourist hot spot given its prominence on Instagram (especially pictures of the rather psychedelic egg-shaped restroom pods), but we all had a great time.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Sketch is in the heart of Mayfair (close to Soho). The interior is whimsical and feels like a chapter out of Alice in Wonderland. For interior design, I give it five stars. 
But, let's talk food. It was just ok and the tea wasn't anything spectacular. They don't keep the tea leaves in the teapot, so you can't make the tea more or less strong. I don't like that. 
The egg salad sandwich was delicious. However, the salmon sandwich was lacking. It was a tiny square with little salmon.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"If you want to go to somewhere unique and unusual, this is the spot! I only saw 3 of the 5 rooms, but each room had so much character & it was visually pleasing. 
I came here for some late night drinks & we were directed to the East Bar. If you're looking for an intimate area, this is the perfect spot. The circular room is small with the bar in the middle & seats around. The drinks are as unique as the room itself. 
The Glade was closed for a private party, but I saw The Gallery & it looked like a great spot for a girls day/night. The Parlour was a 180 degree version of The Gallery with skulls & lounge chairs. The most interesting ""room"" was the restroom. The vibrant restroom had pods that looked like Eve from the movie ""Wall-E."" A restroom break is necessary here to check it out. There were no men in the men's side so my husband showed me the urinal. It will make you feel fancy as odd as that sounds...   
I LOVED exploring this place & its a place you won't forget!! You're guaranteed to find a room fit to your taste.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Completely forgot to yelp about this place! Loved the playful and kid like environment with the hop scotch at the entrance. Definitely Alice in wonderland inspired, which I love! I ordered the chamomile tea and shared one of the platters for tea with desserts and finger sandwiches. I loved everything I ate it's just a bit pricey. Personally I liked the tea better from the Orangery and better price wise as well but I'd recommend either one as a great experience that shouldn't be missed if you are visiting London for the first time.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"The prettiest dump I've ever been to.. The dinner food is absolutely disgusting and expensive. Small portions and bland. I ordered the rack of lambs and received very thinly sliced sandwich meat in Brown gravy with sauteed mushrooms. Never heard of a rack of lamb being served in a bowl. My date ordered the cod, which was simply salty fish. 
They overcharge for water too and serve it likes it's wine, how pretentious. Furthermore, oh the hidden charges! They include some type of surprise tax, in addition they include an automatic donation to some charity of theirs, oh and of course tack on their own gratuity on top of their already over-inflated prices! They really take advantage because like me, most visiting customers are too proud or shy to speak up, and quietly accept the audacity of their greed.
I suppose the tea time experience is why the reviews are high, I'm not sure. But after that dinner experience, I urge you to take your money somewhere else where you can actually get a bang for your buck instead of wasting it on this posh and overly polished giant turd.",-1

Mom: ""Why is there a cat without a part of it's head outside?""
Me: ""I think it's on purpose."" (failing to notice that it's missing the tail or another body part.. sticking out either) 
Mom: ""I don't like this place.""
~ Little did she know.. that she, along with the rest of my family would end up loving this place.
I was looking at a list of the most instagrammed places in London, and at the top of the list was this gorgeous and fully pink room with a rainbow bathroom. I knew I had to go here. 
Sketch is one of those restaurants that you CANNOT miss out on. It's definitely not the cheapest place to go. But it is so quirky and unique you have to go see for yourself. It's a mini art museum with high class food combined together. You seriously just have to wonder what state of mind the artists were in when they created their works. They are so random.
{DECOR}
- The Gallery is the main room for afternoon tea - it's pink. and I mean REALLY PINK. It has chairs that look like they've had eclairs glued onto them and the lovely rainbow bathroom with egg booths. 
- The walls are lined with 200+ ""sketches"" which you'll have a fun time looking at.
{BOOKING} 
- Reservations can be made up to 2 months in advance.
- They do take your CC in case you don't show up (there is a fine)  
{SERVICE}
- The service here is THE BEST. Every time I went to pee (which when you're drinking tea non stop for an hour is a lot) they folded up my napkin and helped me out of my chair. 
- They clear out the table every time they put new food on the table, and they are so so so attentive! You've just got to look over and they will come on right over. 
- They are so incredibly kind. I commented that the bag to take away food was super cute and the manager offered to give me one as well! 
- The envelope to get the bill is made out of SANDPAPER. And while my family was oozing over it the manager laughingly also told us we could keep it.  
{AFTERNOON TEA}
- At £38/person (59USD), we're on the high end here. If you want champagne it's about £10 extra. But this is 100% worth the price. The service, atmosphere and food just blows my mind. 
- FREE REFILLS! - Oh yes, eat as many of those little strawberry tarts and drink as much tea as you want. 
- You can take all your leftover food home! 
- 2 hour maximum time.
- All of the food was so delicious. I was stuffed by the time we left. 
{RECOMMENDED TEAS}
- Jasmine Pearls
- Earl Grey Supreme: Can you ever go wrong with this?
- Ceylon & Rose
- Vanilla Tea",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,I went here with my friend for the tea. I loved this place it had to be the most unique restaurant I've ever been to. The sandwiches are unlimited and if you don't like one they will switch it out for a different one. The tea is also unlimited. The decor is just amazing down to the tea pots and cups. The bathroom was actually my favorite part of the whole restaurant it was really interesting. You get a lot of food you will be stuffed by the time you leave there.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Went for cream tea with a friend, and it was solid. 
For only £10.50, you can get unlimited tea and scones. The tea selection isn't vast but still good -- for one, I got white tea, and it was unique and refreshing. The scones were good as well. If you go for champagne & tea set, you would get sandwiches, etc as well! 
Service was so-so. It started out very good, but then, they took forever to bring us water. It wasn't even busy either, so go figure why that was. Overall, I felt like the staff could have been warmer and friendlier.
Finally, great posh but also hipster ambience. Would be good for any event!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"A group of seven of us are travelling from Canada and stopping over in London for 24 hours. We wanted to visit sketch because we have been long-time Instagram fans and were super excited to partake in their afternoon tea. Since the reservation maximum was 6 people, we booked separately: one group of three, one group of four. I emailed sketch reservations with our reservation information to see if it was possible for us to be seated together. The Reservations Agent replied and provided the following response:
 ""In regards to your enquiry, the maximum table size we accommodate for reservations would be for 6 guests, so unfortunately we are unable to accept any larger groups. As we do not honor multiple table reservations for one party and do not accommodate reservations for more than 6 guests, I have cancelled one of the reservations under your name leaving one booking.""
We were left with one reservation for three people. The Agent did not ask whether I wanted to keep my booking, instead he cancelled it automatically. Very poor customer service. The proper way to handle this would have been to let me know we would not be able to be seated together, and then ask if I wanted to keep my reservation. So frustrating and unimpressive.",-1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The best place for a fun afternoon tea experience that doesn't feel stuffy!
Food: 5/5
We were presented with an assortment of sandwiches, pastries, desserts and scones. Every item tasted fresh and delicious. My favorite were the scones, these were the best I had ever tasted and I still dream and crave them. The small scone size allows for that perfect ratio of crunchy exterior with fluffy inside, paired with the clotted cream and strawberry jam, it was like heaven melting in my mouth. It isn't just for people who love sweets, my husband found the quail egg sandwich to be savory and divine. It was so tasty, he had 6 of them! 
You can also have a champagne pairing, and their sommelier is amazing. She offered excellent pairings and even allowed my husband to taste a variety of champagnes so he could choose one he liked. 
          
Service: 5/5
The staff is extremely attentive. 5 class service. 
Atmosphere: 5/5
The Gallery is indeed very pink, and the drawings on the walls are a bit trippy. It adds to this weird ""Alice in Wonderland"" feel. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and fun. The toilets look like space pods. 
Value: 4/5
At 38 GBP per person, it is on the expensive end. However, most afternoon teas are around 20 GBP and do not include any refills. At Sketch, you can get refills of anything you want as often as you like. When travelling with a hungry man, this was the best decision.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"We went for a romantic pre-valentines meal here last year - it's pretty pricy but a fantastic place for a special occasion. The food was elegant and cooked to perfection - and although they might look like small portions actually the intensity of the flavours and combinations of ""not the norm"" ingredients leave you more than satisfied.  
Beautifully and artistically designed with different themes in the different rooms and the service was top-notch too, attentive and friendly.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Though I never had a full meal here, I usually go for a cocktail or a cup of tea. I have always found the place to be amazing and the service impeccable. That is, until the last time. I went to the restaurant on Feb 17, we got seated immediately, and the drink and the waitress were lovely. When we were presented with our bill, my friend immediately put in the card without looking at the bill. After all, we only had two drinks, what can be wrong. After she paid, I noticed that the restaurant charged us an extra £1 for a charity that nobody told us about or even told us that it would be automatically added to the bill. Don't get me wrong, £1 is not a lot of money, but I would like to be told if a restaurant wants to charge me for something that I did not in fact consent to. When I mentioned that to the waitress, she rudely sniped at me saying that I should have checked the bill before paying it. I find it to be mind-blowing that restaurants can just do that, which in my mind constitutes as stealing. Charity is a voluntarily thing, regardless of the amount of a donation, and not something to be forced on upon customers. 
I love the place, it's interior is stunning, drinks are great. But service and the restaurant policy is sometimes just shocking.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Wild tea shop with some really cool furniture and fancy dishes with a very art chic vibe. Like a modern artists hang out spot.

Vegan menu was awesome and the coffee and juice was phenomenal. 
Very sweet spot.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"I am sorely disappointed. Ambience was quaint, more than liked the presentation, was more than willing to pay the prices on the menu, but to say the food was lackluster is a severe understatement. Came here hungry enough. Ordered the fish and chips and beef and foie gras burger. Every item was so tasteless that even though hungry, combined with the texture, we just couldn't stomach the food and preferred to leave hungry. Can't comment on the cakes as we cancelled our order and just wanted to leave and grab some real food. As my BF said, ""I feel cheated."" 
Kitchen needs a radical change. Until then, skip this place and just head to Pret A Manger, better use of your time and money.
Note: they add a donation onto your check without your consent. It's for a good cause, but their policy is to not ask (I asked them) and to just append it to the bill amongst your food items which is a little strange in my personal experience.",-1

They required each person to order a tea set, so we end up ordering 5 afternoon tea set, which is ""A LOT"" and we could barely finish half of it.  The tea set has no surprise at all, nothing particularly delicious. There is only one thing I like, which is the sparkling grape juice.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The afternoon tea of afternoon teas. I've had my fair share of finger sandwiches, buttery scones, and delicious teas but none compare to the experience I had at sketch. I made a reservation the day-of on a Wednesday, and it was a very easy process online. The only risky part of making a reservation is that if you don't go, you'll be charged the full amount of the tea service per person included in the party. I can understand this, since the turnover time for afternoon tea can be pretty slow. 
The hype over the interior is not un-founded. Coming here is like walking onto the set of a Wes Anderson movie, and the fact that there are no windows really gives the effect that you've stepped down the rabbit hole into another world. There are differently decorated rooms (and a very interesting bathroom!), which will make for cute Instagram photos if that's what you've come here for. But me, I came here for the tea.
Overall, the food was REALLY close to perfect. Everything was so tasty and fresh, and you can really tell that everything was made to order. I believe the price was 30 or 35 pounds per person, or somewhere around that range. It is completely worth it. You may order as many desserts, or sandwiches as your afternoon tea-loving heart wishes, and the waitresses do it speedily with a smile. You can also choose from a wide selection of delicious teas, which I expect nothing less from any place that serves afternoon tea, but nonetheless, the ones our party ordered did not disappoint. 
If you're coming to London, be sure to stop by, if just for looking around. I compare all the afternoon tea places I have experienced to my time at sketch, and I'm sorry to say it, but they all fall short.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Doing afternoon tea is a must in London, so I decided to check out Sketch with a few of my friends, especially after seeing it all over social media, & not to mention pretty decent reviews. 
This place is definitely on the pricey side for afternoon tea, but it's worth because of the unlimited tea and bites for two hours. I personally cannot eat a huge amount in one sitting so I don't know if I would pay extra for all you can eat again, but it is good value for money in general. You can also add champagne to the deal for an extra 10 gbp. Definitely suggest to make reservations online a few days before to secure a spot. 
The ambiance is to DIE for. There are a couple different rooms available for seating but we were placed in the big pink room which basically made all my little girl dreams come true.  That, along with the cute tea sets and the awesomely designed restroom pods all came together to create a really awesome experience. I am giving four stars because the selection of savory bites were a bit off for me and my friends which disrupted the experience a bit, but the delicious desserts made up for it. 
If you're looking for a classic and traditional afternoon tea experience, I wouldn't recommend sketch- but if you're looking for a hip, trendy place to hang then this is definitely the place.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The food was phenomenal and the tea was perfect (though I'm a novice when it comes to tea).
First off, I walked in without a reservation around 3pm on Sunday and it was a 40min wait. I had also tried the Saturday evening and they weren't taking walk ins. I highly recommend calling to make reservations. You must also wait in the building but it was fine b/c there's a cocktail room you can sit and enjoy the decor while you wait.
Once seated, I opted to order off the menu vs the pre-fixed afternoon tea (£45 pp). I was so happy with the food - duck leg and beef roast - it was absolutely incredible. The tea was great as well - I ordered the jasmine. And, finished with chocolate and coffee cake.
The entire place is charming and visually intriguing. You must see the pink room and use the bathroom. The staff was really friendly, BTW.
I was dressed pretty casually with jeans and heals. I was comfortable though a lot of other patrons wore dresses. I'd wear whatever you'd feel comfortable in but dresses and hats wouldn't be out of the norm for tea.

You know that you are in for something special as soon as you arrive at Sketch: you walk up a flight of stairs and enter the tastefully appointed and luxuriously decorated dining room through the double doors. 
Dining in the Lecture room means you embark on a fascinating culinary journey with creative and original kitchen, innovative and refreshing cuisine that always surprises yet never feels artificial. Gagnaire and his team master the fine art of precisely painting complementary flavors and textures into brilliant culinary masterpieces. Furthermore, the dishes are extremely well presented with great eye for detail.
Pair this with an exceptional and impeccable service and you have a winning combination for an extraordinary dining experience. You instantly feel welcomed by the team that visibly enjoy what they are doing and take great pride in offering an exceptional experience.
I highly recommend the tasting menu with the wine pairings.  It is to die for.

The decor is unreal. You must check out the bathrooms- they are all white with big space ship like pods and a technicolor rainbow ceiling.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Wow just too much to say. The food was amazing the service was awesome and the wine was great.  Love this place.  The 400.00 bill was a bit much, but we don't eat like this often.  
Highlights - Sea bass and scallop",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"We had breakfast here and while the ambiance is  cool (even tho we weren't able to have it in the pink room, which I heard was amazing), the food wasn't great. Well, my porridge with coconut and bananas was so good but I should have never ordered a side of eggs, which came so incredibly salty we couldn't eat them, and for which I paid $12 pounds for. When I told the waiter, rather nicely to please tell the chef about the eggs, she just walked away. 
Also I agree with the reviews below, the whole charity on your bill without asking isn't cool. It's only $1.50, but they should just give you a heads up about it.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Although it's been around for a decade, Sketch has managed to retain its playful sense of kitsch among the departing and arriving competitors in surrounding streets. The two highlights of this place are probably afternoon tea in the upstairs parlour and the lavatory experience (I won't spoil the surprise). The meals are okay, but nothing to cross town for and the service is pretty, but hit and miss. It's definitely not an oil painting, brimming with attention to detail. However, it's a pretty fun sketch that you might wish to share with a friend or potential date.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I came here once with my mother, I got the beef tartare, which was small but good. Service was attentive and the toilets are sick but I don't think the price is justified, the food being good but not amazing and overall lacking that ""wow"" effect. The interiors are beautiful though and I think a trip here is worth it just for that",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Quick Review:  Beyond beautiful displays of amazing food, Sketch is a culinary journey that I highly recommend you try.  Its as if you are eating in a Tim Burton film but its definitely not creepy.  A bit pricey but its a once in a lifetime place you should try.  
FOOD (I recommend getting a few plates to share, sorry for no prices...I didn't see any on the menu online)
Pan-Fried Escargots (also came with baby squid, chorizo and caviar):  Escargot is not a fav of most people but you wont even be able to tell.  They come deshelled and were delicious
Chantilly Lace (w/ black rice, basmati rice and lobster bisque): They pour the lobster bisque over the rice and its an experience to see
Steamed Cod demi-sel (w/ mussels and grilled baby leeks): Fantastic especially if you like seafood
Dessert: Sketch Chocolate - soooo yummy, it was not too sweet, definitely should like chocolate though
SERVICE:
Everyone was very attentive, even if they were not our particular server, they still came by to check in with us.  They don't waste any time when it comes to taking your order though, we had to ask a few times for more time to decide.  This is definitely not a bad problem to have though.  
AMBIANCE 
Each room has their own decor and vibe.  Outside of the food, the restaurant itself is beautiful and quirky at the same time.  Definitely view the other rooms, especially the bathroom.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Everything about the atmosphere here is quirky and unique. The washroom is filled with egg shaped pods and they play the sounds of geese at you while you do your thing. The walls in the pink room were all plush and, well, pink. The art on the walls was to die for - so funny and made for great conversation starters.
The food was very good, but perhaps not worth the steep price tag. There are endless refills on everything, but the refills come slowly. After I had ordered one extra plate of sandwiches and dessert, the waitress started to ignore me, so the refills weren't as endless as I would have liked them to be.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This place is one of my favourites.
I'm a big big art person and I particularly love David Shrigley, so the beautiful pink room is a great mix of things I love: David's sketches and this weird Wes Anderson feel.
The food is yum - I wouldn't say Michelin star level quite yet - but it has a good mixture of quality and innovation. I particularly enjoy the fish when I'm there.
Also, great wine list, which always helps.
I really really want to try the afternoon tea.
If nothing else, go there for the instagrammable bathroom, I mean that's why people go out for dinner these days isn't it?",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Such a beautiful space and quirky, interesting art. A must-do if it is in your budget for afternoon tea! The eccentricity of Sketch is awesome from the caviar man serving you a spoon from a 500g container of caviar to the egg-shaped restrooms. Absolutely an Instagram-worthy setting with delicious food. My partner and I were too full to even bother to ask for more (which you are fully allowed to) whenever prompted. Their desserts and scones are the best part!
You should absolutely make a reservation, as I saw a couple people being turned away at the door.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I wanted the authentic afternoon tea experience in London and this place was pretty much spot on.  All the decor when we walked in oozed character, not to mention the hostess that was pretty much speaking the proper queen's english. 
Once we walked into the dining room it's a completely different vibe.  Really abstract sketches were on every wall, and made for great reading if your eyes decided to wander during tea.  Tea service was everything I expected.  You get little finger sandwiches with smoked salmon and caviar and little dessert things.  Everything was top shelf.  Then you get your fancy tea with scones and jam.  On top of the food and tea being great the service was top notch.  You could tell that they were professionals.  Our waitress was on top of everything without being overbearing at all.  
I couldn't review this place without mentioning the bathroom.  You pretty much need to check it out even if you don't have to go.  Imagine a staircase that leads up to a white room where like 5 giant eggs sit.  These eggs have doors so you can step inside where the toilet is.  On top of that, there are speakers inside the eggs that play ducks quacking at you.  It's crazy.  
Overall, sketch might be a little pricey but the food service and ambiance are more than worth the price of admission.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Maybe Sketch is for you but it's not for me. To give you an idea if you might like Sketch, here are some of its most important characteristics: 
- The dining room is all pink! Everything is pink except for the art on the wall which is black and white
- The bathroom is so weird, it gave me nightmares. It's an array of egg-shaped toilet pods that evokes the movie Aliens, except the monster hatching inside is your poo. Inside the egg pod, there are loud rainforest sound effects with a man counting down numbers which made me feel like the egg would hatch open if I didn't hurry. Not the most relaxing toilet experience  
- Food and drinks are mostly tasty but all came out a bit unexpected. My BF had the filet mignon and it was good. For my main dish, I ordered chicken. Except the chicken was diced up in BBQ sauce with popcorn. Straight up microwave popcorn and literally popcorn chicken with BBQ sauce. You should probably avoid that one if you can.
It's an eclectic place that's for sure!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I was taken to Sketch by my boyfriend as a part of my birthday treat. It was our second visit. As we're both David Shrigley fans, we wanted to visit the place again in the current incarnation.
I love The Gallery, I imagine I'm in a Wes Anderson film for 2 hours.
We had  booking for 6.30 and when we arrived 10 minutes before the time, we were told to wait along with another few guests for the evening service, which we were told starts at 6.30 (although there were already people inside). Literary 2 minutes lady a posh looking couple arrived, storming the door and were immediately escorted into the main room. That wasn't nice. 
I recommend coming at the very beginning of the serving time as the place is mostly empty, so it's nicer and quieter, so you can enjoy the place more for yourself and take photos without  feeling embarrassed and risking catching come c-celebrity in your selfie.
I started with the sashimi, which was meant to be an homage to the artist in residency, but was nothing more than an average and over-salted sashimi at a double price. The started was followed by a prawn dish, that was tasty, but not very big (literary 6 prawns with a spicy sauce) My boyfriend had a fish pie and that was much better and very filling. After two average dishes we found it hard to pick desserts as most of the descriptions weren't convincing. In the end I picked up what was sounding at least half exciting, but turned out to be one of the most fun desserts I've ever had. It was a creamy milky soup with pink bubble gum tasting ice-cream, tiny marshmellows, and pop candies. As a birthday babe I also got two tiny sweets. 
The wine by glass is well overpriced. Even if good quality, you get a tiny amount in a huge glass that last for about 3 sips and then you have to order again. Bottle is much a better option from the start.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,I am so sad such rude service on the reception table and destroy my happy mood. We 3 ladies wanna have some main food but she only applyed a tea table for us. Here doesn't deserve ur visit if u don't mind the service.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Solid experience. From the service to the decor to the tea and food selection, I was thoroughly impressed and satisfied. One of my main goals was to attend afternoon tea in London, and this was probably the best place I could have done it. The tea selection was huge, and we were given a two hour time slot to enjoy all the teas and tiny bites we wanted. The art and the restrooms were very entertaining, and the atmosphere, although a bit dark made for a very peaceful and romantic (if you want it to be) setting.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,A wonderful place for afternoon tea. It's really delicious. The pink decorations are fantastic and ideal for photo lovers. Do recommend this place and you'll see how romantic it is.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Imagine someone giving you a blank canvas and said, paint and create the most imaginative restaurant you can come up with. That is Sketch. We only had breakfast, but it is hard to believe that lunch, dinner, tea and drinks would be any worse.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Beautiful place to visit in London with multiple rooms of different character. Amazing really is an understatement. I went for the pink room because I love pink! But I forgot to make a reservation and didn't get in. No big deal. I still got to see it and sat in an equally magical room with a friendly staff and fabulous food. Speaking of staff, they all wear designer outfits which were remarkable and so fashion forward I would have totally bought one. My husband and I hung out for the afternoon there and had a late lunch and lots of wine. I must comment on the restrooms because it is a one of a kind potty experience with portable egg toilets that make you feel like you are somewhere in the future. Sketch is the most spectacular one of a kind place and I highly recommend! It is a must!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I feel a little bad giving this place 4 stars, but I don't quite think it deserves 5. The ambience as a whole is amazing, but the walls were covered vile, crude illustrations that, while good for sparking conversation, were on the whole unpleasant.
Also the food was delicious and presented imaginatively, and my spicy cocktail, burrata appetizer, and the dessert were delicious; however the flavor just of my entree, the lamb, just wasn't special. 
All in all, it was a lovely night but I think that for a place with multiple Michelin stars the restaurant fell a little flat.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Good tea sandwiches especially the smoked salmon with roe. Very modern place, not reminiscent of a traditional English afternoon tea place.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,We are so happy we came across Sketch in London - what a treat! Such a cool atmosphere with different rooms of different themes. You also have to check out the bathrooms! We loved it and had a great afternoon tea. Not touristy at all.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Absolutely LOVED this place. Where in London do you find tea infused champagne? Or luscious cakes like a pistachio profiterole? Or such great finger sandwiches? Plus their toilets are egg shaped, very instagrammable and you get to hear the Apollo 13 commentary inside. And it's all pink. Basically sketch sweats happiness.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Our experience was pretty awful. The ambiance is lovely but the service is quite lacking and the food quality was terrible. The pubs we've visited on our trip served much better (and less expensive) food.  Our drinks took 25-30 minutes to come out - two rounds in a row, which was ridiculous. After sending one meal (Risotto) back because it was overcooked, when the bill came we found both that and the replacement meal were charged. It was taken off when we pointed out the mistake, but there was very little care shown for the fact that the food was an issue. I would definitely. It go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.  I rate it 1 star because the hype is so over-inflated and the experience is so underwhelming.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I dont know how I feel about Sketch. 
In fact, I do know how I feel about Sketch. The same way I feel about Novikov, but with slightly  worse food and music. 
BUT! If you need to see and be seen... actually, hang on, I'd totally go somewhere else if I felt like I needed oligarchic validation in my life. Although, to be fair, I did meet a famous porn producer here once. 
This place is more hype than actual anything. Shame, them toilets are siiiickkkk. Soz.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Great atmosphere. Good service. The place is very cool. Each room is completely different. And the bathrooms are a MUST see! They are basically egg pods. Awesome spot to have a drink!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I had high expectations from Sketch because of the fantastic review and whilst the restaurant is stunning I felt the food lacked the same wow factor. 
The emphasis is on the ambiance and if this is what you are looking for than Sketch is the place for you! 
The staff is not short of wonderful too!!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Went to Sketch in The Gallery restaurant area.  When you first walk through the entrance of the building through a black curtain you come across hopscotch drawn on the floor what a way to enter but instead of walk in hop in.  You then pass many pieces of different art work on the walls.  You can check your coat in at the reception area before entering the restaurant.  The Gallery (restaurant) when you walk in you are blown away by the colour pink, pink and more pink.  Basically everything was pink from the comfy cushy chairs to the waitress's uniforms which was designed by a top designer.  When me and my friend was given the menu and we opened it up this pop up of knifes and forks made out of paper came springing up what a novelty and such a surprise.  The menu was quite hard to understand with its wording but the waitress explained it well.  I opted for the lamb dish and my friend the prawns and for a side we had mashed potatoes.  My lamb was very nice and the mash was the best mash I have had but for £5 I feel it was overpriced.  My friends dish was also very nice and sweet and different but for four prawns at £28 with some salad around them again overpriced.  For dessert I opted for the pavlova which was done differently to a normal pavlova and she opted for the chocolate dessert which looked like a chocolate U.F.O .had landed on her plate.  Again desserts nice but again perhaps a tad overpriced.  Whilst you are there you should go and check out the toilets.  Firstly you go up a lit staircase pink for girls and blue for boys.  You will then come across loads of pods like an alien has planted them there.  Inside the pods is the toilet and music so odd and different but then afterall Sketch is all about art.  Even though we had a nice time and we loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as it had such a buzz and was packed and this was at 6.30pm and that is rare to see a restaurant packed at this early time I would not go back purely because I feel it is overpriced for what you get to eat BUT saying this it has to be done to be experienced especially for the unusual toilet area.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I went to sketch for afternoon tea back in December to celebrate my birthday. The food was delicious, and they were very accommodating when we asked for extra sandwiches (the mini toastie is so moorish). 
I do not have a bad thing to say about sketch, the interior inside the parlour where they hold afternoon tea is delightful, the service was wonderful and the food was spot on. 
I can't wait to go back and try something different in one of the other rooms!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,Going to Sketch is a cool one time only experience. It is expensive but well worth it once!  The food was fine. A little bit excessive in quantity.The staff wears cool uniforms and the whole process is quite theatrical.  Lavatories are out of this world.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"We went to Sketch for afternoon tea at 3pm. It was quite simply amazing! I want to give it 10 stars. The atmosphere is great, it's a fun and quirky place. The waitresses are bubbly and cute...and as for the the Maitre d'....Yes well.. Go see for yourself  and don't even get me started on the toilets!!! 
The Sommelier served us sweet Veuve Clicquot Champagne infused with bergamot. However, Afternoon Tea with champagne is more expensive and no refills. The food was delicious, and you can order extras of your favorites free of charge.   I would say GO for sure, it's definitely a one off experience, but totally worth it!!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Very good experience! All the staff very professional. Food very tasty with bold flavors and interesting combination from Asian/France cuisine.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Gorgeous ladies afternoon tea.  
This is my go-to place to take out of town guests.  It has a modern twist on an original classic in a spot that is unique and memorable.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"A very cool - looking place that lives up to its reputation online. The place is immense and I wish I could have tried the tea room -- keep in mind that if you'd like to that, you should make a reservation! 
Definitely a bit $$$!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I just made reservations for high tea. So this review is not about food. My reservation says, you can use the table for 2 hours, after which you will be asked to leave.. And we will hold the table for 15 minutes. British snobbery? Nanny knows best attitude? I will update this post after I visit. 
Food was really good. Waiters, servers were great. Attentive. Sandwiches and sweets were delicious. But London does not have good tea",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Swanky, posh, and artful. All the bar spaces are expertly designed to create an unique and lavish experience. Circle bar is great for dates.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Super cool atmosphere, ok food, poor service...for the splurge price I expected so much more, waiter seemed to have forgotten us during Sunday shift change. Scones never came, cream puffs near reception never came, the second cheese toasties my kids requested never came! For a family coming for their first U.K. Tea it was a real disappointment, no teddies can make up for feeling poorly treated!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Five star rating starts with the eclectic decor as you walk in the door. Afternoon tea, although quite pricey is a must do for an elegant splurge. (45£ in the gallery). Wait staff is unbelievably attentive without hovering. Food was plentiful and DELICIOUS. Large selection of infused teas. Sandwiches and pastries were a gourmets delight.......and the bathrooms, well.....you'll have to go see them to believe them.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,Cool place for afternoon tea.  Service crazy slow though.  Not sure I'd come back but cool funky decore,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Definitely a must-see in London. The rooms are beautiful and I had some delicious cocktails at the farthest bar. Next stop: The Parlour! (The most beautiful room of them all...),1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I was dying to go to afternoon tea in London, and my friend and I were lucky enough to score the last seats at the teashop a half an hour before service was done for the day. Sketch is much more than your traditional tearoom. In fact, it's an eclectically designed collection of themed rooms - complete with an underground cocktail bar, a lunch and dinner café, a pink room with wall drawings, and futuristic ""pod"" bathrooms. It's truly a piece of art.
If you ever find yourself in London, I highly recommend a visit! I had a Pureh tea (still not actually sure how to pronounce that) called ""vintage mini cakes"" with two authentic English scones (side note: they're pronounced ""scons"" apparently) with clotted cream and jam. For a couple of hours, I felt like a true Londoner.
Service was amazing, as was the tea and the tea room. Come for an hour or 3 for an eclectic twist on a traditional British pastime.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Unique designs in a special place that is constantly evolving with the creativity of London and its buzzing patrons. Still loving the pods in the bathroom area and the layout of the tea room (ex lounge).,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Amazing dinner and after dinner place in Mayfair. Must take a tour if you're never been around. Good music and nice people.
A complaint: I asked for a Moscow Mule, a classic cocktail. What I've been given was not what I expected: let's define it a vodka and ginger beer mix with some red and sweet topping (?!). Disappointed.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Sketch is like a dream full of rainbow unicorn and magic. The place is a eye candy that you take people to when you want to impress them ;). 
There are 3 bars and 1 restaurant inside. All areas have a different theme and music. All of the themes are very tasteful and unique. For the people who have been, will agree with me that the bathroom is amazing and a must go area (lol. Just remember to bring your camera ;p )
The menu selections are good, I wouldn't say the food or drink are excellent but definitely good. The service is great. The bill is hefty as you'd expect before going in.
I would recommend people to go to this place for special occasions or if you are visiting the city. You will sure to have an amazing time.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Sketch is more of an experience than just food!:) 
I have been a few times and I love to take visiting friends here because they always enjoy the quirky, fun vibe here. 
It has a few different rooms to eat in, I have only been to The Parlour (because the others are even more pricy). The Parlour is wonderful, no two sofas match, and everything inside is an eclectic, bohemian collection of furniture. Everything is pretty to look and rather interesting to check out. Everytime I go I'm greeted by a hopscotch game chalked onto the floor, which I always use when I think no one is looking:P 
I never leave without making sure my visitor has seen the bathrooms here, because they are really fun. One is covered in swarovski crystals (even the flush is a crystal you push), and on the way there you pass a statue of a sitting woman completely made of crystals. 
The second bathrooms is even more fun. When I walked in, my first impression was of a blindingly white space filled with egg pods and odd noises. It is a bit disorienting to realize that each egg pod is a bathroom. The atmosphere is really different than any other bathroom I've been to, and the first time I went I was greeted by the sight of a girl dressed as a Victorian maid scrubbing the shiny white steps for all she was worth, and I wondered for a mad moment if I had been transported to a Victorian futuristic alternate universe. If I was coming for the first time, I wouldn't leave without going here, and hoping to see the cleaner lol.
The decor changes everytime a little, and I'm sure it is different for everybody. My favorite time was the first time because to get to the bathroom i had to pass through a room that was dim and had a video projected on all the walls of someone climbing trees with the loud and creepy sounds of the rustling trees and people. I was expecting lunch, not art, and the surprise was really fun.
Speaking of the lunch, the menu changes everytime I go as well. The first time I went I had the high tea, which was wonderful. They had the loveliest, fragrant jasmine green tea served in pretty tea cups, and a hazelnut chocolate cake that my husband and I fought over because it was so good. 
The next time i went, the cake was gone and the other desserts though decent, were not quite at that level. Another time we tried the lunch and I had tiny black sandwiches which were quite fun although not that yummy. The food there is unpredictable, I have had one or two really yummy things, and otherwise decent if unremarkable food, but never anything terrible. I love the atmosphere and would recommend it to someone who wants something different and fun with a cup of really good tea:)",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"How fancy is this place? Went late night for drinks, Very impressed by the decor of the bar - a bit creepy but cool vibe with great techno music. I got the rocket mohito and finally discovered that the British name for arugula is rocket. A yummy drink that's healthy too. I'd say a bit on the pricier side but then this it's worth it.
And OMG the restrooms! I will not spoil it for you. You have to check it out yourself.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Went to the first-floor area for a quick business meeting in the morning, and really wished I had the time to explore all the nooks and crannies of this huge, eccentric place.  The decor here is anything but dull, and I really want to try it out during the buzzy hours to see what it's like at its peak- plus, gotta see those famous egg-pod bathrooms.
I had to immediately downgrade a star because it is SO BLOODY OVERPRICED.  I get it, we're in Mayfair (though not even in the poshest parts as it's a stone's throw from touristy Regent's Street) but £6.50 for a non-alcoholic fresh juice drink?  So yes, do set aside a budget if you wish to partake in any food or cocktails here.
Still, if you're looking for a London spot with a 'wow' factor, this place is kind of a must.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Amazing service! Friendly and helpful staff!
Came to London with Sketch being one of my top To-Dos and booked a reservation online. Somehow though, the reservation didn't go through and when I showed up, they didn't have my name down on the list. The man working the front was super understanding and found a way to fit me in anyway! I was so grateful! He made 2 Californians very happy!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I went with my sisters and daughter for dinner at this awesome designed restaurant with 0 expectations. I had no idea what this place is about until the moment I walked in.  
The space is incredible the toilets even more.  However......the food was not worth the cost. Yes nothing tasted bad aside from the very boring and tasteless salad but from that to paying 360£ for 4 people it's a big never again place for me.  Yes the place has style the service is superb but did not amaze me enough to don't care about the bill.  
 There are enough places in London to eat well and not go crazy with the cost.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Definitely a place purely for the environment and vibe.  Pretty decor.  Went for afternoon tea with 2 children.  Food is not the reason to go.  Nothing was really that good.  Tea was very good though.  I would suggest this a a joint you take your bestie after not having seen them for 10 years, not just because you're in London.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Come for the decor, stay for the toilets. Also the food is pretty good.
A friend of mine made reservations here the other night. My lady and I met him and his lady. Actually, I met all three of them there...I wasn't late. They just left early without me. Some friends.
Just kidding they're alright.
Any place that has Ron Zacapa on the drink menu is a good place in my book. I keep a book. Assuming you do as well, so you know what I'm talking about.
After dinner we got a drink in the bar that looks like a forest. Cool bar. Not so comfortable on the seating, but whatever. Just drink the pain away.
Turns out this place has two Michelin stars. Found that out afterwards. Pretty cool.
I could spend all day looking at the stupid pictures on the walls. Art. Ha. Still, I liked it.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"It's a 5 for versatility. It suits all your needs whether you want a quirky afternoon tea, or fancy dinner, or casual drinks. And the women's bathroom is the number one reason to visit! It used to be House of Dior (I'm told) and has a fantastic design.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This is a review for Afternoon Tea at Sketch in the Gallery room. Sketch is a great place to take people as it's very different - one of a kind place you'll see in London. Definitely worth a visit. In what looks like a very small establishment on the outside, there are many different rooms on the inside including a 2-michelin star restaurant.
As for the Afternoon Tea - it's your pretty standard Afternoon Tea you'll expect at any London hotel with a more funky Sketch spin to it.  Of course you've got the tea to choose from.  Lots of tea choices. All good.  You've also got a variety of cakes they bring out... probably had my week's worth of sugar in that meal but all worth trying out.  Their finger sandwiches are very unique - for example their egg sandwich had a very small sunny side up egg on each sandwich. Nice attention to detail.  The scones were available afterwards (not much space on the table as there were 3 of us) and they came out warm with jam and clotted cream. Very tasty and above average for the food tasted.
I would expect paying close to 30 quid for tea the service would be exceptional.  If I compare to other Afternoon Tea establishments for at other luxury hotels for roughly the same price the service is sub-par.  For example, tea was provided but not poured. We had to ask for sandwich refills rather than just being brought them.  These are the tiny things I'd expect. The staff, however, was nice friendly and we had a good meal.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,This place is soooo cute- makes sense since I initially saw it on a list of the most instagrammable places in London. Each room has a different theme and each is equally inspiring. The drinks are delicious as are the macaroons! I'll be back with each friend who comes to visit me.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I came here for my birthday and it was amazing. This restaurant is pretty much something from a Wes Anderson movie. The food is also incredible, I had the risotto and was very impressed. The whole room is note worthy, I spent the majority of my dinner looking at each drawing and laughing at the funny/sarcastic drawings and pointing them out to my friend. 
Also, the bathroom is a definite picture worthy place, I spent maybe 20 minutes taking pictures in the bathroom and I wasn't the only guest. The toilets are inside individual egg shaped domes, and the ceiling is covering in these multicolored light panels. 
If you love art, light pink, good food, and egg shaped toilets, Sketch is the place for you.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I'm going to keep this short and simple because that's all you really need , it's probably the most creative restaurant in London, food is amazing!

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,One of the places I miss the most in London! Love it - love it - and love it! I can come here many times over and always feel like it's the first time. Bouncing between kaleidoscopical bathrooms and Clock Work orange Bars another must in the city!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Came here mainly for the interior decor. Five star interior decor! I really like India's interior style and taste. It's retro futuristic. The food is average taste 3 and half star max. I feel like if I were dining in 2030 or another planet. A chic place to hang with family and friends.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,The scone is the best I have tried! Afternoon is great but the most impressive thing is that egg-shaped toilet. U gonna love it!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"What a delightful little surprise with such exquisite, with very well thought out interior decor. FYI I'm only reviewing about the afternoon experience I had here.
Mixing heritage with a modern twist, the hip and artistic atmosphere here is great for birthday tea as well as small friends gatherings. Downtown romance with uptown dining experience, the £32 tea set was pleasant, though not a full on 100% of what I expected- a mediocre scone with 2 jams, around 3 slices of finger sandwiches, one tiny macaron, pistachio mousse, a tiny chocolate eclair, two bite size caramel chocolate candy (so DELISH btw), lime and raspberry tarts, and three marshmallows (lemon, lavender and rose). and of course, a pot of tea that comes out to around 2 cups. 
The tea sets weren't meant to be shared, meaning that's ALL yours. Also ordered an extra earl gray macaron and this raspberry rose macaron base tart (the one with full on rose pedals on top). Do recommend this over that puny droplet of earl gray macaron although the earl gray flavor was a nice touch in variety.
Overall, very satisfied with my experience at this posh and chic place, a little pricey, but consider it worth it regarding all other aspects!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"My dad and I went here for afternoon tea. The restaurant is gorgeous and you'll keep looking around at all the artwork. The food was great. I loved the fact that you could reorder as much as you wanted. My favourite was probably a truffled cheese melt and the scones. The pastries were really great as well, not too sweet. I've been to other afternoon tea places in London like Fortnum, but this was definitely the most special and I recommend it to anyone!!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Food was very good. Entire presentation is lovely. Relaxing room.  Great service - The entire staff was attentive and even made special birthday plate for my sister. Pricey but worth it, one of the best afternoon tea service in the London. My only complaint is that, we made a reservation one week before we went and still had seat too close to the service area.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This is every bit as London cool it will ever get!
Decor is beyond ridiculous, the euro-space cool bathroom pods juxtapose with the old school maid uniforms of the bathroom attendants. I could of easily taken my shoes off and started running through each of the rooms in a game of chase with my husband, yes...that level of playfulness. 
Oh right, the food. Yeah, was awesome...some Michelin guy loved it too, or something. 
GO! 
( I was totally stuffed after the lunch tasting, but I recommend you accept what will come immediately after and go for it anyway, yolo people.)",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Everything was delicious, seriously no complaints.
For an afternoon tea that is not your ordinary tea time, Sketch is the place. It's expensive but its worth it- I walked out of there feeling completely stuffed and satisfied.
The selection of teas is very good- ranging from fruity to more classic teas. I went with Chai and really enjoyed it! My friend had the hibiscus and currant tea- it smelled amazing!
There was more then enough food for everyone with us! All of the different varieties of finger sandwiches were amazing! Then the pastries - especially the pistachio puff, were so so good! I loved everything I ate.
Would definitely go again and would definitely bring friends from out of town to Sketch for tea.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Drinks are good but expensive in a unique setting. Can be a bit of a hassle if you don't have a booking which is a pain when it's not late in the evening.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This place was like a DREAM COMES TRUE! We celebrated my birthday at the gallery , the place was really BEYOND & unique. Starting from their pink decorations & their artistic paintings they had on their walls, exactly where the famous Singer Tyler swift had one of her photoshoots for a magazine right behind the painting walls in the pink gallery. & of course their FAMOUS bathroom, that looks out of this world in which you MUST take tons of selfies in there! 
Their menu was very limited specially with the maincourse yet we got trufilled steaks along with some french fries & onion rings -which were unbelievably tasty- yet I didn't like my steak much & I don't know why, it tasted too meaty , other than that it was really good. & for the dessert we had La Rochelle, which was a very weird looking dessert tbh , it had what looked like 3 icecream cones , only that they weren't icecreams at all , they came in Lemon, Mango & berry flav along with some side marshmallow, so it wasn't that great even though it was highly recommended to us by the waiter. The duck sounded interesting yet overly pricely as it was 32£ i guess. 
 The waiter sounded a bit confused & clueless & i told her to bring me some cocktails instead of the diet coke I ordered, at the end she brought me both of them! & her food recommenations were not obviously the best.
It was a pricey experience, as we paid 100£ +for the food & service, i was surprised to see that the olives alone costs 4£ & the bread & butter costs 4£ also -in which they recommend at the start- BUT it was all worth it! I fell in love with that place & I don't know why, You must visit the sketch at least once in your life! It would be an unforgettable experience, I guarantee you that!  
Cheers!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This was my first introduction to the British afternoon tea concept. We came here last Sunday for a reservation at 4pm. It seems like reservations shouldn't be hard to come by as long as you make them 24 hours in advance. Ironically enough, this place is French.
Sketch was everything I expected after reading online reviews and their website. Swanky, futuristic, Sketch is an exciting blend of modern art piece and everything else from a cafe during the day to a dancing club at night. Or so I have heard. 
Instead of ordering an enormous three-course afternoon tea set, we both went for Cream Tea option. I had scones and White tea with hints of melon and cucumber. This is perfect for someone who's in the mood for a mild yet delighted Sketch experience. 
Check out the bathroom that look like a collection of giant eggs. The whole area seems to be taken straight out of a futuristic space ship where living specimen are frozen to come back at a later life. I might be taken a little bit away now... 
In short, I can't recommended Sketch enough. Bring a friend here as it's perfect for tourists and residents alike.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"This review is for dinner in the gallery (pink room)
The restaurant is beautiful, unique, and very trendy. Several rooms/concepts wrapped into one place. The room I dined in was furnished with pink everything and clever art. Very well done.
The service was adequate, though I often felt rushed, and several junior level staff members could use some polish.
Most of the food was a bit bland, and with the exception of dessert, all dishes left something to be desired. 
All in all, wouldn't pay the ticket again for 'just OK' food and 'good enough' service.",-1

- unlimited food with afternoon tea. I definitely got seconds of everything I liked, which included the sandwich with caviar, pear tart, and lots of tea
- the artwork on the wall. hilarious stuff!
- ridiculous bathrooms. I used them multiple times, because I stuffed my face full of their food.
Solid place and definitely an alternate to the formal, high tea you could get elsewhere. Recommended!",1

The eggpod toilets are a trip, don't even get me started on the waterfall.  Good fun for sure.",1

In a great way. The tea has delicious and so were the little goodies. Highly recommend it! The service was also phenomenal and more attentive than I had expected considering how busy the place was. The pink room was my favorite! What a beautiful gem.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This place is truly unique. Everything from the alien bathroom and the boutique dining room to the impeccable food display, I recommend going here if you want to show off or have classy friends from out of town. 
We started in the circular bar where the cocktails were fresh and strong, and finished with a full three-course meal. Even if the decor wasn't as glitzy, the food was so good that I would have still recommended this place. 
But if you have time do roam around... it's like being in a modern art or design gallery where top quality and style is the norm. Hats off to both chef and interior decorator :)",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch was worth the wait. I had this restaurant on my list to experience ever since my son dined there over 5 years ago and finally dined here July 16th.  The sommelier was perfect with her choice of wine, A 2000 Chateau Belgrave Haut-Medoc.  My wife and I had the duck and loved it. Would I return?  In a flash if I resided in London.  Of course the decor in our dining room and the bathrooms were quite edgy and classy.
I recommend this restaurant!!!",1

Don't really recommend the parlour as without a table you'll be stuck at the tiny bar. This area is tiny as it is. Cocktails were great though, hostess was very rude but bartenders were great!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,A little pricey for afternoon tea but all the sandwiches and treats were refillable so we felt like it was worth it.  My favorite was the smoked salmon sandwich as well as the Brie sandwich (comes hot).  I also loved the scone with clotted cream and fig jam.  The only reason I took away a star was that the service was slow and this was late in the afternoon when it wasn't as busy so I felt there should have been more attention paid.  The atmosphere is very cute for a girls the (pink room),1

Oh and there drinks are ridiculously good! But if I recommend any of the items I would have to say get the duck! They serve it two different ways and present it to you before they actually prep it! This restaurant is more of an experience. From there funky bathroom to there out of space vibe bar, to there pink room dining room. Even there plates are cool! If your in London you must again MUST dine at sketch",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"As you walk in around 4 members of staff were checking to see where we were going - felt sincere. 
High Concept bar - weird....very 90s. Each room has a theme. We were in the cocktail bar. the bar itself was lowered into the floor and the staff had table service. its £13.50 - £15 per cocktail, we stayed for two, they were quite nice. 
iTs a bit cooky and weird - the toilets are little pods with weird people talking in them - sounds like air traffic control. Now what struck me as particularly bizarre was the fact that if you have a massive section for pod toilets where you can look over to the mens side  - why bother have mens/women. I was guided to the ladies side by a bizarrely dressed staff member (in a French maids outfit) who looked miserable as she was leaning on a pod. 
I'd go again - its bizaare but fun.The restaurant seemed to be a place where it booked up in advance, but not the bar. It is certainly a pricey place.",-1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"the only reason for three stars was the wonderful bartender.  Probably the most pretentious restaurant I've ever been to.  The food was not worth the high price, it was just okay.  From the doorman who asked for my ID before letting me in (this is not a club, and It was 8pm) to the hostess who claimed they didn't let people eat at the bar and they were completely booked. Two people walked right in the door without being questioned or having to show their IDs (clearly much younger than me). After asking to use the ladies room, I went to the bar and asked if I could sit down and eat.  The bar staff immediately attended me-  They saved the evening, and were great.

I don't remember exactly what I had, but my main course and dessert were out of this world incredible! Of course, the bathrooms were a special treat.  Also, for the budget conscious, the lowest price entree is 14 pounds and the entrees range to upwards of 50 pounds.  Worth every pound!",1

I would recommend going to see sketch but as a one off thing!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. And I dine out several times a week. I rarely leave reviews but it was a negative enough experience to where I have to say something. We visited Sketch during my first visit to London. We booked for brunch in the Glade on a Monday morning. As in, not peak hours. The service was non existent. We waited over 20 minutes just to be greeted and receive a menu but noticed the server attend the table next to us at least 4 times in the same time span. Our order was never taken and finally we moved to the parlor. The server was more affable in that room but the service was still painfully slow. We had to wait another 20 minutes just for our coffees. It seemed they had one server for the entire room when they know the rooms will be full given you have to make a reservation beforehand. We noticed other tables complaining about the service and looking miserable as well. The menu was overpriced and the cheese and crackers was a complete rip off. Three of the thinnest crackers I've ever seen and some small cheese cubes on a plate for 12 pounds. The rest of the food was ok. It seems they prepped the aesthetics of this place for instagram and then forgot to properly train wait staff. Perhaps they do not care. I don't recommend unless you have 2+ hours to spare for overpriced bites. Very disappointing.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Pretty good French food, but you go for the design and ambiance, very cool.+ Amazing toilets of course!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Omg!!!! This place! Wonderful staff wonderful environment. Price was fine considering the experience. I took my daughter for her birthday. She loves it. Visiting from US and this place made our trip! Love it! Food was great!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Okay let's be honest here. You're paying for the atmosphere because the food isn't all that great. But geez, the ambiance here is unlike anything I've ever seen.
Unique, futuristic, artsy. Each room has a different theme and it's like you step into the wonderland that is Sketch right from the moment you walk through the front door. I made reservations weeks in advance for a Thursday night in The Gallery. We had a bit of time to wander around the venue before being seated so we walked through The Gallery and into the back bar/bathrooms. One word: WOW. Questions like ""Was this the future?"" and ""I am on a spaceship?"" crossed my mind. Really, really, cool. And you get to handle your #1's or #2's in your own personal egg-shaped pod. Nothing beats that. By far, the coolest bathroom I've ever seen.
The food was okay. Nothing to brag about. You'll surely leave hungry unless you want to order multiple dishes. My friend and I split the Sea Bass Tartare, which was nice, but had a very light flavor. My friend ordered the Beef & Foie Gras Burger (21.0), which came with a side of fries. It wasn't a very big burger and we ended up splitting it. Juicy, tender, with a very light layer of foie gras. I ordered the Gambas (26.0), and I wish I got something else because it literally came with 3 prawns. Yup. That's right... THREE. 26 Pounds. BOOM. 
But seriously, such a stunning venue. A MUST DO AT LEAST ONCE!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"The food and plating presentstion was refined and adventurous. The ambience is worth traveling across countries for--it truly is a fantastical experience. However it took ten minutes for anyone to even stop by our table in the Gallery. Hosts, servers and the proletariat-styled utility servers were all buzzing about but we felt utterly rejected and had to ask just to order. It was very disappointing to say the least since I had been so excited to bring my family here. My martini didn't even have olives after I had requested them in my order and it was brought out twenty minutes after the rest of the drinks at the table. I will go back someday but perhaps to a different salon. The staff in the Gallery were just not up to par with the delicious menu and unforgettable installation.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"INCREDIBLE PLACE.  Food, wine, service, ambiance, everything was absolutely fantastic. 
FOOD: We did tasting menu with wine paring. My partner did vegetarian version, and I did non-vegetarian one.  Every single course was beautiful, interesting and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. There was no dish I liked ""just ok.""  My partner also loved every course of vegetarian tasting menu. An interesting thing was that vegetarian menu was 20% cheaper than non-vegetarian one and vegetarian menu has one more course than non-vegetarian one. Paring as well. (Vegetarian tasting menu: £95 for 7 courses, paring: £95 , Non-vegetarian tasting menu: £120 for 6 courses, paring: £120)
WINE: It was probably the BEST WINE PARING I've ever experienced in my life. I was wonderfully surprised and almost shocked by how perfect it was for every course. 
SERVICE: It was exquisite. There didn't seem to be assigned or main servers for each table. Instead all servers were working on us and other tables, which I liked a lot.  For one course, our sommelier couldn't bring paring wine before dishes were placed in front of us. We were going to wait for wine without starting eating the course. But next second, they noticed about that and brought wine for us within 30 seconds instead of keeping us wait for the sommelier. (The sommelier came back to our table to explain the wines while we were enjoying them.)
AMBIANCE: Interesting and grand. I love it.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: There was no female service person or sommelier on the floor!!!!  To make things worse, there was one female outside the floor just standing in a costume of maid!! I didn't ask the reason of all about this crazy situation. So I don't know, but it looked to me that some gender discrimination was going on. This is why I marked four stars instead of five. Since I didn't ask the reason and also I've been seen only one night, I mark four stars instead of less.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Sketch London was an absolute disappointment. When we were visiting London in September, my boyfriend and I made reservations and I was so so excited to finally be able to experience this place. His mom and sister were in London as well, so we had all planned to go together for a special night together. 
Right off the bat they wouldn't let my boyfriend in because of how he looks and they were incredibly insulting. They told him that he looked too ""jarring"" for their establishment, but his mom, sister and I were welcomed inside. His mom explained to them that we had come from California and I had been planning to come here for years, so they reluctantly let us in. Our table wasn't ready yet so they had us go to the bar where there was an apology drink waiting for my boyfriend. He wasn't drinking, but we thought it was at least a nice offer. I was almost in tears at this point because of how belittling they were to us, but I was trying to make the most of it, especially since they apologized and tried to accommodate us. I ordered a mimosa for myself and when I got the receipt the ""complimentary"" apology beer was 15 pounds... I looked at the bartender only to have him give me a snarky look in return, so I didn't bother complaining and just paid for the drinks. 
We waited 30/40 minutes past our reservation time until they finally seated us after having to remind them multiple times that we were waiting. Our waitress was incredibly rude and treated us like we didn't belong there and didn't have enough money to be in their restaurant. We each ordered what we wanted but when we declined drinks she blatantly scoffed, pursed her lips and rolled her eyes. 
By the time we finished my boyfriend and I were both incredibly upset and I was in tears. I've never been anywhere, let alone a restaurant, where the staff made me feel so beneath them and belittled. I had hoped that this would be a special place for us to create memories when we visit London and after our experience I will never step foot in here again.",-1

It was my last night in London and I wanted to celebrate. My friend and I eyed the drink list and she mouthed to me ""champagne"". Eff the exchange rate!

I wanted to bring my family here from the states since they're visiting me during my studies here in London, I don't think I could have made a better choice. My young cousins are vegetarians and our sweet waitress catered way above expected to get us a better selection of sandwiches. She was so genuinely concerned with our tea, making sure we had everything we needed. They even brought out fresh hot scones towards the end of our tea. Not to mention that the bathroom is awesome- but I'll leave that a surprise.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Absolutely loved my visit here! Went for the afternoon tea which was great and they have very cool toilets!! Haha.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Afternoon tea at sketch? No thanks.
I went in there to give it yet another try. They turned the main Gallery in something pink and sickeningly plush. Why sickeningly....well have you seen that picture going around the internet where they should you what chicken mcNuggets are really made of? That's what it reminded me of. 
Bad service. Really. For a Michelin star restaurant I expect more, much more. At Sketch it is condescending, inattentive and impatient. Forget about tea & clotted cream top ups. You'll be lucky to get someone's attention to get your bill.
The food. The only sandwich that was worth landing in my memory is cheesy compte one. Nice & crunchy. The rest were...well. Sandwiches.
There was a lot of sweet stuff alright. Just because you're pink, Sketch, doesn't mean you need to kill your customers with sugar. Opera cake was nice but the rest of the pastries were just disappointment. And scones? I was given a *choice* of scones. I could only have raisin OR plain, nope, not both. Let alone there were no savoury choices for scones (kudos for Mad Hatter Afternoon tea at Sanderson's - they've got it right).
I was hosting guests from abroad here, so at least bathroom impressed them. At least they've got that right... This review would probably not change a thing. The food would still be mediocre, the service still bad and ambiance still not do it. And people would still give it rave reviews. Disappointed.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Step into this exclusive looking club and you feel like you've just walked through to Alice in Wonderland's Mad Hatter's tea party. The decor is crazy cool and the bathrooms are just mind blowingly weird. 
We came here for a cream tea and I was really impressed with the quality of food/drink and the decor. I was not, however, very impressed with the service. We booked a table for 3 at 4pm. We didn't get seated until about 4.30, with not much apology about the wait and ordered straight away. By 5pm we were still waiting for our tea to arrive, let alone the scones. 
I was quite frustrated by the whole thing and thought that they could have at least brought the tea quicker or maybe offered a glass of juice whilst we waited as surely the point in booking is to be efficient and not have to wait.
However, I think the place is really unique and would definitely like to come back some day for dinner or drinks as it's so quirky.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,We had dinner here for NYE 2012 at the two michelin starred restaurant. The food was excellent but the service was a bit average. To make matters worse they brought out the champagne after the coundown had finished and everyone has wished each other Happy New Year !! A tad disorganised dont you think ? specially for a place that has such a high rating ?? I have posted photos of the food here and also the menu. I would defenitely come back here again another time when it is not so busy and see if it's better on the service front. The waiter we had was a tad arrogant and took ages to bring us our bill and rarely checked up to see if everything was ok. I would give 5 stars to the sommelier on the night and he was fantastic. His knowledge of wine was immense and he was extremely attentive the whole time.,-1

Fortuitously blessed with the ability to sleep soundly on aircrafts at any time of day it was fresh off the red-eye from McCarran to Heathrow that I walked into The Parlour at Sketch and although a table laid in wait at The Lecture Room upstairs just sixty minutes later I simply could not resist the temptation to experience the 'casual' side of my favorite Chef's cuisine amidst a room of intriguing design and some of London's most beautiful people.  Truly a space to see and be seen with eye catching décor at every turn it was in a trio of small plates that my Sketch experience began and served en masse at my request not a single bite underwhelmed in the least, the ethereal gougeres melting to the tongue while both the creamy liver and black brioche would not have been out of place at Michelin starred spots throughout the English capital.  Already impressed with the best yet to come it was with a surprisingly smooth transition that I moved to the posh environs upstairs and having already studied the menu at length a six course tasting soon progressed, though as anyone familiar with Chef Gagnaire will know the plates hovered somewhere in the mid-twenties with concepts and flavors evolving exponentially as a well-trained staff assured I was never for want.  Truly a landmark meal for many of the same reasons that I've enjoyed Twist and Rue Balzac in the past suffice it to say that those willing to adventure into seemingly discordant flavors are likely to be rewarded for their faith and with bitter playing a strong role in both Morels and Foie Gras while intense sweetness was well served in the indulgent $51 cocktail and a soufflé standing tall and proud the highlights of the meal were in fact the three-piece guinea fowl and a cheese cart focused on the local and unpasteurized with thick cuts and clever accoutrements unlike any I'd see elsewhere in the subsequent eight days - the unpasteurized Stichelton particularly elegant and a beautiful segue to a baba that would trump even Ducasse, the savory sesame notes playing perfect foil to smooth lemon jam while a stiff shot of rum found levity in syrup, cream, and semi-tart fruits.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"One of the coolest restaurants I have ever been to, and the food rivals Michelin-starred darlings - very impressed with their ability to accommodate allergies, and loved the drink menu! I have dined here twice now, once for afternoon tea and once for dinner - both were exquisite and I was so impressed with everything from the food to the service. Obviously the bathrooms and decor are quirky - but the food and service are the true gems here.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Great for afternoon tea . Not as keen on the food. Great atmosphere with quirky toilets and bar,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"It was a lovely place for girlfriends getting together. Everything is pink, even their cocktails. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly. We didn't have the reservation and it was a rather busy day when we walked in since it was a post-Valentine's Day. People who didn't get the reservation on V-day flushed in the day after. But the waitress managed to give us the best seats at the bar which gave us the view of the entire restaurant. 
The cocktails are great. The bartender definitely knows what he's doing. Even we were sitting at the bar, they still gave us sufficient attention to make our experience wonderful. 
Also, the bathroom is worth checking out. 
The entire building has this ""Alice in the Wonderland"" vibe. Each room looks different and very heavily themed. The Sketch is like the tea party and the bar across it is like the tree hole that Alice falls in. 
Unfortunately, we missed the tea time this time, but I would love to come back and try their afternoon tea.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,The decore here is awesome but £12 to £18 for 1 cocktail i dont think its worth even going there for 1 drink.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I'd been here before, but I decided to come back last year with my partner for afternoon tea in the Glade Room.
The design of the whole interior of the building is incredible, with loads of lush ambient light and the totally weird pod toilets. But my favorite part was going back to The Glade Room for our afternoon tea. 
There's a really nice ambiance about that room in particular and the hues of greens and yellows with the bamboo styled furniture are all really nice.
The selection of beautifully made cakes and savories were just as good, if not better than the first time I came. They were displayed on a lovely stand with a mousse and macaroons at the top, some more sweets in the middle, and with things like egg, cress and caviar topped sandwiches at the bottom of the stand. 
The tea and cocktail menu is also really well put together their gin and tonics are really on point too.
This is a great treat if you want to surprise a loved one, or are in London and want something a bit traditional, yet wacky to do.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Went there with a group of friends.
Food is good, broad range of wines, signature cocktails are sophisticated.
Yet restaurant is overpriced : 100 £ (140 € for starter + main course + wine and coffee).
Courses were good but not to an extent that you can expect for such a price (or at least that would not be the case in Paris).",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch offers an amazing dining experience. I call it an experience because that is what you will get when you done here. From the moment you walk all of your senses will be stimulated. Your eyes will be greeted by the lights and beautiful artwork in the entry way, which is nicely complimented by their soundtrack. I give the atmosphere 5 stars and the food alone 4 stars, because it is good but not as amazing as the atmosphere sets you up to expect. We had the Chantilly Lace (amazing) Dover sole (rather boring) and veal (very nice). The desserts were unique and refreshing but not amazing, we tried the cheesecake and the La Rochelle. They do have a fabulous wine list!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"This place is bizzarre. In order to get the full experience, try to see the whole restaurant, as it is a pretty cool place. Going to Sketch is like going to Alice In Wonderland, with many different themed rooms, and very interesting toilets. I have ate at Sketch twice, once for dinner, once for breakfast. The dinner food was absolutely horrendous (got this weird miso noodle dish), and the waitress got our drink order wrong because she did not speak proper English. The breakfast was good, just got porridge (how can you muck that up?), so I would recommend Sketch only for breakfast. I would go to Sketch once for the experience, as I did, but I would not go back unless forced.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"I've given this place far too many tries and now my patience is over. 
A ""sommelier"" who isn't capable to recommend a bottle of whine below 120£ (this is not about being too pricey for ME, but about being too pricey for a poor quality restaurant), fancy sounding overpriced dishes with more than poor taste/execution, and since the renovation even the cool atmosphere has vanished and been replaced by the feeling of sitting in hell made out of bubble gum.
Did I mention that before you get the menu (which would enlighten you) they ask if you'd like bread (which is free in 99% of all other restaurants I know, with 1% being McDonalds) and in the end they charge you about 5£ for a tiny serving?
Being a lover of pork, foie gras and (strangely) black pudding, I ordered the ""suckling pig and foie gras gatêau with black pudding"". You would imagine a layered piece of heaven, treating all the ingredients, especially a delicacy like foie gras, with all the necessary respect. Far off! What I got was an undefined roundshaped ""mash"" of pork and foie gras on a bed of blended black pudding (attempt to make a sauce?) that tasted to undefineable that I forgot what it was supposed to be at the time.
One word: YUCK! The ingredients were mashed together with disrespect, it tasted like old greasy slime and unfortunately there wasn't even any texture or crunch from the ""suckling pig"".
I have never been so disappointed by a dish with some of my favorite ingredients.
The final reason why I will definitely never come back to sketch: not only was the dish disgusting, it also gave me food poisoning.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Sketch is actually three different businesses - a bar a lounge and a restaurant down at the end. The lounge is weirdly laid out (it's sketchy) with all sorts of random adornments - fancy furniture, moose heads on the wall, very electic. The drinks menu is on newsprint and is quite pricey. You must walk through the restaurant where you can see great sketch artwork on the walls on your way to the bathrooms which are out of this world. You just have to see it to believe it. The only thing I'll say is I wonder if the DJ is aware of what is flowing on either side of him.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,Went here for tea and thought it was seriously overrated. The restaurant itself looks fanatic but the food quality was so average. We went at a busy time and the staff seemed really rushed and it was hard to get their attention.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Amazing surroundings and beautiful interior design. It takes a breath away (especially if you don't expect anything).,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"It has long been on my list of places to go to, especially to check out its famous, colourful, funky loos. I was there recently, seated in the Parlour, for a brunch with some ladies. I had taken my 7.5month old baby along as reviews seemed to indicate the place is surprisingly baby friendly. And I must say, I was pleased with the promptness with which they brought the high chair out... I had a pot of the Puerh tea to start with, as it was a nippy day and I wanted something to warm me...the tea and the presentation were both lovely. I placed an order for their poached eggs, with crab and cereliac remoulade and toasted brioche. The eggs were just right and the remoulade was an unusual take on the traditional breakfast. But, I definitely felt the portion size was a tad on the smaller side, which is why I placed an additional order for wholemeal toast after the eggs arrived. Really liked the spreads to go with the toast. And can't fault the latte afterwards either. However, I feel like this may not be the best fare on offer at sketch.... I looked around and saw a party enjoying their afternoon tea and thought, I must come back to enjoy some of that. Also, I had a peek at their various other rooms including the plush Gallery, I made furious mental notes on where to book for my next meal here... this time, it was an A-OK meal, but next time, I suspect it'll be better!
PS - Also, my experience of the place may have been coloured by the company... when you have a group of 6 who have placed more or less similar orders, just split the bill equally. I mean, really. Stop tallying up the individual items you ate...especially if you have so much freaking cash to eat here in the first place. And especially if the final sum you pay is more or less similar to everyone else's...this is a pet peeve, clearly.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Elegance embodied. 
Sketch is an interior designer's paradise. The attention to detail is magnificent. Several, individually themed rooms create an unparalleled, multidimensional experience. 
The service is faultless. The staff have evidently been well trained. 
This review is focused just on the drinks. Unfortunately my cocktail wasn't up to standard, especially considering the staggering £15. 
The truth is, you don't come to Sketch for the food or the drink. You come to soak up the ambience and bask in its beauty.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I made reservation on their website in advance. I love the place since I walked in to the place. The place is well-decorated and classy. We had booked the afternoon for $45 per person. The tea were just okay but their cakes and very tasty, you can have unlimited tea for 2 hrs. The portion for the afternoon tea is a lot, we couldn't finish the whole thing but you can definitely take them to go! I would say the place is a bit pricey for afternoon tea, but for the experience is definitely worth the money! Forgot to mention, their toilet is so pretty and fancy!  I LOVE IT! So, overall, Sketch is definitely an experience!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Afternoon tea at Sketch is a sight to behold. The room alone is breathtaking. We were greeted with a saucer of champagne, which was soon followed by the afternoon tea. The sandwiches were unlimited and personally, my favourite part of the meal. The tiers were followed by warm scones and more tea. An amazing experience, by far the best afternoon tea I have had. The service was impeccable. The knowledge provided by the waitress was fantastic. The atmosphere was great and the interior is stunning. The bathroom is out-of-this world- like something from Alien! Each cubicle is an egg.
My only criticism would be that they try and convince you to order more champagne again and again, as this is obviously not included in the £65 afternoon tea price.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"This place is so deeply vapid - it feels like its sole purpose is as a location for instagram photos, not to actually experience anything or engage with your friends. The space is interesting but the lack of windows and self-consciously cool decor makes it feel a little like Vegas or Disney World. The food was fine but definitely didn't make up for the unpleasant vibe and the service was not great - both of the tables next to us were told they needed to hurry up ahead of the next seating. We could not wait to leave - find somewhere else for an English tea.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"...probably really cool 10 years ago. The food was just not there in taste and presentation, especially for the price. The pink velvet chairs had layers of dirt building up, really should focus on cleaning up the entire act. I cringed when I realized the toilets were built openly on top of domed bar. The witty writing under the food on the plate was faded. It's just a dying brand, really outdated in every way.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Most amazing afternoon tea of my whole entire life! They bring you extras of whatever you want from the tea for free. My one regret is that I wish I had more time to enjoy it. Carve out a whole afternoon for this experience! The decor, fashion , dishes, staff, music are all inspiring and creative. Don't miss out on using their restrooms! It was an out of this world experience that I can only liken unto a more sophisticated Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but that totally doesn't do it justice.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,One of the most eclectic places I have ever been. Each dining and bar room (including the bathroom) has a different theme that ranges from Victorian to a spaceship. Makes for a great photo opportunity with friends and the drinks were spot on too.  Kick the kettle and Benoit bulleit hit the spot... Ask for them to ease up on the basil syrup though as it can be a little on the sweet side.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"So much fun that I'm giving this place 5 stars. This restaurant is by far one of my favorite places. It's an amazing experience you won't find elsewhere. There are different rooms to choose from and they have the coolest starship inspired restroom. My family and I had dinner at the gallery. They have the nicest waiters and waitresses who give the best service. The food was fine, I ordered fish and chips and my family ordered the udon noodles. The food wasn't too amazing, it was just fine. But, the restaurant and the experience was amazing and is why this place deserves 5 stars! They really should think about opening more locations, because this place is awesome!!",1

The visual concept is beyond creative  in every room, right down to the bathrooms. Me putting it into words does not do it justice! I just can't do it justice with my words. Sketch is a place you need to experience, and see for yourself. I hope you enjoy as much as I did!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The bathrooms alone were worth the trip for afternoon tea. While expensive, we received the highest quality service.

Not so much, but this is a fun place to take friends, especially ones visiting from the other side of the pond. I love pretending I'm British, after merely having lived in London, and Sketch is one of those places that can forgive an American for her fake British accent provided that copious amounts of wine are consumed.
And copious amounts of wine SHOULD be consumed. This is London. And this is Soho baby.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Came here for afternoon tea during the Christmas menu. It was about $100 USD total/person. There was an assortment of pastries, but I didn't find any that were very surprisingly unique. There was also a wide assortment of tea to pick from. Everything was refillable. It might be that we booked the last afternoon tea reservation of the day, but we only had 2 hours for our afternoon tea and I felt a bit rushed to consume everything. The servers were nice and told us we could stay as long as needed, but it felt a little awkward when the room started emptying and people started coming in for dinner. I felt like the afternoon tea place is more known for the cute pink room atmosphere, the christmas choir singing, and the egg shaped toilet bathrooms than the actual food.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"My flatmate and I visited Sketch a few moths ago and loved it. Every room is beautifully designed and the bathrooms are amazing! 
We had breakfast which was very small and not great to be honest but the tea and cakes more than made up for it. I highly recommend the 'London to Paris'.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Yes, the loos are cool, but is that really the first thing you should say in a restaurant review?
Some of the food was really good, like the lamb (which I got to try because my friend only ate half of it due to her tiny appetite. She is an awesome friend). Chantilly lace was a bit weird. Beef tartare was quite good but it didn't really need so many things going on with it. Just the raw meat is fine. Slightly raw fondant potato was not so fine. Banana and lime macaroon was so incredibly good, I absolutely loved it. So basically they need a little more consistency and to let the flavours speak for themselves [disclaimer: I have no idea what I am talking about].
Their website looks like it was made by a 15 year old internet nerd in 1997. Why do so many restaurant/bar websites make noises of some kind? So much inexplicable animation...
The decor...I liked the tree made of toys. And the paintings made of forks and other random items. I can't work out if it's being wanky in a tacky way, or tacky in a wanky way. Either way, it was a pretty fun experience!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"Been to Parlour once for drink and really liked the vibe, so I decided to take a friend there for her birthday to check out the mysterious and fancy library. I liked where I had my food, but I didn't enjoy what I had to eat. 
I was finally allowed behind the velvet rope and led upstairs to the library. I really liked the ambiance with beautiful high ceilings and one side of the dining room with floor to ceiling tainted mirrors. I also like the eclectic furniture style. 
We had the tasting menu which took almost 3 hours to finish and I wasn't satisfied in the end: 
- We had quite a strong beginning: a nice spread of tiny and delicate finger food of tart and jelly and cheese puffs. I was immediately full of anticipation of what's to come, only to find the experience to be going downhill. 
- First off, I had the sea bream and cuttlefish on black olive jelly. Obviously, the jelly was pre-made and put in the fridge and they just put the fish on top when someone orders it. It was quite blend. 
- Then came the red prawns which was actually quite good. 
- Foie Gras ravioli came after. I am a big fan of foie gras and I was not very pleased that they actually screw this one up. First off, putting foie gras in ravioli means it is not off the best quality, otherwise, you will never mess with it that way; secondly it was in a curry sauce which overpowered the nature taste of foie gras. I was not a happy camper. 
- Roasted pollock. It was a nice piece of roasted fish, and there was a bit of a surprise as escargot was used in the sauce. 
- Veal with sweetbreads wrapped in lettuce. They were served separately and I was wondering what the connection of these two flavors were. 
-Lastly, we were presented with 6 Pierre Gagnaire's desserts. They all looked very pretty, but there was one problem: except for one or two, they were not made onsite. While it was great to try different types of desserts, I'd rather have one very good one that is made to order. Don't get me wrong, those desserts were nice and I would be perfectly happy if I were in a nice cafe, but for a tasting menu, they didn't cut it for me. 
They charge 95 pounds for a 6 course tasting menu, but I have tried much tastier and more creative menus at a cheaper price elsewhere.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Best afternoon tea I've been to in London. This one is worth a visit. The decor is fun (pink room and spaceship like toilets).,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Came here for afternoon tea and given all the hype came away with the impression that this is exactly the sort of place that makes people hate London. The tea (£39 a head) is in a room that is head-to-toe pink - it feels overwhelmingly like you're sitting in a blancmange prison. Everyone mentions the toilets, which are startling and apparently modelled on a Hollywood version of a celestial waiting room (or an Austin Powers set) with wall-to-wall white, individual egg shaped pods (mine didn't seem to quite seal itself, meaning I had to keep a paranoid grip on the door handle for fear of becoming a victim of latrinus interruptus) and the inexplicable inclusion of loo attendants in full French maid kit. 
The sandwiches are petite and with the exception of the salmon and caviar offering (whose caviar topping offers a welcome burst of intense flavour), sadly rather tame in the flavour department. The asparagus in the cucumber sandwich lacked any seasoning whatsoever, and the mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur was surprisingly greasy and tasteless.
The scones and cream were probably the best thing about the whole meal - the scones are large and came to the table still warm, albeit with not quite enough clotted cream to go round. The fig jam was also delicious (and I say that as someone with a long time antipathy towards jam in general). 
The cake selection is disappointingly free of British flavours and the cakes themselves are horrifyingly small - the coffee eclair was about the size of my little finger (and I have relatively slim digits) and the raspberry meringue...let's just say I've seen bigger engagement rings. Call me a greedy beggar, but if you can eat it in one mouthful, it's not a cake, it's a petit fours, or in this case, a disappointment. Both the pistachio macaroon and the berry tartlet could have been quite delicious but (like so much else about Sketch) suffered from a wearying overkill with the addition of an unnecessary berry jam/compote in the middle. 
You do at least get free tea refills, but the staff dropped the ball by bringing my flowering tea out after it had infused, thereby denying me the visual pleasure of watching it bloom (which is pretty much the whole point of ordering a flowering tea).
Overall, I might have been reasonably content with the food were it not for the disproportionate price tag which appears to be a function of the achingly pretentious interiors and service. Call me old-fashioned, but I'd much rather have my food served up by polite, friendly professional wait staff without legions of wannabe models floating around purposelessly in utilitarian chic shirt dresses.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,it's okay. Too touristy. Head over to the Gilbert Scott for afternoon tea.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I came here with my cousins for afternoon tea as we wanted something a bit different. Located in a fabulously renovated townhouse in the heart of Mayfair, this is definitely worth a try. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The afternoon tea was a mixture of traditional sandwiches and modern interpretations of cakes. Thoroughly recommended and a real highlight from my visit.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I came here for afternoon tea and it was delicious. The scones were excellent as was the service and ambiance. Afternoon tea is a great way to enjoy Sketch on a cheap budget but still get to experience it.
ALSO, while I was there my friend and I sat right next to Billy Zane and Bill Paxton! They were in town for the Titanic 3D premiere I suppose. So now you have an extra endorsement from them to go to Sketch!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This is the most unusual Michelin starred restaurant I have visited in London so far.  It looks like a trendy nightclub at the entrance (I think there is a bar on the ground floor).  We were led past the velvet rope, up the stair case and went past a few heavy curtains to arrive at The Lecture Room where our table was waiting.
Their surroundings are just what I want to see in this kind of restaurant.  Rich, colourful carpets and decorations flowing with luxury.  Comfy seats.  Dining here is an experience. The service was friendly and efficient, not stuffy. They made some jokes with us, which makes a nice difference.  We also got a mini menu to take home with us.  Another nice touch.
We opted for the 7 course tasting menu. There was a vegetarian tasting menu and a la carte options available too.
Breads. Served in a bowl, warm and crusty, but there was only one type of bread. There were two butters: citrus and a regular one.  The citrus one didn't quite sit right, it tasted like you were eating a lemon creme biscuit.
Amuse bouches.  A mini macaron with blue cheese cream, a disc of goat cheese and a mini roll which tasted like melon.  There was also a little bowl of crunchy parmesan bites.
Earth and sea 3. Great contrasts of flavours and textures. Looked like a raviolo, but it was a blanket of cuttlefish over the other ingredients (squid, pineapple and crunchy fennel). I liked the look of the mini lettuce filled with crab meat.
Crayfish served with onion and turmeric jus. Came with spelt which gave the disk a nice texture.  The crayfish was obviously the hero of the dish and were tasty morsels.
Pascaline.  I'm not sure what pascaline is (!) but this dish was firmly based around scallops, which I love.  We had fried scallops and fresh (raw) mushrooms on top of a scallop mousse and a mushroom sauce.  It tasted just as it sounds. I liked the scallop mousse the most.
Hake, Savoy cabbage and razor clams. Nicely cooked fish and cabbage, I liked the clams. They were like prizes. The crumb coating on the fish tasted like lawn, which is not a bad thing.
Jellied sardine, fois gras, celeriac, frozen raspberries. This was the most interesting looking dish of the night, with the huge cubes of jelly and the star-shaped dish.  Unfortunately, it was not entirely my cup of tea, but it had solid flavours.  It felt like a lot of sardine jelly to get through.  I would have preferred simply fried sardines, but I could see how this may have been too close in nature to the previous course.
Hereford beef fillet, with turnip gratin and crispy aubergine.  The beef was cooked nicely, but for me the most interesting part was the cripsy vegetable chip on top.
Pierre Gagnaire's Grand Dessert.  This was six desserts which came out on separate plates, 3 at a time.  They covered a wide range of tastes and textures, with my favourites being the chocolate ones.
Petits fours.  There was a jelly, a mini tart and a chocolate.  Nice, but not too special.
I had been looking forward to our visit here for weeks, but when the date arrived I had been sick for a couple of days and had a sore throat.  It was a shame because I wouldn't have got the full taste experience.  It was an expensive meal, but in line with my price expectations.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I'll be upfront, the stars are mostly for the decor and the bathrooms. I love a good bathroom design and these are some crazy ass wonderful ones.
The food was surprisely good but way overpriced for the portions size and ingredients. You are paying for the decor and what decor it is. Over the top in all ways both good and bad. 
I came here for lunch so I can't rate the dinner service. The tea service was also going on while I was there and it looked quite nice if I on the dainty side. I would still like to try it as would I like to try the overpriced dinner service.
I ate lunch in the parlour, it's probably the most boring room but still charming, there is the main dining room which was closed for lunch and the garden room which is very charming and of course the toilet which are egg-like free standing pod in a elevated white platform. 
I got the haddock souffle which was surprisingly good if very overpriced at 14 pounds but compared to the 46 pound dishes on the dinner menu, it's steal.
The service was horrible even more so since they automatically add a ""discretionary"" 12 percent service fee which as a North American I would have a hard time asking a server to remove. But seriously the manager had to yell at the server to actually come over and take my order as well as the person next to me. I had to flag them down to get the bill and this was in a room with only four table occupied. It was my first time encountering a discretionary fee being added to the bill without my approval although it appears to be a horrible trend in service lacking London. Again if you are going to charge for service, you need to actually provide it.  
So if you want to check out the decor without spending the big buck eat in the Parlour.
The bathrooms are not in any way wheelchair accessible and the whole space is not designed for any kind of accessiblity.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Lindsey in Wonderland!!!!!  Lindsey in Wonderland!!!!!
Sketch is like my own personal fantasy:  delicious tea and scones, with a side of over the top Alice in Wonderland decor.  And don't even get me started on the space pod bathrooms (I'm sorry England - toilets).  ^see several photos posted above
You'll spend more than a pretty penny here but it's worth a trip at least once.  Don't forget to book your reservation a week out or more, this place is popular!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,This restaurant is a beautiful venue with amazing service and food to match. The afternoon tea is such great value. The sandwiches were different and the quail egg stood out with its slight mustard twang. The macaroons were faultless and the small delicate lemon éclairs just exploded in your mouth with so much flavour. I also went for a seasonal cocktail and it was probably one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time. (Visit - 29/11/2014 Lunch),1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"9 Conduit Street in Mayfair, London.
If you are into food, art, fashion design, or architecture, then you may be familiar with the address. The opulent townhome has served as the headquarters for the Royal Society of British Architects, the atelier of Christian Dior, and is currently home to the 2 star Michelin-rated French restaurant run by Executive Chef, Pierre Gagnaire.
Even if French food isn't your cup of tea, if your pockets are deep enough, I suggest that you at least pay a visit to check out the unique ambiance. The décor is parallel to none; with each room in the space taking you on a journey that is evocative of trippy dream. There are three different dining rooms--each one offering a different menu and price point--as well as two ultra posh cocktail lounges. The whole venue is a riot of color and an onslaught to the senses. But the loud and quirky design makes this Michelin restaurant feel, dare I say, comfortable?!
After studying all of the menus, I chose to dine at the Gallery, which is the more informal restaurant space with more reasonably priced menu items. British artist, Martin Creed, has transformed the space into a serviceable museum of modern art with eclectic chairs and one-of-a-kind dinnerware.
To start, I ordered the Chestnut Velouté with white truffle oil, and pan-fried squid sautéed with garlic and cherry tomatoes (£15). It was velvety, rich, and every bit delicious. I cleared the bottom of my bowl with the trio of freshly baked breads that were brought to the table (£4).
The second appetizer that I tried was the Dublin bay prawn tempura with haricot beans and aubergine, accompanied by an Osframpi sauce (£25). The prawns were delicious but sadly, there were only three of them--typical French portions! I didn't expect the vegetables would also be deep fried, and I found them a bit bourgeois in contrast to the otherwise haute cuisine. The osframpi sauce was magical, however, due in part to the fact that I've never tasted one before. Essentially, it is a puree of wild berries balanced with some sort of lemon acidity to cut the sweetness. I did not use it for the prawns, but rather as a spread for the breadbasket.
For my entrée, I ordered the Cannon of lamb roasted en crépine, Niçoise socca, swiss chard pomponette (£28). The lamb was cooked to perfection and the sauce dressing the plate was to die for, but I have had better cuts of meat before. I cleared the plate none-the-less, which easy to do at a French restaurant--oftentimes in just two bites!
There was little hesitation when it came to choosing a dessert; naturally, I opted for the chocolate one: Sketch Chocolat, which is a dark chocolate box filled with vanilla cream, nougatine, dried fruits, caramel syrup and coffee genoise. On the side, of the box was a little shooter filled with pistachio ice cream with pineapple and mango coulis (£10). I also got the suggested after-dinner drink, The Whisk Away, made with Laphroaig Whisky and Kalua (£7). The coffee notes in the dessert and cocktail complimented one another beautifully.
All in all, Sketch is about the experience: the art, the atmosphere, the service, the exotic bathrooms! Sure, the food is very, very good, but it is the ambiance that is over-the-top. I would certainly return, possibly in some high heels next time, with slightly lower expectations of the food.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Never disappoints !!!I love visiting this place , its classy with a very different artistic touch !! The food is always good with a consistent quality that have not changed for as many years as i visit it !! I know every one says that , the bathrooms are a must visit !!!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Cute afternoon tea spot. I think this had to be one of the more interesting dining experiences. This place is massive, varietal and just overall a fun experience. 
Afternoon tea was an absolute delight with some of the better looking and nicer waitresses we've encountered in London. Its not your typical proper ladies tea out but this is just an opposite spectrum of how whimsy tea could be. 
Definitely a splurge but one worth doing if this your first time in London (like us).",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,Go for the decor and the incredible bathrooms. I'd say that the brunch fare was quite good. It's not necessarily exceptional (although some members of my party had tea and scones and I was thoroughly jealous). The prices were consistent with other restaurants in Central London. I must reiterate--check out the bathrooms. They were so much fun. The different dining rooms also added a kick of fun to what was an otherwise cold and dreary English day. The cappuccinos were strong--excellent for a mid-day boost after a tiring morning flight. The toast with butter came with a good selection of spreads.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"This review only applies to the Parlour. Sketch is one of those places that would almost be most enjoyed if no one had ever told you about the details of it's decorations and you stumble upon it yourself. Although this restaurant has apparently been a London classic for nearly 10 years, I first learned of this restaurant after making a reservation for Pierre Gagnaire's original restaurant in Paris. When I asked around, everyone in London described that it's decoration alone is worth a visit, especially the loos. I jumped on this chance when I had friends in town who wanted to meet for breakfast (reservations taken before noon at the Parlour).  
The Parlour is probably the most tamed/classic of all the rooms. It is a tea room and stays true to that. A walk through the other rooms and the design element didn't disappoint. I'd say imaginative, arty, and eclectic (part Sandusky hotel, part vintage). I wish no one had told me about the loos and left me to discover it myself, so I'll leave out details here. 
A few other patrons were having afternoon tea and it looked decent. We ordered lunch (burger, tartare and salads) and it was OK. 4 stars for the decor (even with the hype) and 3 stars for the Parlour food. Tea selection was good.  I think you take Sketch for what it is. Perfect for bringing guests looking for a surprise element but I wouldn't go for those looking for a classic Chez Gagnaire food experience. In fact, I don't even think I'd recommend it if guests were looking for one single London must-try.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Go for the spectacle of it all, but the substance is lacking. There is not much behind the pink walls full of ""art"" and the Mork from Ork eggs as wash room stalls. Serviceable food and adequate service. Ironically the best way to describe this place walked in as I was leaving. A dapperly dressed man with his dog in tow trying to remain aloof and indifferent, while his every move is screaming, ""Hey, look at me!""  This restaurant is just trying too darn hard.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,I've been to sketch four or five times and have loved it every time. Fantastic service and exquisite food! Hopefully back soon again!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This restaurant is all about the experience. It is like dining in a modern art gallery. We sat in the room in the front of the restaurant that was a mixture of strange items and art pieces. As far as I could tell, there are two more rooms in the restaurant. One looked like a forest. The last one was bright pink. The restrooms are an experience too!
As far as food, that is why the restaurant gets one star off. It's not that the food was bad, it just wasn't great. We started off with a tomato soup and bread brought in a Lego basket. Then, I had both the pate and foie gras burger. Both were fine, but not exceptional. The presentation on both was phenomenal. We had dessert as well which was unremarkable. 
Overall, just because this restaurant provides such a trippy experience, it's worth going to.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Came here for an afternoon tea on a beautiful Thursday afternoon. 
First things first, the price: £34/person x 1.125 (service charge) + £1 (donation to KidsCo). So you're looking at around £78 for two people. That's about the price of an afternoon tea at any of the nice hotels in the area - so if you're feeling a bit adventurous or forgot to adhere to the dress code, this is the place to go!
There is a great selection of  teas: I got the white tea, and it was the right bit of flavor - and didn't get too concentrated as the water ran low. 
The assortment of desserts and sandwiches was unique, my favorite dessert being the strawberry cheesecake and my favorite sandwich being the asparagus sandwich. The scone was spot on. 
We sat in the parlor room, which had a very interesting chandelier and paintings that demand more than a passing glance. The servers were nice and attractive, though slightly slow. The highlight of the afternoon was the egg bathroom and its two French maids. I never thought I would say a bathroom would be the highlight of a dining experience. 
Definitely worth going back to when friends are in town.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"You can't write a review of this place without mentioning the toilets and the lego-brick bread boxes.
Went in for dinner, and had a wonderful time.  Would definitely return.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Sketch is a splurge, no doubt about it. Be aware of the price point.
I'm glad we booked up in the Lecture Room; when we got a tour of the rest of the premises, the other dining rooms were much louder, much more buzzy, and much less, well, classy. (Also, the pod bathrooms are cute, but they didn't smell or look particularly clean on a Saturday night; I'm glad that the Lecture Room had its own facilities, which were bling-tastic but impeccably clean.)
When I visit a new place like this, I generally opt for the tasting menu to get a broad sweep of the chef's style. The food here is very much nouvelle Continental. You won't encounter anything particularly exotic or flamboyant, but you can generally depend on classic flavours done right.
I felt that some of the menu items shone, like the venison, whilst others were a touch off base. A couple of the sauces were too bland, and the kamut (or spelt; I can't actually recall) was overly salty. Portions were small, as expected, but very slow to arrive; overall, we were there nearly five hours, including the 20-30min tour of the building, which is quite a long time for a seven-course meal.
Service was mostly impeccable. One of the waiters was less than willing to make a substitution for one member of our party, which was a touch off, but the chef came up with a compromise. Likewise, the sommelier butted heads with me on a few of the wine choices, despite my explaining to him that I was choosing them to be in line with the more conservative palates at the table.
Dessert was visually pretty but all components were overly sweet and not particularly refined. 
I would have liked to have seen a greater overarching story to the meal; instead, it felt like individual components cobbled together in only a roughly increasing degree of intensity rather than gastronomic cohesion.
Enjoyable, and a good choice for a celebratory dinner, but I can't say that any of the dishes were memorable enough to make me rush back.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"Terrible service, mediocre food, weird and tacky decor. I had a manager guy drop an entire glass of cocktail on my back and got no real apologies. I ordered their special duck dish for 2 but it was not good. took us 30 mins to get our coats back at the door because of all the clubbers coming in. Terrible experience.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"If you want to go and take a pee in an egg shaped toilet cubicle whilst hearing the sound of birds humming in your ear then THIS IS YOUR PLACE! BOOM! Be prepared to reenact a scene from the film Cocoon when venturing to the bathrooms. (Anyone growing up in the 80s + visited sketch has done that, right!?) Now on to more important things (just), we visited Sketch for afternoon tea recently. The room is extremely quirky and the 'sketches' on the wall had my 5 year old inner self in stitches. The waiting staff were on the boarder of being rude, nobody was exuding a fluffy pink mood to match the room sadly (I would have happily paid extra if the waitresses were dressed in a pink care bear outfit - imagine that!). The food was good - egg sandwiches are always a winner and nice to have vegetarian options for afternoon tea. Tea was out of a tea bag, not PG tips mind but still out of a bag. I would expect tea leaves for the money you pay and destination. Rose champagne was £17.50 a glass so make sure you start saving up those golden nuggets! I went with my mum and would definitely visit again with friends. More of a girls club than with partners.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"This place is pretty cool. The pink decor and overall atmosphere definitely creates a lovely setting for a relaxed afternoon.
Food and tea wise it was good. Although the sandwiches and cakes etc are small there is plenty of them and you wont leave hungry, you also have unlimited refills. 
With regards to the tea, I don't actually drink it. but I was there as part of a girls day out and my 3 other friends said it was ok, nothing amazing but I did notice a lot of different flavors to choose from though.
The reason I'm giving it just 2 stars is because of the excessive cost.
Our cost was £68 pp, typically it is £45 pp but it was higher than normal because it was Wimbledon week. We were aware of the cost at booking and decided to go ahead as there was a different package on offer reflecting Wimbledon. These ""extras"" was the bathroom attendant was dressed as a ball girl and there was a live feed from the tennis matches coming thru the speakers in said bathrooms......that was it. We each paid £23 EXTRA for that.
The real humdinger was when we got our bill an additional £12 pp was already included in our total as a discretionary tip! 
As I said it is a really nice place, decor, food, staff - no complaints. If we had received something extra reflecting the extra cost incurred I'd be really happy. For now it just feels like a rip off.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,Outrageously overpriced for well presented but bland food with mediocre service.  Don't try to impress anyone by bringing them here...,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"we had the afternoon tea in this nice restaurant, especially the toilet of it. It's a special restaurant, even though the food is not that amazing.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I visited Sketch not too long ago for afternoon tea.. and at £44 per head, I can't say I was highly impressed.
The interiors and decor are definitely incredible and nothing like your average London hangout. I agree with some of the other reviews, it has an Alice in Wonderland feel with quirky messages written on the teapot and at the bottom of the cup. 
I must be very boring, as the sandwiches and cakes didn't leave me wanting more probably because of their unique combinations. In fact, at times I often just finished what was on my plate because of the price! The toilets are jaw dropping to look at and each 'cubicle' is in the shape of an egg (bit claustrophobic though).
The staff were friendly and showed us to our table when we arrived. They also provided extra tea but were a bit difficult to get a hold of when it came to asking for the bill. 
Can't say I'll be coming back here again but I am glad I've visited as it's another place I can check off my list.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I went to the Gallery with a friend for dinner last week. Overall, my experience at Sketch was memorable, but I still wouldn't say it was worth the price tag, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. One thing I must say is the service was top-notch. The staff was attentive and very helpful in their recommendations. They seemed to be genuinely interested in making our dining experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible. The ambiance is absolutely lovely. The pictures don't really do it justice. It is truly a Gallery as the name would suggest - very colorful and beautiful without seeming over-stylized and tacky. Also, check out the bathrooms! One of the coolest bathrooms I have ever been in in my life.
Overall, the food was pretty good, not mind-blowing. My friend and I each got a cocktail, a starter, a main, and a dessert. The dishes were inventive on paper, but didn't seem all that different from what you could get at a number of restaurants in London for a much better price tag. Given that the hype and the ambiance was so unique and fresh, I was expecting the food to exhibit the same qualities. This wasn't the case and I paid a premium for it. 
I would say if you're looking for a great scene with decent food and don't mind the price tag, try Sketch out. I may come back, but it will likely be only for drinks or their afternoon tea. Again, I may have ordered badly, so I'm not ruling this one out entirely. :)",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,Apart from the funky toilets it wasn't all that. I still had to go somewhere else for food because the portions for were soo small. It is a very posh place and is good for the experience but the food didn't justify the price.,-1

Décor is enjoyable (although now looking a bit tatty in places), food is really poor and at silly prices for the quality of the kitchen - let me make that clear: FOOD IS REALLY POOR AND AT SILLY PRICES FOR THE QUALITY OF THE KITCHEN - service is obnoxious (but possibly in a slightly funny and characterful way - the stroppy cloakroom woman with attitude was hilarious).  Probably best for a drink in one of the louche and atmospheric bars.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,I was expecting a little more glamorous atmosphere. Instead it was pretty sweaty and smelly in some of the rooms. For that amount of money I have been to more appropriate places. Design and decorations there were really cool though.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"I think this place has 5* for novelty factor. But I was very disappointed with the actual content of the sandwiches. There was very little filling in them, despite looking the part. I also thought it was very expensive for what it is. The one bonus is that they are happy to bring you more sandwiches and cakes and don't charge you extra.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,A feast for the eyes!  The different rooms are incredibly decorated.  Very different feel in each.  I had dessert there and it was a work of art.  The service was like no other.  Great music and great atmosphere.  A must!,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I've been to Sketch's restaurant a couple of times for lunch and really enjoyed it - as well as the food, I love the decor and the theatre of it all. I'd highly recommend lunch there on a sunny day - when they whisk you up the stairs and throw open the doors onto the dining room, the light and colour is just spectacular. 
I think this was also the first place I dined where my handbag was brought it's very own seat at the table, which was a delightful touch, and made it feel so special! 
I've had afternoon tea in the parlour before too, which is fun, although usually very busy. But it was only recently that I noticed they also do a breakfast/ brunch menu (served until noon), so this review is primarily focusing on that.
I went for the Parlour Breakfast scrambled eggs and smoked salmon option, which is not my usual choice, but it was absolutely delicious. Beautifully served, the eggs were the perfect consistency, not too runny and not too firm. The salmon came in a separate side dish and was melt in your mouth delicate, with an accompaniment of lightly cooked tomatoes, and toast. 
I liked that all the constituent parts were on separate plates enabling you to build your own breakfast as you ate, and it meant that the toast stayed crunchy, the salmon kept cool and the tomatoes didn't leach into the eggs.
Other options include their take on a full English or continental breakfast, eggs benedict, pastries, porridge, muesli and fruit, so there's a decent, albeit fairly traditional, selection on offer.
And of course given their focus on afternoon tea, they have an extensive range of teas and herbal infusions available, although on this occasion I went for a cafetière of one of the ""rare and exotic"" coffees, which was just right. 
I will definitely be finding a reason to brunch here again!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"The Sketch is such an amazing and interresting place. It is the perfect place to enjoy a drink while you are mesmerized by what is surrounding you. 
The Parlour Room is this sort of bar that you'll be proud to show to your friends. Mix of Class and Cool!! 
The Egg bar, is just crazy, an Egg shape bar with the Egg toilets upstairs, it says it all. 
You Have to go there if You have been yet. One of the nicest place in London. My favourite place by far.  :)",1

The decor of the tea parlour is so soothing and its light pink. The bathroom is literally a jungle of dinosaur eggs, you go into an egg for the toilet haha!

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Sketch's recent £50 off deal meant I finally got to visit!
The Gallery's deco is very memorable and makes you feel like you are in a Wes Anderson film. The walls are covered in individual drawings which results in constant distractions.
The toilets are mad and are all in individual pods.
The food itself was ok, but if I had of paid full price I think I would have been a bit disappointed. I went for the ""fish and chips"" for main which was a good sized portion but a little too salty for my pallet. I went for a cheesecake for desert which again was ok, but nothing spectacular.
Overall an interesting experience but not somewhere I think it's really worth spending all that money on!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch is truly unique. 
People have described it as very ""Alice-in-Wonderland"", and that is appropriate.  Every room has it's own unique charm, theme, design.  The attention to detail is evident everywhere.  There is not a single light fixture, door knob, or texture in the place that hasn't been thoroughly thought-out.  You might not always agree with or like the thought process yourself personally...but you cannot deny that a creative mind was at work on each and every decision.
Possibly there might be better restaurants in London; possibly there might be more capable cocktail bartenders in London.  
But you will never set foot in a place like Sketch anywhere else in the world.  
It's worth the trip even if all you do is walk in, sit down, and order a soda.",1

My husband made a comment on his booking and they took it and ran.  Everyone that spoke to us knew we were celebrating.  So on to the restaurant itself.  I love it.  The food is amazing and the service is as good as the food.  We had foie grais to start and I had pork for main while my husband had the lamb.  It was so good but left us both so full we couldn't sample any of the cheese which looked amazing too.  The pork was sweet and juicy and just so tasty.  I love this place.,1

The three level tray of foods was amazing. There were curried chicken salad, ricotta and cucumber, grilled compte cheese and salmon sandwiches to choose from. The next two levels were different sorts of pastries - all delicious. My favorite was the pistachio. Next came scones with cottled cream and fig and strawberry jam. After that, was a special dessert of vanilla custard with rhubarb. Also, you can get more of anything you like for no additional cost!  Bathrooms super cool sleek white pods. Great neighborhood too right in Oxford Circus.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Ok, the toilets are amazeballs. This is probably the only reason I'd tell anyone to visit Sketch which is really quite wrong. Big giant pods with maids cleaning around it. A real-life bizarre dream. 
Sketch has different rooms with different atmospheres and a restaurant between the bars. The bar which you would first walk in has a calmer ambience with elegant yet crazy furniture. The room on the far end is very small and much darker with a bar in the middle of the room. The bar sits lower than the ground floor so that you are much taller than the barmen. 
Prices are quite shocking but the cocktails were nice. Definitely not amazing. And it took at least 25 minutes for two cocktails to come. 
The service was top notch. Great staff, handsome men at the doors and between each bar standing straight and elegantly.

Came here with a small group to celebrate my 32nd (ugh) birthday a couple weeks ago.  We had dinner in the Gallery.  Sketch is a larger building comprised of several different portions.  There's the Parlour where I believe they have afternoon tea, the Gallery, in which we sat and ate and gawked and marveled, upstairs is the Lecture Room which boasts a Michelin star.  There are also a couple smaller bar areas, one of which looks like you stepped into a fairy tale forest, and another which I unfortunately didn't discover!
The decor in the Gallery is everything I could ever aspire to dream of in a future home.  The furnishings are completely mismatched.  No fork looks like any other fork... same can be said for every other utensil, glass, chair, table, etc.  Oh, I love it so!  It's a feast for the eyes.
No complaints about the food or drink either.  I had the Chantilly Lace as a starter which is basically lobster bisque with a tiny tower of tri-colored rice in the middle which was black rice (squid ink), red pepper rice, and regular basmati rice.  It was fantastically delicious.  Roast leg of lamb main, which was basically tiny chunks of lamb with bean and a gorgeous broth, and the ""Lemon"" for dessert.  It's just called ""Lemon.""  And it delivers on the name.  Again, every plate is a carefully constructed work of art.  I wish I could shake the hand of that pastry chef because man, was that Lemon something to see.
As we were leaving, a gentleman caught me and a friend gawking at the art (which we found it is commissioned specifically for Sketch), and quickly started telling us how he'd worked there for years and Sketch was his passion and he very nicely showed us around to the rest of the building!  He snuck us upstairs to the Lecture Room and let us peek in, told us the history of the building (it used to be the House of Dior), and told us more about the art and showed us the equally spectacular bathrooms on the upper floor which are meant to be the inside of a jewelry box.  Quite the contrast from the crazy insane egg-pod bathrooms near the Gallery (all bathrooms attended by ladies in stereotypical ""french maid"" outfits, bee tee dubs).
My only complaint is that they were completely out of their famed hot chocolate!  Oh well, guess I'll just have to make my way back.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"It was a really quirky dinner and great waiting staff. Great food, not as pretentious as expected but definitely on the pricier side - but was a special occasion so glad that we did try it out. May not make it a regular visit though - too many other quirky places to go in London!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I give this quirky spot 4 stars for atmosphere and friendly service. It is almost impossible to describe what Sketch looks like. You must go and see it for yourself. And don't miss the bizarre, but fun bathrooms. That said, this was the most expensive drink I have ever had. Wayyyyy overpriced.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,1,"If I could pick zero stars, I would. We came to London for 5 days for Christmas and picked sketch for our last night as it was so highly recommended. We were highly disappointed with our experience. We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived on time and were seated right away with barely a greeting or a smile. The waitress hastily dropped our menus and walked away. When she came back to take our drink order she was visibly annoyed when my sister and I (we were with our mother) requested sparkling water and no cocktails (my mom ordered a martini). It was clear that from this point forward we were an afterthought as we were not a high ""money making/bill running"" table (since we were not planning to drink.) As she kindly described the menu and specials to other tables around us as they sipped their cocktails, we were simply asked if we were ready. We ordered at 9:40 after being asking twice and our meal was delivered by 9:50. It was clear our table was being rushed out the door to turn us over quickly. we felt very upset as this was our last night and we wanted an experience and not to be rushed in and out. My mother asked to speak with a manager and he was so arrogant and rude that it was inexplicable. the customer is never right at sketch!!! he gave her a great deal of attitude when she explained she felt upset. The whole staff was pretentious and rude  and this restaurant is HIGHLY OVERRATED. Not worth it, an awful experience and highly overpriced with a disrespectful staff to match. Besides the awful service, the food was nothing to write home about either.
Don't waste your time or money!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"CRAZY AMAZING place !!!!
Everybody should go there at least one time !!!
The better time is from 17:30 to 18:30 like that you can visit the 2 different toilets and all the crazy rooms. Ask for information about the design and decors.
The waiters are very nice and happy to tell the story of each room :)
Oh and the tea and food is just PERFECT :)",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Sketch is an interesting place with a bizarre layout and atmosphere which makes for an intriguing visit. 
In the evenings it becomes a lively bar. I'm sure the atmosphere is different during the afternoon. 
The few evenings which I've been the music has been good with lots of space, seating and tables in the main room.  
We enjoyed spending time in the small intimate room at the back of the bar which almost feels as if you're inside a padded space capsule.
A quick visit to the bathrooms upstairs and you will find bathroom pods which resemble something out of a James Cameron film. Well that is until you spot the scantily dressed French maids cleaning round the pods :)
Trying to get bar service at Sketch always proves very difficult for us and other patrons. The wait time seems obscene no matter which room you go to or what you are ordering.
All in all it's worth the visit because of it being totally weird!",-1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"The place is cool; the ambiance more hip than we could ever be; and the food is very good but not great. We had the shrimp, the veal and a couple of appetizers.  All were good but they were not as interesting or as memorable as the room and the place settings.
So, no five stars but definitely worth a trip.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"We enjoyed afternoon tea here at the parlour room. Very hip, out of this world, chic, & artsy. loved it there! Conveniently located by oxford street...what a great way to unwind & relax after an afternoon of shopping. We had the ""cream tea"" which consisted of fresh fruit scones served with jam & clotted cream & your choice of teas. They brought out an individual tea set & tray for each of us, super cute. and we enjoyed free wi-fi as well! the bathrooms were way cool. wish i had the opportunity to check out the different sections of the restaurant...definitely will be back here if i'm back in london!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Lasting impressions of Sketch (I merely came here for a quick snack) - awesome hot chocolate, the most beautiful restrooms I have ever seen (probably the only times i would stop to take a picture in the restroom), and one of the most glamorous/hipster places in London.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I feel late in jumping on the Sketch bandwagon, because like, everyone I know who does food/restaurants in London has already been here, but I recently came for lunch in the parlour with a friend before he moved. I convinced him to come because ""you can't leave London without eating at Sketch,"" and based on my previous suggestions for our meals out, he was interested.
First impressions were good--the host was very nice and realized who I was despite my lost looking-ness, and directed me by name to my friend. That's the kind of thing you want to stick in people's minds.
The parlour itself is beautiful, like a funky dream place from Alice and Wonderland. Filled with interesting things to look at, we tucked into a table near the window and enjoyed the sun while we waited for our orders to be taken.
Here's the tough part: we waited.
At a place like Sketch, especially for lunch on a Thursday where the parlour is maybe 1/3 full, waiting shouldn't be part of the equation. Much less should we have had to flag down service each time we wanted something.
We ordered the burger, chips, and the macaroni cheese. I was pleased with my mac-cheese, but my friend was disappointed in the size of his burger. As a guy, I understand, because it was nowhere near enough to fill a person, much less for the prices we were paying. I especially dislike letting down people with my recommendations, which is another strike in my mind.
The decoration is of course cool--I had the chance to walk through and look at the other dining rooms on the way to the coolest bathroom in London (though I do have an issue with the idea of having such an obviously hip, gender-neutral bathroom color coded in pink and blue... stereotyping much?? What about individuals who don't identify as ""blue"" or ""pink""?). It seems like a nice place for a really great experience, at a really high price. I will probably be back to see the dining rooms in action one night... but it's only for the visual experience, not the eating or customer service.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"When you go to Sketch, you're going for the ""complete dining experience"". And I'll admit, it's fun and interesting. The gallery is hilarious, the maid costumes quirky and the bathrooms are amazing. That being said, the food is average, bordering on bad. I had the risotto, and I know, don't order risotto, but I thought I'd give it a test. Horrible choice. The rice was actually just hard. I'd expect with the price tag, we could at least get this right....",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"wow, sketch, way to be out of this world.  the first room, big fairly quaint...we ordered a melbec...not good.  This place is a members only...which means pay your dues or know someone....lucky me, i knew someone.  This place is like a weird time warp plus art gallery...think allison wonderland weird tea party with an andy warhole exhibit...noting that neither of these has anything to do with sketch.  
The two rooms towards the back, interesting and different.  Looks like they took some painting from a midsummers night dreams, enlarged it and threw it on the wall.  The other room turns into a weird seventies v-neck sweater vest pattern...and the very back bar...looks like some star trec weird modern bar....which serves amazing cocktails...order the herman something...good dj, though no one was dancing.  London? Do you hate dancing?  WTF?? The bathrooms are located above the star trec submarine, and they are eggy like latrines...seriously its bizarre.  That, in fact, is the most relevant thing i've typed.  Sketch is bizarre and yet sort of cool.  The kind of place you want to know about so you can tell your friends, but maybe not go yourself...again...",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Reading the great reviews I feel like I visited a different place! The ambiance is certainly interesting, unique and an experience. The service is excellent. Everyone is really great, very attentive, helpful, kind - I cannot fault it anywhere. The only thing I would suggest is perhaps follow the good reviews on here and go for afternoon tea. We went for dinner and left unimpressed, which is a real shame. The starters were good but the main dish (we both got the same - chicken fricassee) was bland and flavorless. It was as if the chicken was boiled. Perhaps the other dishes are better. As for desserts, 1 was really great (praline/hazelnut one) while the Sketch chocolate dessert left much to be desired. Perhaps it comes down to choice -and if you make better choices the experience will be far more enjoyable.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch London - We were in London wandering around Oxford Circus and Regent Street looking for a French Restaurant and we find this place by chance. And I am very glad we did. As mentioned in other reviews, this is a building with several functions. We went to the Lecture Room upstairs. This is an upscale French cuisine, with a special ambience with lots of details to call your attention, starting from the doorman.  The building is the former Chanel House, we were told, and captures all the glamour of London and the old buildings around the area.  And more.
Service is amazing starting at the front door and as you goes upstair enter it gives you already a sense that it will be a special evening. The menu isn't extensive but it is interesting enough to call your attention. However, when food comes and you taste it you realize that is above all expectations, simply delicious.... I had the duck, which came with the best fois- gras that I had in my life. My husband had the lamb, equally outstanding. We did not asked for starters, but they surprised us with small bites of heaven.  The experience was repeated for dessert. We should have taken photos of the food, but we missed it.  It will be one more reason to come back. And we definitively will, whenever we are in London. Hopefully,  we will come back soon to take our  daughter there, she will love it as well.  I guess this will be a enw London favorite!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"One of my favorite things to do is googling ""quirky London resaturants"", and I've found that Sketch consistently shows up in the results. This place is adorable with its eclectic but perfectly appropriate decor.
I've only been to the Parlour- it is still quite expensive even though the food and drinks are delightful.  £7.50 Tzatziki was not your run of the mill dip, but enhanced with green curry,  £16 burger came with a red cabbage and xeres jelly that we kept dipping our fries into.  Drinks will definitely make a dent in your wallet with its £10+ prices but they are amazingly refreshing and made with top notch liquor.  Try the Kick the Ketel and Let's Talk about Passion.  Their nonalcoholic drinks, the juices and tea, are very fresh as well and worth trying.
During the day it feels like the sitting room of a crazy grandma who has been hoarding bizarre relics and haphazardly displaying them in their full awkward glory.  Parlour at nighttime though- grandma's taken out her fur, cigarette, and heels, and she's ready to mingle.",1

Between the marelle drawn on the floor at the entrance, the fairy forest bar, the delicious cocktails, the nearly alice-in-wonderland main dining room and the borderline clockwork-orange-lookalike egg-shaped toilets well sketch simply does not stop surprising you.
All I had was a delicious cocktail. I cannot wait to go again and have dinner, another cocktail, and generally spend more time in the slightly surreal, oddly juxtaposed, mildly psychedelic and indubitably francophone environment. Et c'est reparti!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Came here for afternoon tea. £40 a head (plus 12.5% service charge) but in my opinion worth every penny.  Really tasty sandwiches, LOTS of sweet stuff, and refills if you wish. Come here at 3pm and you won't have/want to eat again all day.  The decor is sublime (the parlour room is pink and decorated in lots of David Shirley drawings; the toilets are like something in a UFO) and the whole thing is just great fun. Staff were fine and attentive.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"this is quite a restaurant.  i think you come here more for the experience rather than the food.  we started in the bar on the right and had a few cocktails.  the cocktails here are delicious if not a bit pricey.
we had dinner in the gallery, and the room is amazing.  it's kind of hard to come on a quiet date, b/c there is music playing, but if you're in the mood for fun and a more ruckus time, then it's fine.  i started off w/ a salad w/ beets, avocados and some greens and split that w/ my friend's lobster bisque.  for my entree, i had the halibut and split that w/ the sea bream.  everything was tasty but none of the food was blow-me-away fabulous.  for dessert, we got the le citron and the chocolate gateau, and both were very good.
i'm not into place which make you pay for bread, even if it does come in a lego box.  it's bread, for christ's sake.  
the best part of the restaurant is the decor, and of course, the toilets.  going to the bathroom in an egg pod definitely made for an experience.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"After a very enjoyable 2 courses our meal was brought to a very abrupt and disappointing end. Immediately after the removal of our main course dishes we were informed (fairly rudely) that we had reached the 2 hour limit allotted to us and we had to depart as soon as possible without dessert. We asked if we could have dessert in another room as it is a very large, cavernous space, and were told there would be some tables opening up soon next door but we must pay for our meal so far before leaving the table. We attempted to enter the bar next door for dessert but discovered that the menu would not be the same. For such an expensive restaurant it was very disappointing to be shown this level of service after what would have been a very enjoyable meal. The food was very good and the service had been more than adequate until this point.",-1

That sums up the evening. We experienced the vegetarian tasting menu which was a proper introduction to the chef's talents. It's a rarity to find an all vegetarian menu in a 2 Michelin Star environment, which indeed delivered. The portions were very generous and left one to be well satiated. The presentation of each course was lovely. The wait staff were stealth ninjas, always anticipating, very attentive, impeccably dressed and soft on the eyes. This was my 2nd time and I look forward to the next dining experience at Sketch!",1

I have been quite a few times now for lunch and afternoon tea, and i must say each time i visit i am extremely pleased with the overall service.
 It's extreme attention to detail at sketch. Make sure you check out the toilets!! 
The Jasmine green tea is to die for as well.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Great place for afternoon tea or a drink, it's definitely a change from your more traditional bar or restaurant.
I went there for a cream tea and was agreeably surprised by the many choices of teas. The scones were served warm and with two different jams. Service was a bit slow but very nice.
I also tried the cocktails in another room. They are a bit pricey but good, and the decor is worth it.
If you go there, don't forget to visit the restroom! It's a must-see!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"THIS IS MY NUMBER ONE PLACE FOR AFTERNOON TEA! 
I had ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS wanted to go for Afternoon Tea here. I knew it would be fantastical and it did not disappoint one bit! I knew if I wanted the Afternoon Tea on a Saturday I'd have to book, originally I was going to call just to enquire. I called up and the gentleman (because he was ever so polite, so I'm not gonna call him a 'dude') asked me what I was booking for. I mentioned it was a surprise for my friends birthday. So he said rather than just booking for the Parlour he'd reserve me a table at the Glade, which he said would be 'nicer'.
On arrival there was quite a queue, but thankfully got to bypass it all to be taken to our table. Coming from a Theatre Design background I was in complete awe of my surroundings. The quirky sculptures we passed on our way to the Glade. Totally geeked out over how visually stimulating it was. If you've visited their website and loved the quirk, the place itself will not disappoint. 
On to the good stuff. Everything that comes with the afternoon tea looks exquisite and tastes absolutely incredible. THE BEST AFTERNOON TEA EVER. Every single thing that I ate was pretty much orgasmic. YEAP. THAT GOOD. This is fine dining at its best. I can't say any more than it was the best, the best, the best. 
N.B: I've kept this short (for me) because I cannot recommend it anymore, other than saying if you don't try it I may have to slap you with a giant wet fish!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"London's better clubs are private. You either need to be a member or have your hotel concierge get you on ""the list"". Sketch is just one of those clubs. 
There are three bar areas- one in the front, the pod, space like one in the back and the other one that is hard to explain but that we spent the most time in. The walls are red with laser lights shining on them and crystal sparkles dotting the walls. There is a huge branch like decoration hanging from the ceiling and small tables scattered about. It was almost garish when we walked in but got better when the lights were dimmed a bit.
The drinks are not for the ""faint of wallet"". Their speciality cocktail list starts at 13 pounds per drink and have names so odd I cannot remember one but are interesting concoctions. At the end of the day- I still prefer my old stand bys.
Service was almost nonexistent for a private club- they easily could have served us three drinks in the span of time that we were there yet we only were able to get one. And all of our glasses were empty for quite some time. 
The dining room in the back doesn't open until 9 but it's almost impossible to get a reservation there as the members have it all booked up.  I wish I had made it to the restrooms reading these other reviews (and the manager told us about them the second we walked in) but we were running short on time.
Take a gander at some of the wild art that they have around this place. The copulating greyhounds statue (so much detail) and the technology tree (all sorts of gadgets) come to mind as two things you won't miss if you walk in the place. 
All in all- a bit much for me but given the crowd there on the night we were there . .it seems to have a loyal following.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"I was invited to a set dinner at Sketch about a month ago through work.

However all I can say is I'm glad that I wasn't footing the bill. Whilst service is wonderful, and the egg shaped loos never grow old; the food was terribly disappointing. 
A tomato salad with a jelly balsamic, jelly with salad... really? It didn't work and I think the chef was just trying to be too fancy. Why not slosh some good quality balsamic onto those quality tomatoes and let the natural flavour shine through... hmmm.
My second course was halibut, delicious cut of fish cooked perfectly- but with potato foam?!? Why foam when you could just have it with some great tasting Charlotte potatoes? 
An experience but certainly not one I'll be going back for... overpriced, over fancy, not my thang.",-1

The rosemary martini was probably the best drink I've had in my life (and I've had a lot of drinks...). They have a pretty extensive list and everything we tried was delicious. The drinks were surprisingly even worth the 13 pounds that they cost.

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I love writing reviews, but there are times where I really don't want to write the review because I really want things to be better than they were. Sketch is one of those places.
Four of us went here to dine in the Lecture Room (Nava, Andrew, me and my other half). I was really excited. Nava had a £50 promotional code! My parents got my other half a £100 gift voucher! I was ready to have some fun and a good meal.
Unfortunately, several things went majorly wrong. It started out okay. We met in the Parlour room for drinks. The drinks were nice, if not a bit strange. They took us upstairs to the lounge in the Lecture room to wait for our drinks. My rosemary martini tasted nothing like rosemary nor a martini. Reading the ingredients, it was expected, but still, rosemary would be nice. The other half wanted another cocktail, so the waiter brought him the cocktail menu (for the Lecture Room). There weren't many and they were way too expensive. It was close to £50 for an old fashioned, and while it was with really rare bourbon, it seemed a bit too expensive. So the other half asked if he could order a drink from downstairs. He was told no. He was told he could go downstairs and get one, but they wouldn't make one upstairs nor bring it up for him. (Annoying). He went downstairs. The maitre d' saw him going downstairs. He was with other people, but eventually caught up and told him that they would take the drink to him upstairs. And they comped him because he should never have been told to go downstairs and get it. The comp was nice, but it was annoying he had to go down and ask for it in the first place.
At the table, we were told we couldn't use both the voucher and the promo code. Which made no sense. A voucher is money they already have. It's not like we were trying to use 3 promo codes or anything. Nava agreed that we could use ours. My other half had to talk to them at the end of the meal. The manager agreed that we could use both, obviously, but the fact we had to actually discuss it with them was annoying. (The trend here is annoying, in case you haven't noticed.)
The food was actually pretty good. Most of it. However, they left the plastic backing on part of my food, which I had to eat around. Really two-Michelin star restaurant? Plastic? I also had a bone or plastic in my fish as well. Two courses in a row? It's annoying (and puzzling). The chicken curry was fantastic. They really enjoy giving you two or three dishes at once. (Or in the case of dessert, SIX. Yes we had six different tiny plates surrounding each of us. My other half was overwhelmed and felt rushed to eat it because it was all there at once.) And they liked to whisk the plates away at random times. I'm used to dining in the UK where they take plates away all at once, but the constant whisking away of plates was a bit unnerving. The hot chocolate was good, very good. Not the best I've ever had to be honest. Given that good chocolate is fairly new to the UK, I can understand why people would think it's the best. I'd have it again to be sure, but I've had far better in the States. The seaweed butter was to die for though. I've never had it, and I kind of fell in love with it. We ran out early, and had to ask for more. Irritatingly. We were almost out of butter and they kept bringing us bread. It's not hard to notice that more butter was required.
The wine. It was really good. So good we do what we often do and see if we can find it to have at home (because wine at home is usually about half the price. There's a markup, I get it, I don't mind paying double for a bottle when you're at a restaurant). We couldn't find it anywhere in the UK, but they were about €15 a bottle on the mainland. Now I'm pretty good at math, but you don't really need to be great to figure out prices. I know it's more expensive for booze in the UK (thank you taxes), so €15 a bottle equates to about £25-30 a bottle in shops in the UK. Now double that, it's pretty standard at a restaurant. That's about £50-60 a bottle if you're out. Now these wines were about £75-90 a bottle. That's a triple markup. I shouldn't be surprised since they were selling glasses of Balfour sparkling wine for £30 a glass. I can get it at home for about £40 a bottle. Do the math. Six times £40 is £240 pounds. That's way more than a triple markup. Triple markups are a bit too much for my liking.
The decor is pretty fab though. All the rooms are decorated differently and you can tell they spent a lot of work making it look the way it does. The big cushy seats in the Lecture room were also great for eating dinner in!
So overall, I had a good time, the food was good. The service needed a lot of work (so very surprised with the two-Michelin star rating). It seemed the servers needed a lot more training to understand what Michelin star service should entail. I'm probably not going back when there are lots of other places to try and since I wasn't wowed by my experience, I'll be moving on.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I've been dying to go to this place for ages, mainly for the bathrooms that everyone keeps raving about. What finally got me here was it being the 1st stop of the Mayfair chocolate tour as Sketch is reputed to have the best hot chocolate in London.
Verdict? Yep definitely some of the best hot chocolate I've ever had, and by far the best in London. It's rich, creamy, full of deep chocolate flavour, but light enough not to weigh you down. It comes in posh porcelain tea cups which is a little odd as I consider hot chocolate best served in a mug with little marshmellows but then again that's usually when made at home or around a fire.
The bathrooms are just hilarious, and fittingly odd for the place. To put into context, you first walk up a short flight of stairs and in front of you is a beam of light which changes colour periodically. Cool but nothing special until you turn your head away from it and a word flashes out at you from the corner of your eye. It's almost as if you are seeing things but it is just a strange optical illusion definitely sets the scene. 
The sculputures around the restaurant, cafe, and club areas are a bit disturbing and what I imagine the artwork of Chucky to be like. My favourity was the slim female figure in an almost Thinker pose with a big afro. Which wouldn't be that unusual until you realise that the ""afro"" is made up of hundreds of syringes stuck needle first into the head of the figure.
There is a Michelin starred restaurant above (didn't make it there, but planning on it soon!) and a large open room that you can easily see being a dance floor at night. The room is ringed with projectors that can cover all four walls with pictures and movies although in this dark open space with white couches, the only playing was a indie art flick that I could only describe as the lovechild of the Ring and The Twilight Zone. Needless to say I didn't linger in this room and rushed to the bathrooms just next door. 
The bathroom area is actually above a sunken spherical bar and boys go left while girls go right but a curving white staircase. In contrast to the room of horrors of a club, this is pure dazzling white. You pick an egg, cocoon yourself in side, and go about your business. Oh and don't be scared if you hear voices...everyone does.
Overall, loved the unique atmosphere that Sketch delivers and just walking around is a rush. Tracy L and I have decided it's a must for a night clubbing and then perhaps a posh dinner.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"Giant pod-shaped bathrooms!  
Definitely the classiest pee I've ever had.  Ascending the pure white staircase up into the foggy nest of space pods was quite surreal.   Each pod is quite roomy with it's own separate toilet inside and a small mirror for primping as well.   I've never been so amazed with a toilet in my life.  The pods are like big fancy port-o-potties in a sense, though much cleaner and you don't feel like the whole thing could topple over.  After exiting the pod when your business is complete, there are maids standing around to offer any assistance you need.  Now that is service!
I was only here for my office Christmas party, so I can't say that I've truly experienced Sketch in all its glory.  But, it is definitely cool.  Whilst wandering around I found Buzz Lightyear atop a sculpture of toys and trash, a statue of two dogs getting it on and lots of sparklies and flair.   Bizzare, yet awesome.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Let's just say - I take everyone who's visiting to Sketch.
This place is so quintessentially London!
The best decor I've ever seen anywhere, quite frankly.
I usually go for drinks, I'm a big cocktail person, but their's fall a bit short somehow. Same goes with food - nothing I tasted blew my mind.
But it's just such a wonderful place, the service is great too, that I just keep on coming back.",1

Great space and ambience! Very unique. Check out the toilet. Drinks on the menu are delicious and interesting (on the fruity side).",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"We stumbled upon this restaurant one afternoon while visiting London a few months back. There was a 30 minute wait for afternoon tea, so we decided to keep moving, and possibly comeback for dinner. 
We called later that night to make a reservation for dinner, but they were closed for a private event, and we proceeded to make plans for lunch the next day. When we arrived the following day for lunch, we were seated in the Parlour until our table was ready, and the staff was ready to assist. We were greeted by the maitre d' who told us that the chef would be ready shortly, and then gave us a tour of Sketch, and the history of the establishment. He led us upstairs into the Lecture Room and Library where our table awaited with a full-on french staff ready to assist. 
I was given a stool for my purse, and the napkins were placed in each of our laps. In the background you can hear music playing. Very similar to a finger piano, which has an almost eerie sound. We both went with the fixed lunch menu, which was three courses, plus palette cleansers, and after dinner espresso with chocolates. Overall the presentation was breath taking, and every dish was very creative.  
The service was impeccable! Our pretty french waitress was on point the entire meal. She wiped every crumb from the table, and instructed us on proper consumption of the more bizarre artistic entrees. For example: when I thought I was supposed to eat some sand at the beginning of the meal that was holding thin crackers. She informed me that I should not be eating it, awesome lol... I'd also like to brag about their cheese plate selection, it was the finest I have ever seen at a restaurant. After lunch, we were allowed to explore the art studios in the back where different events are held each night. We then ventured upstairs to some crazy futuristic white bathroom pods that speak to you. This place left a lasting impression on us and what a cool city London is. We highly recommend Sketch to tourists looking for a hip place to eat lunch, dinner and afternoon tea.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Sketch is a must for visitors and London locals alike. You're going for the atmosphere and people-watching more than the food, although that part is definitely unique.
LOVES:
- Service - very attentive and charming!
- Stool for my purse!
- Complimentary glasses of champagne to compensate for a short wait
- Black and white (silent) theater on the walls & unique art
- Coolest bathrooms ever
There is so much to look at that it is hard to focus on the food, but here are some of the highlights:
- Scallops appetizer
- Lobster and rib eye mains
- Chocolate cake (yum!)
There was a lot of mousse / foam in the dishes (3/4 of the dishes had some sort of foam-related covering), which I'm not against, but it seemed a bit overdone.
Dessert was delicious - and I might come back here only for that and cocktails / champagne next time!
Don't forget to dress the part for this place. A unique outfit is a must because like you, everyone else is looking around :)",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This was a really fun and funky Afternoon Tea.  I had a few surprise visitors from home (NYC) and I wanted to make sure they didn't leave London without having afternoon tea.  I also didn't want a boring traditional afternoon tea either.  I've done the traditional swanky afternoon tea at the Ritz and I did enjoy it but its some place I'd take my mom.  This place was just what the doctor ordered. The main comment I got from my friends is that they felt like they were in Alice In Wonderland (good thing the Mad Hatter's Tea at the Sanderson was booked up).  As soon as I got there there was a doorman with tophat and I got a little nervous because of my attire (its summer and I had ""stylish"" flipflops on) but I trucked on in anyway.  My friends were waiting from me and I was immediately pleasantly surprised by my surroundings.  I passed the cafe - for the sorry sods that weren't smart enough to book - and walked into can only described as a tea room in a red forest.  the lighting was soft red and I passed some truly artistic trays of edible art.  Our party each decided to have the Afternoon Tea £25 but I decided on the champagne tea which came with 1 glass of champagne (Pommery Ampanage) along with unlimited tea at £46.  I don't think that is particularly worth it but the presentation of the glass of champagne was definitely something to see.  We all chose different teas so we could sample each others. Mine was jasmine, but the ladies ordered berry hibiscus, vanilla, and rose hip tea.  I liked all but the rose tea.  Now for the sweet and savoury goodies... WONDERFUL. Anyone who thinks they won't be full is terribly misguided.  We had servings for 5 people and we left with 2 beautiful takeaway boxes because we couldn't finish it all.  The Assorted finger sandwiches were smoked salmon and Jacob's cream cucumber, ricotta and asparagus, MY FAVORITE mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur, and egg and mayonnaise, quail egg, caviar were seriously tasty and is NOT your everyday egg salad sandwich.  It also came with 5 warm and buttery Sultana scones
served with clotted cream, bitter orange and strawberry jam. All the jams and creams were so fresh I didn't care that I felt the pounds literally developing as I ate.  And finally, the edible are which were the sweets selection of pistachio macaroons, almond and berry tartlet,coffee éclair.  We ate our strawberry cheesecake in a glass because we knew we couldn't take it with us. The only thing I didn't like and its only because I am not a big marshmallow fan was the mousse malabar marshmallows which tasted like spongy chalk but again... I am NOT a fan of marshmallows and other people will probably love them. There were other sweets but honestly I can't remember the names and here's a warning: these pastries are meant to be eaten THE DAY YOU GET THEM.  Not that you'd be able to resist but as I said we were so full we had to go boxes and after tea went shopping, by the time I got home my macaroons lost their air so they shrunk and of course wasn't as pretty but just as tasty.  Our waitress was super sweet and I only have to say you have to SEE the restroom in order to believe it. The bathroom mirrors are just a small part (they say: You're beautiful and remember I'm a mirror so I can't tell a lie) of how awesome the bathroom is.I am going back there again and again again and I highly recommend.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Coolest loo in all of London!  
This place is just dripping with coolness.  Sleek, stylish, quirky, modern art-filled interior. A bit pretentious, but that's part of the thrill, I suppose. It's less of a restaurant and more of an experience. To be honest, I can barely even remember what I had to eat. 
Oh, and the loo. It's quite surreal. In case you haven't heard yet, there's a large room with a bunch of white pods... women's on one side, men's on the other. After using the appropriate pod, and attendant helps wash and dry your posh pod hands.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Sketch is Famous French chef Pierre Gagnaire's signature restaurant in London. It actually consists for three different restaurants: Gallery, The Lecture Room and Parlour. Parlour is the more relaxed option while The Lecture Room features a tasting menu. I had the chance to eat at Gallery which is their ""middle ground"" option last weekend. Although the food didn't live up to my high expectations, I absolutely loved the experience. I had the ""Pollock"" for starters and then the scallops with truffles.  Both were good but not that original in my opinion.
""Le Citron"" dessert was excellent. And so was the Bollinger red wine selected by their high-skilled Sommelier.
All in all, it was a fantastic experience for the food was good but, most importantly, service was absolutely spectacular which is a rarity when the staff is mostly French. Sketch, indeed, seems to be the exception that proves the rule in that regard. In addition, the decor of this place is just worth going there just to check it out.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch strikes me as a really ""London"" experience. As a Canadian, I see London (and Londoners) as quirky, unique, and a little brash underneath the demure exterior. That's what Sketch is like. It's like Alice in Wonderland here, with chipped gold-plated cups, a trail of false blood leading you to the washrooms, and waitresses wearing brocade jackets and converse sneakers. 
I've had tea and lunch here, and it has been totally lovely. Service is a little uneven, and they get busy on weekends, but it's worth it. Cream tea is only ten quid, and the scones are delish. Oh, and after your meal be sure to make your way down the stairs from the main tea room to the cavernous washrooms with their blindingly white pod-like toilets. A very cool photo op indeed.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"What hot spot in London would you take your weekend guests for
a lasting memory? At Sketch - as one of the rare exceptions in
London - a club membership is not needed for having a good
night out. Even first timers can expect to be greeted warmly
several times over by the receptionist - the front desk - the
wine waiter and the table staff. Sketch is placed in Mayfair at
Number 9 Conduit Street, formerly the house of Dior. For Friday
and Saturday it is highly recommended to reserve a table a week
in advance.
The Gallery, a white room with white padded sofas and ornate
chairs, is one of various eating-places: there is also the
cheaper Glade, the (much) more expensive Lecture Room and Café
Parlour. Being ushered into the gallery one is surrounded by a
multinational crowd (wearing avant-garde black) dining while
still art is projected onto the walls above. The new trend of
visual jockying (VJing) goes beyond just the eating experience.
Even though Sketch presents their cuisine as French, it has
more than a few international influences. Matching Sketch's
concept, - the food is aesthetically pleasing and the flavours
are exotic. You eat with your eyes and the small dishes are
arranged decoratively. But if Chef Pierre Gagnaires's dishes
are modest in size they are not in price.
Imagine enjoying a fantastic dinner while the DJ puts up his
electro beats louder, chairs and tables are taken away and
finding yourself in the middle of a dance floor. You would be
surprised what interesting conversations and contacts can be
made over a Diamond Martini from the adjacent igloo formed bar.
In there you hear the echo of voices and music. If the toilets
get the main part of discussion, there is something wrong with
the restaurant, but an exception has to be made: Have you ever
stepped into an egg shaped space ship before? They are beyond
this world (literally).
The Michelin Star reflects the high concept dining; it goes
into an extravagant overdrive combining art, fashion, style and
glamour. The gallery has forthcoming exhibitions. This November
there is a gallery opening showing the exhibition of Patrick
Jolley and Oswaldo Marcia. For more information see the
references below. Finally, let me share a secret: on your way
out, draw your attention to a piece of UV light art. While
shaking the head and looking at it the words love appear - What
other surprises are waiting tonight?",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Five stars for the experience. 
Drinks were good, pricey as expected. It's worth the money for a walk through and a look at the people and interior. As mentioned, the toilets are cool as hell.  Hung out in the East Bar and it's a very compelling space and the sunken bar is one of the many oddities throughout the place.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Go for the atmosphere, not the food!
If you're in London, a visit to Sketch is a must.  From the moment we arrived, we were surrounded by bizarre things - all of which added to an excellent ambiance.  From the pod-shaped bathrooms to the computer graphics on the interior walls, it all culminated into a visual ecstasy that was extremely entertaining.
In terms of the food, we enjoyed the extensive cocktail menu and wine list.  The sommelier was very helpful in choosing a wine that paired with our food selection.  We had the lobster bisque as a starter, the venison for our main, and the chocolate cake for 2 for our dessert.  The lobster bisque was very well done with the rice, lobster and bisque all being mixed in front of us.  The venison dish was only okay.  By the time dessert had arrived, I had forgotten what I had as my main.  The main was not worth the value, but given the ambiance and quality of the other dishes - it was alright.  The chocolate cake was more of a tart, but delicious.  It was paired with a small scoop of vanilla/hazlenut ice cream which was amazing.
All in all, if you're a foodie - this place is probably not for you.  If you're a London guest, or entertaining a guest in London, this is a great place for an exciting evening with a relaxed atmosphere for catching up.
Tip:  Be on time.  They hold you to a strict allocation of 2 hours.  They loose a bit in my book for this policy.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"As someone who ""wines and dines"" my clients all over the world, I can state, without a doubt and without any bias that Sketch produced for me one of the best culinary and service experiences ... ever! This is not your standard grab a quick dinner establishment, but a highly sophisticated dining enlightenment that was truly savored over the course of almost 3 hours.  I have to pay a massive compliment to our host Sebastien, who really took us on a journey of some of the finest foods London has to offer.  Let me offer up an example of Sebastien's amazing attention to the guest as well as details.  We ordered the cheese course to start the evening (i was treating one of my best friends to a Birthday dinner), and the normal thought process would be that the restaurant brings out a cheese board with a variety of breads and spreadable flavors.  Sketch takes it to the stratosphere by rolling out 4 separate mobile cutting boards and presenting the diner with a cheese entourage from around the world.  We probably had over 40 different types of cheese to select from, and Sebastien took his time to review everyone of them. We took his suggestions (all of them) and he cut very generous pieces from each selection, and then suggested the order in which to appreciate them.  This in itself was over an hour, and the whole process was fascinating.  I cannot throw out enough positive adjectives regarding the entire dinner experience, as every course, including the artfully crafted desert, was stunning.  Now, here is where Sebastien and Sketch go over the top to secure themselves in my own personal Restaurant Hall of Fame.  Sebastien comes over to the table, asks us to put down our napkins, and follow him.  How do you not comply with this request? Sebastien walks us back to the kitchen to meet the head chef and the brigade... AWESOME!  I felt like we were walking the Hall of Honors, and the Chef could not have been more gracious to us.  How was the rest of the service? As outstanding as it could possibly be.  From the gentleman pouring the water, to the waiter who refilled the bread and to the management that checked on us, as well as gave us a tour of the entire complex, we felt like the red carpet was specially rolled out for a personal experience unlike any other.  I cannot wait until my next trip to the UK, and the number one stop on my list the next time, and every visit thereafter, will be Sketch London.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,2,"The food was unimpressive (particularly relative to the price), most of the staff had snooty attitudes, and we felt pushed to leave on a timetable so they could get someone else in, even though there were lots of empty tables.  The decor was impressive though.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I've been there few times. The people, the streets, the lingo, the architecture. Everything seems so fresh and interesting.
 The place is mysterious, impossibly chic and you need to understand all the philosophy and the history",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I had afternoon tea here and I hate to say it, but I wasn't hugely impressed. As many of the reviews here rightly point out, the venue itself is amazing, and there's something extra special about turning off a busy Regent St and ducking into this charming maze of quirky grandiosity. But I digress. 
The afternoon tea itself was really delicious. I should disclose at this point that  gluten and I do not get along, so afternoon tea always requires a bit of compromise for me. However in the course of my fledgling love affair with this quintessentially English way to spend the pre-twilight hours, I have learned that the swisher establishments can usually cater accordingly. My lovely wife has no such handicap, so she was able to enjoy the full offering as the chef intended it, and it looked delicious - particularly the sweetish glazed smoked salmon buns. Not that I'm bitter. Really.
The first problem was our seating. We were in the parlour, which is where they accommodate the overflow from the front room. It's a nice room in itself - warm pinkish tones and pleasantly spacious, but we were tucked away into a corner behind the door and the effect wasn't so cosy. There were three staff in the area but they seemed to struggle with the demands of the room. 
The real problem was with the presentation of the food. They brought out each person's entire meal on a lovely looking cake stand. While this looked good, it didn't really work because the scones come out warm, as they should, but they're not the first course so by the time we got to them, they were cold.
My sandwiches were nice, but the gluten-free bread was nothing special. But the real disappointment for me was that when I asked for more, I was told that I would have to order off the menu. Now I've only eaten afternoon tea at two other places, but both times the extra sandwiches flowed freely. And at £27 per person, I reckon Sketch can afford to get a little more generous with their precious sarnies. 
The sweets were delicious, and so too was the tea. But we were hustled out after an hour and a half, when we could have done with an extra 20 minutes or so.
Basically it was good, but not great. There are a few too may buts that need to be addressed before they can be considered in the league of places like Claridge's, which definitely served the best afternoon tea that I've ever had. That said, Sketch is still worth a visit, but maybe just for one of their fancy (£15ish) cocktails.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"I came to Sketch for some drinks with friends while visiting London.  The bar decor is a bit uber-bizarre, including the quite anatomically correct dog(s) statue in the entrance, the bar that only comes up to your knees, and the very strange pod bathrooms that make you feel like you're in an alien egg.  I think the fact that we were there on a Wednesday night (making the place almost empty) may have added to the strangeness... It would probably feel a little more ""cool"" and a little less ""creepy"" if there were more people around.
Evidently, Sketch has been awarded a Michelin Star, and the quality that suggests shows up even in their cocktails.  There were three of us there, and we each had two drinks, so I (math whiz) got to try 6 of their drinks.  Every single one was delicious.  I especially enjoyed the ""Duvel in Me"" drink, which incorporated one of my favorite beers into a cocktail expertly.  
Yes, it's a bit pricey, but this isn't the type of place that you're going to have 10 drinks at (well I suppose that I shouldn't say that for sure, but definitely not when it's a Wednesday and you're jet-lagged from coming in from Chicago the day before!)
I almost forgot to mention... the WC Pods are quite an experience.  Mine had barn-yard animal noises coming through the speakers.  I am not kidding.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"My flatmate decided to surprise me with a belated birthday dinner and took me and a friend to Sketch. We were greeted my a number of beautiful people at every door and each one of them was more accommodating than the next. The ambience and decor  were incredible with the dim colored lighting and white hand-painted ""antique"" furniture. There were images of bubbles projected on the walls creating a fantasy-like atmosphere. And going with the bubble theme the restrooms were these singluar white pods, everything was very pristine and sexy.  
Dinner was lovely, I had the lamb (that was perfectly cooked) which was accompanied my some coco beans, celery slivers and yogurt dollops on what seemed to be a sweet cracker of some sort.  My dinner guests had the salmon and the ribeye which they polished off as well.  DInner was followed my this delicious chocolate cake with a lemon/ginger custard.  Yum!
The reason I took off 1 star was due to the fact that out waiter was rude.  Well, I take that back, he was very rude to my flatmate.  The 3 of us could not figure out why but it seemed that everything he ordered the waiter judged.  It was a little comical after a while but at the same time there was no reason for Pierre/Jean-Louis/Francois to be as rude as he was.
There are also a few cocktail bars in this venue that you either have to be a member of or have dined there that night to enjoy.  The 2 that customers can enjoy were both very unique. One was tiny and followed along the bubble theme as it was this round pod with a sunken bar in the middle and the other was more of a lounge with great lighting effects.  
I highly recommend going just for the atmosphere alone.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"My bf and I got a reservation last minute on a Saturday night since his friend is a member at Sketch. Didn't realize all the perks you get if you're a member!
The whole place had a artsy/Damien Hirst vibe to it. Like the dog humping statue, alien pod restrooms, and the trendy dining room. 
The staff was amazing, shook our hands and greeted us by Mr. X and Miss. X. 2 glasses of champagne was at our table. The food was good, nothing too memorable about it. I was just in awe of all the great looking people walking around (both the staff and the customers). 
Afterwards, we headed to the members only bar which was very cool. Really good cocktails - watermelon martinis are my fave. DJ was playing alot of great music as well, and everyone was up and dancing!
I also loved the fact they had a smoking jacket by the door that they offered to guests when you headed outside for a smoke break. Big black fur coats are GREAT to smoke in cold London weather. 
Anyways, I am definitely coming back again.",1

I only had tea and scones and didn't have a full meal so I can't really judge the quality of the food, but I was very impressed by the staff. They were downright jovial and inviting - a rarity these days! I'm looking forward to going back for an evening drink and meal next time I'm in London.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"So bizarre.  I think I quite like Sketch, despite not completely loving my night there. I love offbeat art, and as soon as you walk past the coat check, the statue of dogs having sex kind of sets the tone for what you'll find inside. 
London is one of those cities where you can get away with dangling dead birds and laser lights over people and still charge them 4.75 for a bottle of Asahi as long as you make them feel like they've done something fabulous to have made it in the door. 
I think there's two ways you can look at the place, another reviewer mentioned that they don't seem to take themselves too seriously, but I'd argue that they take themselves very seriously.  There's a lot of work that goes into looking that nonchalant, kind of in that way where the indie crowd spends hours on their hair to make it look like they've just rolled out of bed. 
Visually, I do love the place, but I think my visits are going to be sparse in the future as it's just not something I could justify the spend for on a regular basis. Certainly worth a stop in if you haven't been.  You know, when in Rome...",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Had breakfast here with my husband and was immediately a fan. Loved the decor & coziness of the place. Although it was said to be quite posh, it wasn't at all as intimidating as I was expecting. The food was good, but portions were a bit small. 
The best part, though, was checking out the bathroom. We heard a woman at a table near us saying that it was the best bathroom she'd ever seen. My husband went to check it out first and he couldn't stop talking about it for the rest of the meal. At the end of the meal I made my way to the bathroom and was amazed! 
It was truly an odd, wonderful, crazy, little place & would definitely recommend breakfast or tea there.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I've been to the Parlour at Sketch a few times. They serve a great afternoon cream tea, with bizzare nibbles and colourful confections. The crockery is as mismatched as the furniture and decorations. But it all works. And it attracts an interesting mix of people. And you can dress up and not feel silly.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,Excellent food. Very beautiful ambience (former Chanel House) Amazing Service. Lamb and Duck were extraordinary.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Sketch feels special, even if your'e just calling in for a coffee (£8!!!!!). The decor is lovely, the waitresses are beautiful (it must be on the job description) if slightly nonchalant, and the food is tasty. Apart from the £8 coffee, the prices actually aren't too bad. At lunch today I had an aubergine, feta and... something else I've forgotten... in pita, French fries, glass of wine and of course the £8 coffee and it came to around £25. We took our time (we were having a meeting) and were not rushed or made to feel like we should be leaving. 
The lunches are light - so don't expect big portions or stodge.
Although I clocked the selection of patisserie on the way out and they looked stunning, so you could always top up the light lunch with a couple of those!
I really like it here but do consider it a treat, not a regular venue.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"came here for breakfast with friends, was a little over average, but not the less lovely. all the rooms are wonderfully decorated and so are the bathrooms, I recommend the London to Paris room, my personel fav!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Stylish, artsy, hipster...overall cool. Must check out the bathrooms on the gallery! And try the steak tartare! Service is excellent",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Love, love, loved this place!  Did I mention that I loved it?  It was unique, fun and the food was delicious!  We sat in The Gallery.  Unfortunately, The Lecture Room was closed for the evening.  Perhaps, next time we will get reservations for it.  The risotto is to die for!!  The servers were attentive and informed about the decor and menu.  Seriously would recommend this one to all who visit London.  The prices lean toward the higher side but very well worth it!!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Decided to check out sketch a few weeks ago and i thoroughly enjoyed it. Spent all night in ""The Glades"" bar. The decor inside the entire building was mind blowing, the wine was great and it was pretty chilled out. The giant eggs toilets are pretty awesome too!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Wow - this is the ultimate place for bling, glamour and ultimate service.  The staff are attentive and the service is truely personal from the time you step in the door to the time you leave.  The food is absolutely delicious - as you would expect from a two michelin star restaurant.  Took a client here for a business lunch and it certainly is the place to impress.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Wow, what a place.
 The décor is worth going to see before you even have a drink or something to eat. When I went we had apple pie mojitos which were delicious and a selection of canapés which were mostly very good, apart from a couple of iffy ones.
 If you go you really must make sure you use the bathrooms. They are egg-like pods which sound effects and it's all very surreal.
 The major downside of this place is the price, but for an extra-special treat it should be on the to-do list, even if it's just for a drink in the bar.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This is a great place for tea. I just had an afternoon tea over with a friend and the staff was really helpful. The price is not cheap but it's worth the money. The cakes were very good. I couldn't fault it atmt. You also don't need to call for a reservation. Just walk in and they will get you a table. 
However, I didn't like the seat that I had. The place looked vintage posh so I expected the chairs to be comfy but there were very hard (for my friend's as well). But it depends, I guess. I saw other tables, there were good seats where you can sit on a couch. Still, I don't think anyone would expect uncomfortable chairs in the place like this. 
Another thing was, it can get very busy. There's a possibility that you might get the one like mine.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"An interesting place, worth the visit, if only for the experience.  I came here for tea on a very rainy Saturday.  The wait was long, but we were finally seated on these cute little Alice in Wonderland-like chairs.  The desserts looked beautiful, although I have to admit they looked better than they tasted (in my opinion).  The chocolate tart with orange zest and salt, however, was rich and delicious. 
While you're there, take a walk around the place.  The different rooms have different atmospheres.  As you walk toward the back, the stairs to the left appear as if they are covered with wet blood, although this is only an illusion.  The stairs to the right lead down to a library-like dining room, as well as a large white dining room, which was not in use when I was there.  You have to walk through this room to get to the infamous white egg pod bathroom, but it can be a little creepy.  As I walked through the completely dark and empty room, I could hear the sound of someone chewing/eating, emanating from the speakers.",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"When I got to Sketch, I was fortified with an entire bottle of wine sloshing about in my veins.  Imagine my excitement when I went to empty some of this liquid excess and found myself peeing in a GIANT EGGPOD FROM THE FUTURE.  As if that weren't enough, a trip to the bar yielded a quirky delicious rosemary martini made with basil, vanilla syrup, rosemary-infused vodka, sugar, salt and pepper, apple juice, and pineapple juice.  This was as tasty as it was innovative, a combination that is all too rare in the world of cocktails.  At £13 a pop, these drinks are exorbitant and should be savored.  To get your money's worth, get a little liquor in your system and go dancing among the ovoid spaceships upstairs.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I first came here on a first date some few months ago, he certainly impressed me with his choice of venue for the evening.
 We had a cocktail in the space ship bar first and then went on the restaurant where we had a really nice and pricy (well I wasnt paying the bill so it was ok) meal with a bottle of wine.
 Each area has its own stylish atmosphere,
 The highlight really has to be the memorable egg-shaped toilets. The architecture of which are absolutely amazing!
 This is a great place to come for an extra special evening.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I went there for my birthday. The decor is funky,elegant,posh,unforgettable!
Pricy but you are paying not only for the food here,its the whole experience..",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Yikes! It is expensive, but you get what you pay for!
I was lucky enough to attend a dinner here last night hosted by business contacts. 
On entering the main hall the general bar is the the right on the grouns floor, a long, open room riotous with colours and quirky artwork. On meeting my group we went down stairs to the rear of the venue to the Glade room for drinks. This bar is a bit quieter and makes talking a lot more simple. Ceilings are equally as high, with reddish-pink walls decorated with crystals and sequins in swirling patterns. Odd squat 70's furniture reminded me a little of my grandad. Don't worry, you're not being targeted by snipers - the circular rotating mirrors in the walls seem to reflect red lasers for some reason. All part of the 'artistic license'.
 After drinks we moved into the main Gallery restaurant, much more to my liking. The whole space is white with projections beamed onto the upper half of each wall in an ever-changing display. All furniture is white, whether it's high tables with cocktail chairs, low sofas or glossy laminate tables.
 Just off the restaurant the VIP bar looks like a James Bond-esque snug - all black leather around a circular bar and curved walls. Up the curving staircase are the egg-shaped toilets that everyone raves about.( see pics uloaded). Yes - they're cool, but slightly unnerving to hear applause or Ave Maria sung by choirs on completion of your time 'en oeuf'. Apparently the sound effects differ per pod and the lights strobe through the full rainbow spectrum so you get a different experience at different visits.
Now, on to the food. 
Luckily, with all the pomp and pretention, the food is still excellent. We tried the set menu ( which seemed to have some kind of apricot theme throughout! )
I tried baked pollock on a bed of aubergine and a square of apricot jelly-esque side spread. This was followed by the rib-eye steak, done to perfection as a medium-rare, with vegetables and a polenta cake with some whipped, cocunut frothiness on the side. Finally a cake concoction stacked with diced apricots, apricot sauce and a brittle, nutty disc on top. All in all, a great food standard peppered with friendly and prompt service.
 I think that the main reason this place has stayed 'de rigeur' for more than 6 years is more down to this level of attentive and professional staff and high-quality food than to the 'quirky' or trendy styling.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Sketch is a Bar and restaurant just off Regent St. This Establishment never fails to give you the wow factor from it's ever changing Gallery Restaurant (This has different artists to commission unique digital and traditional works and themes) to the excellent East bar that is housed in a dome with great atmosphere and the craziest most unique toilets that you will ever encounter. Food here is also excellent and the lunch menu is great value if you can get a table.
Definitely worth a go on a civilised night out if you get a chance go and check it out!",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"If you don't mind paying a little extra, this place is well worth a fun and posh afternoon tea. And being an American - yes, please, I'll take my tea while being posh...only way to do so, right?
The interior decor is breathtaking and the bathrooms are super fun (yes, I said the bathrooms are super fun).
My mate and I (I can call him a 'mate,' because he's British, even though I'm not...) weren't very hungry, so we shared the ""Queen's Tea"" (I think that's what it was called): 3 scrumptious little scones with delectable butter and raspberry jam - perfect to compliment the hot Earl Grey in the cutest tea pot.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I came here for dinner with some colleagues while on my last business trip to my company's London office.  It's located literally steps away from my office, so we thought we'd give it a go.
Sketch has a unique vibe - sort of a combination of Star Trek meets Alice In Wonderland...kooky, yet chic at the same time.  It's a combination of NYC Meatpacking district type club meets chic restaurant  The decor is modern, yet with a twist of vintage at the same time and includes quite a few over the top works of art (including the enormous images of a man's scrotum on these video screens that hung at the top of the dining room we were situated in)...hmmm.
A DJ spins dance / electronica tunes which add to the cool and lively vibe.
Overall, the food was very good.  They have a great selection of wines and cocktails as well.  I did think the prices were a bit steep for what we got (and I am by no means a cheapskate...refer to my other reviews).  At these prices, I do at least expect free bread, thanks!  I don't remember if we had to pay for the first bread basket, but there were 3 of us eating dinner that night and all we got was a tiny bread basket with 3 miniscule bites of bread in it.  When we asked for a second round, the server made it clear that we would be charged for it...seriously?!!!  I just ordered a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine and you're making me pay for a bite of bread?  Wow.
The service was decent, but I've had better.  It got a bit sporatic as our meal went on and the place was getting busier.  Again, at these prices, I expect a certain level of service thanks.
This may sound crazy, but the best part about this entire place is the bathrooms.  So quirky and unique!  You have to go up the spiral stairs that wind around the bar to this weird open room at the top.  Each toilet is individually located in it's own separate egg shaped ""pod"" (see pics to get what I mean) - again, it makes you feel like you are in an episode of Star Trek...as if you are about to trasport to another dimension once you close the pod door and the world outside disappears!
I would definitely come back here again, but not for dinner - just for drinks.  Oh, and of course, to use the bathroom ;-P",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"At the entrance to the Sketch restaurants (reviewed elsewhere) is Sketch Parlour, a cozy place to take an excellent pot of tea, a delicious cake or two or even a light lunch. 
The place is laid out with the sort of furnishings you'd find in the parlour of a georgian house, without much in the way of formality or pattern. Pull a group of armchairs and a table together and while away an hour or two with friends or using the free wi-fi. The services is friendly and attentive, the food beautifully presented and delicious and the atmosphere calm.
It's not cheap, but it's an oasis and a great rendezvous right in the heart of London.",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"This place is pretty awesome.  Most hoighty-toighty places are superficial and starch, and this place is nothing like that.  
This restaurant has a sense of humor, and doesn't take itself seriously.  It's whimsical and interesting interior entertains while providing a wonderful dining experience.  It's been said, but if you ever get the chance, visit the bathrooms!  I'm sure if you stop in when it's not busy and more casual (lunch) they'll let you pop in to check it out.
My friend and I checked online to see that they weren't taking any more reservations for that night.  We decided to go check it out anyways, and try to get in without.  We walked right in, and after saying we didn't have reservations we were seated immediately (it helped that we got there right when it opened at 7)
The food is delicious; my friend got the chicken dish while I got the Norwegian Cod (which came with gnocchi colored with squid ink.  Fancy!)  We both finished all of our food, and it was very good.
If it weren't so expensive for a student, I would definitely be back in a heartbeat.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,The coolest bar and bathrooms ever. packed and overpriced drinks with a pretty boring crowd made it kind of a bummer. No one looked as though they were having fun. The bar staff was hustling and made a delicious cocktail though. Not my spot in town for fun.. but would like to try the restaurants and give them a fair chance.,-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,I only went to the east room bar a couple of times. It's the one in the white globe. The drinks are amazing very creative and some of the best drinks you can get. Well worth the price and the wait at the bar. It can get very busy especially right after everyone has dinner. Overall totally worth it and I would make an effort to return here.,1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"I drank gallons of tea during my time in England and out of all the tea I had out at restaurants, this place had the best cream tea! I believe it was £10.50 for the cream tea- the tea is endless, so we had a few pots  between the group I was with. The scones were fresh and the atmosphere is unlike any place you will go in London. I have never seen such unique/odd but cool different types of designs in one place. We came in around 3 pm on a Friday and had no issue getting seated. You have to go have a look around this place. Be sure to walk into the different rooms and to their main restaurant upstairs as well. I am sure this place gets pretty wild at night, as it seems like a bit of night life hot spot, but if you are looking for an affordable afternoon tea in a great area, stop by here!",1

had to go to the gallery because the michelin star one was full. service isn't great. it's snobby. but u still want to be there because everyone is 'hip' (.... i can't think of another word to use and it's kind of awkward)
food was good- delicious risotto and dessert, nicely paired with a white wine. i'll skip the loos, (five out of five toilet rolls on LooReviews)
we walked out of gallery and to the left just before the exit, and danced in a room with a cool vibe, where men with handkerchiefs in their suit pockets asked me to dance. fun night all in all.
p.s. LooReviews doesn't exist [yet.]",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,3,"In additon to my review below I have since had another visit to sketch for a friends birthday. We ate in the bar this time around and I can say without any hesitation that it was really, really poor. The food was trying to be art and flavour was an after thought. Out of 6 or 7 dishes we ordered 1 was ok and that was the peanuts. The sandwiches were black (by design), but all this managed to achieve was to to make it taste like a old sports shoe.. 2/10 for the bar, must try (less) harder! Back to basics...
 Have haunted the corridors of sketch on more than one occasion and always had a good time albeit expensive. Yes, put your nice clothes on, buff you shoes, clean your teeth, splash of the smelly stuff and hit the ATM hard and in style, ok now your ready for night.
 Pre dinner cocktails with well healed city girls and boys and then into the restaurant for dinner. Set in visual projected on surroundings the food is well presented, service efficent and wine list good but didnt find any gems.
 Great place for date, not a first! Great for group of friends who want good drinks, fun bar and good looking people.. A little bit shallow, well maybe a touch but theres a place for everything and Sketch fits theres perfectly. Toilets, well everyones else has said plenty about them but for my two cents, there clever and egg shaped, other than that there toilets and Ive seen better places to spend 5 minutes in several other London bars/ restaurants.
 Not sure about about one reviewers suggestion to ""forgetting about the credit crunch"" and hit sketch, theres a good possibilty you will still wake up in the morning with a very expensive hang over and not feeling any better about yourself.. But ive been wrong before... Worth a visit, but please no first dates unless your a city boy with little imagination and a large wallet, in which case, have a great time!",-1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"While in London you have to go to Sketch.
Service and food are just amazing. My favorite is the egg/pod shaped toilets. I always make a dash to go see them. I get yelled at every time by the bathroom attendants who think I am trying to sneak into the mens or something, while I'm just trying to take a picture! They get very angry about that but oh well. Great place, definitely a must do!",1

Fabulous, the only thing I can complain about is that the staff seem to think that they're part of the decor too - it takes a while to get some service here.
Do try the scones and chocolate tart! Absolutely delicious.",1

I've only been here for tea, and every time it's been a great experience. The food is good, but typical, not extremely outstanding or innovative, but always up to a certain standard. Their desserts always look very delicious, and I really do enjoy their tarts. 
I am, however taking a star off because the staff can sometimes be a little snobby. Sometimes I feel like they are a bit short staffed? And it takes awhile for them to come to our table.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"never miss this place if you visit london. Unique place. Go there to enjoy their ambience, special toilet, cool designed chairs and tables. I can't tell if their tea is better than other place, because I forgot its taste while I was looking at their unique things. Maybe no tables left for you, or close. location is also good. walking, shopping, kinda tirey? go there and take some rest. But little bit overpriced, I think. Still, it is  a must- go place! I haven't tried their restaurant, but it always crowded. I assume maybe good food(Not sure).",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"Cathy and I dined here twice, once for afternoon tea and cakes back in September, and once for supper in April. Let me say this much - the place is very large, with different rooms with different themes, and so much to look at that it borders on the distracting (but in a decidedly good way). First, I'll say the one bad spot regarding Sketch ... the service is a little erratic, and sometimes takes a while to get noticed if you're drink is needing replacing or you need extra attention to your meal.  That being said, let me move onto what I can describe as the magic of Sketch!
We got seated proper at 8.30 on a busy Saturday evening in the Gallery Room, and the maitre-d was an incredibly charming French gentleman who said everything with a insouciant flourish of his well-manicured hands and his impeccable smile. A giant lamp made out of children's toys and action-figures and dolls painted entirely white is by the entrance. Near the coat-check is a porcelain statue of two mating greyhounds. In the entrance is a hopscotch painting in the floor, and one of the doors off to the left appears to be melting, cascading thick red resin down a petite flight of stairs. Outside is a merry-go-round of ""out of work"" ashtrays that spins and empties themselves into a urn. Cathy and I were seated next to a softly lit wall set in the centre of the room that was impaled with chairs, pieces of antique tables and chandeliers, and one of the first things we noticed was the projections of the Paris skyline rotating slowly on the upper parts of the walls. A DJ was spinning some wicked house music with a lot of bass, and everybody was beautiful.
We ordered a bottle of Veuve Cliqot, which arrived quickly, and received two little shot glasses of a vegetable puree which was then poured over a little shaving of raw tuna with something that resemble lentils. Cathy's entree was a little radicchio salad with slices of Chilean Sea Bass and a balsamic vinaigrette, I went for more of the tuna!
Main courses came a bit later. I dropped a knife once and a server caught it as it bounced off the floor, and immediately replaced it. Good reflexes! I had a rib-eye steak bloody with dauphinois potatoes and leeks, whilst Cathy had a fish dish I can't remember.
After we had this blowout piece of lovely hot chocolate cake, I took off to the toilets. All I can say is ... WOW. You go through a door in the back and you see in the centre of this massive room a small dugout bar surrounded by two semi-spiraling staircases that envelope the bar as they go to the next level. One is back-lit blue for the boy's toilets, and the other one is pink. You ascend the staircase, and come across these pods that look like escape pods mated with the transportation pods from ""The Fly"" and the eggs from ""Alien"". The door opens with a gentle hiss, and closes behind you. Everything is bathed in a soft blue (or pink if you're a girl) light, and gentle soaring sounds surround you as you complete your business.
I recommend saving some space in your evening for a last glass of champagne in the little dugout bar when you've finished with your meal.  It's rather small, and looks like something out of ""Star Wars"". The gently domed ceiling is covered with little sketches, the bartenders were friendly, and a single portal in the centre gives way to the blue/pink lights from up above near the pod toilets.
A very interesting, fun, and fabulous evening, I highly recommend it!",1

french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I don't have anything in particular to say about the tea, but the scones so good!  And the raspberry jam is the best raspberry jam I've ever had.  That itself made my day.
Sketch also has a gallery in the back of the dining area, and if you go even further back, they have the mot unique bathrooms ever seen.   Each bathroom was a pod.  Kind of like a very comtemporary portapotty.  I even made my friends that didn't need to use the restrooms go check out because they were worth taking pictures of. And I don't take pictures of bathrooms. Ever.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"This place sure is a little bit quirky - which makes it so appealing! It's not the kind of place to take your oldies for Sunday lunch. I visited the Sketch Gallery on a Monday (which was suprisingly buzzing)
 The decor is of course an art gallery so you shouldn't expect anything less than eccentric! The projectors show the latest art exhibit on the blank wall 'canvas'. There is an extensive list of cocktails but @£13 a pop you probably won't be getting too wasted! The bread is served in lego baskets. The food although good isn't exceptional. the menu is based on little carbohydrate & dairy products, so you shouldn't expect mountains of grub!
 Was an interesting experience and you have to go for the whole atmoshphere not just the food. (and the wc's)",1

I came for afternoon tea with my mum for her birthday and it was a wonderful experience. The delicious cakes are displayed like jewels, the decor absolutely ravishing and I would highly recommend a pot of the white jasmine tisane! 
The little girls room is an experience in itself; very space-age/futuristic but it does get your imagination going and a good example of somewhere that has made a conscious effort to make its decor uber cool. 
Lets be honest, Sketch is rather expensive but it has to be visited if only for a cocktail or two to experience the decor (and creative use of technology) alone.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,5,"Futuristic in design with a bit of outerspace galactic appeal not overdone however, this uber cool restaurant is fanciful in delight.
I went with family for dinner to celebrate the festive season. With reservations on hand the quirky minimalist proportions intrigued my male cousin who likes a substantial meal. A two course meal with dessert and wine costs about £40 upwards per head. But with the highly rated service and menu it was a luxurious dinner enjoyed to the utmost. 
My attention was especially caught by the simple use of technology to create ambience. With projection lights placed strategically across the dinner hall patterns evolve throughout the wall and ceiling space to create texture played with colour. Along with the music this movement is so catchy and surprisingly not distracting. I found it highly effective in every possible design rule.
I would say perfect to entertain international business clients, a date with someone special or just a celebration. I don't think big group gatherings could be a success. I may be wrong.",1
french,NRKS1X3bWK42HmSlX-IXnw,Sketch,4,"I've been to many, many great restaurants all over the world, but Sketch is among the most interesting dining experience I've ever had.

When we sat in the dining room, it felt like, as others have said, dining with the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland (helped by the fact that one goes below ground to get there). The food, which my wife astutely observed, was good but had predictable combinations that did not match the bizarreness of the restaurant's design. Nonetheless, I would highly rate, even require, you to visit Sketch when you are in London, even just for a drink and a trip to the lou.",1

 I had a blast. I even danced - something I very rarely do in public. The drinks were pretty delish and very fancy schmancy. In fact the whole flashy moves by the bartenders by the bartenders kinda turned me off. Just fix the drink! But, hey everybody else seemed to like it. So what do I know. The other thing that turned me off and away from drinking more than I would have liked was the price. YEOUCH! Sketch ain't cheap. Most cocktails were well over ten quid. I guess that's to be expected in such a happening Mayfair spot but I had to mention it.",1

Good Food
Great Drinks
Excellent Service
Beautiful people
 This place really does it all for me. Whether you want to have a romantic night for 2 or indeed a wild night with friends Sketch fits the bill!
 I can highly recommend the risotto and without a doubt they have the best mashed potato in London (maybe not eaten together!)
 So it might be a bit pricey... forget the credit crunch for one evening and treat yourself, you won't be disappointed!",1

I have been a few times and the atmosphere is always lively and vibrant and although it's usually very busy the service is excellent and the waiters are very attentive.
 A good night out either with friends or for an intimate meal for two. The decor is lovely - check out the egg shaped bathrooms.

I must admit that it can come across as a bit of a posh persons trendy hang out, but its not the too young ""posh""...ie you don't feel like mummy and daddy are paying for the meal and it's established people that really just like good food and great cocktails.  For a trendy place it's not pretentious and peps working there are great and approachable. There is a bit of fusion going on with the food, but it's all worth a try (adds a bit of excitement to your meal). I'm not sure I would be a huge fan of going back to the sunken bar but for a 5ft5"" chick - it felt good to fill tall",1

The kitchen was much smaller than Las Vegas but after watching the food prep for a little but the synchronized choreography and all the kitchen staff became evident. My order took a minute to sink in with the waiter, ""I want you to pick my meal for me and pair a wine for each course. 
As the food and wine came out each course was delightful prepared and the wines paired perfectly. Nothing disappointed but the ravioli was mouthwatering. 
Rafael, you're going to have to work next time I'm in Las Vegas to deliver me an equal experience!",1

My friends and I got the three course lunch: I got the beetroot tartare, the caramelised quail stuffed with foie gras, and rum baba. 
They served steaming hot bread first with butter. Then they offered us sparkling/still water, and then later red/white wine. Later upon refill, the water accidentally poured more still into the sparkling glasses and vice versus for my friends still water. A slight mess up but it was nothing really.
The chefs beginning foie gras with red wine reduction was very rich, I couldn't finish but it was delicious.
The waiter gave me the carrot starter and I told him I ordered the beetroot but was happy to take the carrots. Another worker told me that he'd give me the beetroot and that we could share the carrot dish! It was delicious too, the beetroot was refreshing.
The quail is one of the best things I've ever had, honey is the perfect flavor to treat your meats. The side of ""famous"" mashed potatoes was also amazingly buttery. 
The rum baba might not be for those who don't like rum or sponge cake, but the vanilla cream is so light and sweet.
The petit four was also a nice bite at the end.",1

We also spoiled ourselves with the freshly shaved jamon iberico served along pan con tomate. The only dish that did not wow us was the sea bass. Otherwise, an amazing meal.",1

Not a 5 Star because the feel, ambiance of restaurant seemed very causal, maybe it was the black and white checkers that reminded you of a steak and shake. I personally enjoyed the food, small portions and creative plates but my partner whom is more of a wine snob than a foodie liked his experience at La Petite Maison which the total bill there was double the cost mainly because of you be Wine. I would still recommend that go here to experience the food. May favorite starter is the Fois grad  hamburgers.

This is the first Michelin Star I have ever been in and it was amazing. The place has a romantic setting and the chef and his workers cook in the kitchen thats right in front of you. The unison of the staff is great! The full course meal is amazing. I had their steak the first time. It was so amazing I had to go there a second time. They start you off with a selection of bread and butter. Their water was 6 pounds which makes sense for the restaurant to charge that much. Afterwards, they bring you 3 small complimentary appetizers. Their molecular gastronomy techniques are excellent. Hard for me to describe the taste so I will leave photos of them after the review. Next was the 20 oz steak with jalapeno peppers and finely cut potatoes. They wrap a small bundle of rosemary to enhance the flavor of the steak. This steak was and still is, the best steak I have ever had. On the side is their famous smashed potatoes and it definitely has an exquisite taste. Lastly they gave me complimentary desert that was a great palate clenser. All for only 55 pounds. If this was a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, I can't imagine what a 3 star will taste like. I can still imagine the soft firm taste like it was yesterday. Until one day, I will come back to this place",1

If you dine here you need to surrender yourself to the whims of the chef or your server.  If you do, you will not be sorry.  The service is good but the menu selection is superb.  I had the chef's menu and was blown away by the presentation and the flavors.  For me, the highlight was the dessert which consisted of ""chocolate wonderfulness"" that defies an adequate description!  This is an expensive spot but its innovative menu and remarkable ambiance is well worth it.  My only issue was our server had a very thick accent which made it difficult to understand her.  I am not trying to be picky but this put me off a bit.  Our entire group had the same problem and we had a group that included both native German and French speakers.  The acoustics didn't help.  The menu, presentation, and food gets five stars.  Service, sadly was a little confused with plates arriving at different intervals.  Not a huge issue but caused the overall rating to slip from five to four stars.  If you want a special meal in London, L'Atelier should not be overlooked!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"We were excited to see that there were reservations available on a Saturday night.  We booked a 10:30 PM slot. When we arrived, our table was not ready.  We were sent up to a lounge where we were given menus for cocktails. No one ever came by to take our order while others were being seated and helped. Finally, after 30 minutes, someone came by. He was extremely apologetic and provided us with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine.  About ten minutes after that, and fort minutes after our reservation time, we were seated.
Someone promptly came to give us menus and bread.  There were no bread plates, so after several minutes we had to ask.  My friend ordered a diet coke.  The waiter took our order and then a few minutes later someone else came to take our order.
We ordered the eight course tasting menu.  My friend's diet coke never came, so after a few courses, we had to re-order. I ordered a cocktail, the Secreta Negrita around the first course. It came around around the seventh course. That was ridiculous. I didn't get it until I threatened to cancel the drink order.
Our dessert took forever, at least 25-30 minutes after we finished the last course, which was strange because the other courses came out at a nice pace. By this time, people were banging pots and cleaning without seeing if we needed anything. I kept having to flag down people for water.
We had the eight course tasting menu.  
Course 1: Tempura - This is not your Japanese style tempura. These were fresh vegetables wrapped in a light tempura batter.  Simple and delicious with a light cucumber and mint cream.
Course 2: Caviar - The caviar was served over crab with potatoes vichyssoise. This was beautifully plated on a plate with palms painted on it and a bowl of ice underneath the dish.  Very beautiful.  The caviar was on top, and then the potatoes vichyssoise, and underneath was the delicious crab. The combination was superb. 
Course 3: Seared Scallop - This was beautifully presented on a half shell on top of potatoes mousseline. The scallop was seared perfectly. The texture and flavors were supreme.
Course 4: Gyoza - This was a chicken and leek gyoza in a hibiscus broth. The broth was slightly sweet and acidic. It was so good that I didn't leave a drop in the bowl.  The gyoza was my least favorite.  It didn't taste any better than the dollar dumplings in NYC, aside from the soft (vs dollar dumplings' rubbery) texture!
Course 5: Foie Gras with a similar hibiscus broth/juice from the previous course. This was my favorite!  It was a generous portion, and it really melted in my mouth, truly a wonderful experience.
Course 6: John Dory with a tandoori-lime emulsion. This was my second least favorite course. It was good, but the texture was a bit rough. I never had John Dory before, so maybe that's how it's supposed to be. I really liked the broth, and it came with baby clams.
Course 7: I had the lamb cutlets. My friend had the quail stuffed with foie gras. Both came with a mashed potato that was to die for. It was the thickest and creamiest mashed potato I ever had. I had my lamp medium well. It was tender and savory. 
This was around the time I got my drink, La Secreta Negrita.  It's truly a dessert in itself, a creamy mezcal drink with a chocolate treat inside.  
At this point someone put a bowl of the mashed potatoes in front of us and didn't say anything.  Several minutes passed by with it sitting there, so we asked about it. And the waiter said he ordered it by mistake. We gratefully indulged!
Course 8: Herb sorbet and kiwi puree with a light Sorbet AND Chocolate Mousse with Oreo cookies.  This was worth the wait. 
Overall, a beautiful venue with fresh vegetables serving as decor and strong red colors that make the ambiance.  The food is divine.  If they can get their service in order, this would be the perfect experience!",-1

Cocktails to start, gorgeous combination of spirits, decorated with fruit and flowers. 
Little palette cleansers in between, that were fresh and flavoursome.
I had the duck, duck bon bons and cherries, it was cooked perfectly, and tasted divine. It was only then that we realised we were sat facing the open plan kitchen, they were working so quietly, efficiently and cleanly they didn't disturb anyone.
Before desert, we were given little petit fours of truffles and gorgeous raspberry marshmallows. 
We ordered pots of tea, with super attentive service I wasn't allowed to pour my own. 
My friend's desert in particular was amazing, with a beret of leopard print painted chocolate, my desert was also perfect, but not quite as pretty.

My friend and I were very excited about this lunch. Turns out it did not live up to the Michelin star expectation. #disappointed
We were sat at the bar area elbow touching elbow with the customers next to us. I could literally read who the customer next to me was whatsapping. There was a couple sitting next to my friend, talking about her mum #wedidntwanttoknowherstoriesok(!). Cosy was not what I was expecting. 
The bread came without the butter. We waited for a few minutes thinking the butter was on its way. Sadly it did not show up and we had to request it. I felt that the waiting staff should be more attentive. 
The starters, mains and desserts were decent. However, it just felt that we were having fine dining at a cosy ramen bar. 
The last disappointment hit when the coffee came without the chocolates/sweets. The waitress did inform us that the sweets were on their way. Though they never show up and we ended up asking for them. 
All in all, a huge let down.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,1,My review plain and simple. We had a reservation for a family celebration and they did not have a table when we got there. Which is not a acceptable situation for any restaurant. Even the local chain restraints can accomplish something that simple.,-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,2,"Big disappointment for a Michelin starred restaurant. The meal left me quite sick well into the night and next day. I started feeling sick after the third course and was was sick until the night. Husband had the regular tasting menu and I had the vegetarian. He liked his; I did not like mine at all. The two stars is for husband liking his meal. However, The vegetarian courses were quite heavy and complex, but in a way I found overwhelming and ""tried too hard."" The beetroot and poached quail egg dishes were nice.  
Aside from the somewhat disappointing food courses, the service was very patchy. We asked to see the sommelier a few times before she appeared, a promised dessert wine never came, and courses took a while to come out even when we were the last people there and they were cleaning to close. 
The worst part was that we saw at least one mouse running about the restaurant. One if the waiters stomped his feet to scurry away the mouse. When that mouse or another one reappeared, another waiter blamed it on the door being left open. The hostess said, "" don't worry madam-- it's a mini one.""  That statement did not work in their favor. The door was not open and seemed unlikely that the mouse had run in from the outside as this was pretty far into the end of the restaurant and there are two separate doors by the entrance. That's not acceptable for any restaurant, much less a Michelin started one. It completely ruined my appetite for the last dessert course that took too long to come.",-1

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.We dined at Joel Robuchon in London for Christmas dinner last winter.  We've been a fan of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon restaurants in many cities, but our experience on Christmas day at your restaurant fell far short of our expectations.
The food was decent, as consistent as other Robuchon restaurants we've been to.  It didn't wow us as much, possibly as our bar is always moving higher.  The service, however, made us feel unwelcome.  We were about 10 minutes late to our reservation due to traffic, which we apologized profusely for.  However, I don't think the service thereafter was justifiable.
Throughout the night we were consistently ignored.  We weren't sure if there was a dedicated server for us, as no one had introduced themselves as we were seated, and several folks rotated on our needs.  It took roughly 5 minutes after we were seated to get a menu.  It took another 10 minutes for someone to take our order (we got the tasting menu).  The older couple next to us had a blast talking with many of the staff, which is great for them, but my wife and I were paid no attention to for drinks or feedback on the food.  At the end of our meal, it again took a long time for the bill to arrive after we had asked, and no one bothered to take away our dishes after bringing us the bill.
At some point we wondered if we were ignored because we looked younger or because of our ethnicity (we saw other tables also ignored according to a pattern), I'd rather not assume discrimination so we'll chalk it up to just bad service.  Given that it's Christmas night, this made it all the more frustrating experience.
All in all, I would not visit Joel Robuchon London again, nor recommend to anyone.  You can get better food in many places, and better service in all places.",-1

The cleanliness was good. But then again, it was so dark i couldn't see much. You feel like you're entering a Chinese torture room with antechamber and all. The service was awkward. They sit everyone at the bar looking into the kitchen so the service is impersonal. Also, every time the chef said something, the minions would say, ""oui, chef"" and it got very annoying after the 70th time. Also, i ordered a Sazerac and it took over 30 minutes!!! I have no idea what happened. Someone dropped the ball? After 30 minutes i told them to just forget it but eventually they ended up bringing it anyway as a freebie. Regarding the honesty, i dont know. I didnt like the exorbitant pricing for a lackluster experience. Two hamburger sliders for example was £21 (almost USD$30). If they had made the whole experience more personalized, intimate, and awesome i wouldnt mind the price. I also felt they were more interested in making money than providing an experience.  After asking for the check, it was very awkward. They kept opening and closing the pocketbook with the check and whispering amongst themselves. At one point i got annoyed and asked, ""is that mine? Is there a problem?"" Even after setting it down, Two seemingly managers came to open the pocketbook again and look at the check. ::rolls eyes:: oh, lastly, the maitre'd seemed annoyed when we arrived.",1

My wife had a five course tasting menu while I secreted a few things a la carte. 
A few standouts-
Lamb chops- maybe the best lamb I've ever eaten. Perfect. 
Blacken Cod- pretty good. But not the best I've ever eaten. 
Foie gras stuffed quail- very good especially the quail. 
In the downside the deserts didn't wow us. My Oreo cookie chocolate entree was just so so.  My wife had a mango sorbet / homemade candy concoction which was also just ok.

Of all of them, this is our favorite, because of the intimate size of the downstairs area. It offers arguably the best tasting menu in London, with wine pairings that superbly match each course. 
The artistry of the food arrangement is really unsurpassed, and it's great fun to watch it being assembled before you, so be sure to ask for a seat at the counter. This makes it easy to chat with the servers and sommelier, making it a friendly, energizing experience.

Absolutely delicious. From the beginning to the end, it was definitely a two Michelin star experience. It was actually fairly empty when me and my friend went, so we had 3 people serving out table. They recommended the Riesling from Germany which was lovely. Nice, sweet and refreshing. It suited my tastes perfectly.
I ordered the lobster salad, which has fresh lobster (really good, comparable to Newfoundland!), avocado, fried courgette and large mozzarella cheese balls. It also has a green creamy sauce which I would hazard is avocado. 
This came after a basket of fresh bread, which of course also tastes great when you're hungry. This was followed by an aperitif which was quite interesting. 
They brought out a free bowl of mashed potatoes which somehow was also really good, rich and creamy. 
We finished the night with dessert. I ordered the chocolate mousse but I just couldn't finish it. So good but so rich! Definitely get desserts to share! It had this white whipped cream around it which was nice and a little bit lighter to complement the rich dark chocolate mousse and it had a hard chocolate top.

It is so bad, I asked the hotel to never book a guest here ever.  
I arrived for my reservation on time for 8:30. I sat upstairs for 50 minutes waiting for my table. We were told that there was no ETA on when we could be seated. At this point, we were waiting over an hour to be seated. At 9:30, I was told by a manager that I could sit at the bar on level 1. There were three people in my party. There were empty tables that could accommodate us. How would that work with three people eating dinner at a noisy bar? When I spoke to a very nice manager, he finally seated us at a table.  Once at the table, it took 20 minutes for someone to come take our order. We ordered basic steaks close to 10pm at night. As time went on, no food was delivered to us. We kept having a manager tell us the food would be here shortly.- ""a few more minutes"". We waited 70 minutes after we ordered but STILL NO FOOD. At this point we had been in the restaurant for close to 3 hours with no food but bread and water. We had ordered coke to drink for the table. That never arrived. We spoke to a very rude and condescending manager who told us to ""be patient"".  At that point we got up and left. It was 11:30pm.
Another manager, told us the food was coming and to go back to the table. He kept saying the kitchen was backed up but the food would be there soon. 
While we were getting our coats, the hostess was laughing about the situation.  She then said to my friend ""have a good night, thank you""
We walked out of the restaurant at 11:40pm followed by the manager who basically told us to not come back. 
I told my hotel, who booked the reservation, to never book there. They will not.

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Truly spectacular in every way. The food, the hospitality, the service, the ambiance, they all hit the right notes in an evening that was more like a symphony than a meal. We ate on the ground floor in the bar area, a concept begun in 2003 at his left bank St. Germain location in Paris. I highly recommend this as it allows you to watch the precision of the kitchen,  which you're in full view of, and you can engage more easily with the staff and your neighbors if you so choose. 
Either before or after dinner make sure you head to the 3rd floor for drinks as an aperitif or post dessert coffee or tea. Beautiful lounge like bar with an outdoor patio area on warm nights. 
The staff is so great you could have a bad meal and walk out smiling. Of course, having a bad meal here has got to be impossible. We opted for choosing 3 courses each from the starter list/tapas style and portion part of the menu. See my attached pics for mouthwatering crab, langoustine, scallop, girolles (chanterelles), black cod, quail, chocolate soufflé and pineapple dishes. Epic meal!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"Been to the restaurant once but more frequently to the bar upstairs which is a place you need to know about as not evident from the outside or, as you step into to the restaurant.
The bar is a cosy place with soft furnishing to relax into.   There is an outside area for the summer time.  During the winter there is a large fire to keep you warm.  Cosy little seating areas which are great for a catch up treat. 
This is a treat as the price of the drinks are rather on the higher end of the scale.  Waiter service is attentive without being hassled and drinks served with a decorative little rose petal placed beside it.  
Cocktails are wonderful (but reflected in the price).  Challenge here is not to drink too much that you forget (or stop caring) about the cost as it can be a pricey visit!
However, love it here!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"We had a very good lunch time deal with top end quality food, from very well poached egg, to pig trotter terrine, foie gras & blackcurrant coulis teaser and deliciously baked bread.",1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"It's a five star place, no getting around it.  L'Atelier serves super high quality food in a casual environment.  The location is in the heart of tourist London, but L'Atelier is hidden in a smaller street so it's not crowded.  
All the foie gras dishes there are really good and perfectly cooked.  I especially liked the lobster dumplings with foie gras sauce, since the lobster was really sweet, the foie gras sauce gave it just the right amount of bitterness it needed.
I also really enjoyed the veal steak.  It was also cooked to perfection and was tender as fuck mate.  They have a sommelier there if you dont know your wine shit, but make sure you are specific when you tell them what you want otherwise they just gonna suggest the most expensive shit.
Would probably come here every time i go to London because french food is bomb AF",1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,Kind of overrated and extremely over priced! The only thing amazing here is there lamb chops and there mash potatoes everything else is extremely overrated borderline awful,-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"We were somewhat disappointed in our experience here. The food was good, don't get me wrong. However, the food wasn't great, and for the money that we paid to eat here, we expected and should have received great. 
We ordered a range of things from the menu including the foie gras, scallops, miso cod, and lamb. The foie gras was done excellent and so was the lamb. Surprisingly, the best part about the lamb was the mashed potatoes that came with it. Unfortunately, the miso cod was very average and we have had much better. However, the biggest letdown were the scallops. The presentation was beautiful (as it was in every dish), but they smelled and tasted fishy, to the point where we couldn't even finish them. They were also in a very harsh flavored sauce that did not go well with them at all and couldn't even cover up the fishy taste enough to swallow them. 
I am happy we tried L'Atelier after hearing so much about it, but I highly doubt we would go back after the mediocre experience we had there.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"This might be my new favorite restaurant.  We had the tasting menu last month while sitting at the counter and it was fabulous.  First of all the service is impeccable.  The staff is attentive, helpful and friendly.  
The tasting menu was amazing and the sommelier arranged a wine pairing alongside it for us.  We started with crunchy spring vegetables in tempura that was a perfect light first course.  The second course was a crab royal with vichyssoise and caviar.  It was basically parfait of vichyssoise with delicious crab at the bottom and topped with caviar.  It was excellent.  The third course was a seared scallop and was lovely but suffered by comparison to our crab.  The fourth course was a chicken and leek gyoza that was excellent in a tasty broth.  The foie gras course came next and was excellent with fresh cherries.  We then moved onto the black cod that was good but set the stage for our main, the lamb.  The lamb was excellent and flavorful.  For dessert we had mango with a passionata sorbet followed by a herb sorbet with chartreuse cream.  
All in all, a wonderful meal and even if you dont eat some of the things on the tasting menu, I would suggest you go for it.  I rarely eat crab or caviar but that might have been the highlight of the meal.  Everything is so well done, you cannot go wrong!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon had flawless execution from start to finish. I am 110% satisfied with the experience I had here. Right when you walk through the door, you're greeted by a friendly host who gladly checks your winter coat. I came here for lunch yesterday with a friend and we both had an amazing time. The atmosphere is dark, dim, and especially trendy. I loved the back where the wall is covered with tree leaves. We were seated at the bar, which was lovely because you can see everything the chefs are doing. Every dish is carefully crafted and none reach the table unless it looks absolutely perfect. And yes, it tastes as good as it looks.
It was lunchtime and a prix-fixe menu is available with a few options at different price points. We opted for the one-starter or dessert and main entree for £28. We both went with starters and a main entree.
Starters
L'ŒUF DE POULE - Poached egg in a crispy rice batter served with black truffle &Iberian ham; This was incredibly delicious. My friend said it reminded her of hash browns & breakfast, which isn't a bad thing at all.
LE CŒUR DE SUCRINE - Heart of lettuce with chicken breast, crispy bacon & parmesan shaving; Very light, but still very tasty. All the elements of a caesar salad, not the most unique dish but still very good nonetheless.
Mains
LE CABILLAUD - Cod fillet served with flat parsley ravioli and vegetable broth; Very light and flaky but very tasty. The vegetable broth was amazingly flavorful, the fish was steamed cooked to perfects, and the ravioli cover gave it a nice touch.
SPECIAL OF THE DAY, PORK FLANK - This isn't on the menu, but it was most definitely the best dish we ordered. The pork was tender and juicy and packed full of flavor. It was one of those dishes that with every bite you take, you roll your eyes back and savor each bite. Yes, it was that AMAZING.
Not only did we have an incredible lunch, but to add to the already amazing experience, the service was just as good. I guess I shouldn't be surprised given this restaurant has 2 Michelin stars, but the waitstaff kept bringing us little sides throughout the entire time. Compliments of the chef, we received an amuse bouche to give our tastebuds a teaser, fennel & mashed potatoes as sides for our entree, and a little dessert to end our meal. We spent a good two hours in here and we were never rushed out even though we sat and stewed for a while after our meal was over. 
I'm a big fan of this restaurant and I'll gladly say that this was one of the best experiences that I've had at a restaurant in London. If you're short on dough and want to experience a culinary experience here, try to come during lunch time when the prix-fixe menus are available.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Excellent service, nice decor and ambiance. Was there for the Holidays, the menu was different but still very original.
Did the wine pairing, they were all excellent choices, so much that we asked if we could have a copy of the wine list so we could order them later.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"The upstairs cocktail bar is where it's at!
I haven't eaten her, but would say that this amongst one of my favourite cocktail bars in London.
You wouldn't be mistaken entering this building through the bouncer guarded door into the mute black tones of this venues reception that this place requires a suit. But don't be scared, as long as you're not wearing trainers, ripped clothing and paint splotched jeans, the chances are they won't turn you away and leaving your excess luggage in the clock room and you'll be escorted to the top floor cocktail bar!
In the same black muted tones, you'll find plush red seating laden with cushions. For those who like the outdoors there is also a outdoor patio that allows you the fresh air that you so seldom find in venues located so centrally.
At around £12 a pop for a cocktail, some may find this on the more expensive side, however it's still a reasonably priced night out if you don't expect to binge drink and are happy to nurse your beverage.
However beverage really isn't the right word to describe these cocktails, each is made extremely well with great care, have a fantastic balance of flavours and you'll find amongst some good old favourites, some really great modern twists.
I would highly recommend the Aviation No.3 which is pure nectar. Whilst the Fleur de Framboise is surprisingly delectable, without the normal sharp tones your expect for a dink that features Prosecco.
The atmosphere, the attention to detail and the fantastic drinks, definitely makes the salon bar a firm favourite of mine!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"I really enjoyed a lovely dinner with friends.  Had the 8 course with regular (non-French wine parings).  The 8 gets you an extra dessert and a few other goodies.  We sat downstairs; the stools feel a little uncomfortable for an 8 course meal.  The quail and caramel desert were very memorable.  The french vibe was also very cool.
After dinner they seated you upstairs for coffee and dessert, which was great, too.  There is a pre-theater special that I would have tried if I knew about it.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Four course tasting menu with the option to upgrade dishes.  The final tab was £70 for lunch, and I wouldn't have changed anything about it.

The environment is modern and creative and really makes you feel like you are in a movie, without being intimidating.   I sat at the bar once and got a table with a date another time and both were great, though very different experiences.   If you want to impress someone, you can't go wrong here.

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"New Years Eve in London - It had to be French - San Francisco banned foie gras so getting my hands on some was 100% necessary. 
Atmosphere: 
Nearly identical to L'Atelier in Tokyo - dim, chill, trendy, centered around their bustling open kitchen
Service:
Relaxed, friendly, a bit scattered at times
Food:
The tasting menu for the day didn't appeal to us so we went a la carte, which meant double the foie =) Overall - the black cod and mini-burgers with foie were excellent, but everything else was tasty but very forgettable.
Damage: ~£200 for 2 (including some champagne)
Overall - A notch down from the Tokyo branch and  the weakest 2-star Michelin I've been to, I think closer to a medium quality 1-star. Doesn't matter though, cuz I got my foie =)",-1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"I just came here for drinks... but after the experience that I had, I will definitely return for dinner.
Upon entering the lobby, you are greeted with a chic, tasteful decor and a typically friendly hostess. The other thing that you are greeted with is a beautifully cloying food aroma. And this is one of the very reasons that I know I will return here!
After being escorted to the lift, you will head to either at the restaurant or the cocktail bar. In my case, the latter. The chic, gloss black and red decor continues through here and I always appreciate a bar with dim lighting. I never understand why in London, bars insist on flood light-strength illumination!
The table staff tried very hard to accommodate our large group and did so with good grace. When my cocktail arrived, it was presented in a beautiful manner along with a single petal - I know that they have great attention to detail here and I very much appreciate this.
With the amazing ambiance, great service and that oh-so-wonderful food aroma... I can't wait to return!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"After having been to a few other L'Atelier locations, I feel that the food at this L'Atelier was the best. I did the big tasting menu and everything was so amazing. The cocktails were delicious (could have been a little stronger), and the presentation of each dish was phenomenal. It was a little bit dark and slightly tight in there, but it didn't really matter since I sat at the counter. I highly suggest sitting up there, especially if you eat alone a lot like I do. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in London!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"Regular Tuesday evening at work and a senior colleague declared that we would be doing a 'spontaneous' team dinner after work. I volunteered to organize. Knowing the nature of the people at dinner, I knew I needed to look at the top end of the range - Hakkasan, Galvin Bistrot, sketch, L'Atelier de JR. Amazingly, sketch and this place had seats available - the bosses preferred good food over funky atmosphere, so we settled on L'Atelier. 
Free team dinner at Michelin restaurant - yes, please! But oh no, I have some medical restrictions for a few months on alcohol, raw food and delicacies like caviar and foie gras - oh so sad (What a strictly upper middle class first world problem :P)
We were seated upstairs in a dark gallery with dimmed lighting, stylish decor and a view of the kitchen. We provided plenty of logistical challenges to the restaurant between my dietary constraints and one of the party arriving 45mins late, which upset some of the rhythm of the multi-course menu.
After some confusion, we finally placed our orders. The tasting menu comes in 5-/8-courses with two different types of wine pairings (Sommelier's choice vs. French pairings) - we decided to brave the 5-course menu with Sommelier's choice(not for me!)...but as I started reading through the details of the menu, I realised I could have almost none of the courses without replacements, so despite the ""strict"" rules about the entire table ordering the menu, I was allowed by the chef to order off the 'small tasting dishes' menu. The other alternative was to order off the vegetarian tasting menu but frankly, what's the point? 
After running into foie gras in the most unlikely places, I finally picked 4 small dishes (with dessert to follow!) to keep pace with my colleagues' 5-course menu. A nice balance of veggie, pasta, fish and meat with non-alcoholic drinks.
Verdict:
1) Spiced Carrot Juice - excellent. Light, gingery, quenches thirst perfectly without overwhelming the palate or weighing me down.
2) The amuse bouche with port reduction, egg etc- hmm, oh yes, readied the palate very nicely for a grand meal afterwards
3) Slightly smoked aubergine caviar with vegetables and spicy tomato coulis - Tangy and sour from the tomato coulis, just the way I like it, the aubergine was of a smooth texture with crunchy veggies to balance out the creaminess. I like.
4) Capellini with tomatoes and a méli-mélo of crunchy Spring vegetables - a cold dish of stringy pasta in tomato sauce presented pleasingly with a range of veggies. This was certainly the most underwhelming dish of the evening for me. It made me wish I had gone for the lamb, cod or crabmeat instead.
5) The Apple Mint Soda took a while to materialise, some chasing was required - I liked the first few sips but soon, it was ghastly in its sweetness and it overpowered my palate and appetite so much that I had to drink water to wash out its flavour before eating
6) John Dory fillet on a tomato reduction with avocado vierge sauce - I hadn't had a dory in a long time, so I enjoyed the dish. It was a bit more-ish which is perfectly fine as I was starting to get a bit full. I would venture to say that a tomato reduction is a fairly strong flavour, not always ideal with fish, but this worked. In the future, I'll keep in mind not to order two dishes (aubergine caviar and this) in the same range of flavours - both dominated by the sourness of tomato
7) Gyoza of braised veal shank with spinach and harissa - This definitely felt like a 'main'. For one, there are 4 substantially sized gyozas where one might expect 2 or 3. Also, the meat is bursting with flavour and tender, so you can't just inhale it without noticing the quantity. The gyoza was made perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 
8) The bread basket was fabulous!
Aha, dessert. While the rest had to go with their menu-dictated choice (something boring with raspberry), I could pick from a wide range, and I decided to go for the Warm Guanaja chocolate soufflé and Sicilian pistachio ice cream, despite their warnings that it could take 15-20mins. It didn't take that long and oh my gosh, definitely the highlight of the meal! The souffle was the BEST I have had in life. It was light as air, the chocolate was dark and intense, the texture was flawless...I almost didn't notice the pistachio icecream because I couldn't get over the souffle, ooh la la.
I noticed my colleagues enjoyed a wide range of wines from various regions, including an unusual Riesling from Luxembourg. 
So. Why the 4 stars, and not 5? Well, when my dinner costs a small fortune (over 700quid for 4 of us, and I wasn't even drinking), I would like to not feel like I'm inconveniencing the chef through my dietary constraints. If foie gras is merely a garnish in a dash, can they not exclude it? Even chain restaurants are happy to customize so this was unexpected. Service was friendly but a bit confused. Even so, excellent place and quite an experience!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"It must be me. Or maybe they were just having an off night.  I have eaten at amazing restaurants all around the world and people talked about L'Atelier like it was the second coming or something. I thought it was just OK. 
First of all- there is a ton of pretense. I can be as pretentious as the next person but there was attitude abounding in this place. First the reservation. We called a month in advance and still could only get a 9:30 seating. We got there early and were seated in the upstairs lounge drinking very pricey cocktails until our table was ready around 9:45. 
A quick note on the lounge as it was quite lovely.  There is an outdoor area with the walls covered in ivy.  Inside are several grouped seating areas- one around a large fireplace with leather sofas and chairs.  We grabbed a corner table relaxing in the club chairs that surrounded it.  Another nice touch?  They put down black napkins for your drinks and adorn them with a red rose petal.  Very classy.
Once our reservation was called, because there were 4 of us- we were not seated around the kitchen which is the norm (allows patrons to interact with the chefs)- but got one of the very few tables in the place. This place is small. It gives the illusion of being bigger than it is with mirrors on every wall but I think there may have only been 4 or 5 tables in the whole place. Most of the seating is at the counter where you can see the food being prepared sort of Japanese style. 
Service was SLOW- slow even by European standards (I get that everyone thinks we Americans are always in a rush but we were hungry!) And our server kept commenting on our choices as if we should be ordering something else. 
The menu is broken down into two areas- smal tastings on the left facing page and entree sized portions on the right. But don't think you can share the tastings.. These are little tastes. If you want to share- you need to order more than one- and at these prices . . .it adds up fast. 
We ordered a variety of the tastes: soup, john dory, squid, mini burgers, the salmon (which never came) and the egg cocette. We also ordered the beef tartar from the entree side of the page. While most were good (forget the egg cocette if you want my opinion and order more of the john dory- now that was good!) this was not food I was going to rave to people about. Nor would you be full. Four people split the above and if not for the bread- we would have walked out hungry. 
But since one in our party had been there before- we had a special treat for dessert. Picture a ball of chocolate (About the size of a softball) filled with fruit and ice cream. At your table- they then pour hot liquid chocolate over it which causes the shell to break apart and reveal what is inside. This was the highlight of my entire dining experience and truly unique. 
I would have a hard time recommending this place to friends as I think for the money there are better places to eat in London. Those that know me, know that I am not on a budget when I eat out. But I also like to think that the place that I am spending my money wants me as a customer. I didn't get that feeling here at all. And for that . . I doubt I'll be back.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"This place is very classy and expensive.  We took Mum here when she came over from NZ on holiday, it was good for a special occasion like this.  The dishes were very well presented.  The servings were small, but the food was rich and you didn't feel like you would want the servings to be any bigger.
Every dish was luxurious and delicious.  We shared our dishes with each other, so we could experience all of the tastes.
The staff were very helpful.  We were looking for a side salad and there wasn't one on the menu, but it was no issue for our waiter to get the kitchen to make one for us.
Of course, this was an expensive dinner, but this is a place that you would go to for a special treat.  I would recommend this restaurant in that context.",1

Went for a date night, sat upstairs and ordered the tasting menu paired with wine.  It was a lengthy experience and I loved it.  The details were right, the range of flavors wide and expertly done matched by attentive service and a very clever sommelier.
I remember one course was spaghetti and red sauce.  I thought they must be  joking...this place!?  But it fit in perfectly wasn't a huge portion hiding behind some oddity, just a very well done dish.

The starter was an egg in a crispy rice with black truffle and ham - freaking good...
The main dish was Le Cabillaud which is a cod fillet with ravioli and vegetables which gives it a special taste... Vegetables were perfectly cooked. 
Both dishes were amazing!

The flavours are mouth watering to say the least and the service is immaculate, however something lacks the true fine dining experience I felt.

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"This is one of the 3 Joel Rubuchon's I've eaten at, and it's definitely a very good place to try. Actually, it's probably my favorite restaurant in London! However, I should point out that compared to the locations in Paris and New York, I found this branch to be slightly behind, quality wise.
For my meal, I had the the beef carpaccio, the langoustine ravoili, and the beef and foie gras burger with caramelized onions. 
The carpaccio was scrumptious, lovely cuts of meat simply complimented with gorgeously flavored olive oil, garlic and chives. The langoustine ravioli was very good, but it didn't blow me away. I could barely taste the langoustine and the portion was so tiny I didn't get much of a second chance to try and search for more flavor! Finally, the burger was good, but a bit of a disappointment. The flavor of the the foir gras was outstanding, but the beef was a bit non-descript, and overall, as a concept, it just didn't work for me. They also gave me an ""order"" of fries, that had about 4 fries in it. I realize you go to a Joel Robuchon for the taste not portion size, but c'mon! Four f****** fries?
Finally, I just want to note that our waiter (or whatever you call the guys within the Atelier) was a bit obnoxious when talking to us, quite a contrast to the other Joel Robuchon's we dined at where they exude professionalism. I wish I got his name, but since I didn't Ill just say that the guy was coarse and made a few inappropriate jokes which I felt had no place in this type of environment.
Overall, definitely four stars, but surprisingly, not five due to slightly disappointing food and an oaf of a waiter. Still worth a visit!",1

I'm usually pretty picky and not a seafood fan but I tried and loved them all.

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Despite 3 fruitful years in high school French and numerous attempts by my 18-year-old-self to trick people into believing I was French, I didn't have an effing clue what ""L'Atelier"" meant. Even upon entering the interior of the sleek restaurant with Asian-inspired decor, I still had no clue. Let's face it, I googled it just before I began this review. According to the free dictionary (yes, had to use the free one because it turns out places with apostrophes in the name are as expensive as they sound), L'atelier means ""A workshop or studio, especially for an artist or designer."" It all fell into place when I read that... 
Words to describe our experience and the food at L'Atelier: Superb, fabulous, wonderful, delicious, beautiful, surprising, gorgeous, yes-I'll-have-a-dessert-even-though-I'm-full-and-will-be-late-to-my-west-end-show-licious. First off, the service was wonderful. Not stuffy or overly formal, but friendly and extremely professional. I do think the Frenchman delivering our food may have amped up his accent just a bit to play the part of the French waiter, or it could be that in contrast to my ridiculously English boyfriend, it stood out. Disclaimer: The sommelier was also helpful and accommodating with regard to the price range we felt comfortable with. 
The food...scratch that. The Food (yes, it has to be considered a proper noun - it's that good) was spectacular. We began with a rich amuse bouche and a basket of 3 types of wonderful bread - traditional baguette, savoury olive bread and a sweet fig bread. If I could have bought a loaf of each to take home, I would have. We opted for 4 courses. I went a little egg crazy and got a cheese soufflé, followed by a crispy poached egg served atop parmesan mousse. A CRISPY poached egg! How does that even happen? I was sitting there while they made it in the open kitchen and I still have no idea what frankenstein science was used! All I know is that I want it to happen over and over again. I had duck for the main and it was every bit as delicious as I could have hoped. This is where my only criticism comes though - the orange sauce that came with the duck was far too sweet for my taste and reminded me of a melted down hard candy. I just ate around it and enjoyed the duck in a slightly purer form. I was, however, reminded of the time when my dad was making a ""new recipe"" which was ""orange chicken"" and when we didn't have real orange juice, he used Sunny Delight instead. We ended up eating pizza that night. 
My boyfriend was equally as happy with his dishes - a lobster salad with a very generous portion of lobster, a shitake chicken broth and a 'spit roast of the day,' which happened to be lamb and (surprise) happened to be delicious! We were also given a complimentary pot of the smoothest, creamiest mashed potatoes either of us had ever had. Despite running short of time, we decided to squeeze in dessert because, well, we are greedy, disgusting gluttons but it somehow seems more acceptable when it's not burgers and nachos... We had the same - chocolate fondant with a mint sorbet. No points for creativity here, but from the first bite it was obvious this had been perfected and shouldn't be messed with. 
The really outstanding thing about this restaurant is that they so artfully prepared ingredients, we each enjoyed things we otherwise wouldn't have touched with a 10 foot pole. Case in point: My boyfriend hates eggs so much that I had to get a hysterectomy (ok, not that much but you know...). He ate and ENJOYED the savoury crème brûlée amuse bouche. (*sorry Ed, you ate eggs. I didn't want you to spit your food up at this civilised establishment so didn't tell you).  I hate sea creatures and am actually scared of them. This probably all goes back to when I got sea lice as a kid but that's another story for another time. I ate a piece of lobster and didn't even flinch! Neither of us particularly like olives, we pounded all the olive bread like it was the last bread on the planet. 
L'Atelier is one of the best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. It's clear that there is a real passion for food, art and creativity here. It's front of house is well managed and they even walked us down the street to get us going the right direction to the show we were attending. It's not cheap and it's not everyday fare, but it's worth every penny and great for a special occasion or a good ol' fashioned splurge. I'll be saving up my burger and nacho money from now on and putting it in the L'Atelier fund!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,Delicious food in an elegant setting.  The service was terrific.  My only regret is that I couldn't eat more...,1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"Went there with my girlfriend. I was expecting delicious food and a good atmosphere as the owner is one of the most reputed Michelin-Famed chefs. 
The food was excellent and I don't regret the fact I chose to go there to eat something delicious. Even if a bit pricy for what it was.
Unfortunately, the service was not what I was expecting for.
They have ""bar"" tables in front of the open kitchen and room tables, they didn't ask about our preference but just ""your seats are here"". If some people enjoy to see guys cooking food, I definitely don't recommend it as it quickly becomes really hot and all what you want to do is to leave the restaurant.
You can hear ""Service, s'il vous plait"" a large amount of time during your dinner, each time a plate has to be served. I don't know if it's to add something to the ""show"", but that's a way too much, and the french food doesn't require it.
Other than that, you can expect to have good time there. Again, the food was amazing :)",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"I decided to treat myself to a 'nice' dinner. This was far beyond my expectations- everything was perfectly prepared and presented. The staff was knowledgeable about the food and appropriate wines to accompany the food. 
It's a fantastic space focused on the kitchen. I sat at the bar, which I never do, ans wan amply entertained and intrigued by the mastery that was happening in there. It was like watching performance art. I highly recommend it, and will no doubt be going back in the near future!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,Wow! This was an amazing dining experience with a rock star chef. My date got the egg with caviar apertizer that was a true work of art and tasted even better. I got the scalops with pumkin risoto that was so awesome! The deserts were equally impressive...we got the soufle and the chocolate dome. I hope to be able to go back again while im in london!,1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"What a great experience, both at the bar and later the restaurant.  Cocktails were excellent and I highly recommend starting your night in the bar; I actually wish we had more time there before our table was ready.  The menu is extremely flexible.  They offer two tasting menus (either 5 or 8 courses), both available with or without wine pairings.  They also offer items a la carte, including both small plates and entrees.  Like most places, they expect all members of your party to do either the tasting menu or a la carte but not a mixture.  We ended up ordering a la carte and asked the sommelier to pair wines with each dish.  The sommelier totally nailed the pairings.   Some of the dish highlights include the seared scallop, the lobster ""ravioli', the hot foie gras, and the filet.  Easily earns its Michelin star.  Expensive for sure but you get what you pay for here.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Visited the new bar upstairs for some post work drinks. Very delicious. It's small and intimate and they're just opening up an outdoor terrace. Will be nice if the weather actually gets better.
Also had a few bits from the bar tasting menu.
The bar upstairs is perfect for a couple or a few friends. Not a place for a big group but wonderful place for catching up with a friend or two. Highly recommend the spicy martini!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Amazing evening! The food is beautifully made, delicate and amazing flavors, pricey but worth every penny!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"This restaurant suggest a variety of French classics in a
reasonably price. Our family visited this place to spend our dinner. And I can't go wrong, I always remember this
place, for they servedone of my favourite foods.They also had a friendly and attentive

very affordable priced, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was
lovely. Verygraceful, but in a simple way! All that you want was almost there, surprising

waiting for, it is a highly suggested place for everyone.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"We went to La Cuisine de Joel Robuchon, which is on the first floor, on a Friday evening.  The food was creative and just great .  The service was attentive and friendly, despite the French wait staff.  The decor was interesting, like sitting in a kitchen.  The first floor restaurant was less busy, and we were told to have the same menu and food as the downstairs - L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.  
The 2 of us had 8 dishes to share, and created our own tasting menu.  The bill including 3 cocktails, which were also very tasty, came to GBP138, which I thought was reasonable given the great food and the Michelin 2-star status.
The night before we went to the Gordon Ramsey Maze, and the price was about the same, and the food was terrible in comparison to the food here.
Definitely worth a visit.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"I had my Graduation meal there last night with my parents and my partner and I can't even find words to describe how amazing it all was.
 Firstly the cocktail list is very intelligently put together and I had an apple sour that had a shot glass full of Moscato Jelly! The textures and the sweetness offset the sourness of the apple cocktail beautifully. It was so clean and refreshing on the palate and very well mixed so there wasn't such an alcoholic back draft after each sip.
 The Rooftop bar too made all the difference especially in this hot, sultry weather. It was tranquil up there as well as nice and cool. L'Atelier is seriously one sexy place in terms of decor as well as everything else.
 If you want to take someone here to impress them then this would be a sure fire way. From the moment you enter the doors to the moment you are seated, the place seems to do a good job in seducing you in every single way.
 The food is a great concept too. We opted not to have the tasting menu on account that there was a bit too much Foie Gras in it (3 dishes had it in there) and we wanted to sample the other things a little more.
 My only criticism is that I felt that the tasting menu lacked imagination to provide 3 dishes with Foie Gras and before anyone states the obvious, I know it is a French restaurant in essence!
 That aside I felt between us we all chose well. We had a crab guacamole which was delicate and very beautifully presented, scallops and squid that were cooked to absolute perfection - I have never had squid melt so gently in my mouth. If this was to be a food erotica gastronomical moment then I would have sent my taste buds to Coco De Mer to be whipped, teased and tingled to a culinary orgasmic afterglow.
 There was another scallop dish too which had a baby leek, caviar, gently seasoned seared scallop and a lovely buttery lemon sauce that was like eating a slightly savory equivalent of something like lemon curd. It was delicate and gentle but gently cleansed the palate against the salty caviar. I could have eaten that dish a million times over.
 We tried the little hamburgers that had some foie gras and to go with that we had a lovely bottle of Pomerol. It is my absolute favorite red wine ever and it was so smooth it would have given James Bond a run for his money. For our mains we had Black Cod that was divine, some Veal that was beaten and topped with a salad and the veal was so good and so vegetarian friendly that it was more than suitable as a veggie option for one of our open minded members of our party.
 We were also served a delightful pot of mash that was so velvety and rich we literally found ourselves licking the pot clean. The french really know how to make potatoes taste good!
 We also had cheese, which was nicely ordered and slightly strong that was accompanied by some rather divine walnut bread.
 But for me the Chocolate Profiterole with vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell was the most amazing dessert ever. They poured chocolate over a chocolate shell which made the sauce that covered the profiterole and to say it was fantastic would be a complete understatement of the century. I rarely eat chocolate desserts either but this is going down as the best one I have eaten ever!
 There was also a yuzu mousse that was zingy and that was accompanied by a raspberry sorbet as well as a rum baba and meringue sphere that was accompanied by a 'multivitamin' sorbet which I suppose was there to make the diner feel a sense of some health after consuming the delicious calories offered.
 But saying that when you go for a dining experience like that it is about the food and the calorie counts will go out of the window.
 I would definitely go back again and it was certainly a graduation to remember!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"Joël Robuchon is kind of a big deal, as he's pretty much the most well-respected chef of his generation and was named ""Chef of the Century."" He's got restaurants all over the world, most of which have one or two Michelin stars. The two-starred London location is right by Piccadilly Circus, and upon arriving for my 1:30 pm seating, I took a seat at the bar, which is set right in front of the open kitchen. After placing my orders for the £28, three-course lunch prix fixe menu, I was served an amuse bouche, which is another thing about fine dining that appeals to my inner cheapass (more food!). Consisting of a spoonful of a potato-fish purée, the amuse bouche tasted very much like a white fish spread, and it was a tasty first bite. Served a bread basket consisting of white, wheat, and olive breads, I found myself going back for the olive bread again and again. I must have gone through four or five pieces of the olive bread before my meal was done; that's how good it was. And also because, well, unlimited bread!
For my first course, I went with what the waitress described as one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Described as ""Egg cocotte topped with light wild mushrooms cream,"" this dish was mind-blowingly good, and it's no wonder that it is a signature dish. A soft-poached egg nestled in a bath of creamy soup along with mushrooms and asparagus slivers, this was the highlight of the meal and had me using bread to sop up every last drop of soup.
My entrée, described as ""Razor clams fricassee with confit tomatoes, sweet onion, and macaroni,"" (pictured at top) was like a refined version of a pasta dish that you'd find at The Cheesecake Factory. I don't say that to slight the dish, but it just wasn't as creative or elaborate as the other courses I enjoyed. The creamy sauce actually tasted very similar to a vodka sauce, and the razor clams were cooked nicely. While I usually am not a huge fan of cilantro, I found the cilantro-bread crumb mixture on the razor clam shell to be quite refreshing.
For dessert, I ordered the ""Fresh strawberry and pistachio cream cake with mascarpone ice cream."" The beautifully-presented dish was just as appealing to the taste buds as to the eyes, as the moist interior of pistachio cake was really quite tasty, especially when paired with the fresh strawberries and sweet ice cream. I wasn't particularly crazy about the outer pastry layer, which I found to be a bit tough, but everything else about the dessert was superb.
Walking away from my meal at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, I can say that I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and service, which was friendly and helpful throughout the lunch. Okay, so perhaps the restaurant would be better served by not applying foam to nearly every dish, and £28, or about $45, is definitely close to the maximum amount for how much I'd be willing to pay for a three-course lunch prix fixe, but all in all, I was quite pleased with my lunch. Whereas Restaurant Week prix fixes tend to be disappointing and underwhelming, year-round prix fixe deals at restaurants like L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon mean that there's no need to fight the crowds and muck your way through mediocre food. Overall, this is a good-value prix fixe that gets my recommendation.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"The food was mouth watering as was the preparation and delivery. I only give it 4 stars because the restaurant was too dark and the seats were uncomfortable. Otherwise, a perfect 10!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"This was a well-rounded experience with delicious offerings, great service, and entertainment.
I enjoyed the pre-theatre deal at L'Atelier which included 2 courses for 28 pounds or 3 courses for 32 pounds.  I thought this was a great deal considering the accolades and 2 Michelin stars owned by this establishment.
My party was seated at the bar, which surrounded the kitchen.  This kept us entertained as we watched the kitchen staff put together our meal.  
For my starter, I had the warm asparagus salad with nuts and iberian ham.  It was well balanced and tasty.  My dining partner had Scottish salmon carpaccio, which I enjoyed more.  It was both refreshing and texturally interesting.
For the entree, I had the roasted cod bouillabaisse which sat atop a potato disk.  The bouillabaisse was really nice, with just the right amount of seafood flavor.  The fish was cooked expertly and I enjoyed the texture of the potato in the mix.  Our other entree was the braised pork belly, mild spices and served with celeriac mousseline.  This was very rich, unexpected in flavor, and all around enjoyable.
Lastly, the highlight of the meal was the dessert - Coulis and mousse of mango, Joconde biscuit and exotic sorbet.  The different textures of the mousse, sorbet and biscuit made the perfect, fruity, not-too-sweet bite!  I loved it!
I felt extremely satisfied after my meal here and can't wait to go back and work my way through more of the menu (and maybe re-visit that mango dessert).",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"There is really only one experience from my first year in London that is worthy of my 100th review.  We went to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon back in March when we were first getting our feet wet in the London food scene.  Of course, I've been writing and rewriting the review, and it's been sitting unfinished in my account for nearly a year now--what can I say, I have an amazing talent for procrastination.  I wasn't sure (am still not sure) that I can do our experience the justice it deserves.  So, without further ado... my best London food experience of 2010.
The hubs and I made a pact that our time in London is going to be one of great experiences.  Chalk the first one up for Mr. Robuchon, one of the greatest culinary minds in the world.  We went to London's L'Atelier for my birthday in March. My husand has been to the one in Tokyo several times, and absolutely adores it.  We were seated near the far end of the sleek and sexy bar on the ground floor.  I was a little perturbed that we hadn't been seated in the empty seats smack in the middle of all the action.  My mind was quickly changed.
Nearly every seat at the bar has an amazing view into the kitchen.  Sitting to my right was a very well dressed Frenchman chatting it up with the sommelier.  Next came another European couple that took the two seats next to my husband.  Both impeccably dressed... the girl about twenty and the man somewhere in his late-40's.  Of course, I suspected the worst.  But after a couple glasses of champagne, we discovered that they were actually father and daughter, and the guy was Robuchon's business partner.  At which point, Robuchon made an appearance from the rear of the kitchen. He chatted with us for a few minutes. We mainly discussed the amazingness of the Chicago dining scene (he's tried repeatedly to open a place in Chicago to no avail--please keep trying! is all I have to say to that).
At this point, the evening becomes a fairly booze-fueled, and rather surreal experience.  We started the meal with the menu decouverte with the wine pairings.  This, however, was derailed after a few courses, because having made friends with the Monegasque father-daughter pair and the impeccably dressed Frenchman, who turned out to be one of Robuchon's most regular customers on the face of the planet--hey, if I could afford it, I'd make this place my own personal Cheers, too!--suggestions on what to try were made.  And wow, best, recommendations, ever! 
We ate rounds of butter-laden mashed potatoes and wondefully divine truffle dishes. The Frenchman was our ticket into samples of amazing, 20-year-old, first-growths served by the awesome Bulgarian sommelier. Of course, then he introduced me to ""Francois' Yuzu Souffle"". There really is nothing sexier than a Frenchman talking about souffles. And of course, Robuchon's pastry chef, Francois is a super crazy diva--a man diva, but a diva nonetheless. The man wears sunglasses in the restaurant and hits on the gorgeous women sitting at the bar in his spare time. Like I said, man diva. Anyway, it was one of the best things I have ever consumed. Done so perfectly, it was absolutely incredible. I cannot even do it justice talking about it. You'll just have to try it for yourself. 
By the end of the evening we had an open invitation to hang out in Monaco; a Polaroid with Joel Robuchon, that my husband proudly displays on his desk at work; and a bill that could have been far worse than it was (it was still the most expensive meal I've ever eaten). It was hands-down the best dining experience I've had in London so far. And while I can't promise anyone else the same experience, it is still my favorite fine dining restaurant in London, and my first recommendation to out-of-towners looking for a great experience. Robuchon is one of those chefs who wants his diners to love food as much as he does. And that in in itself is what makes this place so brilliant.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"If you love Fois Gras, and amazing wine, and service, and ambience.. in fact; if you like food - you will LOVE this place! I was spoiled for selection - not one but three fois gras options on the menu -each as delectible as you would imagine, truly melt in your mouth ah-mazing! My friend took me here and raved about it - and it definitely lived up to expectation. :)",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"If you are familiar with L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, 
I'll highlight the main differences with the Paris rue du Bac mother-ship.
It's not just sitting at the counter around a plancha kitchen. They have a few small tables, and a bar/lounge. Which means that :
1) they take reservations.
2) you can wait in the lounge if no place is free!
For those who do not know Robuchon:
He is the most renowned French chef from the past quarter century. No less. You will not get very rich French classical cuisine. (and definitely not the over-creamy rendition offered to foreigners all over the world). But modern French cuisine at its best. You will be blown away.
For those not familiar with L'Atelier :
Similar restaurants been opened in Vegas, Hong-Kong, Taiwan and Tokyo. This is not the flagship 'High-cuisine' Robuchon restaurant ('La Table de Joel Robuchon', Michelin 3 stars), but a more convivial, less formal setting.  The Paris restaurant does not take reservations, for example... this one does.... 
You will still get a very refined and modern take on some French and international classics. 
A bit like tapas, you get to choose between small 'bites' and larger dishes. Mix and match, as much as you like / can afford.
The menus range from the 27 quids 'pre-theatre' offer to the gigantic menu Decouverte. 
The pre-theatre formula (27 quids) is definitely the best quality/price ratio food you're ever likely to get.
My advice is simple. GO!  If you can't get a seat right away, WAIT !
BUT. WHATEVER YOU DO. DO GET THE MASHED POTATOES.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"I don't know what it takes to get three Michelin stars, but i believe this restaurant has done everything except bribe someone.  I ate here on Christmas Eve, and it was one of the few restaurants in London that wasn't doing a set menu, and I was glad they weren't.
The restaurant itself is beautiful with a very unique setup on the lower level.  It has the appearance of a high end sushi bar, but with a warmth that you don't generally find in Japanese restaurants.  The majority of the seating is at the bar with a few scattered tables throughout the downstairs.  I believe the upper levels are all table seating.  I would recommend sitting at the bar.  It is a unique setting.
There is an open kitchen that is actually inside of the seated bar, but separated by a small run in which the waiters and sommelier's pour drinks, take your order, and expedite your food.  Essentially, you still see the Chef's working, but you get a real waiter.  The service was spectacular.
This was one of the largest wine lists I have ever seen for a small restaurant.  They must have somewhere between 200 to 250 wines available by the bottle.  They have both red and white wines from every major wine region in the world, but (of course-Joel Robuchon) the majority is made up of French wines.  I am not very well versed in French wines so I requested the assistance of the sommelier.  I gave her a very short description of what I like and she immediately pointed us to a 2008 Sancere that was a perfect choice.
The first dish was a black truffle and endive salad followed by a scallop carpaccio in lemon oil.  Both were amazing.  The next was a pumpkin soup, it was my least favorite.  I want to be very clear in saying ""least favorite"" as opposed to ""worst"" because even being my least favorite; had this dish been served in 98% of the other restaurants I frequent it would have been the best dish.  We followed with a lobester ravioli with savoy cabbage and a foie gras reduction, which was flawless.  Finally, we had black cod with a cauliflower puree (it was the tits)..
No flaws to be found anywhere in the service, atmosphere, or food.   We ate at ""Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's"" the previous evening.  That restaurant was good, but not great.  It was what happens when a really great chef is no longer in the kitchen; some laziness in the dishes.  The best dishes at Ramsay's were the off menu amus bouche and pre-desert.  IThis had me greatly concerned when we went to Joel Robuchon's the next night.  I thought: ""Well he isn't going to be in the kitchen so the food may be suspect.""  That couldn't be father from accurate.  Amazing food, kudos and my highest compliments to the staff, both kitchen and floor.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"This is a place to go for an experience. We went for lunch and the damage to the wallet was diminished with their 28 pound ($42) prix fixe. 
Really, you go to be stroked and coddled. They did and we felt like royalty (funny we were in London). The restaurant is gorgeous. The Mondrian inspired wall art with spices is original. The wall of ivy (?) cascading down brings life and color into the dark room. But the clear vases displaying vegetables above the kitchen radiate with carrot rings, perfectly green fennel, orange bell peppers. 
I'm sure the menu changes frequently. However the best part of our meal was the unexpected vegetables that accompanied our main courses. It was a bowl of cooked radishes napped in butter and the slightest hint of vanilla. After endless meals of meat/potatoes in England these vegetables made me so happy. 
After our entrees they invited us upstairs to the lounge to have our desserts. They went out of their way to provide the pregnant wife with enough pillows to support her back. Definitely would return!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"Summary: 3-course prix fixe lunch menu for £28, great interesting food.
Came on a Sat. around noon to try to lunch prix fixe solo. Got the egg cocotte, pollack stuff w/ squid ink, and a chocolate dessert. Also came w/ an amuse bouche and a bread basket with four types of bread and a great salted butter. All of the food was interesting, tasty, visually appealing, and well-prepared.
Service was friendly and pretty good, other than not filling up my water without having to ask (not a big deal, just not what I'd expect at a two Michelin star place).
Would come back again.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon is one of my treats to myself when I'm in the mood for a wonderful gastronomic experience in London. It is a short walk from Leicester Square or Covent Garden tube stations.
I can see what other reviewers mean when they say that there is a bit of pretension here (Michelin star, etc) but I've never experienced anything but courteous and meticulous service when I come here - and once *gasp* without a reservation!
The best deals here are the lunch specials and the pre-theatre menu. I prefer to come for lunch since it is more relaxed. The food is always beautifully presented, absolutely delicious and very creative. My cousin, who detests fish dishes, will come to L'Atelier and devour their fish courses without complaint and even want more! 
I like to order a cappuccino after my meal, but I must admit that it's more for the accompanying house-made caramel than for the coffee itself. 
My one tiny complaint is that something in the L'Atelier restaurant seems to irritate my eyes - they get very dry and itchy. I'm not sure if it's the proximity to the open kitchen (onion fumes?), the lighting or some combination of both. I don't have this up in La Cuisine (or when I leave and step outside into natural light). Odd, isn't it? Ah, but I will suffer itchy eyes for the delicious food here!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,Unbelievable dining experience. You've gotta do a tasting menu and get it paired with wines from Europe.,1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"My approach to restaurants that are SORT OF A BIG DEAL has always been to feign ignorance and not let my inner fangurl get the best of me. However, this was the second L'Atelier I've been to, though it must be said that the first was in Las Vegas so I'm not sure if the two experiences are even comparable. 
I arrived for lunch with a mid-sized group on a rainy afternoon and we were immediately seated (not too busy for a weekday). They were offering a type of set lunch with several courses, which all of us opted in for and turned out to be a great decision. After being well-oiled with several bottles of wine (though our server was rather stingy on the pours), we began feeeeeding. 
The bread basket (as expected) was amazing and contained a variety of bread choices. I'm a bit of a carb-hound so I was obviously delighted. The food was very rich and cream-based, which I guess is to be expected, and the portions (though moderate) pack a punch. Let's just say I was not hungry for the rest of MY LIFE/day. 
As others have mentioned before, the highlight may have been their mashed potatoes, which we all agreed were 90% butter and 10% potato. Either way, it was a decadent party in my mouth. I'm refraining from a five-star review because the service was rather lackluster. Though our group occupied two tables side-by-side, we had different servers and the other table's server was noticeably more attentive and GENEROUS WITH THE WINE POURS (yes, I am apparently fixated on this point). 
The venue was obviously decorated by the same quirky set designer behind Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain (yeah wrap your head around THAT for a minute). What this means in reality is actually kind of hard to articulate but silly to witness so perhaps you should save yourself the Google image search and see for yourself.",1

It is tucked away on a quiet street near the theater district. The interior is posh and swank, with a very cool sushi bar that is great for singles and watching the kitchen.  My husband is still raving about the cold avocado soup that he had as a first course.

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"This was my second trip to the London L'Atelier outpost -- it didn't measure up to the first.  The a la carte and the wine menus are not as extensive as it used to be; indeed, not as expansive as those of other L'Atelier locations (e.g., Hong Kong or New York).  This seems indicative to me of the short-cutting that London L'Atelier engages in, generally (e.g., non-existent truffle shavings on the scallops; three rather ""blah"" selections of bread; timing and temperature issues with entrees and frozen desserts, etc.).  
I was also sorely disappointed that our request (made at the time of booking of the reservation) to be seated at the counter was not honored when we arrived at the restaurant.
Not sure that I would go back to the London L'Atelier anytime soon -- especially when Robuchon's other outposts are so much better.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"L'Atelier is a must do for a great dining experience.  
Searched through Yelp reviews and stumbled upon L'Atelier. Sounded fab and used the online booking tool to make a reservation. Unless you book far in advance, you're kind of stuck with either 1700 or 2100. Ah, what the hell...I'll do my workout and hit the restaurant at 2100--earn that decadent food! 
Since I was a table of one, they seated me at the bar which was fine with me though it is a tad cramped.  You're almost sitting in the lap of the person next to you.  One of my few recommendations would be to take a  couple of chairs out and give folks a tad more room.  The guy next to me elbowed me a couple of times.  BUT, you get this awesome view into the kitchen.  The service is very attentive as the variety of folks working behind the bar continually check on you.  Great looking wait staff also.
The food is simply amazing.  For a starter, I had a crab tourteau (15 pounds) that was crab meat with a blood orange topping.  For the main, I chose the lamb loin special of the day (34 pounds) which was a nice thick slice of perfectly cooked lamb loin.  While sitting there admiring the kitchen operation, I spotted this animal leg perched in a silver holder.  After inquiring from the hostess, found out that it was Iberian ham...YES PLEASE.  The sommelier recommended this flight of wonderful sherries.  Of course, something like that is going to set you back some coins...37 pounds to be exact...but well worth the experience as you just can't get Iberian ham in the States and our sherry selections tend to be crap.  
So...all totaled, four courses, wine pairings with each and a cocktail to start off the madness...175 pounds.  You only live once!!!",1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"I went here tonight with my Mum after sourcing the restaurant's pre-theatre offer on 
Lastminute.com
. Three courses for £27 at a Michelin starred place, courtesy of the 'chef of the century' doesn't sound too shabby to me.
We arrived a little early and had a drink at the salon bar upstairs. Just next to The Ivy, the place is hard to miss, but is surprising once you step instead. Any preconceptions about the kind of decor French cuisine might be served in are slashed immediately. L'Atelier is decked out in Oriental black and red, with the hostess & waiter's uniforms and beautiful Japanse plants to match.
The drinks upstairs were nice - the bar was nothing special, but empty and relaxing all the same.
Lovely service throughout dinner - as expected - and very tasty food. I had a country terrine with fresh bread, pickled mushrooms and redcurrant chutney, followed by haddock and mussels with pasta and a shelfish sauce. I finished off with a chocolate sorbet with mousse with a Oreo cookie crumb.
All very nice, but nothing that made me go 'wow'. I think my Mum picked the better dishes as she made yummy noises throughout eating. We had a nice bottle of white, but it was pricey at £38. 
I liked being able to see directly into the kitchen, and the chef's bar looked fun. I'd definitely go back to try the tasting plates, but I can't say it lived up to the over-hyped expectations.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"It's a shame its fabulous reputation precedes it.  I can't help but feel disappointed.
Presentation was amazing.  Out of this world beautifully (and meticulously) composed.  
Unfortunately...  I took one bite of my main meal (white fish stuffed with basil and pinenuts) and was horrified.  In parts, the fish was translucent, lukewarm, chewy and definitely undercooked.  I took another small, cautious bite, and it was a letdown as much as the first.  I don't have a problem with sashimi, but I do feel like I need adequate warning.  If there's none, then I'll assume it's not supposed to be like that...
I really didn't know what to do.  Was it supposed to be like that?  In the end, I said something to a member of staff (as I couldn't stomach the idea of a third mouthful), and she vehemently said the fish was perfectly cooked.  Grudgingly she took it away.  I felt like I was in the wrong.
The manager soon visited me and profusely apologised, as did the chef who had prepared my meal.  A second was prepared, while my dining partner finished their meal.  To occupy me while I was waiting (and my friend who later had to wait for me to finish my main), the manager kindly and thoughtfully provided us with two complementary foie gras burgers.  But unfortunately I don't eat foie gras for ethical reasons.
All this aside though, and judging by the merit of the food alone, it wasn't anything special.  Food combinations were boring, ingredients were common, I didn't savour each bite, and it was pretty average.  It was just beautifully plated in a fancy setting.",-1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"No words to describe it... When we were sat at the bar, I was expecting the worst (I always find it awkward to sit at a bar - I feel it can be less personal and I hate people watching me eat...) but I need not have feared! We had the best seats in the house, since the kitchen is open plan - we got to watch all the food being prepared and really made us appreciate it more! This food is definitely an art form... I've never seen anyone select the right tips of some dill to place on a place before, nor have I ever seen anyone put tiny cubes of smoked salmon on a place using a pair of tweezers to get it in the right place...).  Sitting at the bar reminded me of sitting in a sushi bar in Tokyo, watching the chef make my sushi... 
The food blew me away - it looked amazing on the plate (almost too pretty to eat... almost) and tasted really good.  We had some tasting plates to share - my favourite was the crab wrapped in spicy turnip and the scallop carpaccio.  Definitely leave room for dessert! 
I'm amazed how full it was, just for lunchtime on a weekday... but totally worth it! The staff are great - they explain all of the specials, memorise your order and have fabulous accents (I'm still working out whether the accents were genuine or not...!).  My favourite thing about the whole visit is the apple theme - giant apples placed strategically around the restaurant, very juicy looking apples displayed in a bowl... is it any wonder that when asked what I would like to drink, I said apple juice?! 
Overall, we had a wonderful time and it's a fab place for a special treat! Give it a try! You know you want to!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"This was clearly one of the highlights in a while. Seated at the bar, you peek into the kitchen, looking at a group of gastro-surgeons about to carve and cut little works of art. It's all clean, sleek, modern - but unlike some reviewers, I didn't find it pretentious. It's French - but all in the best possible way.
And the food. The art. Aubergine caviar on coriander panna cotta is a flavour firework. Foie gras soft and rich, with a crunchy top. Jerusalem artichoke soup makes you sing. Highlights from the ""tapas"" menu were langoustine ravioli and milk-fed lamb, the latter as tender as a ripe pear. Desserts are all priced at £10, but each of them has a sweet wine recommendation for a surcharge of a few quid. Worth it. 
Speaking of worth - cheap is different. But then, you only live once. Eating at Robuchon makes this one life worth so much more, though.",1

Do not eat all day if you want to do the tasting menu otherwise be brave and ask if the chef can prepare you something special, be adventurous!  You will not be disappointed. While it is dark and lounge-like inside it certainly doesn't cross onto the side of cheesy or kitsch.

 I love pre-theatre menus. How else would one be able to regularly dine at Michelin starred restaurants in London without for instance being a stock broker (before the credit crunch) or a professional footballer? One of these restaurants is L'Atelier de Joel Robouchon in the middle of the theatre district in Covent Garden just next to The Ivy which offers a 2 course set menu for 22 pounds, 3 courses for 27 pounds. The French chef Joel Robouchon who has achieved more Michelin stars than any other chef (25 if Wikipedia is to be believed) has restaurants all over the globe. Two of these stars are held by the London joint of L'Atelier Joel Robouchon. So believe me  my expectations were higher than high and I was looking forward to a stunning meal.
 The restaurant is impressively beautiful. The elegant and stylish dining area is dimly lit and decorated in a red and black theme (I was not so sure about the apples in the big bowl (see below) but what do I know about interior decoration?). There are high tables and bar stools and, around the central kitchen area, patrons are seated at the counter and can watch the chefs preparing their dishes.
 Sometimes the service in high end restaurants can be a bit patronizing but the service at L'Atelier Joel Robouchon was absolutely perfect. Obliging and polite and, when they brought as the wrong main course, three people came one after the other to apologise (which was maybe slightly over the top). Also a very nice touch was that, when the wine we had ordered was not available, the somelier exchanged it with a (very delicious) cheaper one. Even though we 'only' had the pre-theater menu, they did not rush us at all to leave after we had finished.
 Unfortunately the food was not as enjoyable and exceptional as I had expected. Of the 3 starters and 3 mains to choose from a very autumn-style, mushroom-based menu we commenced our meal with Egg Cocotte Topped with Wild Mushroom Cream. The soft-boiled egg was at the bottom of the glass topped with a very tasty mushroom cream. It was nice but did not blow me away and I did not like the consistency too much.
 The second starter also embraced the autumn theme: Wild mushrooms served with Puff Pastry consisted of perfectly cooked, delectable wild mushrooms on light pastry. This was rather enjoyable dish but again not terribly special.
 We choose two different mains: RS really liked The Razor Clams served with White Wine Emulsion and Leek Fondue. I only had a small taste of it, far too much dill for my liking.
 The Crunchy chicken breast with Curry Sauce and Pilaw Rice was rather mediocre. The nicely cooked chicken was too salty and the combination of elements of chicken katsu curry and the Indian influences of the Pilaw rice were not convincing, especially for a 2 star restaurant.
 Now the question is  if you have a pre-theatre/ good value set menu in a Michelin star restaurant, would you expect the set menu to be of the same quality as the a la carte? I do, and L'Atelier Joel Robouchon did not deliver. Does this mean now I have to save and go back to try the a la carte (assuming that the Michelin inspectors know their job)? Or do I just give up on old Joel?",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was the best thing that happened to my fiance and I on our recent visit to London. The best thing that happened in our dining experience, that is. Being the foodies that we are, we did alot of research before we embarked on our trip and part of the process involved making reservations at must-eat places before we left Chicago for London. Needless to say, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was in our must-eat places.
We were seated at the bar. Actually, it's not really a bar either since you're not sitting in front of the bartender, but it's a high top counter that allows you to see all the action going on in the kitchen. What a fantastic experience seeing the kitchen crew prepping appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had baked clams with minced garlic and mushrooms and the clams were served on a thick bed of sea salt. I ordered an entree of spaghetti which will make you think, ""What?! You ordered spaghetti in a 2-Michelin star restaurant? How boring!"" But wait til you hear what the spaghetti came with: sea urchin! Sea urchin and spaghetti = divine. I've only had sea urchin sashimi-style in sushi restaurants and have always loved it. And now having sea urchin Joel Robuchon-style tops it all. The sea urchin was used to make the creamy and there were also bite-size pieces of sea urchin hidden in the sauce. When I bit into it, the texture reminded me of foie gras. I think they don't always have sea urchin on the menu because it seems like they constantly change what goes into the spaghetti. My fiance had fried langoustine, duck liver pate, and octopus salad which he all loved very much. For dessert, we shared the Rum Baba which was absolutely divine. The sponge cake was soaked with rum that you can actually taste very well. in fact, the rum was pretty strong. This was what stood out for me because it's not one of those desserts that claim to have liqueur in it although you can't really taste it. We also got Irish coffee to go with dessert. They have several types of alcoholic coffee drinks, depending on the several countries of origin of whiskeys they offer.
The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions. This place isn't pompous or pretentious at all. You can dress up fancy here or show up in jeans and you won't feel out of place. Ask to sit at the kitchen bar, if they don't already seat you there.",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"I have to say that this restaurant single-handedly renewed my failing interest in French food. Everything was cooked to the exact millisecond for perfection and I couldn't help thinking, this is what French cuisine is really all about! Delicate, exquisite, satisfying. Each bite were mini explosions of all things wonderful in my mouth. 
Go there for their lunch menu where two courses are £19 or three for £25. With that and sharing a small tasting dish, we actually got to try quite a variety. 
+Egg cocotte 
+Sweet french onion soup with croutons (they pour the soup over the croutons when they serve it to you)
+Lobster (la langoustine) ravioli
+Suckling pig with polenta 
-Cod (was still very good but not mind blowing like the others)
Oh, and I really liked their bread basket, esp the mini baguette and ciabatta rolls! Seriously, we couldn't stop eating that bread.",1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"This place is definitely not on the cheap side and the the portions of your meal is definitely not filling.  There are two sections to the menu, Tapas Style and Main Dishes.  They recommend that we order 8 tapas dishes (4 persons (2 of each)) and each order a main dish.  We elected not to take their recommendations and went with 4 tapas dishes and 2 main dishes.  It was still expensive, but fortunately, my friend picked up the tab since my girlfriend and I got engaged on the London Eye. (no, not where 30 other people were in the same capsule, but a private capsule)  
The food and ambiance was really good, but the service was less than stellar.  I would give them 4 stars, but the service really made the experience disappointing.  Our server took way to long to greet us.  We ordered cocktails in the beginning and that took forever.  Our server apologized and I looked over to some other tables and I noticed that there was bread at the table.  I asked if the bread was complimentary and she said it was and then she asked if we would like some.  We were starving at this time and we definitely wanted some!  If our experience was better, then I would've definitely given this place at least 4 stars.",-1

It's great gastronomic fun to try the ""small tasting dishes"" but don't flinch when you see your bill and your stomach's still a-rumbling.  Even certain ""main"" plates are miniature.  This is indeed a fancy French tapas spot (with extraordinary food).  
What may come as an annoying surprise is that one scallop costs nearly as much as a generous plate of steak tartare, or that the sea bass - a ""main"" dish like the steak tartare - is just a small square and sets you back £30.  It's impossible to choose wisely with an eye on both your hunger level and budget unless you've been here a load of times (or have tried most of the dishes).  I've done neither, but I can tell you this:  if you like red meat - and your heart is good shape - you will never regret having the mini foie gras burgers and the steak tartare.  Eat it downstairs at the atmospheric bar.  And if you're not alone, split this and the cheese plate.  You'll be full and not too broke - but please eat your fruit and veg the next day.",1

The service is all synchronized and you don't have one waiter, all employees know whats going on, it can be a minus at some point..
The food presentation is really amazing and five star, seeing the executive chef preparing with his team of about 10 chefs prepare all the dishes is really cool and entertaining, also love the bar style seating, all friendly together.
The portions are tapas style and small, but really good. The martini menu is extensive and has some exciting mixes. The tasting menu [which the executive chef Olivier Limousin did me a solid, and made it for me alone, which usually is only done for the whole table [party] as it is a complex and hard menu] has some really award wordy dishes.
Why five star? ok because it's the best tapas I've ever eaten, it don't get better then this. Yes 105quid for a nine dish tasting menu is quite high but totally worth it. If you say this is no tapas, than it's a four star restaurant.",1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Merry Christmas to me! I have to say that it does not take a lot of convincing for me to give this place 5 stars. Bob and I were in London over the holidays and I saw that not only was there a reservation available at L'Atelier, but that there was also a price fix menu we could take a part of. We (naturally) decided to go with the price fix menu with the European wine flights and sat on the first floor - at the counter concept restaurant. The feel is very loungy - dark red, black and dim lighting. The counter wraps around the entire kitchen and you then have the added benefit of watching the talented chefs prep your food. Although there is a slight downside... you do get to see how much fantastic butter is being used. The food was absolutely beyond amazing. Everything tasted delicious, fresh, inventive - all the good adjectives that you would use to describe a great meal. The highlight of the meal was the mashed potatoes. OMG. These were probably the best potatoes I have ever had in my life. Sadly, the server thought that we were done and did snatch away our remaining spoonful... I literally thought about jumping over the counter and tackling her for that last morsel. It sounds ridiculous that mashed potatoes could be that good, but these were velvety smooth and just absolutely delicious. We were a little surprised by how many white wines were in the flight, but everything was paired beautifully. The service was very good - it was very different than the traditional table seating since we didn't have an assigned server per se. It was more casual than the food suggests, but still prompt and friendly. Overall, if you're looking for a fancy night out - or just in the mood to treat yo'self - check out this restaurant. And be prepared to latch on to those potatoes with an iron grip!",1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"Went during restaurant week (coincided with an offer for the pre-theatre set menu). Being a two-Michelin-starred restaurants, I was expecting a really blow-you-out-of-your-mind experience, but the restaurant didnt quite deliver.
 The food was very artfully presented, and you can watch them cooking the food and searing things in the open kitchen. The restaurant decor was beautifully done, with a large living wall on the far end.
 But a couple of things put me off. One was the service was a bit too smarmy. Maybe I am just a troglodyte, but I dont need people hovering over me with every step and course constantly checking to see if I was OK, or if I needed anything. I suppose there are people out there who require this sort of attention to validate themselves, but I dont care for it; it was almost as if they were willing to cut my meat for me, and maybe even pre-chew it for me so that I wouldnt have to lift a finger. If that is what 2 stars gets you, then I can give it a miss.
 The other thing was that the portions are a bit small and the food did not blow me away. I was expecting every bite to be a mouth orgasm, but that didnt happen. Go there if you need to impress someone, and go there if you are the type that needs to be seen at michelin-starred restaurant. But dont go if you expect a full belly at the end of your meal.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,4,"My only visit here was not on a happy occasion. One of my best friends was leaving London (under less than ideal circumstances), and he wanted to have a treat at a good restaurant on his last day in town. He found out about a two course lunch offer for £19, and we walked in for my first visit to a michelin 2 star restaurant.
It takes a while to find this place, tucked away as it is in one of the many otherwise unknown alleys around leicester square.
The seating was unusual. Everybody were seated in tall stools next to the bar. I don't know what the purpose was, as it was pretty uncomfortable. We didn't interact with the chef ... but the guy who was serving us did spend quite a lot of time around us ... the attention was evident.
The food was exactly as i have come to expect from good french restaurants in London ... very good ... very tasty ... and very little. It tingles your taste buds, and leaves you craving for more (and if you indulge, be prepared for bankruptcy :p). The wild boar and foie gras was something i hadn't had before and i really liked it. 
With the wine and the dessert, our bill came to northwards of £40 per head even with the discount offer, so you can guess how expensive this restaurant usually is, but totally worth a visit (my friend had a pleasant last lunch in London) .",1

Wonderful though much of the food is, when you come to settle up at the end of the evening... well... can you feel that hollow sensation around your upper torso? That's where all your money used to be, as you just shelled out over £200 on dinner for two. And I didn't even have a digestif.
 It's a sort of Japanese-styled succession of very, very tiny French tasting dishes. Sorry, I should explain: not Japanese food, but served in a restaurant that's as close to being a bento box interior as I've ever seen. Now I know how salmon teriyaki feels.
 You're brought these tiny, delicate little courses, and you have this sort of explosion of taste, then it goes away, and you have some more wine, and wait for the next one. We ordered 2 mini-things and one more substantial course each and I have to say that we left feeling sated, if not (whisper it) full. Maybe it was just the sensory overload. Don't worry... neither felt the urge to scoff a pizza on the way home.

One us received their hake raw and when he called the waiter over the waiter knew before my friend had said anything and just picked up the plate and said 'Not cooked?' and swept it away, I guess that it is not that unusual in this restaurant
Desert was so so sponge with chocolate though two of my group thought it was very nice.
A bottle of wine and some tea and coffee and £50 each and we all went home and had something to eat.
Service was good friendly and helpful though somewhat slow
None of us will visit again

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"I have been hearing stories about Robuchon himself regarding the myth etc. When I heard that l'atelier after Paris has opened in London, 2 things came in mind.. 
1. Wow!
2. Is it another business-man opening branches??
 Tried L'atelier twice. The ambience is really nice and cool, with modern and innovative decoration. Its more of a place to chill and have a bite instead of a proper long-stay dining place. 
You can sit on a bar or tall tables with stools, it's fine though, you enjoy.
 The mythological-must-try-speciality is the potato puree.. I know sounded weird to me as well but its really an interesting story!
 Everything fair and good enough till here. Now the downside. 
Although the food very good and tasty the portions. GOD really tiny ! And yes I know what gourmet kitchen is and what the word L'Atelier stands for. The story is that you cannot really sell L'atelier-styled food and charge for 2 big portions! Come on! 
From my experience so far this is the restaurant with smallest portions, except if you try the steak which will probably compensate a bit to your stomach. 
The two stars missing from my rating is because of the relation Price/Quantity. 
You really wouldn't wanna go there on empty stomach!
 Overall: A nice place with comfortable environment BUT very bad relation of Price vs Quality/Quantity.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,3,"The restaurant is quite stunning, a japanese red and black lacquer theme running throughout. Bathrooms are also absolutely beautiful. As a vegetarian my view is probably slightly slanted, I had the deep friend hens egg, followed by the leek terrine, both were interesting dishes (very flavourful), but not great. The others (who ate meat!) enjoyed their meal much more.
 Can't really add much more than the others have already written, except for they do a set lunch which is £19 for two courses or £25 for three. A good way to sample the food before you come here for a more expensive dinner.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"The L'Atelier location in London is ten times better than the one in Vegas. So if you've been to the one in Vegas and didn't like it, then give this location a try. It's definitely worth it. It's about 8 courses and like the Vegas location you can sit at the bar and watch them make your food. The dishes that stood out for me here were the foie gras, butternut squash soup, quail and of course dessert. The dessert was ice cream mixed with a bunch of good things and sprinkled with Oreo crumbs (yum!). I give this place a B+. Just about everything tasted as good as it looked.

Maybe ease into it by trying their incredibly value for money pre-theatre diner (until 6.30 -7pm if you're lucky) that gives you an overview of their excellent food.
Or go for the tapas style mini dishes that will undoubtedly blow your mind (if not your appetite). The Egg or the Burger are to be recommended, as is the purée (50% potatoes, 50% butter!).
Sit at the bar, watch the cooks cautiously prepare your plate and relax, it's well worth it (also, note they have a vertical garden on the wall, very trendy!)",1

The greenery and the colours on the ground floor will make you feel extra special. The service is typically French (a bit blase and well not quite up to the American service standard, but still better than most London restaurants).
 The bar upstairs is also very special. Very expensive, but well worth it. The lamb is spectacular, and the mash that comes with is buttery and delicious. Don;t miss the foie gras burger...mouthwatering.

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"A couple of my friends and I were vacationing in London and we decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.
We ordered the pretheatre menu, which came with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert for £25.  It's definitely a little expensive for a 3 course meal, but it's actually not too bad considering the fact that it's a very famous and renowned restaurant.
They started my meal with this amazing French onion soup.  The soup was served with crispy cheesy garlic croutons floating on top.  The crunchiness of the croutons was definitely a nice complement to the creaminess of the soup.  For my entrée, I ordered their flat iron steak, which was cooked to perfection, topped with caramelized onions, with creamy potato gratin on the side.  I have to say that it was the best flat iron steak I've ever had EVER!  It was tender, juicy, and well flavored.  I could tell that they used very simple ingredients to season the meat because the natural taste of the steak was preserved and didn't get over overpowered by the seasonings they used.  The potato gratin was very delicious as well.  It was very creamy and cheesy, yummy!  At last, they served this chocolate mousse/ice cream thing for dessert.  I still don't know the name of the dessert or exactly what's in it until this very day.  All I know is that the dessert was so amazing that it blew my mind away.  It was creamy, chocolaty, and crunchy (crisped rice, I think).  Overall, it was an amazing meal!",1

While the food was tasty, the portions were a joke- almost the equivalent of a bite each.  The service was horrendous-snotty waitress and sommelier- and the cost ludicrously high.   I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact, my only recommendation would be to stay away.",-1

french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,1,"We arrived five minutes late for our reservation full of apologies, and were told that our table was not ready and we would have to wait another 15-20 minutes for our table! We asked if this sort of thing happens often, and we were told that they didn't rush people along with our meal, later we found that this simply isn't true. From the moment we arrived, the staff treated us terribly badly; they were so hot and cold that my partner asked me: 'what have we done wrong?'  I am convinced that our waiter was high, he didn't blink once, was sweating profusely, had no idea of personal space and kept saying 'YUMMY, YUMMY' every time he put our food down. 
 As there was a delay in seating us we missed the 10 course menu, a real shame as the majority of what we ordered was terrible.  We were given a bread basket to start with, with no butter or oil, the French bread was so stale I would have reservations about feeding it to pigeons up the road in Trafalgar square! We both started with the Ravioli of Foie Gras in a chicken broth, this was terrible it reminded me of instant chicken and noodle soup.  I then had the stuffed clams- these were average, frankly I have had better at a local bistro. My partner had the lamb; he said the best part of this was the mash potato.  We both then finished off our mains with the quail stuffed with foie gras served with truffle mash potato, this was really very good, but completely ruined by the lack lustre service we received the truffle mash 10 minutes after we received the quail. The dessert was the lowest point of the meal and tasted like a tesco's finest chocolate cheese cake. 
This year we have eaten at Gordon Ramsay's Royal Hospital, The Vineyard, La Trompette and Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons (my personal favourite); if you have £150 per person to spend eat at any of these other places. We both felt terribly ripped off at L'Atelier.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,1,"No, seriously?
 I was disappointed by this restaurant. It is overpriced, and I use that term with care having happily paid far more for a meal elsewhere. I am happy to pay a lot of money for an excellent experience, but this just wasn't. This was mainly down to the service, which was indifferent at best - I'd've been unimpressed being served this way at a chain restaurant. It wasn't 'informal' - it was disinterested, cold and not even competent.
 The food was excellent. But I've had far better meals for less money in places which - crucially - had a far better atmosphere.
 We sat downstairs in the 'atelier' - perhaps things might've been better upstairs in the formal restaurant, but we chose downstairs because we wanted to try out a tapas-y approach to fine dining.
 The service spoilt this place for me. I actually refused to pay the service charge, for the first time ever. I am the sort of person who gets embarrassed when things are disappointing and I once didn't send back a still-frozen lasagne in a pub because I didn't want to offend anyone(!!!!!), so this is a big deal.
 I emailed to say how awful the service had been and someone wrote back offering us a free bottle of house champagne next time we dined there.
 Our meal, with wine, cost £200 for two. No ta.
 We went to Clos Maggiore a couple of weeks later to try to erase the bad memories and that was much better.",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,1,"This was a very dissapointing experience. 
Shockingly so actually. 
To be honest i feel ripped off. 
I am willing to spend an obscene amount of money at a restaurant but only if i am blown away. In fact, not only was i nowhere near blown away but i can confidently say that i did not consume anything that was anywhere near memorable!
This restaurant is way overpriced for what is essentially quite average food.
My dining partner and I, opted for the tasting menu at £125 each. The amouse bouche seemed to signal a good start but unfortunately there was no highlight, no surprises, nothing really.
The inclusion of expensive ingredients (black truffle,caviar & alot of fois gras) was, I felt, a way of justifying the ludicrous prices. However, as a discerning diner i must say that if it was simply about the ingredients anyone can buy them for less and have them at home!
The point of making the effort and paying so much money is to sample great skill and creativity with great ingredients. Sadly, this was most definitely not the case at l'atelier. 
The reputation does precede this restaurant and one does expect alot, but at these prices one should!
I do not advise anyone to dine here. 
Having said that, i think that the fixed price lunch for £27 may not leave you with as bad a taste as i have been left with!
Total failure. In fact i can honestly say : APPALLING!!",-1
french,HoS9YPbwzz-GzHhsVPQnCA,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,5,"Joel Robuchon's new London restaurant brings with it the 'atelier' or workshop approach to eating, when one sits at a counter and watches the chefs prepare the food a few feet away. It's common in Japan and works extremely well here, particularly as the leather bar stools are comfortable. The menu has a page of delicious small tasting dishes, which are basically half a starter size, to encourage you to have several. In fact one could eat entirely from the tasting dishes and try 90% of what's on the menu - but they are not cheap - between £10-20. We went for the £19 set-price lunch and experienced exemplary cooking - particularly a richly-reduced sweet onion soup. The waiter behind the counter was instantly accessible and although Hungarian, recommended an absolutely superb Grune Veltliner which came by the glass and caused us to spend much more on the wine than the food. The whole place (there is a standard-type restaurant and a bar as well) has a well-managed feel and with cooking and prices (at least at lunch) of that order, it should quickly become a favourite",1

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"Bar Boulud is just one outpost of renowned chef, Daniel Boulud's empire.  The French chef, who is originally from Lyon in the Rhone River valley, became famous in New York after moving there in the early 80s.  Boulud's centerpiece - three Michelin star restaurant DANIEL is located in NYC - but his empire spans the globe with locations in Florida, Singapore, Beijing, Montreal, Toronto and London. Bar Boulud sits in the ground floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park hotel, one of the poshest addresses in London's Knightsbridge area.
The Boulud American-inspired French bistro concept is a majorly relaxed and welcoming environment. And unlike many other restaurants in this price range, it attracts people who aren't dressed to the nine's and just want a chilled out, but very nice meal.  The slightly-underground Bar Boulud is designed to feel like a French wine cellar with vaulted ceilings and recessed, red-leather booths.  It's open kitchen does make things more lively than your average wine cellar.
I, of course, had the burger.  Bar Boulud features four delicious burgers on their regular menu, priced between £17 and £24. Now, this is pricey - it's prohibitively pricey.  And considering just a few short years back, the Boulud burgers were priced between £13-19, Boulud has realized that there is money to be made in a delicious hamburger.  
However, I do say that these burgers are worth it - considering the Hawksmoor burger for £15 without fries; Bar Boulud includes the pommes frites, and it's on par with Hawksmoor.  Boulud's beef comes from the Castle of Mey; aged Aberdeen Angus Cross chuck steak (grass and silage fed from the North of Scotland).
Their burgers include: the Yankee (£17) - a classic beef burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle on the homemade glazed brioche bun.  The Frenchie (£19) is topped with confit pork belly, tomato, and dijon on a morbier peppered homemade bun.  The Piggie (£19) piles bbq pork on top of the beef patty and then includes jalapeno mayo and cabbage on a cheddar bun.  And finally, the piéce de résistance is Boulud's £24 BB: a beef burger with foie gras, short rib meat, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes on a black onion seed bun.  
They also serve up a sampler of three burgers, cut in halves so you and some select friends can divide your attention amongst these four 8oz. burger delights.  The beef absolutely melts in your mouth and remains the focal point of the experience.  Even though the house-made buns are exquisite, they are purely a bit-player to the beef.  Even the toppings, though fresh and wonderful, are purely there for slight variation, not to overpower the burger patty.

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"Bar Boloud is just amazing. I would actually think it's the best overall restaurant in London, because it's so excellent always, and also because it's a great fit for any occasion - from dinner with your mother, to a work beer, to a romantic date or business dinner. It can be a place to splash out for superb French food and expensive wine (they go up to £400 per bottle) but also to have probably the best value meal in London (the set menu is simply the best deal in London) with extremely good value wine serviced by the glass. So it's just perfect for any occasion. The French food is superb. Everything is great, from the fine dining cuisine to their burgers, and if you like a bit more rustic country food I can really recommend their sausages.
And the service is just always flawless and genuinely friendly and caring. I had a person in my party spill red wine on their expensive cashmere sweater, and one of the waiters solved it with some soda water - it was gone!",1

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"About four or five times a year, I get an overwhelming craving for a burger. But being a lady of high standards, I want a burger that has real beef inside and I want to eat it in a nice restaurant on a plate. I can't stand plastic wrapping, or themed restaurants that try to pretend they're in America, when you can quite clearly see London buses going past the window.
Anyway, rant over, I was so happy with my burger at Bar Boulud. The texture was divine and there was just the right amount of lettuce and tomato with a delicious burger sauce. There are some more adventurous burgers on the menu, including one with foie gras inside, but I stuck to a Yankee burger with cheese and salad. Not that three bits of lettuce can be included as part of your five a day, but it probably saves some calories.
Saving calories on the main course is important as you'll want to indulge in a dessert. I had the chocolate lava cake, and held my breath to see if molten chocolate would oooze out as I've had some disappointing experiences with chocolate desserts recently. Thankfully, a river of chocolate flowed over the plate and I spooned up every last drop. A raspberry sorbet cleansed the palate so I could keep going back to the chocolate.
Not only was the food divine, but the location was a plus. As it is inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, which is just down the road from Harrods and Harvey Nichols, I expected it to be much more expensive than what it was. My Yankee Burger was just £18 though so it was cheaper than Burger and Lobster and some gastropubs. Service was excellent and the clientele were cool and civilised. 
Next time I'll go back a bit further after Christmas, so my stomach can handle a foie gras burger. It's the poshest setting for a burger I've found in London so far.",1

Needless to say, I am a huge fan, so when I come to a city that has a restaurant of his, I am there - especially if they have USDA steaks.  This restaurant is in the ground level of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and the place was a beehive of activity.  The crowd was lively, young-ish and very upscale.  It was last minute so I had to sit at the chartreuse table attached to the open kitchen, which was ok, since it was cool to be able to see all the action.
Also, when I found out that Daniel Boulud himself was there in the kitchen, I almost ran to my seat!!
Yes, Daniel himself was in the kitchen.  Although, he is New York based these days, I guess he was in town for something and while in town, he was working in his kitchen.  Pretty cool.
I had a glass of red and a USDA sirloin steak with béarnaise and a side of frites.  The steak was fantastic, as this was a USDA grade cut of beef, not something you see often in London.  The frites on the other hand, were rock hard and lukewarm.  I asked for fresh frites and I got a dish of piping hot frites no questions asked.  Awesome.

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,The burger seems to be what all the tables around me ordered.  More casual than other Boulud restuarants. Ordered the special of the evening which turned out to be the biggest piece of meat I've ever had brought to the table. While it was tasty..I regretted not ordering the burger.,1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Thanks to Andrew M for organising Burger Quest 4.0, which turned out to be one of my oddest dining experiences
Bar Boulud is the brainchild of Michelin starred New York legendary chef Daniel Boulud and has been reproduced in London from its original version in New York. Senior maitre d' Paulo de Tarso, which eventually turned our evening into a special one, told us the origins of the London version from its humble basement beginnings at the swanky Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge
To be honest, the evening didn't start well. The first 4 of our party of 10 Yelpers arrived to find that they had split us up into tables of 4,4 and 2 and that they were unable to sit us close together. Having now spent an evening in the buzzing and impressively full dining rooms, I'm still not sure why our tables couldn't be placed closer together
The other unfortunate policy at the restaurant is that no photo taking is allowed, especially of the food. At the end of the evening, we all agreed that it was a real shame that they didn't allow us to take photos of the food, which was beautifully plated and presented. A little bizarrely, they did offer to let us return to photograph the food with professional photographers and they would set up the food professionally, which rather goes against the spontaneous joy of Yelp. I really hope that they re-consider this policy as I, in common with a lot of others I'm sure, have chosen to eat somewhere when we've seen the beautiful photos of the food
However, once Mr de Tarso worked out that we were serious foodies, he did put in a lot of time with us to share his obvious passion for the food and to make sure that we had an enjyable evening. He was the perfect host
We had some nice cocktails to sip on - my non alcoholic 'Exotic Breeze' was a nice combination of lychee juice, fresh berries and tonic - as we perused the menu
Very generously, Mr de Tarso sent over some complimentary charcuterie boards as he wanted us to try the terrines, which reflects Daniel Boulud's rustic origin and style of cooking though elevating it to perfect execution and appearance. Despite it having a bistro air in the dining room, they don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients or cooking
The many terrines and hams on the board weren't shy on flavour, which was nice. The mustards served alongside added some lovely bite but the pickled veggies could have had a little more zing
Being Burger Quest, we all went for burgers. I had already decided beforehand on their signature BB burger which is a beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, frisée, horseradish mayonnaise and confit tomato all on a sesame black onion seed bun, costing a reasonable £19.50 considering the top class ingredients. Yinnie C bucked the trend on our table by having the Piggie burger, which was personally recommended by Mr de Tarso
So, the BB. It was very good but just a couple of notches from perfection. The beef patty is made in-house with a carefully measured ratio of fat to meat and this results in a wonderfully light patty. The foie gras and short ribs were nice too but as all these main filling ingredients are of the same consistency and flavour, everything just merged into an amorphous mouthful, nice though it tasted. I felt the foie gras was wasted in this mix and extracted it to be eaten separately. Similarly, the truffle was a bit lost in the meat feast. Linzi M had requested no horseradish in her burger and I did wonder if they leff it off mine as well as it did lack a little bit of different texture or a a little kick, which would have elevated it into the great division
However, Yinnie's Piggie burger was a little star. With the addition of barbecued pulled pork and chilli mayo, it had interesting contrasts on the palate
Happily, the truffle in the truffle mash was more obvious and was my favourite side. The fries, mushroom fricasee and cauliflower cheese gratin were good fillers but not in the same class
Somehow, we found space for a dessert each. These were yummy. We had a nice range with pineapple souffle, chocolate tart, peppermint chocolate sponge and mango with orange mousse
Mr de Tarso had a last surprise for us with a batch of mini madelaines fresh from the oven. Though we were stuffed by then, these all disappeared and I even spotted some fellow Yelpers pouring chocolate sauce into them!
So a big thanks to Mr de Tarso for being a perfect host and making our visit special",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"This was my best restaurant experience during my recent trip to London. The atmosphere at the restaurant is wonderful: ritzy but comfortable. The decor is an eclectic mix of old and new, antique and industrial. I loved it from the moment I walked in. My party of 3 was seated by 3 waiter--one to pull out each of our chairs. 
From the point of seating we were perfectly attended to all evening. My water glass was never empty and our bread basket was always full of a delicious mix of fresh, warm, breads. 
I had the fruit de mer grilles--a mixed grill of scallop, octopus, prawn, heritage tomatoes, lobster croquette, and basil mayonnaise. For dinner I had the volaille rotie-- a chicken breast perfectly prepared with polenta, roasted peppers, feta, charred courgette, and harissa vinaigrette. For dessert (of course I had dessert!) I had souffle baie des ronces--an incredibly light raspberry soufflé with thick tangy raspberry jam in the bottom of the ramekin and a side of fresh, nutty pistachio ice cream. 
Others in my group tried the sole limande--a whole roasted lemon sole with brown butter and lemon and capers (it's typically served on the bone, but she requested it boned and it came completely boneless). And one person had the Prix Fixe 3-course meal and adored every course. 
Everything was perfect: the atmosphere, the temperature in the restaurant, the staff and service, the timing of the meal, the drinks, the food (OMG the food!), and the desserts. 
I am dying to go to the Bar Boulud in NYC now and cannot wait to go to London and eat at this Bar Boulud again. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"Clean and classy with top quality food and a suckerpunch of a 5 star customer service experience is exactly what this restaurant is all about. 
Ambience/Décor:
The way in which I can describe the ambience and décor within this restaurant would be of a subtle nature. The restaurant (in my own opinion) is in a league of its own with having the ability to be well lit, calm, peaceful and down to earth, yet also possessing the qualities of having an air of elegance, class and of high quality to it's list of ways to describe the experience and memories it leaves with you.
Food/Dessert:
Due to having a semi full stomach, I decided to skip the starter and head straight for the main.
For the main course, I had one of the notoriously talked about burgers, the ""BB"" burger which consisted of: the beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, frisée, horseradish mayonnaise, confit tomatoes and black onion seed bun. I can honestly agree with all past reviewers about why the burger is London's best. The beef patty, foie gras and the ribs all complimented each other. The burger had a unique and overly satisfying taste. It is of decent size, packs in a lot of ingredients, flavours and good quality beef patty with it being filling, yet won't leave your stomach bursting with agony. I would definitely  recommend this to anyone who knows about good quality burgers.
For dessert I had the 'Coulant Au Chocolat' which consisted of a chocolate lava cake, raspberry sorbet and vanilla milk. What a collaboration of flavours and textures. This dessert is just one of those desserts that is better tried than described. The warmth and sponge like texture of the cake with the flow of hot chocolate mixture pouring out of it is to die for. It is sweet well baked and having the raspberry sorbet on the side is definitely a plus. The raspberry gives you a wake up call and definitely shockwaves your tastebuds back into action with it cold temperature and raspberry sour kick flavour. Great portion and really closes the meal in the best way possible. 
Price:
I guess there is not much to say really apart from you get what you pay for. What I can say though is if you want a meal that is like an experience then that is sure what you are paying for. On the plus side, I didn't think the pricing was expensive at all and the food was by far definitely worth it.
Customer Service:
It is rare to receive such customer service that has you talking about it for days. The waiters & waitresses really show that they care about ensuring you get the best experience possible. The waitress who served on the day I attended was very informative about the menu, very patient and engaged in general conversation. Customer service is just one of those things tjat in order to understand, you have to experience ir yourself, but, being an active restaurant diner, I have seen my fair share of customer service and yet still, when you receive a new moment of excellent customer service it does leave you in awe.
***Non-pretentious, chic, elegant and top quality restaurant serving top quality food with the sprinkle of excellent customer service in a modern building in the heart of London is where you need to be. Bar Bould is the restaurant where you need to be.***",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Burger Quest 4.0 has descended upon Bar Boulud and have also left with lighter wallet. The minute we walked in, it was clear that these people were serious about their food, and they only seem to serve tables of 4 and under because it means it is more intimate. So as a party of ten, we split into 4,4 and 2! Also no photos of the food please. It is THAT serious and crazy classy. 
The Maitre d' Paulo de Tarso (who has a 'small' following of 200,000 followers on twitter) was lovely, he talked to us about the beginnings of Bar Boulud and how passionate he was about the place since, he has a major hand in opening and managing the place, starting from it's basement origins. 
We also had the pleasure of trying the charcuterie board, and I totally agree with Linzi M, the foiegras and lamb terrine STOLE the show on that board. The Jambon Ham was also quite nice. They also had a pork and parsley terrine and a rabbit terrine as well. (Veggies look away!) 
Then, the burgers came, the beacon of our travels across, uhm, London. 3 BBs and My Piggie Burger. Although I did sample their shortribs and foiegras on top of their patty and it was so rich and so good. I polished off my piggie burger is fast timing too. The Chilli Mayo on top of my pulled pork and beef patty with the sour tang of the red cabbage slaw lifted was was a good burger to a great burger. It had a kick, it was medium rare and it had the extra juicyness of the pulled pork. AND I DIDN'T GET ANY ON MY WHITE TOP. WIN.
Since we pretty much shared EVERYTHING on the table, the sides were no different. But,the sides were hit and miss, which is why I had to knock a star off. The fries weren't great, B+L does better chips. The Mushroom fricasee, had great flavour but was really oily at the bottom. The great sides were the truffle mash,and the cauliflower cheese gratin. 
We went ALL OUT, and ordered desserts. And, the desserts were special, like Linzi's Peppermint chocolate dessert is something I'll order again, it's got a really unique taste, and it worked so well. and it came with hot chocolate sauce. LOVE! Yee Gan's Souffle was super super light and hot pineapple and coconut ice cream ALWAYS works. The chocolate tart that Andrew ordered was decadent and I'm glad we shared! My mango saffron crumble was light but the biscuit at the bottom really changed the dynamics of the dessert. I got dessert envy from Linzi's dish FOR SURE. 
And the madeleines, how could I forget the ones that were BETTER than paris. These were light, and fluffy and just too cute. AND added bonus to the staff who showed me how to the do the basket. (3 times 1 side and 2 times the other and then pull up from the bottom) Don't judge me, I am an origami freak!
I am meated out though. Beef Patty/pulled pork/meat board. I was like, my arteries are clogging up on the train ride home. LOL",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Lovely restaurant in the basement of mandarin oriental hotel. Classy yet trendy - it has that NYC French brasserie take replicated well. Good is slightly more American as well that French and I think this is what is nice about this place.
Really love their burgers, salads and crispy pork belly were definite yum! Would definitely recommend for nice but casual meals - highly recommend it!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"It is really good value for a decent French place with great location. Because they offer the choice of ""petite plates"", we decide to order several small plates to try as many dishes as possible instead of two or three large ones. So we end up ordering eight dishes--two real appetizers and six petite entrees. It turns out, I'd say, the petite ones are actually in good sizes(compared to those entrees served in similar high-end French restaurants) , especially the mussels!!! Among all the plates we order -- scallions, prawns, sausages, pork belly, chicken oysters, mussels and crab rolled in cucumber, I really recommend pork belly, scallions and crab rolled in cucumber, the last one is creative too in the way they make it. So if you ever have he chance to be in London, find a time to try out this nice restaurant in mandarin oriental hotel near Harrods.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"This place is even better than it was two years ago.  The people working there, who all seem to be from somewhere other than the UK, are all extraordinarily pleasant and eager to please, and very attractive without being like models and robots.  
I started with a cocktail, a killer Aperol spritz as good as any I had in Milan.  Followed that with a special of grilled calamari served with an aubergine (eggplant) pureé and a small pork croquette.  The calamari was both tender and flavorful and that aubergine was good to the last dot on the plate.  
I followed that with a single Merguez sausage served with red bell peppers sauteed with a moderately spicy harissa sauce and also served with a yogurt mint sauce.  Everything was wonderfully seasoned and the sausage was perfectly cooked and of wonderful texture.
Dessert was a piece of simple Basque cake served with brandied cherries and a light vanilla anglaise.  It reminded me of the type of baking my grandmother's generation loved - in the very best way!  
My server was a very nice young guy from the Czech Republic who made some spot-on menu recommendations and could not have been more pleasant.
I cannot wait to return the next time I visit London!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"I got so much love to give... to you Baby Boulud! 
As all good church going girls know, after a thought provoking talk, one needs time to mull it over and digest what was said. So what better way to do this than with a glass of bubbly or two!
In total I and my companion spent about 5 hours drinking, eating, chatting,  people watching and getting checked out (I'll come back to that - stay tuned.)
We opened with glasses of champagne and was convinced by our waiter that our afternoon drinks would be incomplete without some petite madeleine, which are small shell shaped cakes, dusted with icing sugar. They were light fluffy and warm. Mmmm, just delightful!
After more hours of more champagne and talking, we thought it would be rude to leave without having dinner, plus I had heard that the burgers were pretty good. I opted for the Piggie - beef burger with a pulled pork crown, but I was a little disappointed as there really wasn't that much piggy in the Piggie and certain not enough to make a difference to the taste. Still, the beef was as I requested it, a gorgeous medium rare, could have perhaps done with a little more seasoning, but overall nice cow.
Needing to wash the cow juice from my hands I popped to the ladies and needed to walk through the restaurant, and who was drinking in my form, but a German ginger sports man. Being a married man I think it's only fair that I do not disclose his identity, but I will say I'm just glad I was nowhere near a broom cupboard!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Right next to Knightsbridge tube station at the Mandarin Oriental, this is a great laid back restaurant where you can enjoy a lovely meal.
I've tried the coq du vin with the truffle mashed potatoes and it was delicious!
I came back with friends for burgers and we were not disappointed! The service is great as well. Highly recommend!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"I was taken there for my birthday. Very good wine menu, mouthwatering steak and their truffle mash.. Oh my god! I still dream about it! And nothing beats a surprise cake with compliments from the chef!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"I chose Bar Boulud from a well culled list of the top ten burgers in London. Each entry stated the case for the burger and was accompanied by a picture to illustrate its worthiness.
The Boulud offering jumped out and clearly warranted a visit by me and a fellow burger lover.
There are three burger choices at Bar Boulud:
YANKEE
Despite both of us being Yanks, the iceberg lettuce featured on this hamburger
and the fact that it didn't have any other redeeming or fun toppings summarily reduced its appeal.
FRENCHIE
What's not to love about confit pork belly, rocket and tomato-onion compote on a 
peppered brioche bun? 
PIGGIE
Pulled pork atop a patty just seems like overkill, no?
Of course, we went with the Frenchie. In an attempt to tamp down our gluttony we ordered one to share. Along with the fries, it made a nice, not too terribly heavy lunch for two.
As we waited for our Frenchie to arrive, we watched the professional kitchen with rapt attention. This operation is firing on all cylinders and frankly reminded me of kitchens I've usually only seen in New York and occasionally, San Francisco. I loved the buzz coming out of there.
The restaurant's interior is a little too tricked out for a burger but man, what a burger it was - juicy, true medium rare, umami busting at the seams. The flavours were harmonious and the fries were phenomenal. Not much more you can ask for, really.
Knightsbridge may not be the most obvious choice for a burger, but if you find yourself in the area craving one you'd be crazy not to come to Bar Boulud.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"This place has a nice ambience and can be relatively quiet on week days.
I shared the Piggie and BB burgers with a friend. The BB was the best for both of us - A beef patty, with foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes and black onion served on a seed bun. 
You can appreciate the quality of the ingredients used and they are cooked to perfection but both burgers could have done with more flavour and 'wow' factor. Especially for the price!",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"Erin and I enjoyed a perfect Christmas dinner at Bar Boulud our first night in London.
 
The flavors matched those I expected to satisfy me on a chilly, northern winter's night.
 
The amuse bouche distiller all such flavors into a spirit lifting broth of white bean and white truffle soup. It's steamy heat enlivened me from the outside chill. 
 
 For my first course, I had a delectable duck / pistachio  terrine served with a spoonful of cranberry jam and miniature ginger bread biscuits. I paired this with a dry burgundy. New rule - I serve duck terrine at all my parties.
 
I zeroed in on my second course from the word short-rib without realizing it came with a rib-eye steak as well. These meats were accompanied with a compressed spinach packet and the cutest potato dauphine. We had a glass of a 1995 Bordeaux with this richer course. 
 
For dessert I had buch du Noel for the first time, though I've fantasizes about this holiday treat since my 8th grade introductory French class. Was the stuff of dreams!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"My goodness, what a fabulous dining experience - from the service to the food. I like that the servers are French. The occasion was my birthday, so we ordered a fairly priced bottle of Ayala champagne. I started with the escargots, cooked simply with butter and garlic - and accompanied with potatoes dauphin, which were like little balls of mash heaven. That was followed by the sirloin steak with lightly creamed spinach and a salade frisée. The steak was cooked to perfection and oh-so tasty and juicy. My mum had the boudin noir, with mashed potatoes and sliced apple - and she said it was delectable. 
But the best part of the meal was the dessert. We were both so full, but our server, the funny and charming Thibault, encouraged me to choose something , as he knew I was celebrating my birthday. So I chose the madeleines - and good lord they were incredible. Thibault told us they're not baked until they're ordered, so they arrived warm and fluffy and amazingly tasty, lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Oh my gosh they were just out of this world. 
Definitely recommend this place, birthday or not. I did like that they didn't sing to me. Thibault quietly but sincerely placed a plate in front of me, garnished with ""Happy Birthday Jennifer"" in chocolate, along with a chocolate cupcake and a small candle. Right up my alley. Bravo!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"I have never been to a French Resteraunt. So please excuse me if my review makes you want to go here and it's not great. I thought it was absolutely delicious.
The staff make you feel so comfortable,  they take your coats, pull out your chairs and are there for your every need. The decor is remarkable and the food is absolutely amazing (in my opinion), I would love to go here again anyway.
The reason I have not given this venue a 5 star rating, is due to the area (Knightsbridge) it is very pricey, well for me being a student it is anyway. For two of us, with a starter and a main course it cost us 100 pounds for the meal. However, as it was my friends birthday, he did get a small cake free! With his name on which was really sweet. 
Would recommend to anyone that likes to try out different cuisines or has a taste for French food. It was a pleasure being there and I would go again if I could afford.",1

- the service staff is impeccable, from the front door staff to the barman to our waiter; very very obliging, friendly and alert staff!!
- great atmosphere, nice interiors (sleek open kitchen, vaulted ceilings, red-leather banquettes and zinc-topped bar create a comfortable and welcoming surrounding); however, very narrow seating (this is really a minus!)
- the seasonal bistro menu includes an impressive selection of house-made terrines and pâtés, as well as a handful of signature sausages and burgers, adding an American touch to this French inflected bistro and wine bar
- the wine list focuses on Burgundy and the Rhône Valley, including many fine selections by the glass, as well as a wide array of draught and bottled beers
- starter: ""CHARCUTERIE DE GILLES VEROT"": chef's selection of pâtés terrines,sliced meats, hors d'oeuvres, pickles & mustards (small 16.00 GBP | large 32.00 GBP); delicious! I loved the mustard as well as the terrines very much!

Our local hosts (friends from Australia) promised a quick local bite, so I was rather surprised to be led into the glam interior that was Bar Boulud at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge.
The french onion soup and burgers were recommended by both our friends and the waiter, but being a non-red meat eater I opted for the bouillabaisse followed by  baked chicken breast on polenta which were both rich in flavour and very tasty.
The bouillabaisse arrived in several different dishes and was constructed at the table. Deliciously fragrant!!
All staff were attentive and either authentically french or had excellent french speaking accents :)

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"Wow, what an incredible evening. At the next instalment of our 'Burger Club', we just had to try the legendary BB at Bar Boulud*. With its origins in New York, this is a burger of 18 years fame! Situated in the beautiful Mandarin Oriental Hotel, this is a lovely space and from the second you walk in, you can tell these people know their stuff and service is of paramount importance. 
We had the pleasure of meeting maitre d' Paulo De Tarso, the main man formally of The Wolesley and Scotts, who set up this entire place. He was truly a delight, highly knowledgable and treated us like family. We discovered Paulo is a more than a bit of a respected  celebrity in restaurant circles so it was lovely of him to spend so much time with us describing his ethos for the restaurant and how much attention goes into each dish. 
We started with the charcuterie board and were won over by the flavours of the terrines from lamb terrine to coarse country foie gras. As always cured meats are my favourite, I couldn't get enough of the different flavours and textures of this board. Try them all! 
As was the theme of the evening, everyone ordered the burgers, 3 BBs and a Piggie. We had to go for all the sides, truffled mash, mushroom fricassee, cauliflower gratin and of course, fries! The burger was a revelation, the most moist, tender patty you could ever bite into. I wasn't relishing enough enjoyment from the foie gras in the burger, so I began spreading it on the bread provided and that was divine! Back to the burger to really taste each part then, the highlight of the BB is the combination of the braised short rib with the foie gras sitting on an unusual black sesame seed bun.  
Sides are almost always my favourite, maybe because I used to be a vegetarian. But I could have eaten that truffled mash all day long. It was decadent! Same for the gratin. 
Of course, we were a greedy table and ordered a round of desserts. At a place like Boulud, how can you not?! Coconut crusted pineapple soufflé with coconut ice cream, this was like eating a fluffy delicious cloud of air. Andrew had the coffee and bittersweet chocolate tart - this was decadent and divine. Maybe too rich to eat a whole one, but I was too taken with my coupe peppermint, a flourless sponge topped with mint chocolate icecream and a chocolate 'lid' that melted when poured over with chocolate sauce. Hello! 
Paulo then treated us to fresh baked madeleines, straight from the oven. What a delight. Light, airy and with a hint of citrus, I think they may have been the highlight of the meal for me. 
This was truly a fantastic experience and we were wowed by the charm of Bar Boulud. If you are looking for something special or have someone special to treat, take them here! 
* Boulud had actually been on my list to try for quite some time.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"I had the BB. It was the best burger outside of the States I've had. Ray's Hell Burger in Arlington, just across bridge from DC, is still the world supreme. 
The burger was the perfect size. Quality of meat was good. It was cooked evenly, not the half raw, half burnt, interpretations of MED rare I've run across. The bun did not take away from the flavor of the burger and foie gras. I had the roasted veg as a side and downed a Bellenrose to wash it all down. It was a good day.",1

On top of all that we were able to get a booking on 20 minutes notice. The prices are reasonable; in theory, you could get in, get a burger, and get out, with change from 20 bucks or the UK equivalent.

The only thing, it was awfully hot - either it was the heat from the kitchen or the glaring lights set up for the not very good wall photographs, but it was very uncomfortable.  We asked to change our table and were reseated away from the kitchen -  a decision that took 20 minutes to make in a nearly empty restaurant, for which they lose a star.",1

Pricey!",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"The Piggie at Bar Boulud was a rare example of a burger trying too hard. Pulled Pork, Green Chili Mayo, Bibb Lettuce, Red Cabbage Slaw, and a Cheddar Bun all combined for too many textures and flavors going on. The interesting fact here is that none of them stood out and the burger was lacking any salt/acid to give it that mouth watering effect. The burger was also quite tall and difficult to handle/enjoy while eating. Overall, the Piggie has potential however it seems to be a little confused about what it is trying to do. I'd suggest subbing the lettuce for fried onion strings and topping the burger with a healthy dose of vinegar based BBQ sauce.",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,1,"I'm gonna start with, their christmas dinner 2011-2012 was absolutely WONDERFUL. It was every bit of delicious juicy velvety piece of goodness I can ask for around the holiday season (while eating out). BUT...
I went there a few more times after that and it was more disappointing than ever. So disappointed that I've lost my last bit of faith in this place. my pork belly was so overcooked that it tasted like leather, fish was way fishy, pate was half frozen, sausage tasted frosty.. and most of all, service was crappy. Mandarin Oriental's are normally great with services. Except for this one.. for some reason I've witnessed more customer dispute and unsatisfactory comment at this particular MO than anywhere else in the world.
So yeah, the one star is the one redeeming quality for this restaurant and it all goes to the christmas dinner from last year. Bar Boulud has really gone downhill!",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"I too joined the rest of the Yelp krew for Burger Quest 4.0 here. I'll cut to the point and much has already been said. Bar Boulud is a great restaurant but we all felt a bit conflicted once they figured out that we all wrote reviews about restaurants and other services. It would have been really great to experience the restaurant without the ""extra attention"" for lack of a better term.
Either way, the burgers are quite amazing. The juice and crumble of the patty is outstanding. I do wish that they had less patty and more toppings though! The pork belly was severely skimmpy on the toppings.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"I got the 3-course prix fixe meal. It was quite the bargain. Just £23, about the same price as restaurant week in NYC. Chopped salad, steak with bearnaise, and the french cake. All very good. I got the sommelier to pair a good wine, and it was a fantastic cotes du rhone. But I want to come back here to try the burgers, which seem quite special.
All in all, you can trust any Boulud restaurant or a solid, fine French dining experince.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"The ambience of this place is great, chic but not pretentious, the moneyed on a casual night out. Staff are efficient and pleasant too. I've been a handful of times and if you don't book, then there will often be a wait. I went on a Monday evening and it was packed. The consolation is having cocktails by the bar whilst waiting for your table.
Of course I went for the burgers, which are on most of the top 10 London burger lists. In fact I have never tried anything else off their menu, although the other food looks great too. Burgers are good-patty is well cooked. Perhaps I am fussy, but I think there is too much bun in proportion to the burger, which obscures the taste of the patty a little for me. It's simple enough not to eat both halves of the bun though.
Burgers are £11.75/12.75 except for the foie gras burger. Chips are extra. This is great value for a good food eaten in a lovely environment.
We returned a burger because it was overcooked. A perfectly cooked replacement was brought without fuss, in super quick time, and with a free side of chips.Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, in the very same hotel, could learn a thing or two from this place- but that is for another review.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"So different than I expected. It's tucked inside the Mandarin Oriental. We walked in knowing the food would be good, but would the experience be too snooty. It wasn't. It's a very cool place. Great lighting and decor. The service was top notch. They work in teams, so there's always someone to help. We both had the burger. I had the Piggy. It was fantastic. But note, anything cooked beyond ""medium"" takes 20 or more minutes. The Pom frites were basic, but the cauliflower au gratin was succulent. Also can't say enough about the French onion soup. It was perfectly balanced and flavorful. We skipped dessert, but we're definitely intrigued. Overall, it's a 3.5 star place, but with a more robust menu could be a 4 to 4.5.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"This is a decent French restaurant in the Hyde Park area. The price of the food is responsible and so is the quality. It's nothing that's going to bring you back for a second tasting, however it is far from disappointing.",-1

Of course, I did not tell him this thought because I did not want to hurt his feelings. It was double thumbs up to him for the effort and the choice but food-wise it was really A-OK. I had a better French food elsewhere especially for the price. I must admit I enjoyed the freshness, quality and the presentation of the food here. In addition, I commend the service here (it better be excellent as it is part of high service charge paid the mister). The ambiance here is definitely posh as you could imagine but its all right, a girl can play and pretend to be posh sometimes especially on her birthday. Enough said, a single visit here is adequate for a lifetime. On the other hand, I would go back tirelessly to Asia De Cuba.",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"On my venture to taste London's best burgers, I finally made it to Bar Boulud in Knightsbridge. It's a beautiful simple room with nice warm colours and very friendly and attentive staff. Speaking about staff, the sheer number of staff is almost scary, but as all are very obliging, I did not really mind.
I started with a really great Trinity Hill, Viognier, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand 2008, a delicious white wine that reminded me a lot of dry Rieslings. 
For the food, I chose the Frenchie burger. To be fair, it is not a very large burger. But that's probably a good thing. I agree with many others, this burger deserves a mention in any top list. The taste is rich, the bun doesn't dissolve half way through the burger and I cannot think of much that would make this burger better. The Pommes Frittes, as they call it, are thin and crispy, well seasoned and a good complement to the burger. 
The strawberry dessert was simply amazing, the pastry  that was mainly for the eye anyway, but nice and crunchy  even came with some gold on top! Whether it was gold or not, you clearly pay for it. But I have to say, it's worth every penny! 
To finish off, I ordered an espresso. I didn't expect too much, and I didn't get too much. It is really a pity, that almost no restaurant offers decent coffee. So unfortunately, the last impression was by far not as positive as the rest. 
After all, I definitely recommend Bar Boulud. It's a very nice place, the food is great, the wine delicious, the staff friendly, and if you don't order an espresso but go straight for a walk in Hyde Park, you will perhaps have a perfect time there!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Good place to stop in for a bite. A little 'scene-y' on the weekend, loud, but dependable for drinks and some good food.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Bar Boulud is pushing the bar for burgers in London just for a bit higher with some innovative creations, epic attention to detail that really shines through in the taste and texture of the meat, and a high level of service to back it up.
Bar Boulud was the location for the latest Yelp BurgerQuest, picked for its appearance on several top 10 lists on London's burger blogs and the fabled BB burger topped with foie gras and coming in just shy of £20. It's a posh place (located below the Mandarin Oriental Hotel) with a suitably luxurious décor. It's burgers are no less fancy with all four offerings being based on a bespoke beef patty. But is it any good? The short answer is yes, yes it is. From the Yankee to the Frenchie and of course the BB, the burgers are very tasty with one of the best patties in London and a solid set of buns to support them.
Two important things we learned are 1) groups of more than 4 need to book several weeks in advance to have a chance of sitting near let along with each other, and 2) NO PICTURES!
Anyways, we eventually got seated and the night properly began. Our waiter was pretty cool and, despite being fairly new, really put in a lot of effort to make sure we had everything we needed and also answer all the questions we threw at him. Mr. de Tarso also spent quite a lot of time with us over the course of the night to discuss his vision for Bar Boulud and also a bit of his personal history. He's worked with some of the top names in London and is a fairly impressive chef in his own right. 
At this point, I need to disclose that we didn't have a completely typical experience as Mr. de Tarso was kind enough to send some free charcuterie plates (as they say, you really know a chef by how he puts together a plate of meat) and some fresh madelines for dessert. Now I'd love to think it's because we demonstrated an obvious passion for food and thus inspired Mr. de Tarso to ensure we tried the best Bar Boulud had to offer. But, the smart money is on the fact that we let slip at the start that we were all Yelpers. If the latter is the cause, I attribute it to Alex S's (Yelp London Community Manager) efforts to really put Yelp out there above its competition. Regardless, there was free food, and it was good.
The BB burger is average sized with a fluffy soft white bun, the aforementioned patty, seared foie gras, and red-wine braised short rib. It's a bit tall and may prove a challenge for those who can't unhinge their jaw, but each bite is full of tasty meat and soaked bun. I give extra points as the bun actually holds together for the entire burger despite the copious amount of juice running out with each bite. The foie gras was delicious on its own but was lost in the taste of the combined burger. At best, it added a bit more richness to the whole thing but it was a poor value-add. The braised short rib was likewise a bit lost in the overall combination although it did add more textures to the burger which was sorely needed. I could have eaten it as a side dish alone though, absolutely brilliant flavours and tender shredded meat. Overall, a pretty good burger but not quite worth the nearly £20 price tag. At £12-15, I'd be quite happy and perhaps if they took off the foie gras they could do just that.
Finally desserts! We started with the mini-madelines as ordered by Mr. de Tarso which were brilliant. Light and airy with a slight lemony flavour, they are very moreish and incredibly hard to put down. And when you dip them in hot chocolate sauce then you pretty much won't bother stopping until they are all gone (I know that's what I did). The chocolate tart was my next favourite with a  deep bitter chocolate although the chocolate sauce soaked sponge was a close second (or third rather). Finally, for a bit of freshness, we managed to take down a pineapple soufflé and a mango mouse. Both were light and refreshing and a great option if you feel stuffed from your meal but still want dessert.
Overall, an excellent experience and a definite burger win. I only wish we could have taken some photos but perhaps Mr. de Tarso will be kind enough to send some professionally taken ones for us to use. Get over to Bar Boulud (make a reservation first), and try the the Piggy or Frenchie burger for a good time. And a special thank you to Mr. de Tarso for being an absolutely brilliant host - he even got a waiter to teach us how to fold a napkin into a bowl for serving madelines!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"Summary: Decent food, nice setting, small portions, not as good as I'd expect for the price.
Came with two friends late Fri. night - I ordered the boudin noir (blood sausage), frenchie burger w/ spinach, and we split desserts.
Boudin noir was small but great. Moist and flavorful.
Burger was dry (both the bun and the meat) and underwhelming. Small as well. Spinach was not too creamy and good.

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"Not as good as the New York original -- the charcuterie was excellent, but the other items on the menu were universally lackluster.  Everything lacked flavor: steak tartare was bland, as was the choucroute and the lamb.  I didn't care for the basement location; the dropped ceilings make the interior feel claustrophobic rather than cozy. 
On a positive note, the service was quite pleasant (but I would expect nothing less from a Mandarin/Boulud collaboration).",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Went to Bar Boulud to check out the lamb burger specially created for their one year anniversary. I'd been meaning to go to BB for a while, but never quite managed to find the time. This time around, the fact that the lamb burger was only going to be around for a week enticed me to come down, even though I was not able to find a dining companion at such short notice.
 Despite the fact that I was on my own and a small eater, the service I received was impeccable. Batiste, my waiter, introduced the special (the lamb burger) right after handing me the menu and helped me choose a nice wine to go with it. I also asked whether I needed to order a side to go with my burger order, and he said, no, as he thought the burger was quite 'significant' in size. I'd read a couple of reviews that said the burgers were a little on the small side but as Batiste mentioned that the kitchen could turn out sides in double-quick time if I thought the burger wasn't big enough, decided to just go with the burger.
 And a good thing I did! I'll just say that the burger didn't look that big, but I had to take a break midway because I was getting really full! The lamb was good, not gamey, while the chickpea fries were a delightful surprise.
 I really wanted to give the desserts a go, but, as you might have guessed, that simply wasn't possible. Contrary to popular belief, sometimes, there simply isn't space for dessert.
 I mentioned it earlier but I simply need to mention it again. The service is incredible. The staff checked on me several times during the course of my meal, but not too many times as to make me uncomfortable. My water glass was topped up almost the instant it was emptied, and my dishes were cleared in an efficient manner. Batiste was also friendly and smiley to all of the tables he served at all times.
 I'll have to come back another time to try out the regular burgers. I strongly suspect I'll enjoy the Piggie Burger given my love of all things pork. But, first, I'll need several weeks of gym visits, and a friend to eat here with so that we can order more food!",1

The beer braised feather blade is one of my fav things on the menu, the sorbets are super refreshing and comes with these rich warm chocolate sea salt cookies.... mmmm.... Everything is presented beautifully, not only does the food taste great, you really enjoy every bite!

Bob and I were able to get a Christmas Eve prix fix menu for an excellent price - naturally, we decided to just go with that. The service, was absolutely impeccable. Our server was fast, friendly and exceedingly polite. He was very accommodating as we asked to substitute one the courses for something else, and he happily obliged. We had the onion soup to start, Bob had the beef, I had the chicken and for dessert I had the Napoleon and Bob and the chocolate gateau. Everything was delicious - but my chicken was phenomenal. Fall of the bone tender and crispy on the outside. The ambiance was lovely - very comfortable and casual but still with a touch of formality. This is one of the best restaurants we had the pleasure of eating at in London, and I highly suggest you all do the same!",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"Bar Boulud should come with a health warning:  ""Serious indigestion and/or illusion of time being sped up around you""
Put it this way- we had a 3 course meal with souffle done, dusted and paid within 1h30 minutes.  And Oh the WINE!  They managed to douse away the bottle by the time the mains came.  And there were only 3 of us.
Having discussed about this ""Daniel Boloud hates patrons going to toilet because he has to recook the whole table"" episode as featured in the quasi biography ""The Fourth Star"", I stood up to go to the bathroom about 1 minute after they cleared the starter.  Urm, NO; the steak was being served already and I was essentially ushered back to the seat.  
To be honest, the food itself was delicious and the chacuterie was amazing value for the amount of delicious food you get.  The steak was well cooked; the crab salad was very fresh and the lamb well seasoned with a tip top chickpea stew.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable and friendly.  
Unfortunately this was all overshadowed by teething problems and a slightly heavy handed attitude towards selling you more wine by pouring quickly (literally after every sip) and ""attentiveness"" and keeping good time.  I personally prefer my nice dinners to be enjoyed leisurely and not in a hectic, chaotic and comical ""everything-around-you-is-going-at-light-speed"" crazy blur.
Bar Boulud has a lot of potential, but honestly, I now totally understand why the Guardian spent the whole review complaining about their 2 hour turn around policy.",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Bar Boulud London is possibly better than the one in NYC, which is saying a lot! The restaurant just opened a couple of weeks ago, but so far, after dining here 3 times, I'm definitely a fan. The food is solid - excellent charcuterie (my favorite is the Pate Grandpere made with the creamy bits of foie gras), beautifully rich Boudin Blanc, excellent grilled lamb chops, a delightful fresh shellfish platter featuring periwinkles, langoustine, lobster, crab, king prawns, tuna tartare, whelks, clams, and mussels, and a superb wine list. The decor is not my favorite - there is something about the mix of maroon red colors that is a little off-putting, and the artwork on the walls that are supposed to be different types of wine spilled onto white tablecloths and framed, look more like.. well to be perfectly frank... women's used maxi pads hanging on the walls. But the service and food more than make up for the odd decor.
The prices are surprisingly reasonable as well considering it is smack dab in the middle of Knightsbridge, AND in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.",1

And mind you, this isn't some crappy tourist joint serving you 3 day old fish and chips.  Reviewing the prix fixe menu, half of the options seemed interesting while the others were okay.  I had the rabbit terrine for appetizer and the blood sausage/mash for entree - both were excellent and I would order them again if they weren't on the prix fixe menu.  Service was excellent and they were very accommodating to our 3 year old - who knew that Bar Boulud would have crayons and coloring sheets for kids?

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"Bar Boulud is listed as a French restaurant but if there was a rustic/homey category, it would be listed there.  We made reservations for a late Friday night (10 PM) and were seated immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the art on the wall.  There were various wines spilled on a canvas and framed to give some type of 'Rorschach Test' effect?  But to me, it kinda looked like ummm the problem that women have once a month so it was a little disturbing.  With my appetite built up with that thought, let's talk about the food.
We had the grilled pork belly, aka really thick bacon pieces, which I devoured and grilled sausages for appetizers.  Very rich and delicious.  I'm not usually into fatty cuts of meat, but these were seared to give it a nice texture outside and the fat really melts in your mouth when you bit into it.  My heart is going to hate me for it later.  Next course was the yankee burger.  A good fancied up burger, but nothing spectacular.  Third course was food coma back in the hotel room.",1

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"What we ate on a Saturday evening around 6.30pm..
6 Rock Oysters - £12.00 (accompanied by brown bread with seaweed butter, shallot vinaigrette, sauce 'américaine', lemon )
The plump juicy oysters were served on ice in a raised platter and shucked well enough to be nearly overflowing with briny juice. The homemade seaweed butter was a thoughtful addition but did not come close to the same from god of butter, Jean-Yves Bordier. Their sauce américaine had much more bite and spice than any Heinz replica, a meaty substitute for Tabasco.
Frenchie Burger - £13.75 (includes chips)
This is a burger with confit pork belly, rocket tomato-onion compote and Morbier cheese served on a peppered brioche bun. The bun was delicious and a soft peppery pillow for some serious ingredients. The burger was huge and heavy with meaty flavour thanks to the additional porky belly, the nutty Morbier and jammy compote lifting the meat with some huge hits of flavour. There was some additional french mustard in here somewhere which was not listed in the menu. The chips were good, just good, skinny and lots of them but scoring a 6/10.
Piggie Burger - £13.75 (includes chips)
This burger is served in a Cheddar bun with bbq pulled pork, Bibb lettuce, green chili mayonnaise and red cabbage slaw. The cheese on the bun was strong and gave a great pungent bite to the beautifully soft pork and then the firm burger. The lettuce, mayo and slaw added softness, heat and crunch so there was lots going on in every mouthful. The pulled pork was so good we would have easily eaten a whole plate of this smothered over the 6/10 chips.
Soufflé au citron - £9.50
A super light lemon soufflé was served with a jug of spiced sugar poire william and vanilla coulis. A bit pricey but was nice enough.
Île exotique - £8.00
This dessert was amazing, the lime floating island was filled with a mango crémeux and sat on a coconut anglaise. Dotted around the plate were tiny bites of spiced pineapple, pomegranite and basil leaves and little bit of everything on the spoon was divine, it was a random choice but worth it.
Drink
1 glass of Nittnaus Pinot Noir 'Kurzberg', Burgenland, Austria (2007) - £8.50
1 Sierra Nevada pale ale - £4.75
2 Peppermint teas - £9.00 (they used fresh peppermint but still expensive for water and leaves)
Atmosphere
We ate at 6.30pm on a Saturday and there was a great atmosphere with a busy mix of tables, banquets and booths of dates, family meals, groups of friends and single diners. The open kitchen is exciting and honest and adds to the buzz of the diners and staff. Very attentive service keeps you looked after and there is reasonable 2hr 15mins turnaround in place. Plus, as in all good hotels, toilets are clean and attended.
Offers
Three course set menu meal for £20 served seven days between 12pm-2.30pm and 5.30pm- 7pm
Verdict
GO! GO! GO!
We will definitely go back to Bar Boulud. The burgers were ordered medium-rare but were served medium so in future we'll ask for rare. The set menu looked excellent value and the location is perfect for popping in when shopping around Knightsbridge. Always book, we saw lots of people being turned away.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,4,"I was first introduced to this place by my parents friends who have lived in London for about 4 years longer than I have. We came here as a party of 6 on quite a busy Friday evening, but made sure we made it in time for the Prix Fixe menu (before 7pm). The atmosphere was very nice, posh, contemporary with a dash of NY flavor (just like the one in NYC). It was good to be able to share a nice meal with my parents, who only visit London once a year, and who do love a good meal every now and then. 
We did order from the Prix Fixe menu along with the token burger just to try it out and assess what the fuss about Daniel Boloud's burgers are all about. I still remember starting with the French Onion soup au gratin and the Coq au Vin for the main. The food and service were absolutely delightful and I would have given it 5 stars back when we were Boloud virgins. Since then I've come back here 4-5 times and service and food quality have suffered a little.
The last time I came here was a couple of weeks ago when my roommate and I were celebrating this new gig that I got (see my profile for related reviews from getting a new job :P). The Prix Fixe menu was of choice again, since I'd come other times and have already had the wonder of the a la carte stuff. Anyway, I started with an AMAZING terrine a la morocco, which was just delightful, but a less exciting main. It seems like the main choices have become a little dated and tired, less exciting than when I first popped by Boloud cherry back in Nov 2010. I had a grilled chicken breast with creamed polenta, all were very tasty, and the grilled chicken was done almost to perfection... I've never thought I could have had chicken breast that moist. Anyway, I devoured that sucker, but got to the last piece, and with grilled chicken, if you want to get it this moist, it almost has to be just at the right temps. I must have gotten the fleshiest part of the meat on my 3rd slice and it was just a little too underdone for me. So... being the perfectionist that I am, I sent it back (oh for shame!!)... They returned the dish as if I hadn't touched it and it was done just as well as the first time. 
Lets just say, I still LOVE coming to this place, the service is amazing, and the food is REALLY good. I'd say that the glassed-wine selection needs to be a little improved and that the Prix Fixe menu needs a little defibrillator action, but overall, still a place I would love to come back to and bring people on dates.

 Finally I have made it to Bar Boulud, next to Knightsbridge tube station located in the ground floor of the exceedingly posh Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Bar Boulud has been written up to death (e.g. MarinaMetro, AA Gil, Jay Rayner, and a myriad of bloggers) so I will keep myself short.
 The owner and chef, Daniel Boulud, is a successful restaurateur in New York where he doesn't only have a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars ('Daniel') but is also famous for his up-market burgers .
 For me  coming from Austria  burgers did not exist until I moved to England apart from in the form of McDonalds hamburgers. It took me quite a while to get my head around the fact that a burger should be taken seriously and can be truly delicious. So the burger slowly made its way from being my favourite hangover food to actually being eaten for real enjoyment even without prior alcohol exposure.
 Anyway, what I want to say is that my burger experience is limited and I am far from being a burger expert  so I approached Bar Boulud and its famous burgers (which I of course had to try) with a relatively unbiased attitude but with high expectations.
 For Knightsbridge and for being in the Mandarin Oriental I thought the atmosphere at Bar Boulud was rather pleasant and it was frequented by a mixed crowd. It was Wednesday evening and very busy  we only got a table in the bar area (with stylish but hugely uncomfortable chairs). In fact it was so busy that we were more or less ignored by the waiters for the first part of the evening. Later on service picked up however and the waiters were friendly and seemed to be doing their best.
 I started with the beetroot salad with goat's cheese and walnut (8). I was not terribly impressed actually. Everything, even though tasty, was slightly underseasoned and especially the salad leaves could have done with some kind of dressing.
 Then of course the DBGB Yankee burger (12 + 1 for cheese). Maybe I expected something like an orgasmic burger experience (which might be too much to ask from pour Daniel Boulud) but somehow the burger failed to induce any culinary arousal. Don't get me wrong, it was quite nice. The meat was extremely high quality and perfectly medium rare as requested. It was however bordering on cold when served and in the end it was just a not very exciting burger and I was a bit disappointed.",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,1,"We have been so far to three Daniel Boulud's restaurants and this one at Mandarin Oriental hotel was the worst.
It was our first and last visit there mainly due to overpriced menu, intimidating staff, noise and absolutely ordinary food.
This place does not have any identity whatsoever and definitely does not to live up to Daniel's reputation.",-1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"Where: Bar Boulud, The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Knightsbridge
With whom: The Masticator
How much?: £110 for the two of us. That was four courses (Prix Fixe plus an extra charcuterie course)
 This was the week that we got news of another American import, Keith McNally, bringing a feted and famous New York brasserie to London (Balthazar, in partnership with Richard Caring's Caprice Holdings). Both McNally and Daniel Boulud, at whose new London outpost we were dining, are considered by many to be American chefs, and both made their large reputations there however both were born in Europe, Keith McNally a few miles up the road from his planned new home.
 I came to praise Daniel Boulud, but instead walk away strangely unsatisfied. As a dining experience overall, it wasn't one that will live long in the memory. 
It wasn't the staff. They were as well drilled, knowledgable and friendly a brigade as I've seen... 
It wasn't the decor. The light, well proportioned space is a graceful place for the well heeled to dine... Admittedly I was less sure about the arty splashes on the wall. The blot art of famous red wine vintages intrigued but were only vaguely reminicent of blood stained rorchach drawings. 
Sadly, and more fundamentally, it was the food.
 We went for a so-so Corbier, fair enough, but a little too earthy for both of us. It came from a large and excellent winelist priced squarely for the Four Seasons clientele. There are only a handful below £50, the rest quickly hit hedge fund levels.
 The relatively long and involved menu presented a thrill as it was knowledgeably announced by our gallic host. There were certainly sparks of excellence here. Themes of charcuterie, sausage, pâtés and burger were highlighted and so we decided to go for the Prix Fixe with an additional charcuterie course (supplied by expert Parisian charcuterie supplier Gilles Verot). The small plate was more than ample and made a very good pre-starter paired with a moreish (light in texture but richly flavoured) boudin blanc sausage and its accompanying garlic mash. A very good salami made up for the dry and too subtle ham. Pâtés (particularly the tagine dagneau, a heavily spiced Maroc influenced lamb and aubergine mix and a superb pâté grand-mère) really excelled and the portions of the small plate were the ideal way to sample.
 The chilled pea soup was simple elegance and one dish I'll remember for a long time. Fresh, creamy and with an occasional snap of tiny rosemary flavoured cruton, it hit the spot perfectly.
 Sadly it went a little down hill from here. The Masticator's burger was initially dry, tasteless, unseasoned and lukewarm with a shredded lettuce, 'special sauce' and thin, limp tomato combination eeriely remenicent of a certain golden arched chain. Only a tasty brioche bun saved it. The team were swift to offer a replacement due to the temperature but this arrived in the same state (albeit warmer). The chips were inedibly saline.
 My roasted chicken breast had a rich rustic and flavoursome taste of pure perfect poultry and arrived, in comparison, piping hot. Slightly dry too though sadly, it was helped by a rich (if salty) gravy but badly let down by rather floury fingerling potatoes and overcooked artichokes.
 The Masticator had further problems with his desert (though this time arguably of his own making). A pervading scent of lavender that put him off his two (small) scoops of mint and coconut ices was tracked down to the overpowering handwash in the Mandarin Oriental bathroom. That aside, a powder dry hazelnut cookie didn't add to the experience. My exotic fruit sundae was preceded by a long spoon hightening childish anticipation before it arrived in a Martini glass. A pleasant but not earth-shattering mélange of passion fruit purée and cream came with nuggets of an excellent coconut macroon to give some needed bite.
 Will I come again? Absolutely. It's a great space for a business lunch in the area, a safe menu overall with some excellent notes and very good charcuterie. It isn't somewhere I'll be rushing back to though. For the price, I'd rather take a day trip to Paris and pop by Gilles Verot's shop in person.",-1

french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,3,"I'm a devotée of Daniel Boulud. I've enjoyed many wonderful meals at every single NYC restaurants of hison many occasions. I got engaged at Daniel and my last meal on earth would be at Daniel. (DB's fine dining restaurant on the Upper East Side, NYC.)
My husband and I had many excellent après-theatre dinners at Bar Bouloud in NYC, so visiting Bar Bouloud in London on a similar occasion seemed like an obvious choice. (Besides, we were curious to try one of the latest additions to the DB Empire.)
Bar Boulud London is very much like Bar Boulud NYC. On steroids!! They have a capacity to seat AT LEAST 200 ppl. (BB NYC has about 75.) Similar menu (with old time favorites like the ""Frenchie Burger"" and ""Coq au Vin"" and artisan sausages) with very similar decor and similar winelist but that's about it. Granted, we went there on a Friday night, but BB resembled a nightclub where they happen to serve food. (That's a serious mistake as Daniel's food is normally as good as it gets. At least in NYC.)
I'm not sure if it is the culprit of the location (BB is very unfortunately nested at the Mandarin Oriental at Knightsbridge) but it is the service (from the hostess all the way to the sommelier) that seriously kills it. Honestly, the service could not be more clueless, rude and snotty even if they tried hard. So un-DB. (Truth must be said, the guy who looked after us seemed quite pleasant and I was just thinking to myself, he doesn't really fits with the rest of them.)
It might be London, it might be the Mandarin, it might just be the particular night we were here, I'm not sure. To be honest, I'd never come back to find it out considering how many wonderful choices there are in London. What a disappointment.",-1

 Daniel Boulud is pretty much a superstar of the USA dining scene. He can lay claim to being the chef patron of many an acclaimed restaurant and his 3 Michelin starred Daniel in New York (a darling of The New York Times - it has received 4 stars from 3 successive critics no less than 5 times since 1986) was recently ranked 8th in San Pelligrino's World's 50th best restaurants. (The Greedy Diva had a solid but slightly less dazzling experience there in 2008 - which I'm sure has The New York Times thinking twice.) And now Monsieur Boulud has pitched his flag in the heart of London. I had my table booked before you could say ""steak fri..."".
 While M. Boulud was born in Lyon, which plays a heavy influence on the food at hand, Bar Boulud has a swanky, New York feel (the music on it's website says it all).
 Sister to New York's Bar Boulud, the London bistro decor is intended to be a modern interpretation of a wine bar. Elegant, sleek and sexy, there's a zinc bar, oak panelling and wooden floors (intended to be reminiscent of wine barrels), chandeliers, and swathes of red leather (intended to ""conjure the warm depths of a delicious Burgundy"" - the hint was lost on me at the time, but I suppose I get it in hindsight). Overall, the decor is fairly understated - it's not going to bowl you over before you taste anything.
 The classic French bistro menu holds much to allure. We took longer than usual deliberating over so many appealing options - the Boudin Blanc truffled white sausage with mashed potato is calling me, but so is the beetroot with horseradish and hazelnut, the fish soup and the coq au vin. But then what about the signature charcuterie plates from renowned charcutier, Gilles Verot - such as the Lapin de Garrigue - Provencal pulled rabbit, carrot, courgette and herbs terrine? Tempting.
 In the end, we opt for the £20 menu prix fixe (we'll come back again if we like it), before my deliciously oaky Marsanne steals the last shred of my decision making ability (Andre Perret, Marsanne, Vin De Pays Des Collines Rhodaniennes 2007 - £6.50 - absolutely lovely).
 I start with the luxurious rabbit terrine with cornichons and cocktail onions, toasted bread and a hearty mustard. Elegant and wantonly good, the 2 Frenchmen on the table next door have a serve each, then order another to share. Oui.
 The Peanut Gallery starts light, with the Salade de Roquette - rocket salad, garlic confit toast, stewed tomato, tapenade and buffalo mozzarella. Each element is nice enough, although, not surprisingly, there's nothing here to showcase the kitchen's real strengths. TPG is pacing himself. I'm still in some shock over his choice here, but if we're looking for that silver lining, it certainly gives us just one extra excuse to come back for a face to face with the Boudin Blanc. (Can you tell that it's still playing on my mind?).
 It's hard to go past the chance to devour a New York style burger - it's been a while. We both order the DBGB Yankee Burger - a grilled beef patty, iceberg lettuce, tomato, sweet onion, sesame brioche bun, cheese pickle and fries (£13 with cheese on the a la carte menu). In this price bracket, it's got to compete with my beloved burgers at Hawksmoor and Goodman. It does.
 It might be the messiest thing I've eaten for some time (think shredded lettuce in a train wreck), but this baby is the closest thing I've had to that much sought after, but highly elusive, US style burger in London. It's reminiscent of Shake Shake (and this, for me, is a mighty accomplishment). But it's loftier, even if there's a little too much foliage. The meat is loosely packed, moist and sumptuously flavourful and mine at least was perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. Surprisingly, TPG's patty was a little more well done than mine. (But I still didn't share). The accompanying thin cut fries were are good as they looked.
 On the a la carte menu, the Frenchie Burger comes with confit pork belly as well as the beef patty and there's a Piggy Burger with a beef patty and BBQ pulled pork. While these other combos sound tempting, the flavour of the beef can really sing in the classic DBGB Yankee burger.
 Quite satisfied, I could eat no more than 2 scoops of refreshing mint ice-cream and a decadent chocolate sorbet. More could be made of the sugary biscuit in between if they're going to bother at all.
 TPG finished with the Gateau Basque - custard cake with brandied cherries (£6). The cherries packed a strong punch, but the custard cake itself was boring and dry with a hint of orange that didn't succeed in lifting it out of the doldrums. Disappointing.
 Next time, I'll be trying the freshly baked madeleines (£4 - if they're the same ones we had at Daniel, they're divine) or the macaroons (£5) - among other things.
 We finish with a sweet Domain De Trapadis, Rasteau 2007 (£9) (rich, grape juice",1

This is a smart (posh jeans-friendly) French with a New York edge buzzy bar/dining room. Highlights are the perfectly porky piggy burger and a rather sumptuous, smooth coq au vin (£17.50 and worth it), although, there is a dazzling range of equally tempting dishes on the menu.

Since it was Christmas, we had the fix price menu and the whole meal was wonderful.
The service was discreet but swift when you looked up with a question. The plating was beautiful and the taste was top notch. I wold go back to try their regular menu to see if it was as good but loved it overall.",1
french,w6yKAAO7dAW_qqMF_M3Dcw,Bar Boulud,5,"I visited Bar Boulud expecting to have a brunch like i had in the New York restaurant. I had anticipated that the place would have the same menu as in New York (a yelp review being the reason for the expectation) but sadly the London establishment didn't have a brunch menu at all. So my friend and i had to settle for a French lunch.
The place is classy ... you feel the elegance everywhere. One thing i noticed was the extraordinarily high staff to table ratio. We had a reservation for 12 noon when most of the tables were empty. So we did see dozens of staff members just whiling away with apparently nothing to do.
We went for the set menus ... the two course version costs £16 while its £20 for three courses. For the first course both of us had terrine made of leg of lamb. The dish was borderline raw meat, and i am not a big fan of meat that is not well cooked. But this one was great. Minced lamb has always been one of my favourite foods and to have a brilliantly made meat loaf made of it was a great experience.
For the main course i had a tagliatelle pasta with lamb bolognese. I was surprised as i was under the impression that bolognese sauce was invariably made from beef. However this variation proved to be a very good choice. The pasta was excellent. My friend had a dish of chicken breast. The chicken looked dry but was actually quite juicy, and it was served with cubical pieces of bacon. Every dish had been interesting so far ... i was beginning to love this place :)
I had a glass of Greek white wine (my little contribution towards helping them tide over their debt crisis) while my friend was ""persuaded"" to order an expensive red worth £14 per glass (he asked for suggestions ... he deserved what he got). The red was thick, with a strong odour. The white was milder. For dessert, i had a Muscat de Rivesaltes, which was quite good, while my friend went for the chocolate ice-cream (a safe option ... you can't screw up chocolate, can you ?).
Initially i had thought that the portion sizes were small ... but i was wrong, proven by the fact that i was full at the end of the meal.
The service was excellent, right from taking my jacket to returning it. We did finish our lunch quickly, in less than one hour and a half, but unlike some of the other reviewers here, i never felt rushed. With drinks and service, we paid about £37 per head. Based on the location and ambience, i am sure they can charge much more. We did save by going for the set menus, but even a-la-carte wouldn't have cost much more as many of the main courses were priced in the teens.
Another interesting aspect of Bar Boulud was the many options that i found in chicken and lamb. This is a French restaurant which even my parents would like (they don' t eat pork or beef).
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. Next time i plan to try some of the American dishes (mostly burgers and steaks) on the menu. I have all the excuses i need for returning to the 89th best restaurant in the world :)",1

We waited 20 minutes for our mains to arrive, and that was after we complained to the duty manager.

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Not gonna lie. I'm a Gordon Ramsay groupie and the only thing I wanted to accomplish during my London layover was to check off this box. 
ATMOSPHERE:
Intimate, minimalist, no music, no wall decor - aka the 3-Star Michelin formula to make you pay attention to the food and service.
SERVICE:
Flawless - inconspicuous, fluid, comfortable. The manager and sommelier made frequent rounds and were very engaging. We had a very annoying dietary restriction that they accommodated beautifully on the fly. The only bummer was that we were the last table before closing, so we didn't get a kitchen tour, which is fine because the last time I had a tour that late, all you could see was a sparkling clean kitchen and a lonely pastry chef.
FOOD:
The two of us each took one of the tasting menus and shared - the only thing better than having one Gordon Ramsay meal is having two! Only one suckling pig course was overworked and weird, everything else was tasty and we cleaned the plates. Most of the food wasn't knock-my-socks-off-keel-over-delicious, but solid. To me, I'm pretty happy with a meal if I can walk away feeling like one thing was exceptional enough that I will remember it - for us it was the foie gras terrine, absolutely the best terrine I've every had. The sorbets were also killer.
DAMAGE:
2 tasting menus + 1 wine pairing with gratuity automatically added came out to be ~ $700 USD. Considering that the average bill in a 3-Star US Michelin for one person is often more that that, we can't complain.
Overall, an exemplary 3-Star, worth a visit when in London. I will continue to binge-watch Masterchef when the next season comes out.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"In my opinion, the experience of a Three Star Michelin restaurant is comprised of the total experience.  We had the last 2:15 pm lunch seating and enjoyed all but the last 15 minutes of our meal when housekeeping decided it was time to start steaming the tablecloths for the evening service which was to begin in 2.5 hours. My wife asked if they could hold off until we finished but for some reason they would not.  We were moved to the lobby at which time my wife was escorted to the ladies room only to have a male attendant remain in the room.  With that, she was disgusted and left the restaurant and I followed.  
We had the menu Prestige with the wine pairing.  They set the pacing of the meal and everything was perfect until those unfortunate final minutes.
The service was outstanding and the finesse was superb.  We have dined at numerous great restaurants but have never been moved out of the dining room so they could prepare for the next seating.  I did ask for a manager but none was available.  We did not get to enjoy the dessert or the wine pairing for it.  We won't be back.  I would suggest that a manager stay in the establishment until the last service has been completed.

This was my first Three Michelin star restaurant I have dined at and it did not disappoint. This small, intimate restaurant lives up to the hype and will be one of the best experiences you will have. For the price, I believe it is very reasonable for what they charge. Tasting menu with a high profile celebrity chef could easily cost way more than that price they charge.
I suggest planning ahead on this one, it's a very small restaurant with a paced tasting menu. This isn't a place where you will walk up and get a seat. Plan ahead! The experience is awesome and I highly recommend trying to get a table here. The service is excellent and flow of the menu is just right. One piece of advice is to ask for the check, from what I was told USA vs Europe has different etiquette surrounding the check delivery. If you don't ask for it, you may sit awkwardly for a bit.
The food is amazing, this was the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. Everything start to finish was delicious and perfect. They cook at such a high level here, every dish on the menu is something I would order again. The food was so well prepared and lived up to the Michelin accolade, can't get much better than what they offer. I would go back here the first chance I got, wish this one was closer to me.

We had Lemonade parfait and there was a piece of paper towel in my dessert.

I called the manager right away and notified the issue, and he brought us a complimentary dessert which was Manjari chocolate delice and guess what. I had a hair in that dessert this time.. hair stuck inside my dessert.. having issues twice in a row.. haha I couldn't believe it. what a great experience when you pay more than $700 for dinner and wine.. I was very surprised and disappointed at the same time. I immediately notified the issue again to different server (spoke to the oldest waiter.. because I couldn't find the same one)... and he brought a new dessert which I left almost more than a half because I already lost my interest in their food.

Atmosphere here is great and very quite. so many waiters though.. they had almost the same number of waiters as customers. I also didnt understand the purpose of having a ""wine open performance"" - lighting up the candle while opening the wine, etc..
I understand that Gordon Ramsay is a big inspiration to people, but I personally think this is what happen when the main chef is not in the kitchen.. All of staff was very kind. but I am truly sad and disappointed about what happened. I will still love Gordon Ramsay though!",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"We just had a delightful evening.  For us, this type of thing is an annual splurge, not a regular event.  The service was excellent.   Attentive to the max but not in the way.   The courses each arrived seamlessly, and each had distinctive flavors and presentation.   The whole evening had that feeling of being a special evening, just as it should be.   Well done!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,I went for lunch to celebrate my 1 year anniversary. We did the lunch pre-Fixe 3 course and the create your own pre-fixe menu. The food was nicely presented and tasted great. Service was beyond impeccable. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you can get a reservation. Special thanks to Jean-Claude for being so hospitable and friendly!,1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a restaurant where I would travel back to London just to eat here. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a truly pampering experience. From the amazing service to the incredible food. Words cannot experience how wonderful our experience was here. 
Hubby and I visited London a few months ago and while preparing for our trip, one of the first things we did was book a reservation several months in advance for dinner here. You can book your reservation on Opentable. 
On the night of our reservation we hopped into a black cab and off we went to experience a night we will always remember. 
Do you know why I liked it? It is a restaurant is where you can chuck your tie, girls can wear flats, take a bottle to the face, and enjoy heavenly 3 star Michelin food with first class service.....with no judgement. My kind of night. 
Here are some of the highlights of our night : 
* The hilarious bellman/doorman out front who is the worlds best photographer. 
*Ladies, there is a small seat behind your table to place your purse. I loved this little touch of detail and consideration. 
*Intimate elegant dining room with cozy-comfy dining chairs. 
*If you are going with multiple people, have some fun sharing a seasonal menu and prestige menu. Although each experience is exquisite and delectable on its own, it becomes a higher level of complexity and extravagance when combined (in my hubby and I opinion). Especially during white truffle season. The planning of ingredients merged with platting of choice heightens ones senses boosting the excitement of sampling each piece of artwork(dish).  
*Get a bottle, not a glass. Its acceptable/expected to get wine drunk here.
*The great staff and service will keep you laughing and smiling the whole night. Their teamwork also is commendable. No one is ever sitting with a dirty empty plate, empty glass of wine, nor crumbs on the table ever. To pull off this feat in such a tight and small space while also working in sync with the kitchen staff is amazing.  (I probably appreciate and value this more due to the fact that I use to work in the food industry).  
*Heavy fresh shavings from the enormous and fresh white truffle? Yes please! 
*People watching within any restaurant is always fun. For example, here it was fun to watch the different styles of table manners from around the world being used.
*The staff in addition to their professional service are extremely open, friendly, yet chill which I love. They are open to telling you about their background/life and travel/food tasting plans. Its always fun to meet people from around the world and just simply have a quick chat. 
Michelin start restaurants are all about the experience and journey they take you on during your visit. Here, it is enough to make a special trip for another visit, which is what a 3 Michelin star stands for. 
Excellent!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"My second UK three Michelin star experience left me even more impressed than my first in February. From the moment I stepped into the waiting room, I was attended to by a staff member at one point or another throughout the entire night. Michelin says that execution here is flawless and it really is-- I've griped about the waiter bumping into my dining partner's chair throughout the night at Eleven Madison Park and the bizarre music that was played at Alain Ducasse, but the attention to detail given at Gordon Ramsay was unbelievable. The maitre d', Jean Claude, is world class. He memorized my name and addressed me by it every time he came and chatted with me.
For food, I selected the menu prestige option:
 1) Pressed foie gras: Foie gras doesn't really do anything for me regardless of the restaurant, but this course was still extremely pleasant.
2) Ravioli: a single piece was all that was needed. Absolute savory perfection, it's been on the menu for 23 years for a reason
3) Poached Isle of Gigha Halibut. Looks like a pillow of air, and tastes just the same. It melted in my mouth with no bad fishy after taste.
4) Braised, confit and roasted lamb: a selection of five different cuts of lamb, all of which were  the most tender I've had. The confit lamb was unbelievable.
5) Selection of cheeses from the trolley: I selected one of each of the different groupings of cheese, and told my waiter ""the stronger, the better."" He did not disappoint. Their fromagerie is local in the Marylebone district of London
6) Sorbet: I had to work for this one-- my instruction was to crush the liquid nitrogen dried mint in my mortar and pestle bowl, and roll the sorbet around it.
7) Lemon parfait: Simply exquisite, and a perfect finish to this meal
8) Bonus course: I'll leave this one for you to find out on your own ;)
I'll be back to England in February for a visit to the Waterside Inn so I'll have a third of now five (to include Araki's addition to the three star list) to compare then.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Long awaited review! Let me start by commending Monsieur Jean-Claude. Your customer service is impeccable. What a genuine good hearted man you are. Service was definitely what was expected from a three Michelin star restaurant. The food surprised me. Each dish had an individual taste that foreign to my taste buds. I adored how there were so much contrast in each dish that made the flavors pop. Presentation was well put together. The only complaint I would truly say I had was that towards the end, I did feel that timing was a little off. It might be from my slight jet lag, but I was nodding off during the last two courses. Great experience and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great food.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"I won't be posting all pictures as I think they are the same as all recent reviews. So just the two worth noting is one on duck foie gras - excellent crispy on the outside and buttery inside. It was quite heated-warm on the outside but just cold-warm inside. The halibut was superb. Never had it this way. Very soft like sashimi.
 
Pros - when you go to a 3 stars mich resto, you expect your dishes to be superb. Yes you will get superb food.
 
Cons - We were 10min late. And upon arrival, we were advised that we may need to drink our coffee outside at the reception area. Is that how you treat your guest?
 
Tables are really small for two-persons. Need to relocate my glasses everytime when food came.
 
Tables are really crowded as well. The person from the other table next to me was really just right next to me.
 
The dining area is really packed and busy. Waiters and waitresses were walking back and forth non-stops, not serving food tho, just checking on people to see if they were finished or not. Keep on coming up to refill the water even just after one sip. Gosh, so stressed. Not really fine-dinig atmosphere.
 
Waiters were fine. But the waitresses all look so uptight and no smile at all...
 
I think what put together a 3-star resto means more than just the food. Also the atmosphere, services, comfortness. Gordon Ramsay's resto only has quality food. All the other 3 points are lacking. I would just give it a 2-star...",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Had the opportunity to dine in Chef Gordon Ramsey's 3 Michelin Star restaurant while in London. 
The restaurant was surprisingly small, but didn't feel crowded at all.  The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed.  
The service is impeccable from the moment you walk in. 
The food was exquisite to look at and as delicious tasting.  We had the menu prestige and every course was worthy of all three stars.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"This was by far, the most expensive, yet the most amazing gastronomic experience I've ever had in my life. 
With 3 menus to choose from, I did the classic tasting menu to get the full treatment. To make a long story short, each of the items that I had were prepared beautifully (just look at the photos), oh and they all tasted very good to brilliant. 
I was up sold on the truffle pasta special, The fancy ordeal of the truffle shavings and the sauce was great fun at 35 pounds.
What made my bill go so astronomical after it was all said and done (346 pounds but who's counting), was ordering glasses of wine, willy-nilly, not realizing the price or not caring, to be quite honest.
Overall, I was completely satisfied, amazed, and had the best eating experience of my entire life! In fact at the end of the event the maître d' took me into the kitchen to take a look! I loved that. I don't know if he did it out of pity or they normally do that but I loved it. 
Was it worth the cost, no... but would I do it again... yes - but knowing what I know now, I'll be a little more strategic in what I order and thus, more cost-effective.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,1,"My wife and I ate at the restaurant on Monday, November 20th, 2017. We were one of the first tables seated for the evening.
Initially, things were going great. We were greeted nicely, the staff helped us to take off our coats and escorted us to our table. We both ordered the Menu Prestige and asked for the selection of cheeses to be added on.
Then, our experience went downhill. I ordered a wine supplement with my meal. This included five glasses of wine for a price of around £110-130. This price range was specified in the menu. After ordering, one of the servers came up to the table and asked us who is paying for the bill. Then, he opened the menu to the page that listed the price of the wine supplement, and asked us if we are aware of the cost. I was very confused by this - I've never been asked if I was aware of the cost of something I was ordering. It seemed a bit insulting - as if we would not be able to afford the (very reasonable) price. Neither my wife nor I were under-dressed for this occasion of a fancy dinner. I even wore a tie. The service continued to be rather pretentious throughout dinner, as if we were being looked down upon.
On to the food. The initial courses were outstanding - the foie gras, the ravioli, and the poached halibut. Unfortunately, the mains were underwhelming. My wife did not enjoy her roast pigeon and I did not feel that the lamb was anything special - definitely not for a three-star restaurant. The dessert was tasty but not particularly memorable.
The experience of the cheese course was strange. Our server brought a trolley, from which we could make a selection of four. My wife and I asked our server for recommendations and he asked us what cheeses we liked and did not like. We stated that we did not like bleu cheese or similar cheeses. He insisted that we must try it and placed it on our plate against our wishes. We decided not to make a fuss about it.
After eating and having our table cleared, we awkwardly waited around 20 minutes for the bill. Eventually, we got the attention of one of the servers, who did apologize for taking so long with the bill. We felt that given the price we were paying for the experience, such a wait was unwarranted.
When the bill did arrive, we seem to have been overcharged for the selection of cheeses. The price on the menu was £10, but we were charged £18 each. I did not notice until we have left the restaurant, and going back or calling to complain over £16 seemed unnecessary. The lack of attention regarding billing was a bit disappointing. Perhaps the menus need to be updated if the price did, in fact, change. I've uploaded a photo of our bill, along with a screenshot of the menu from the restaurant's website.
Overall, my wife and I were not happy with the experience. We have eaten at three-star and one-star restaurants prior to visiting Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and have had much better experiences at each of them. We did not expect to be so disappointed by Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,2,"Decor:  Kind of small.  Too much white.
Food:  Lots of frothy things.  Ok presentation.   Foie gras portion was too large.  Sorbet at end of meal looked kind of like a turd.
Wine:  not sure how a wine pairing with their tasting menu isn't a standard request...  
Service:  A member of our party had a nut allergy.  They served her a dish with a nut in it.  They said there wasn't a nut in it.  But there was.  She could have died.  Good thing she mushed up stuff under the fish before taking a bite.  Staff didn't really care about how big their fuckup was.  The reason for the fuckup is because:  a) too many people involved and b) they take the weekend off so when Friday night comes around, everyone is already checked out.
Bottom line:  Gordon Ramsey checked out of this place a long time ago to move onto bigger things.",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"It was a good idea to visit this restaurant when we were in London. I visited this restaurant for the first time in 2017 and it became my favorite restaurant in town. It is a great restaurant because there is a good atmosphere and tasty dishes are served. I would recommend this restaurant to people who like good and tasty food. The food was incredible. I had a wonderful plate of Ravioli and I fell in love with this kind of food.Definitely, this is my favorite place !",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"This place is well worth whatever you happen to pay and whatever trouble it might take you to get there (which hopefully, isn't very much- it's easily found).
Service: impeccable. Not hovering, but exceptionally cognizant of what you need. They're attentive & friendly, willing to answer questions.
Food (vegetarian review):  outstanding. And filling. By the 4th course or so, it was getting to the point of uncomfortably full. 
They have a vegetarian menu that has several choices to piece together a 3 course meal. It does not include dessert- it's an add-on.
You can opt to make it a 7 course ('prestige') meal as well, which is pretty much everything on the vegetarian menu (you have to choose between a cheese plate or a soup). It comes with both desserts. 
I'm sure the menu changes, but they did some cool things- I crushed leaves in a mortar w/a pestle as part of dessert, balls of ice cream came out in dry ice, and there were all sorts of crackle-y, crispy things to crunch your way through. 
Dress code: 
Men- no running shoes, Vans or Converse. They'll make you change into a loaner pair, and they might not have your size- my husband had to wear a pair that looked like clown shoes. 
Ladies- jeans are ok. Same as above. I assume guys can wear jeans as well (nice jeans), but not 100% sure. 
At the end of the meal, they'll offer to call you a cab.
Great experience!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Best restaurant ive been to yet.  We truly felt like the entire staff was there to serve our every need.  The food was amazing, but it was the service that truly blew us away.  Made the trek across the Atlantic worth it.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Being one of the most famous chefs in the world, Gordon Ramsay is a must try during my trip to London. While I had high expectations, I was also quite excited to try this restaurant.
Seared foie gras (5/5): this was very well done. the pairing of the flavor with the sauces and the cherry was outstanding. Also because i just LOVE foie gras.
Pigeon (3/5): while I do like pigeons and the skin was crispy and delicious... this dish was way too salty. The saltiness overpowered the taste of the pigeon and the other wonderful ingredients.
Lemon yogurt dessert (4/5): i forgot the exact name of the dessert but it was kind of citrusy with some goat yogurt, if I remember correctly. It was delicious but not something that was spectacular. Though, the presentation was beautiful.
Service was lovely though, and the ambiance top-notch.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"The food: Delicious. Beautiful presentation. My particular favorites: The ravioli. The pigeon (the pigeon was so tender and perfectly flavored). The cheese selection I added onto our menu. 
The service: Awkward? I don't know how to better describe the service experience. They were constantly buzzing around in this tiny room and I just felt like I had no personal space. The servers were also not as eloquent and refined as I expected from a restaurant of this caliber. At one point, a server poured sparkling water in my glass half full of still water...And it was quite clear that the still bottled water was in front of my glass and the sparkling water bottle was in front of my boyfriend's....So that was strange. There was a lot of hovering and a lack of smooth rotation, in my mind. I don't quite know how better to explain it.
I'd of course recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion or visiting London with a desire to have an exemplary fine dining experience. I just was expecting a 10/10 experience.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,My first UK three Michelin star experience! I ordered the prestige tasting menu and everything from start to end was AMAZING. Foie gras was my favorite. For the price- I think its very reasonable for what they charge.,1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,2,"I have eaten at many 3 Michelin resurants and this one just didn't stand out to me. None of the dishes stood out to me and i have to say i was a little disappointed.
Amuse-bouche:
1. Truffle bun: This was delicious
2. Salmon wrapped in seaweed: had something crunchy inside that was so yummy
3. Prosciutto wrap:
Bread:
1. Bacon onion brioche: Yum!! Didn't even bother with the other bread options.
We Ordered:
1. Egg shell filled: Tasted like creamy bacon potato soup inside
2. Pressed Foie Gras: I am not a fan of foie pâté to begin with, but then i found a piece of what looked like string or i'm thinking part of the animal in the pâté i pulled out, which is a big no no for a restaurant of this caliber.
3. Lobster Ravioli
4. Poached Halibut in infused broth
5. Lamb: Confit, braised and roasted. Delicious. My favorite was the lamb confit
6. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup (option instead of cheese trolley)
7. Cheese Plate
8. Muddled freeze dried rose petal with lemon sorbet refresher
9. Coffee Soufflé - perfect
10. Lemonade parfait - very light and delicious
11. Chocolate Hazelnut praline dessert
12. The petits fours - the chocolate brittle was delicious

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Had a difficult time deciding on which Gordon Ramsay restaurant to try in London, but so glad we were able to book a spot at his flagship 3 Michelin star restaurant. This was an dining experience we will never forget and well worth it.
Food and service was superb, not to mention the many complimentary chef surprises. We loved our conversations with Jean Claude the maitre d.  He has a fantastic way of connecting with people and made us feel so warm and welcomed. 
We decided to go.with the 3 course lunch menu and ordered the Buckwheat gnocchi and Dexter beef tartar, followed by the Roast Cornish skate and roast venison and finally finishing off with the custard tart. It's hard to say which was our favorite because they all tasted so fantastic and hard to single out one.
In addition to what we ordered, we were presented with many surprises from the chef that were so delicious that words alone cannot describe what we had. The complexity of the flavors and beauty of the presentation was phenomenal. Hats of to Matt Abe, head chef, which we had the great pleasure of meeting when Jean Claude invited us to a kitchen tour. 
There is a reason this is a 3 Michelin star restaurant and it was well worth it.The food and staff shine here.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"This is one of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in London so I have decided to splash out and try it since I am a foodie.  
This establishment is located in Chelsea and it is quite a walk from the tube station so do plan your journey a bit.  We were lucky to get a table for 2 about 3 weeks before the reservation date as I think there was some cancellation.
The restaurant is actually quite small and very intimate.  I was hoping the atmosphere was going to be quite chilled and relaxed.  However, due to the number of people in the room, everyone was talking away and it is actually quite noisy for a Michelin starred restaurant.  I was here with a friend and not a date so it didn't really bothered me.
The service was beyond perfect and I give them full marks for it.  Very attentive waiters and waitresses and no mistake done.  We are not locals and we could see quite a few tables with foreigners here but everyone was treated with respect and with no attitude.  This is what makes a good restaurant.  
The wine list is extensive.  We asked the sommelier to recommend wines that go well with our courses and all of them were perfectly paired.  If you want to pair it with your 7 courses, it is usually about £100 per person but you may have less and pay less so it really is up to you. 
I am not going to go into details on each of the dishes that I have tried.  I had the seasonal tasting menu and my friend had the prestige tasting menu.  The pictures that I have posted speaks for itself and what you will be expecting from the dishes.  We also tried a bit of each other's food so that we know how the food was compared to other Michelin star restaurants.  
Unfortunately for us, the food I have to say is not up to a 3 Michelin star quality.  Maybe we went in expecting too much from this restaurant but I have been to some 1 & 2 starred restaurants and the flavour and taste of their food did surpass Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.  I believe that the quality and taste of the food is more geared towards a 1 star quality especially for the price that I am paying.  The Prestige menu was priced at £145 and the Seasonal menu was priced at £175.  Of course, the Seasonal menu tasted better than the Prestige menu since it is more expensive.  
I think this is a one in a lifetime experience which I agree as it is after all a 3 Michelin star restaurant from Gordon Ramsay.  However, I don't think I will come back as we came here to give a 3 star a try.  Just not value for money and definitely not a 3 Michelin star I was expecting food wise.  Sorry but I do think you guys can definitely do better on the food.  The rating I have provided reflects the value and also the quality & flavour of the food when compared with other Michelin starred restaurants I have tried.",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Just... wow.  
My tastes usually run a bit cheaper than this, but Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is something to be experienced.  The food is delicious and complicated.  The wine matches perfectly.  And the service is impeccable.  Like, ludicrously impeccable.  Watching the intricate way that the staff members weave around each other to keep the maximum number of people doting on the guests the entire time is almost as much fun as enjoying the meal itself.
This will very likely always be the most expensive meal I have ever eaten, but it was absolutely worth it.  Eating here is the perfect way to explore what real artists can do with food,and with the dining experience.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Three Michelin stars since 2001 huh? 
They definitely deserve it. 
The wine list is extensive and detailed. Have fun with that if you're a connoisseur.
Impeccable service à la russe in an unassuming location, with 3 prix fixe menus to choose from. My cousin and I each had the menu prestige, and made slightly different choices to try to cover as much variety as possible. (see photos)
My favorite dish was the ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon. What really blew me away was the texture of the dish. It was perfectly folded and completely packed full of seafood. 
To keep it short, every dish was cooked exactly as described to perfection. The dishes are influenced by local flavors (you'll see it in the herbs, especially) so it is a good way to become intimate with that cuisine. 
The decor could have used a little help. The wood paneling on the walls makes me think they're getting ready to pack up and close shop. The seating is intimate, and we had a wonderful table right next to the window. 
The service itself from making the reservation to leaving the restaurant was beyond expectation. No detail is too small for their staff.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Believe the reviews, it's wonderful . I was very impressed . Being that it is a Gordon restaurant you would think that it would be exceptional. It is expensive but worth it . All the courses were on point. My mother has not stop talking about her meal.

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Lived up to expectations. The end. 
Just kidding, we had a great meal and experience. The staff, food, wine list and decor are 5 star.  They brought out a small starter to awaken the taste buds which was a truffle mouse in an egg shell.  My first Course was the lobster ravioli which was stuffed with delicious lobster meat and my husband had the homemade pasta dish w a frothy prosciutto sauce. For second course I had the lamb which prepared in a few different ways and my husband has the Red Deer Venison. Both were great...of course my lamb was the best! ;) For dessert we both had the cheese Course which came out on a large cart. It was glorious! We ended with coffee which they bring to everyone with some tasty little treats. 
I was so stuffed!! The wine list was all I could have hoped for too with plenty of Bordeaux to chose from! And they even took us on a tour of the kitchen! 
I highly recommend! Of course as a Michelin star restaurant be ready to pull out your wallet!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Had a lovely meal of late with my partner and our 18 year old son - who had no idea about the experience of which he was to partake. The fare matched or exceeded the finest of our US dining experiences, including the French Laundry. Our son had a huge smile and his camera ready as each impeccably-served course was laid before him, including the apple gratin with caramel sauce for 2, which he polished off all on his own. We were prepared to splurge on a 'prestige' wine and were pleasantly surprised when the sommelier (1 of 3 on duty that night) helped us choose a reasonably priced and delicious Argentinian Carmenere. We typically prefer our meals a bit more rustic, but would count this in our top 3 meals of all time.",1

I have no vocabulary to describe the Suckling pig. Crispy, sweet, the absolute essence of pork. Sublime. The caramelized Tarte Tatin with a glass of chilled Sauterne. It's really beyond words. Wonderful service, subdued atmosphere and not a hint of snobbery. In a class on its own.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer, performance is the perfect description of the dining experience here.  I was really looking forward to this, I've been a Gordon Ramsay fan for a long time and couldn't leave London without experiencing this for myself.  As a matter of fact, I picked the dates for our visit to London based on the time I could get a reservation!
Our reservation was for 6pm, and our plan was to come a little early and start with a cocktail at the bar.  We accomplished this, except Restaurant Gordon Ramsay wasn't open when we arrived, so we found ourselves at Maize Grill also owned by Gordon Ramsay.  That was a great experience too, but back to this review.  
Everything at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is very precise. Every member of staff gives you a great deal of attention. The dining room itself is fairly small, it can't be easy to maneuver around room without running into each other, but they do a flawless job.  They don't quite stand by your table, but they politely guide you through the experience.  There were two sommeliers to make recommendations as well as to serve and explain the wine with each course.  
Even as efficient as the staff is our meal lasted three hours (and I was trying to go slowly!) This is the first Michelin stared restaurant I've ever been to and it sets the bar quite high for any experiences yet to come.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Once we arrived in town we went to our hotel dropped off our bagged and took a Uber straight there.  We had the last reservation time for the afternoon service and you could not tell that it was the end of service.  We were treated like anyone else without any rush or hurry.  Service was excellent and white gloved.  Waiters, waitresses and head of the house was very informative, friendly and very knowledgeable of their food.   We had their seasonal menu.  Presentation of each course was absolutely a work of art! It broke my heart to eat them but once I took the first bite my heart mended and was filled with love and warmth of the chief's hard work.  
Being the last patron in the dinning room, we were invited by the manager to take a tour of the kitchen.  WOW! We were shocked on how many chef's were in there.  From entrees, pastry, and dishware section, it was such a delight to go into the kitchen and to be shown around.  Too bad that we didn't run into Gordon Ramsey but we were told that he does stop by often to cook and run service.  
The experience was a delight and I am truly honored to have eaten here.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Wow.
Honestly, did you expect anything else? The volatile celebrity chef really does know what he's doing when it comes to restaurants. 
Easily the best dinner experience of my life.
Came here on a Monday evening with 2 other acquaintances visiting from Italy. Since we are all from America and only staying in Europe for short time, we figured we might as well treat ourselves to a extremely special dinner. 
The service was wonderful. The sommelier, instinctively telling that we were college students, gave my friends (I don't drink) a cheap but wonderful wine recommendation, which they eagerly accepted. The matire'd, apparently renowned in London for his welcoming nature, greeted us, asked where we were from, and genuinely seemed interested in a trio of kids that didn't seem to belong. 
All three of us got the tasting menu, The food was stunning. Everything was prepared incredibly carefully, and the presentation was a visual masterpiece. We couldn't help but to take pictures of the food, which I feared would make us stand out in a room of the mature and sophisticated. 
It started with a small collection of starters that included scotch eggs. Next camethe pressed Foie Gras, which had a smooth texture and sweet tartness to it due to the green apples.Then we moved onto the Isle of Gigha Halibut, which was presented with this ras el hanout infused broth. The flowers that laid atop the delicate fish were a delightful surprise, both visually and in flavor.
The Ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon is undeniably the star of the show, being one of the signature dishes. Easily the best ravioli I've ever had in my life, I was saddened when it so quickly disappeared off my plate. I eased the pain away by licking the delicious bisque that accompanied it.
Next were the Cotswold lamb, Mango Jasmine and passion fruit soup, Cucumber sorbet (which was used as a palate cleanser), and finally dessert with Lemonade parfait. The Lemonade parfait was truly an incredible way to finish off the meal. It was possibly the most beautifully extravagant concept for a dessert I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The transparent sauce that aligned the plate was especially delicious. 
After our meal, the matire'd actually invited us into the kitchen. We were eager to see Claire and thank her for the meal, but unfortunately she had left by the time we finished. The kitchen trip was a unique experience in its own right, as I have never seen the kitchen of a restaurant before, much less that of a 3-star Michelin one!
Afterwards, our maitre'd bid us farewell, wishing us a good night and safe travels back to our respective homes in the states. I was astonished he actually remembered all of our cities, but in retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised such an impressive man would be in charge of such an incredible restaurant.
It's been a few months since that night, but I still look back upon it with fondness. Hopefully one day I will be able to return to Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and enjoy another unforgettable meal.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Gordon Ramsay is an amazing chef and his restaurants never fail to deliver a fantastic meal regardless of city. Although his restaurant within Trianon Palais Hotel in Paris is my favorite, I absolutely loved dinner here. The lemon parfait dessert was perfect icing on a five star dinner that was creative and full of delicious flavors. Service was five stars and flawless as expected.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"The lobster ravioli and suckling pig are culinary perfection. The ravioli was fresh and meet of the lobster was creamy, sweet, and perfectly cooked. The pig skin was the best I have ever had, ever. To get that texture takes a lot of experience and time. Great great dishes.
The compressed foie gras is complex. The texture and temperature were done perfectly but the dish came out underwhelming in taste and seasoning. With the garnishes it does bring the dish to a different level but I believe the foie gras should be able to stand by itself.
Staff was friendly and attends to the tables well. I had a tour of the kitchen and it's superb as you'd expect.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"I won't go into a lot of detail here, there are legions of other reviews for that.  The key points about my experience:
1.  The food was phenomenal
2. We were treated a little weirdly at times
Here's some detail on point 2: We are American, we are well versed in fine dining.  Does anyone come here who isn't?  You can't exactly walk in off the street or stumble into a reservation...  Anyway, the first weird thing was that we requested the wine pairings.  The pairing isn't like a typical tasting menu where there is a published price, they give you a range because they claim to select wines on a case by case basis after discussing likes and dislikes with you.  That's fine.  The weird thing was that when my husband told a server that we were interested in pairings, she asked us who was hosting the dinner.  We were perplexed, never having been asked that question before, there were only two of us (married couple).  After a painful few moments we discerned that she was asking who would be paying for dinner and then verified that we were okay with the range of prices that had been printed on the menu that we had *just* been perusing.  Yes, we ordered the pairings, we are prepared to pay within the listed price range.  The second weird thing was when we selected our chosen main course.  I ordered the pigeon (or squab as we yanks call it) and the server (I think the GM?) asked if I was fine with it being cooked med. rare.  I said yes, that is fine with me, that is how I prefer it.  It seemed as if he didn't quite believe me and then basically proceeded to try to talk me out of going with the chef's recommendation.  He said ""I don't know, are you sure?  It is served *quite pink*, we can cook it more for you if you prefer...""  I'm not sure what this was about, perhaps they've been burned by too many stupid Americans sending back a beautifully cooked dish to be cooked more?  Or I was just being profiled as a dumb woman who doesn't know anything?  I can't be sure.  Regardless, the squab was perfection and I ate every bite.  Perhaps this gentleman recognized that he'd misjudged us, he gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal, presumably to compensate for his somewhat poor behavior earlier in the meal.
Ultimately, the meal was fantastic, the food was fabulous and the weirdness didn't ruin it, but I thought it was notable, I've never been treated this way in such a highly regarded restaurant before.
Hopefully someone from the restaurant reads this so that they can take the feedback, but I have a feeling that management at establishments such as R GR don't give a hoot about yelp reviews...",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"So we made reservations for two people six months ahead of time as that was how far out they were booked 
I had the Menu Prestige (£145) and my date had the Season Inspiration Menu (£195)- both choices were terrific in their own right. The evening started off with three little sets of complimentary dim sum-like gems from the kitchen. Each bite was exquisite and we saw that no two tables had quite the same complimentary gems to start. Good touch! 
The plates from Menu Prestige are as follows: 
1. Pressed foie gras, green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - This was good but it wasn't as good as the other dishes. 
2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel - This was easily the best savory dish from the whole set. It was just heavenly. 
3. Isle of Gigha halibut, Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth - The prettiest broth I have ever seen - it reminded me of colorful sakura blossoms drifting about on pond water. 
4. Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey, orange and sautéed foie gras (you can opt for the Cotswold lamb if you wanted to) - this was the main dish. They used every part of the pigeon and it was cooked to perfection. 
5. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Simple, wildly fragrant and not too sweet - it was perfect 
6. Green apple sorbet with chamomile and marigold - This dish had the most interesting presentation; you are given a mortar and pestle to pound away (gracefully of course) at the frozen herbs to be eaten with the green apple sorbet. Refreshing!
7. Lemonade parfait, honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet - The most amazing dessert presentation that I have ever seen. The honey had been crystallized to form a perfect centerpiece to complement the yogurt sorbet. 
After we were done with our dinner, we were invited back to see the magic in the kitchen. Amazing service and superior attention to detail from the whole staff. Best dinner experience in London.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I appreciated the elegance of the lunch course, where the light and flavorful sauces really took the main ingredients to the next level.  I like it when chefs exhibit restraint and incorporate elements of authenticity and tradition; it shows true confidence in one's palate.
I was especially impressed with the hospitality by the very professional maitre d'.  We spoke some light French and enjoyed a tour of the kitchen.  Lunch was $285 for two.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"If one is to pay ~300 pp for a meal (that's how much the menu prestige will come to after london tax, tip, water, etc.) then this better dinner better knock your socks off.  I better walk away with something to remember, something deserving of praise, and something that will make me say...i will never be able to make that myself.  Well, the halibut in the lime and rose infused broth is to die for.  I spent a good minute just smelling, starring, and appreciating this work of art.  It was so beautiful, my heart cried a little as I carved into the masterpiece.  But then the joy was restored as a party ensued in my mouth.  Unforgettable. 
My party was the last to leave the restaurant and it was already past midnight, but we didn't feel rushed at all.  If every dinner was like this, I think I would die an extremely happy and round-bodied glutton.
The loss of a star is simply secondary to comparison with other 3 michelin star restaurants I've been to...gotta have some standard of comparison!  But this is like saying Tom Brady is a 4 star QB and Peyton Manning is 5 star QB (heehee...just wanted to stir some waters with that comment :)",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"I had to try out a 3 michelin star restaurant so I picked Gordon Ramsay to be the place. 
{ABOUT}
- Booking: Online, I reserved less than a month in advance and I had no problem 
- Photos are only allowed on your phone (No DSLR's as it bothers the experience of the other patrons) 
- Dress: Smart Dress Code (jackets are preferred, shirt with a collar required for gentlemen, no T-shirts, shorts, sportswear, sneakers or trainers of any kind)
- Cancellation / No Show Fee: £150 /person if you don't cancel within 48 hours - so don't miss it. They will call you a few days ahead to confirm your reservation. 
{ATMOSPHERE}: 3/5 
- A tiny lovely little restaurant. From the outside, it looks so unsuspecting 
- It gets quiet noisy actually as the people fill in
{SERVICE}: 5/5
- One of the best, always someone to be folding your napkin when you go to the restroom or to help you out of the chair. 
- Staff was very welcoming and took the time to explain the menu to us commoners and give recommendations :p 
- They even took out my fish and showed me how it smelled before serving it to me all nicely plated 
{FOOD}: 4/5 ~ Everything was good and plated amazingly, but it was nothing impressive. My family ordered 3 courses off of the a la carte menu (£110 per person). They give you a bunch of entremets in between courses.  
[Appetizers] 
- Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel: Um it seriously looks like a giant wonton and taste like a wonton. I wasn't very impressed with this dish. The server told me it was one of their signature dishes that had been on the menu for 10+ years.
- Pan Fried Sea Scallops: Yum, the sauce was especially lovely. 
- Cornish Brown and King Crab with radishes, kombu, sesame and oyster emulsion: Similar to a crab salad? I kept thinking it looked like a imitation crab salad from a Japanese restaurant. But it tasted way better and was quite delicious
[Entree] 
- Roast Pigeon: Never tried pidgeon before and it was a intriguing experience. It's definitely something to try! I liked it very much and just taste a bit like duck.
- Cotswold Lamb: Definitely worth to get. The meat was so tender and great. 
- Cornish Turbot: Just amazing, the fish was so buttery and just melted in your mouth. They bring out the fish for you to see before they plate it and smelled wonderful.. 
- Filet of sea bass: was alright. 
[Dessert] 
- Souffle: a MUST get. This was the best dessert by far. The souffle was so poofy and tasted absolutely like a cloud. Just stunning. 
- Caramelised tarte Tatin of apples with tahitin vanilla ice cream: Just like a giant apple pie honestly. Two people have to order this but I thought it was too much for me to handle half so I just ended up eating the apples lol. 
- Caramel Milk Chocolate, praline and malt mousse with treacle granola and hazelnut milk: A very beautiful chocolate cake pretty much. Would recommend if you like taking photos of pretty food or chocolate desserts. 
Overall, the experience was quiet pleasant and nothing less expected from a 3 michelin star restaurant. However, I saw nothing special and unique about it.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"For being my very first restaurant in London and first 3 star Michelin restaurant. It. Did. Not. Disappoint.
The whole ""performance"" the waiters put on is just perfection. You can not find service like this in america. From the pulling out your chair, to a brand new glass/silverware with each plate, to sweeping the crumbs off your table because the pig you are. Every single dish I had was an eye opening shock. The combination of flavors were out of this world. I had a very late reservation so I was able to get a mini tour of the kitchen which makes you feel a little important. This place is a must if you're ever in London and are prepared to spend at least 350 pounds on yourself alone. 
treat yo self.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Three Michelin stars does not disappoint!
My husband is a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and so when we were planning our trip to London we had to stop off and eat at one of his restaurants!
We planned the trip very last minute so we were not hopeful of getting a reservation. As everyone says, looks like you have to book months in advance to secure a table, we had weeks lol. I watched the opentable reservations like a hawk and managed to score a last minute lunch reservation for a Thursday!
Make sure you leave ample time to make your reservation as we had to call an uber to get over to the Chelsea area as there was a tube strike occurring. 
We made it on time and were seated at once. The service was impeccable. We were started off with a glass of champagne followed by our choose of butter and breads. There's one with bacon, a pretzel roll, and Irish soda bread. All the breads are delicious so you should have all of them and a lot of them as much as you can!!
Then comes the hard part, what to eat? We were really tempted to try the prestige menu which had 7 courses which is what the restaurant was known for but it was lunch time and we wanted to save room for more snacks and food as we explored London a little more. So we went with the 3 course lunch menu and added on wine pairings for our starters and mains. I had the agnolotti with fresh peas as a starter while my husband went for the steak tartare. My agnolotti pasta was soo good. The flavors were very delicate but had a lot of flavor! My husband looked happy with his steak tartare as well.
For the mains, I ordered the Cornish cod while my husband ordered the poussin. I loved all the flavors of the cod and loved the shiitake mushrooms. The poussin was cooked very well as well.
The funest part was the desserts. Not only were our desserts delicious, we got extra desserts as well! The white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls were served in a tin with dry ice so that was a fun effect! My favorite of the extra dessert with the peanut butter brittle. Soo good.
Yes it's worth the money to come here! The service and food here are all top notch! I'll be watching the dinner reservations on opentable to come back for the prestige menu!!!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"As many have mentioned, the restaurant is elegant with great service but unfortunately I was not super impressed with the food. I think my expectation was too high. 
We got the 7 courses menu. 
Pros: 
I thought the portions were just right. 
Great service! - but with one oops at the end by the biller. For some reason, she was unable to comprehend splitting the bill by 1/3 and 2/3. It took 3 tries to get it right. 
The food overall looked good and tasted decent. 
This was by far the most expensive chef choice I've tried so far likely because the pound is so expensive. For some reason, the food just did have enough wow factor for me. Definitely not bad food though. 
My favorite were the cucumber sorbet mixed in the mint, lemon verbena and burnet salad. Very creative and tasted refreshing. 
We also had:
Foie Gras with green apples, turnips watercress and smoked duck. - well prepared but did not leave a lasting memory in my palate. 
Lobster Ravioli - somewhat bland for my taste. 
Halibut with King Crab and lime, Cauliflower Cous-Cous and Ras el hangout infused broth - The broth compliment the halibut really well. The flavor was fresh. The fish was cook to perfection. The dish was also very pretty. I enjoyed this dish a lot. 
Cotswold Lamb with vegetable  
Bresse pigeon
- both decent but not memorable.
Good one time experience.",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Had the opportunity to come here for Valentine's Day. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the world. Things to take note of is that this restaurant and it's staff/chefs are extremely well trained. The design of the restaurant is simple and elegant, allowing for the service and food to shine.
- The service staff is phenomenal. They are attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable. They seem to make it a priority to anticipate your needs. It is almost as if they can read your mind. Their timing and delivery of service is impeccable.
- The cooks/chefs have food put together and delivered in appropriate time. Every dish was always spot-on, well plated, eye catching, and of course delicious beyond words. Every item we received from the menu had obviously been very well thought out. Flavors worked/melded in a way that accented the ingredients used to develop a symphony of deliciousness. Though I enjoyed every dish, the one item that would consistently bring me back to the UK and this restaurant would definitely be their ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon in a light bisque with lemongrass and chervil velouté. That is bar none, one of the most wonderful things I have ever had. I was literally licking that plate clean. 
In my experience with all the restaurants that I have visited in the world, this is by far one of the front runners and very deserving of it's Michelin stars. The service is a dream and the food is so wonderful that I doubt even the magic of a unicorn and skilled fingers of Santa's elves could possibly make any better. Bravo Mr. Ramsay, bravo.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Life changing dining experience. Staff and food was exceptional. Highly recommend.,1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"Without question, the food here was great. And I say great, not AMAZING the way a three Michelin starred restaurant should be. They say that you should go out of your way and even travel to a country for a three star restaurant, but this food was more on par with the one stars I've been too. In fact, my favorite part of the meal was the dessert, a grapefruit custard with mascarpone sorbet. The main, roast venison, was quite well-prepared but nothing to write home about. It was not impressive. The service, too, was quite rude. My group of 6 was not treated the same as the other clients, as we were obviously half the age as everyone and were from America. We were not seated immediately because our last party member was not there yet, but another group after us was seated immediately even though they said they were waiting for someone as well. What's more, our friend was made to change into leggings from her jeans, which is totally acceptable given their dress code, but then we saw another woman with shorts on who had not been made to change. Additionally, the host kept on asking us if we knew what tartare and venison were and asked us to tell him what it was just to make sure we knew... if we didn't know, would we be there ordering it? Overall quite disappointed by the incongruence between price and taste as well as the rudeness of the service.",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"It was an unbelievable experience ! From the moment you walk in , it feels different ! Everybody is so attentive to you . The food ?

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Being a foodie, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is definitely on my bucket list. Having gone to most of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in the Bay Area (aside from Manresa at the time of writing), I was looking forward to trying out this place on my visit to London. We came during lunch time (they open their reservation MONTHS in advance, and at 4 months before, I was only able to grab lunch spots). Their menu availability is the same for lunch and dinner, in addition to a lunch special menu that they only offer during lunch time. My boyfriend and I went a la carte during our meal. As always, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and I decided to go with the option that lets you try every dessert they have. I didn't realized how big their portion sizes are, so by the time dessert came, I was already way too full. I got the foie gras for appetizer and fish for entree. They're definitely more of a ""traditional"" fine cuisine place. So if you're into traditional French cuisine such as The French Laundry, this is your place. My boyfriend and I prefer more adventurous takes on cuisine (our favorite is Benu in SF), so the food here is a bit boring. But don't get me wrong, the food was amazing and perfectly prepared!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"This was a fantastic dining experience on my recent honeymoon. We booked a table months in advance and it did not disappoint. I will say that the restaurant was smaller than I thought it was.
My husband and I both had the menu prestige. I was wonderfully surprised when my husband actually liked the foie gras! (He tries to be adventurous.) His favorite was the lobster and langosteen ravioli and mine was too. The lemon sorbet dessert was also to die for!
The service here is top notch and I would have expected nothing less. The bathrooms here are unisex, which is unexpected. So the moment you stand up, there's always someone who spots you and walks to you the bathroom. Bread plates were always full and glasses were too. The staff were definitely not sleeping on the job!
Lastly, we got to tour the kitchen! The Matre'D was very nice and brought us in. Great touch to the perfect night!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,Best food even and all the money was worth it I hope it gets the full 5 stars. Also the location was perfect and at the perfect time to go to the restaurant.!! Hope I can go again,1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Gordon Ramsay creates the most unsurpassed French cuisine in London's culinary scene.
For some, the word ""London"" spawns images of famous monuments like Big Ben, the London Eye, and Buckingham Palace. Others imagine the cabbies, fashion, and pub scene. 
But hardly anyone can attest that London is known for delicious food. The statement itself is an oxymoron.
Until you try Gordon Ramsay's in Chelsea.
I have been a huge GR fan since the first season of Hell's Kitchen. Attending a live dinner service is on my bucket list just to try a dollop of his award-winning sauces. And even though Gordon may have his anger management issues on the show, the man can cook. Then I realized, what am I waiting for?? I should just come to him! So I did...
But don't take my word for it. Ask Michelin. Gordon Ramsay is a recipient of three prestigious Michelin Stars, the highest accolade one can receive by the Michelin brothers. 
The Michelin guide began in 1900 as a handy-dandy manual for those traveling within Europe for reliable gas stations, eateries, and service tips. In 1933, it launched its Red Guide that inspected restaurants all around Europe under the highest caliber of secrecy and standards. The inspectors to this day are anonymous (even the parents don't know their line of work), and the secret diners are funded by the Michelin company, not the restaurant. 
The grading scale is 1 to 3 stars: One being good in its category, two being excellent and worth a detour, and three being exceptional and worth a journey in itself. The Michelin grading system has received worldwide respect and to date, less than 100 restaurants around the globe have been bequeathed with the 3-star honor.
With that said, I was beyond excited to try this place. I had booked my reservation at least four months before I set foot in London. Service was spot-on with our waiter epitomizing the perfect blend of cordialness and humor. He grew up in Dijon (France) and was extremely passionate about the menu. My bf and I ordered the Prestige Menu and the Seasonal Inspirations Course. 
Each seven-course dish was impeccably crafted and presented. The poached lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli held remarkable flavor. My foie gras was embedded with the sweet juice of duck confit and pickled pears. The next protein courses were the halibut and suckling pig with crispy skin that I could have nibbled on the entire evening. After the soup, cheese and fruit course, we were pretty stuffed. But lo and behold, the desserts shined brightest for us. 
One was a Milk Chocolate Truffle Tree. This literally was a silver tree stand with truffle-infused chocolates awaiting our degustation delights. Like Ancient Romans plucking grapes off one-by-one, we fed each other these signatures confections with smiles and laughs. The second dessert was a White Chocolate and Strawberry Ice Cream platter on dry ice. As if that wasn't enough, the best was yet to come.
The most memorable part of this experience was being secretly escorted ""behind the scenes"" to the kitchen where all the magic happens. When the manager found out that we had visited all the way from Hawaii, they asked if we'd like to see the chefs at work. Unfortunately, Chef Gordon himself was in New York but Chef Patron Clare Smyth (Chef of the Year winner by UK Food Guide and the only female UK Chef to win 3 Michelin Stars) was leading the team, mastering the finishing touches on every dish sent out. Their kitchen was absolutely spotless, and every member of the kitchen was working harmoniously like instruments perfecting the tunes before it hit the audience's ears.
I still remember the tray of mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup about to be served to the dining room, poised in a champagne flute and glass straw. Chef Clare stopped the waiter and placed a drop of sugar water on the end of each straw to ensure it was perfectly presented in taste and vision. 
This experience took my breath away and we talk about it every so often when we relive our European getaways. I look forward to meeting Chef Gordon in person one day to express my gratitude to him and his staff for a lifetime of delicious memories.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"The easiest five-star given.
The service was impeccable (be forewarned, lots of superlative adjective will be thrown out in this review). From the greetings to the last gesture when we were leaving, the service was not too much or on your face. The maitre d, knowing we were tourist, chatted with us a bit, sharing his story too. It was a nice touch. My glass of water was never empty for more than 8 seconds, it was that attentive. All were professional and friendly, definitely the true definition of dining service. 
The food was too perfect, every single bite was memorable and if only I could keep the sensation in a jar and savor the moment again and again. We ordered the 3 course dinner menu, and let me tell you outright, the amuse bouche were as good, and some were even better than the 3 course menu. My personal favorite is this white egg, potato soup and truffle serve in an egg shell. I did not know it was a potato until I asked (I guess I missed their explanation at the start, probably admiring their accent too much). And also this strawberry ice cream dessert something. 
I had the lobster ravioli for appetizer and it was super juicy and easily be my second favorite. My friend ordered the foie gras. We ordered pigeon and suckling pig for entree and then we opted for the all-dessert menu. I would run out of vocabulary to describe all the food here and will sound repetitive because every description will entail the word ""excellent, perfect, outstanding, impeccable, splendid and unmatched"". 
A true and special dining experience.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,The best dinner I have ever had.  The food was impeccable.  The service was perfect.  The staff were very friendly and always around to make sure your glass was never empty and/or if you needed anything.  It's not a cheap dinner but it is absolutely worth it.  I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in London.,1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a 3 Michelin Starred Restaurant in a quiet area of London. I unfortunately made the same mistake of booking a very late reservation (the only one available a few weeks ago) and sure enough, this was not as great of an overall experience as I'd hoped. Made the same mistake of booking 9:30 PM reservations at three other NYC 3 Michelin Star restaurants (Le Bernadin, Jean Georges and Daniel before it lost a star) and all of them were just OK to me - nothing special whatsoever. You would think that a restaurant is responsible for quality no matter what the time but I'm finding that this just isn't the case consistently. 
When it comes to high end ""French"" restaurants, you hold a very high standard to how every dish is prepared and that the flavors of the courses are that which you only find at that restaurant in the entire world. Other Yelpers had a great experience but again, I'm assuming that the late reservation impacted our total experience completely. 
My girlfriend and I entered and were walked to our table in the very minimalistic yet cozy dining room. Most of the tables were filled but I can presume that since it was already 9:30 PM, some diners already finished their dinner.
You have the option of an a la carte, a traditional Prestige menu or a ""Seasonal Inspiration"" menu. What is cool is that you aren't obligated to order one menu per table so my girlfriend requested the Prestige and I did the Seasonal.
The Seasonal one:
1) Poached Langoustine with caviar and celery - Surprisingly very fishy and did not taste at all fresh. Did not finish.
2) Linguine with black truffle and mushroom - Excellent!!
3) Dover sole - Another fishy flavor unfortunately. Did not finish.
4) Roasted loin of Highland Venison - The gamiest venison I've ever eaten at any Michelin Star restaurant.
5) Vacherin Fondue - So good!!!! A very great flavor on a traditional cheese fondue.
6) Lime Sorbet with shiso and coconut mousse - Pretty good but not memorable
7) Clementine Parfait with orange mint and lemon thyme - Pretty good but not memorable
The Prestige menu:
1) Pressed Foie Gras with green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - Enjoyed
2) Ravioli with lobster, langoustine, salmon, oxalis and wood sorrel - Again felt was fishy but she enjoyed
3) Poached isle of Gigha halibut - Alright but not memorable
4) Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey and blood orange - GAMEY
5) Soup with mango, jasmine and passion fruit - Good
6) Sorbet with green apple, chamomile and marigold - Alright but not memorable
7) Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt - Very good
They ended the meal with pretty cool white chocolates (I believe) that came out in a very smokey box. 
Service was impeccable for sure. The food and experience were just not my taste compared to every other 3 Star around the world - the fish were fishy tasting and the meats were gamey and difficult to cut and eat (not cooked all that well).
Also not a fan that they didn't leave us with any takeaway, not even a takeaway menu of the experience. :( 
DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING LATE NIGHT RESERVATIONS!!",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Easily the best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. 
The whole experience is exactly what you'd expect from a three Michelin star establishment.
The setting is beautiful and with only only 12 or so tables very exclusive so book well ahead. Chef Patron Clare Smythe is absolutely brilliant at the helm, her dishes interesting, delicious and beautifully presented. 
The Maître D' Jean Claude is extremely attentive, knows every dish, and gives you the full explanation upon its arrival. The staff are excellent, always there when you need them, while never hovering or interrupting. All of the staff make you feel extremely welcome. 
Jean Claude asked if we would like to see the kitchen and meet the Chef before we left which we did. Clare was also very welcoming. The kitchen was very well organized, and probably the cleanest I've ever seen.
I had the pressed foie gras, braised confit and roasted Herdwick lamb and Lemon soufflé. The wine selection is excellent and they add nice touches between courses of little complementary tasting dishes from the Chef. One of which after desert and before coffee were handmade ice cream sweets in white chocolate shells served in liquid nitrogen. 
The prices are very reasonable for the experience you get and well worth paying. I'll definitely be back.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,Classic and modern. I've been there for the first time and I loved it. The wine list and the food are exceptional. Next time I would like to taste something good from their vegetarian menu.,1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"Gordon Ramsey was absolutely delightful. Maitre d' Jean Claude immediately came to our table.  He was the perfect host to us and the other diners that was joining me.
I enjoyed every dish  that came out. My favorite dish was the ravioli of lobster But don't get me wrong the service was amazing. I expected a little more for a 3 Michelin star restaurant i will defiantly return",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"It's a very small dining area with about 8-9 small tables at the most. I came in for lunch because all the dinner reservations were booked in advance, but either way, you can still order the 9 course meal during the lunch hours too.
Unfortunately, I had another 9 course meal waiting for me that evening so I just settled with their 3 course lunch menu. It was cheaper too at only  £45. And even with the 3 course meal, it still fills you up. Because you actually get more than 3 courses. It just keeps coming and coming.
I was even entertained by Jean-Claude, the maitre d' of Gordon Ramsay who gave me a book to read while I was waiting for my meal. And he also gave me a tour of the kitchen and got my menu signed by Clare Smith, the head chef of Gordon Ramsay.
I realize now why dinner reservations book up so quick. I really enjoyed my time here and when I come back to London, I'll make it a top priority to come back and this time to try out their ""Menu Prestige."" 
Job well done there, job well done.

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"One expensive meal. Had the menu prestige with all oh chefs original masterpiece.  The sequence on how the food was served was great it really gave good balance. There are dishes that are not that good, but one can only satisfies someone so much.  The king crab halibut was bomb the aroma of the broth that was poured on top of it gave it a very balance feel, I'm not big cooked fish fan...I'm not sure if they cooked the halibut more mushy to blend with the consistency of the king crab. Main course was the lamb served in 5 ways (can be a bit gamey for some) but prepared right in my opinion with the different cuts. Cucumber sorbet was bomb. Overall the service was the best I've had out of all the Michelin star chef choice restaurants. At the end of the meal even visited the kitchen. If only the bill clerk knows her math than I would say the service is as flawless as it can be",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"My wife and I are so lucky to have had this experience.  We had the perfect lunch.  On a scale of 1 to 5, it was a solid 10!
We were greeted warmly and taken to a great table in a relatively small restaurant--and a place they do not strive to turn their tables.
Maitre d' Jean Claude immediately came to our table.  He was the perfect host to us and the other diners at this sold out service.
Head Sommelier Jan was flawless as he helped Nancy select a wine that was just right for her.  She sampled several as he narrowed down to the target wine.  It must have been over the top, as she had 4 glasses of it.
Words cannot describe the seasonal tasting menu prepared by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.  The food was delicious and plated so beautifully.  This was their first day back following a long Christmas holiday.  She and her staff did not miss a beat.
The manager for the front of the house left about 6 months ago and his assistant has been promoted to manager.  He was absolutely delightful and his staff took excellent care of us all day.
On a sad/happy note--Chef Smyth will soon be moving on to captain her own restaurant.  We we fortunate enough to be able to catch her for a brief moment to wish her well and assure her that we would find and support her new endeavor.
Any who follows Chef Ramsay must see how he supports women in their efforts to achieve greatness.  This is a prime example of just that.  I hope Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In organization is taking note and giving credit to this fine man and great mentor.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Michelin Three-Starred, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, London. This is Gordon's very first restaurant opened in 1998. In 2001 it was awarded the three michelin star restaurant. There are two three michelin star in London: 1. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay 2. Fat Duck. This is the only three michelin star restaurant in London at the moment since the ""Fat Duck"" has been closed down for its renovation. Hence booking a spot for lunch or dinner is very difficult for even some celebrities and politicians. This was probably one of the best three michelin star restaurant I have dined. Purely elegant, service was excellent, I would like to dine here again in the future.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Everybody knows it, lovers and haters. In two words, Gordon Ramsay. And this is his flagship restaurant. Here you do not dine out, this is a food experience, this is a culinary trip. You don't get here by chance, and every single dish, every single instant will be stuck in your mind for a long time. But yet, small imperfections caused the lack of the ""top quality seal"" approval (yes we have a seal!) from me and my lovely lady.
As soon as we entered here we got the feeling this was a place like no others. The cure for details is maniacal, from the door to the tables. But here we also started to notice the first issues: the place is quite small, as it should be, but it's rather busy: we were lucky in receiving a table on the wall, but a couple in front of us (really, at less than 1 m with the corridor for waiters in between) was right in the middle of the hall, something completely uncomfortable giving the amount of tables on the wall. It seemed to me they really pushed their capacity over the limit, and that's a serious error.
But as we said, the decor both of the place and on the wall is incredibly refined and classy. Quite minimalistic in the style, it has several little classy touches both me and my lady love. Incredible.
The waiters were nice and warming, very accommodating (even too much perhaps, given that we were on a romantic dinner) and they spoke to us in several languages. But from the other side, some of the waiters lacked in appearance, with a wrong make up messed-up hairs. Something you don't want to find in a three stars restaurant.
But then, let's speak about the main reason we get there, the food! First time we came here, we wanted to try all the classical dishes the restaurant is acclaimed for, so here we go with the tasting menu. We chose a half bottle in order to get something a little bit more special, and we received the service we expected considering the age and the caliber of the wine, candle, decanter and so on.
At first I prepared an awesome review with every single dish carefully described, but the maximum size of 5000 words on yelp is really too much for me. Hence, I just want to speak to you about two dishes, my personal favourite ones.
The first one is a dish I waited for years: ""Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon"". Wow. Already the name is something to blow up your mind, putting together the sweetness of the lobster, the delicacy of the langoustine and the heavy and powerful taste of salmon. And the result is so good it can't be described, you need to taste it. Served with a delicious bisque with sorrel giving that extra citric needle, it's just one of the best things I ever tasted in my life. A dish so delicious they should name a star with its name.
The second one is another famous masterpiece for Gordon Ramsay restaurant: Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth.
Now, let's start from the beginning: presentation is ridiculously perfect: the dish comes with the halibut and the crab on top, and they proceed to serve the broth (at room temperature) all around the halibut (like they do with the bisque and the ravioli). The difference is that the broth is liquid, transparent and with flower petals and the composition of the dish rapidly becomes a painting. A wonderful painting, relaxing and intriguing. And the broth, oh my the broth. Incredible, powerful, with 4 thousands flavor all balanced between each other, it's like a Kandinsky frame on your mouth (yes keep going with art paragons!), you can always feel something different and something new, evolving and moving, but the big picture, the big screen is always appealing and entertaining. This dish alone deserves a dinner here. Full stop. If you don't like such a perfect combination of taste, smell, sight I don't even want to be a friend of yours on yelp. And I'm serious.
It's painful not to speak about every other dish, as every single plate on our table was a piece of art, even the ones we didn't like, but each one had a history and was perfectly concepted and realized. It's amazing.
Unfortunately, as every adventure, we had to end our trip. We started good, we had some initial issues, we had some awesome surprise and we reached home safely. All in all it's a wonderful dining experience, but because of some strange errors I found it does not deserves the 5 stars. Not now, not this time.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Went to Gordon Ramsay to celebrate my birthday. When you make a reservation they take your credit card right away and warn you that they will charge you if you don't show up (100 GBP per person?). 
The service staff is phenomenal, super nice and super attentive all the time (3-michelin star alright). Food was also very good but to be honest I had better in places with fewer michelin starts (Kitchen W8). 
All in all, we had a very pleasant evening but expected more for what we paid.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Went here for one of my most memorable birthdays and thoroughly loved it! The food was very good as was the service. If you're looking to get bottles though, just be careful as some go for well over a thousand quid. I would recommend going with a couple of people so that everyone can try a few different dishes.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I loved Gordon Ramsay, even though I was seated next to a loud Chinese party of ten. If it weren't for the attentive service, that could potentially have ruined my night. The restaurant is very intimate, so you'll see how that could have been distracting. 
I was stuffed by the end of the Seasonal Inspiration Menu. The server was extra generous with the truffles, but I can't say I preferred the overall experience to Petrus, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Try both and see for yourself!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Service at Restaurant Gordon Ramsey was perfection. The dining room is cozy and intimate with an abundance of staff operating a quiet symphony. The maître d' was so friendly and made his rounds multiple times to every table. He even provided a kitchen tour at the end of our meal.
We had dined at another Ramsey restaurant a couple days prior and we were very excited to hear they also were serving the white truffle linguine here. We absolutely loved it at Petrus and could not imagine the dish tasting any better. Somehow the one created here was better!
I am a sucker for souffles and get excited when the flavors are more interesting than chocolate or grand marnier. It was heavenly and had some shredded coconut around the top crust.

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Outstanding in every respect. As we were visiting from the USA, I had made reservations online for the 4 of us and the restaurant called the week before to confirm the time. It was nice to speak someone prior to our arrival and let them know how much we were looking forward to the meal. I knew it was going to be expensive and wondered if it would live up to the expectations and it way exceeded them. Jean-Claude the maître de was phenomenal. The service was impeccable, he regularly checked back on us without being intrusive. The other wait staff were polished and smooth throughout the service.
The food was the best that I have ever had, every course beautifully presented. The taste out of this world, the menu descriptions do not do justice to the taste on your tongue.
At the end we were shown the kitchen; smaller than I expected and was able to thank Claire for a most wonderful experience.
I think it speaks volumes that although Gordon is hardly ever there, his high standards are maintained.
Once in a lifetime experience, wish I could do it again",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"The wife and I managed to secure a booking on very short notice and after a quick trip on the tube and a short walk past the home of the Chelsea Pensioners (fun!), we arrived at the unobtrusive door of Gordon Ramsay. One look at the tiny dining room (with 30 seats, tops) and the large number of servers (about 10, by my count) told us that we would be in for a pampering.
And it was. What a feast for the senses! We both ordered the Menu Prestige prix free menu and a lovely bottle of chinon to go with it (recommended by the friendly sommelier who also suggested that my wife pick up a pair of Hunter wellingtons to make our trip extra-British). 
Every dish was thoughtfully prepared and engaging to all the senses. We were invited to smell the sauces before they were poured. The dishes themselves were works of art and tasted like heaven. Some dishes delved slightly into molecular gastronomy- honey that crunched and bread that literally melted in your mouth. The sight of the squad of waitstaff moving through the dining room with poise and precision fascinated everyone. And the invitation to walk through the kitchen was so thoughtful.
Sure, we blew a good chunk of change on this place, but it was worth every penny. We left excited, full (which always surprises me at places like this), and invigorated.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I was so anticipating this visit as one of the highlights of my London trip that I was worried I would end up disappointed. Not so.
The restaurant's atmosphere was pure understated elegance. I was slightly intimidated walking down the long entrance hallway, but that feeling mostly faded as the friendly staff guided my mom, sister and I past the waiting space and into the single-room dining area. It was surprisingly unassuming, filled with soft beiges and mauves. Throughout the meal the servers were warm, helpful and professional--the only hiccup came when my sister's turbot arrived a bit too early and had to make a brief retreat.
Now for the food. The meal began with three tiny, unexpected hors d'oeuvres: a fluffy little parmesan dumpling (good), a cheesy, crunchy ball topped with salty iberico ham (excellent) and a seaweed-wrapped, sashimi-like cured salmon (excellent). The next surprise item was a bright green ricotta dish, beautifully plated with fresh vegetables (tangy and salty, every bite slightly different).
Then the appetizers: I was a served a single giant lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli, surrounded with a wood sorrel sauce (also bright green). It had a balanced, hearty seafood flavor, and the savory wood sorrel was oddly addictive. My dining partners both had the scallops--I'm not normally a fan, but these were probably the best I've tasted. They came with two sauces: a nice sweet apple-based one and another (even better) that was concentrated with walnut flavor.
Entrees: My sister had the turbot with greens and an unidentified vegetable (sea beet?)--nicely seasoned and meaty, but not really a standout. My mom and I had pork five ways. The chou farci (stuffed cabbage) was my least favorite, salty but otherwise unexciting. (There was also a smidge of applesauce that I tried but mostly avoided.) The sausage was also slightly disappointing, but still well-spiced and quite decent. The loin was elevated by some slightly acidic potatoes and bite of thin, perfectly crisp bacon. The suckling pig was tender and flavorful, accented by sweet bit of pineapple...
...And then there was pork belly. Oh, the pork belly. This razor-thin rectangle of salty, fatty goodness was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The brilliance of it was the contrast in textures: immaculately crispy on the top layer, melt-in-your-mouth tender on the bottom. It came with two preparations of apple--one baked, one fresh and thin-sliced. It was good with them, it was good without them. It was just good.
Another intermission: a sweet, brightly flavored mango-passion fruit beverage that was a lovely pre-dessert palate cleanser. We split our three desserts evenly between us. The peppermint souffle was immensely fluffy--so much so that it was essentially a minty egg foam. A bit strange, but better with the chocolate sorbet (which there should've been more of). The chocolate, praline mousse and granola dish was very nice, possibly the best of the three and a nice mix of sweet and pleasantly bitter. The lemonade parfait was easily the most interesting one, jam-packed with sweet and sour flavor. It came with a beautifully spun honey tuile ring, a creamy sheep's milk sorbet and a tangy bergamot gel.
Finally, three more mini-surprises. The elderflower Turkish delight was an appropriately floral gelatin treat. The thin wafers of chocolate peanut brittle were nothing very unusual, but delicious with a balanced sweet-saltiness. The white-chocolate-dipped morsels of strawberry ice cream, immersed in dry ice fog for maximum effect, were a memorable end to a spectacular dinner.
My meal here was delicious and inventive, with several hits and only a couple of partial misses. I would love to make a return pilgrimage someday and try their even more elaborate ""prestige"" or ""seasonal inspiration"" menus. I'll look back on this dinner with fondness for a long time to come.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,1,"Although the food was exquisite, the service, unfortunately, was not. 
I had lunch at the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant on Nov 4. I showed up and was charged 200 pounds directly to my lunch meal. I understand the importance of no-show fees, but here's what was wrong. 
- 2 people in our party of 4 couldn't come, and my friend had called a week in advance to change the party size (the restaurant requires 48 hrs advance notice)...only, the restaurant didn't actually change our party size. 
- The people who showed up (myself and a friend) were charged 100 pounds/person for the people who didn't show, even though I wasn't liable for the reservation. My friend who couldn't come had made the reservation, and the charge should've gone to the card on file for the reservation (her card).
- Gordon Ramsay restaurant has conflicting ""no-show/cancellation"" policies on their OpenTable home page, their website, OpenTable confirmation email, and information relayed by the restaurant representative. Only the person making the reservation on OpenTable had access to the ""accurate"" policy -- which apparently is that the party size has to be successfully changed. Notifying the restaurant isn't enough.
- Also note, the per person no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch menu is only 65 pounds per person.
During the actual dining experience, the manager stopped by all tables except ours, and I was told to contact the restaurant via email. 
It then took 10+ emails for the manager to admit that Gordon Ramsay should've charged the card on file. Turns out, he didn't charge the card on file because the process is longer and more complicated (he has to go through an account executive at the main office). Regretfully, the manager didn't realize that as he cut some corners on the correct process and charged the fee directly to the meal of people who did show up, my dining experience was negatively affected. I still have yet to receive an apology for the miscommunication from Gordon Ramsay and the way in which the no-show fees were handled. 
  
So here is my sad, but quick tip to you: 
- If your complete party can't make it, order the lunch set menu for the ""invisible people"" in your party. You'll save 35 pounds per person. The no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch set menu is only 65 pounds.",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"The dining experience at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay's London Mother Ship is wonderful, memorable, elegant and unparalleled in service.  The servers are all good looking in their formal attire, and friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and professional to boot!
We chose the 7-course Prestige tasting menu, and along with 2 extra chef ""surprises"", took 3 hours to complete.  The interior is cozy and elegant in dove gray, muted whites and crystal, so it is a soothing place in which to spend lots of time savoring the atmosphere and food presentation.
And it is all about the presentation.  Each dish was uniquely creative, sometimes with surprising ingredient pairings.  Each plate is a visual masterpiece, which led to much speculation about how they actually do it!  Razor thin slices of baby vegetables and roasted shallots dressed the foie gras with amazing grace.  This could be said of every single plate in this menu, which contains many of the restaurant's signature dishes.
But here comes my inner comment:  the food mostly looked  better than it actually tasted.  A small square of poached fish surrounded by delicate flower petals and broth was-- bleh.  A beautiful mousse of egg white, potato and toasted truffle served in an almost-whole egg shell was -- hard to swallow.  It's like deliciousness was sacrificed for artistic merit.  I almost feel like it's The Emperor's New Clothes, where everyone is so busy oooohhing and ahhhhing and being devoted foodies that they have not stopped to taste the food and admit that this was not the best meal they ever had.  
Having said that, I'll run and hide from all the rotten tomatoes that will be thrown at me.  
Signed,
Desperately Seeking Umami",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"The two-hour meal I savored during my first trip to London in early July ranks as the best belated birthday present I have ever received. My father and stepmother treated me to a lunch I will remember for the rest of my life.
The petite dining room features a mere 14 tables, yet it packs enough charm and splendor to fill a big box store. Never attempt to eat here sans a reservation. Secure a spot at least one week in advance just to be safe. My sister, who lives in London, placed a call almost a month prior to our visit.
Gordon Ramsay's posh flagship on Royal Hospital Road employs enough wait staff to allow each member to serve a specific course. Another paramount consideration: This is not a fast-food, dash-in and dash-out establishment. A leisurely, glacial pace of food consumption is essential if you want to appreciate the myriad flavors married by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.
We ordered from the lunch menu and elected for the three-course option, which costs 55 pounds per head. As the five-star rating should indicate, not one pound of the exorbitant bill was wasted.
The extravagant cuisine adventure commenced with a complimentary consomme. The made-from-rich-flavored stock was drinkable, with baby radishes, heirloom tomatoes and chives delicately assembled in the center of the bowl. I did not leave a trace of this delightful opener on the plate.
I opted to start with the roasted quail with soy honey, togorashi, pickled vegetables and herbs. The house-made soy sauce and dijon mustard rim delivered a perfect accompaniment for the two wing cuts of soft roasted bird. I cannot remember enjoying another quail dish more than this.
Next, I selected the roasted rabbit loin with Bayonne ham, salted baked turnips, toasted hazelnuts and pickled mustard seed. The exquisite presentation of this and every other dish served at the restaurant merits museum enshrinement. The many components at work on the wide plate bonded beautifully. The mustard seed and savory sauce enhanced the wonders of each diminutive bite.
Throughout the afternoon, one wait staff member offered three different breads paired with finely sculpted salted and unsalted butter towers. The onion bacon brioche ranked as my favorite.
For my last official course, dessert, I chose the chocolate bars with toasted milk mousse and tonka bean ice cream. As much as I love caramel popcorn, I would not have pictured it as a sinful ally in a gourmet dessert dish. Each bite of popcorn with a splash of the milk mousse was even better than the previous one. The caramel, dark and milk chocolate bars melted in my mouth. You can't buy candy this delectable at a convenience store.
Patrons also receive a complimentary dessert tray with four ice cream balls served in a bowl of steaming dry ice plus two lemon Turkish delights and two chocolate ganache squares.
The championship clincher of this five-star experience: Waiters had eavesdropped on our table during an earlier birthday toast and brought me a sixth course, a miniature but wicked chocolate-hazelnut cake complete with a candle. That they nailed my favorite sweet combination, most often referred to as Nutella or Bacio, has to be the greatest instance of dumb luck ever. Wow!
Wait at least one minute after receiving each dish because servers tend to return in a few moments with extra goodies and garnishes for your selected item.

Undeniably a caricature of his own creation, and perhaps nowhere more than back home in Las Vegas where his most highly regarded restaurant flaunts ""a fury for flavor,"" it was with a cautious sort of optimism that I approached Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and thankfully sparred from any semblance of shtick nearly every moment of my three hour lunch would prove a delight.  Still Ramsay in name but maintaining three stars from Michelin under the direction of Clare Smyth as each of 45 seats are pampered by formal yet friendly service amidst an art deco décor bathed in white it obviously comes as no surprise that a visit to Royal Hospital Road proves a far more elegant experience than fans of the Scottish chef's celebrity might expect and although some may call the cuisine a touch too 'safe' I prefer the term precise, not a single element of the ""Menu Prestige"" out of place as a parade of ornate plates shined bright.  Admittedly not the best way to showcase Chef Smyth's skills yet at the same time far more broad in scope than the shorter prix-fixe it was of several Ramsay signatures that my meal comprised and with courses such as the tender ravioli and delicate halibut every bit deserving of their legendary status served alongside Milliat nectars, a top tier bread program paired to Bordier, plus a cheese cart rich in selections from Antony not a single detail seemed overlooked.  Delving into a few modernist flairs as the meal transitioned to sweets it was only here that I diverged from the ""Prestige"" path and although commanding a £20 premium the Assisette de l'Aubergine was every bit worth the price - a trio of the restaurant's daily desserts paired with an individual portion of the restaurant's signature tarte and capped by a full sized soufflé, itself bearing a £20 tag if ordered a la carte.  Beleaguered by some due to its namesake's antics but every bit worth its celebrated status suffice it to say that whether Chef Ramsay himself has cooked on Hospital Road recently is irrelevant, the kitchen remains in good hands while the front of house flows with an effortless affability far too infrequently seen amongst Europe's mostly highly ranked.",1

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"A real 5 star yelp experience for a 3 Michelin star establishment.
Starting with the friendly welcome from the doorman and the greeting from the staff, we were shown to our table, a snug table in a comfortable, relaxed dining room that was both luxurious and slightly understated which created an exclusive yet completely unstuffy vibe.
We started with champagne, of course, served from a magnum bottle, several varieties on offer in ascending price.
The wine menu weighs as much as an encyclopedia. The sommelier came over to discuss the style of wine we were looking for. Her reco was spot on.
The starter of scallops with apples and walnuts was perfect.
For mains I chose the suckling pig cooked four ways.
Desert choice was chocolate cylinder with ginger mousse.
Each course was perfectly presented and composed with winning taste combinations. I could have been happy with any of the dishes on the menu and making a choice was hard. Fish & seafood seems to be a particular standout here so maybe I should have opted for a fish main course also. The dishes are sophisticated expertly created yet the menu descriptions are straightforward. I like that lack of pretension.
A good variety of interesting of amuse bouches added more excitement between courses and the Maitre D' stopped by for a chat. A nice touch which just added to the overall pleasant and relaxed ambience.
Every member of the staff excelled and the whole meal was so well coordinated it was perfection.
A special dining experience that I would love to repeat again. A key metric for me is value for money but that doesn't mean everything has to be cheap. But expectations are high when the price is high and Gordon Ramsay delivered.",1

Food and service were executed perfectly.  But there was no longer excitement in the dishes.  
I first ate here 15 years ago when Gordon was still cooking in the kitchen, and the 9 course lunch was fantastic.  The food woke me up despite the jet lag after having just arriving in London from California.   I was awed by almost every dish.
The current chef still deliver a superb meal, but flavor and texture of the dishes are very predictable.
Service was perfect.  Wine list was very good as many bottles are reasonably priced.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"Booked a birthday lunch here earlier in July. Despite being a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, this was sadly the most painful 3-Michelin star dining experience I've had in ages, and I'm not referring to the price. The service at Ramsay's was well-balanced and not overly stuffy. Everything about the restaurant was immaculate--elegant and on point. But that was it, it was a bit too sterile and the dining room was not particularly inviting.  
We opted for the Menu Prestige. The only items that stood out for me were the lobster ravioli (which was both nice to look at and had great flavour) and the desserts (which were all very pretty but unpalatable -- it took a great act of will to finish my plate as I did not want to be rude, but hubs didn't even bother and pushed his plate back). The entire meal looked amazing but the focus was too much on presentation and not enough on flavours and textures. So this was a massive disappointment. 
Sadly, we shall not be returning after an unimpressive culinary experience.",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"I came here for my recent birthday dinner and I had a very pleasant evening. The tasting menu that I did was really delicious, and the presentation was superb. I think the presentation was a bit better than the actual food, but hey, I am a picky girl. The service was outstanding, but what really stood out was the wine list. They have a separate champagne list which absolutely excites me. They also had a Salon '99 by the glass. How can you pass on Salon? Overall, it was a beautiful night and I am glad I finally tried it.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"""Who's hosting?""  That's the first question we were asked.  (Turns out, the host is the only person who gets the menu with prices.  Sweet.)
Terrific food and impeccable service. The lunch prix fixe was great.  I loved the small, cozy, elegantly decorated dining room.  Just wished it wasn't 100% tourists (yeah, I'm discriminating against myself) and oh-too-quiet.
Would I come back?  Nah, once is enough, not because of price (I'm willing to spend, baby) but because the meal was very good, just not memorable.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,This place is truly top notch in terms of food and services. We went with the Prestige menu and I opted for the pigeon option whereas my husband did lamb. I loved the pigeon so much better! The pace was great and ambiance was really relaxing.,1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Usually places like this are over-hyped but man, I was so impressed! Everything was   exactly what you'd expect from a 3 Michelin star restaurant: beautiful decor, stellar service, and amazing food. 
Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. We made a reservation for 12PM lunch and half the room was taken up by 12PM (by 12:30PM it was completely booked). It's not a very large space at all so definitely plan ahead.
Sautéed foie graswith roasted veal sweetbreads, carrots, almonds and Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar - California foie gras lovers, this one doesn't disappoint. If you're going to order foie gras here, order this dish and not the other one (per the recommendation of the wait staff)
Fillet of line caught sea bass with cucumber, samphire, steamed charlotte potatoes, 
oyster and caviar sauce - Solid entree but what actually really impressed me about this dish was the sauce. The sauce was so good I had to refrain from licking the plate. Seriously. 
Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet - Beautiful presentation, solid dessert to finish the meal.
It's always hard to describe the items esp when the menu is changing but everything was fantastic. It's not cheap (even for lunch) so be prepared to burn a hole in your wallet but it's a hole worth definitely burning.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Came here on a trip a while back. I'm not used to this level of cooking. Literally put - perfect. I have never seen a better display of craft, ingredient quality, service, and overall atmosphere to this place. 
I did notice the kitchen was somehow really quiet? I don't know how they pulled that off but props to them. I would absolutely return here for pleasure whenever I see myself in London again. Just wow.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Had dinner at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay this past week and it was most definitely the best meal I have ever had in any restaurant!  From our arrival to our departure more than three hours later, everything about our evening was totally perfect.  We were warmly greeted and shown to our table in this beautifully decorated dining room.  Our party chose the 7 course seasonal inspirations tasting menu and everything was so delicious.  We were brought several 'amuse bouche' dishes ahead of our tasting menu and the bread basket was brought round every time there was a new course.  Unsure what wine to choose, I asked the sommelier for advice and he provided excellent suggestions on different wine pairings.  
As each course arrived, there were usually 2 or 3 waiters, serving the food to each of us in unison - so perfectly choreographed!  The Maitre D' was great and came by our table several times for a chat, but was not intrusive at all.  At the end of the meal he invited us to visit the kitchen and we were treated to an amazing sight of the chefs putting together their wonderful creations.  I was surprised at the quiet and calm in the kitchen, with so much concentration - it was not at all noisy as I might have expected. 
During coffee they brought my husband a birthday cake and all of us chocolates - a nice unexpected surprise.  We were also given a copy of the menu signed by the executive chef - this was a lovely memento to bring home with us.
The meal was most definitely the most memorable dining experience of our lives so far and we would return in a heartbeat - they deserve all 3 of their Michelin stars.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Excellent experience, great food, exceptional service.  One of the employees greeted us as we got out of the taxi and led us to the door of the restaurant where another guy was there ready to check in our coats.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected, and it felt very cozy.  The service was exceptional.  May of the staff are there to attend to your every need.  At one point during the dinner, I was getting up to go to the bathroom.  As soon as I moved my chair back slightly to get up, the waiter already anticipated my action and moved the chair back for me.  He proceeded to direct me to the restroom where another staff member was already there holding the door open for me.  They called the taxi for us at the end of the dinner and gave us a tour of the kitchen while waiting for the taxi.
The food is spectacular..as expected for a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  We ordered the prestige menu offering seven courses.  More if you counted the three small appetizers and amuse bouche.  We started with the Foie Gras...very light and flavorful as you eat it with a few small slivers of duck on the side.  The lobster ravioli was excellent.  I wanted more, but knew I had to save room for more courses.  I ordered pigeon for my entree.  Very tender...not as gamy as a quail.  I really enjoyed it.  I also tried the lamb from my sister's plate..also spectacular.  The desserts were my favorite treat.  presented like a piece of art in front of you.
Overall, an excellent experience.  Not to be missed when you are visiting London.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I went here a couple of weeks ago while on vacation with my girlfriend. This restaurant was absolutely amazing. Probably some of the best food I have ever had. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. They always made sure we had what we needed and were constantly refilling our drinks right when we needed them refilled. They knew what to do before I even knew. I was also really nervous as I had never eaten a 3 michelin star restaurant so I didn't want to accidentally do something wrong.
Anyway, I ordered off the lunch menu and got the globe artichoke, rabbit loin, and vanilla parfait. The globe artichoke was probably the best appetizer I have ever had in my life. It was so delicious. Just absolutely amazing. The rabbit loin I had after was also absolutely delicious in every way. One of the best entrees ever.  Cooked perfectly and absolutely amazing in every way.
Then the dessert came and that was OUTSTANDING. Probably the best dessert I have ever had. They poured frozen olive oil on it and I just couldn't believe how good the vanilla parfait was. It was hard for me to believe, even now, that a vanilla parfait could be that good. 
They also had a chicken mousse soup starter and these white chocolate balls with some squares for dessert. All of it was amazing. And for a fancy restaurant the food was actually quite filling. We also were here for a while but it didn't feel like that long as there was always food on my plate or there was about to be food on my plate.
I highly recommend if you can get a reservation to go here. Great restaurant!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"We had a wonderful lunch; everything about it was superb.  The food was delicious, and the presentation beautiful.

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"With three Michelin Stars, Gordon Ramsey's restaurant is simple yet elegant.
Unfortunately, Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsey doesn't work the kitchen anymore, but the Michelin three stars still hold, and the menu continues to feature his signature updated French cuisines.
All in all, a fabulous experience, first class service and wonderful food. Will be back again soon, if I can get a table.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Had to try the tasting menu - the food is darn near perfection.
The wine list is quite overpriced.  
Service is sometimes almost distracting -- I'm guessing 1:1 Server/Diner ratio.  So they're bustling all around, here comes the guy in charge of the spoons ...
I REALLY wanted hear a bellow from the kitchen:  ""You Donkey!  You could have KILLED someone!""  but alas, it was just an almost-perfect dining experience.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"My first Michelin 3 star restaurant as well! :)
Amazing amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing decor.
You have to book months in advance to secure a table. I booked it back in May for my July trip and I was only able to book a lunch :(. They take down your credit card number so if you don't show up or don't cancel within 24 hrs, you get fined 100 pounds--about $162.
I ordered the Menu Prestige, which consists of 7 plates. I highly recommend this menu to sample all of Ramsay's food.
1. Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble - This foie gras had a harder texture and was less buttery than the others I've tried, but still very good.
2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a chervil velouté - DELICIOUS dish!! So good. It was a fatty ravioli with a generous amount of lobster. Sauce was amazing--went together very well.
3.Roasted fillet of line caught turbot with English asparagus and morels - Can't decide if this or the ravioli was my favorite. This fish was delicious! Couldn't taste the sea flavor, which is a definite plus.  So good I forgot to take a picture :(
4. Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of summer vegetables - not a fan of lamb, but if all lamb dishes tasted like this, then I'm sold! Super tender and the vegetables were a good addition.
5.Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice - So GOOD. One of the better creme brulee's I've tasted. the Granny Smith apple juice was unbelievable!!!! BEST apple juice I've tasted. I think all apple juices should be made from Granny Smith Apples. Yum! I might even blend some for myself.
6. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Yum!! This ""soup"" was so good! 
7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm Eton mess with vanilla ice cream wafer - Wasn't a fan of this dessert. :( I dont really like sorberts. But I did like the wafer and the plating was absolutely beautiful.
Bonus: Silver Chocolate Truffle Tree - So unique and so pretty. Fun to pick off of and pop in your mouth.
Bonus #2: White Chocolate Covered Strawberry Balls in Smokey Dry Ice - Again, another unique dish. The smoke coming out of the dry ice was such a cool effect. 
Great experience. Never had such attentive waiters. But of course, this amazing-ness comes with a hefty price tag. My meal amounted to about 136 pounds, which is about $220.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I think this may have been the best meal / service I've ever had.
Memorable items: 
- metallic balls that looked like a piece of art but were so delicious.
- a fruit smoothie with vanilla foam on top and pop rocks!
- a tasty amuse bouche: thin wafer /cone with avocado and prawn inside
- a silver pot brimming with liquid ice, bearing beautiful white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls
- a refreshing jelly-like, square, ""turkish delight"" with fragrant floral hints to it
Service SO amazing, I can't even begin to say how attentive they are to you. Food was so delicious too. AND so beautifully decorated -- from start to finish. (i.e. from their home-made bread, to pop rock desserts)
My ""nicoise"" salad had 27 ingredients in it -- skillfully prepared, delicious, beautiful, fresh and refreshing. What more could you ask for, really??",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Gordon Ramsay was my first Michelin star dining experience in London. Since I've been to many others, I keep rethinking my five-star review, and I think that it really doesn't deserve that fifth star. 
Don't get me wrong. I had a great time. The food was exceptional. It just wasn't memorable. Nothing wowed me. (Check my previous review for my experience there.) It was just lacking something that I had experienced at other three-Michelin star restaurants. I thought it was perhaps those were just exceptional, but now that I've gone to other ones in the UK, I've come to realize that Gordon Ramsay just doesn't hold up to these others.
It still gets four stars though. Mostly because my lovely other half bought me a cooking Masterclass here for my birthday. In case you didn't know, they offer one occasionally. I showed up bright and early at around 9 am where they had pastries and coffee waiting. We then went into the kitchen and prepped a three-course lunch for the next three hours. Then you and a plus one get to eat your three course menu with pretty much unlimited wine. It was fantastic. I had an amazing time learning kitchen skills and hanging out with the sous chef and some of the other chefs at the restaurant. Our meal consisted of salmon and lobster tortellini (similar to the ravioli, but smaller), mini beef wellingtons and a salted caramel chocolate fondant. At the end they give you the menu with the wine pairings and recipes for all the food you've cooked.
Granted it's not cheap, but it makes for one hell of an experience if you know someone who loves to cook. It's quiet and intimate just having a lunch with the people in the class and their plus ones. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. In fact, I would recommend it over actually dining at the restaurant. There are far better places to go have a nice meal, but not many where you can actually help cook it!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"My wife and I came here to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  It was an appropriate restaurant for the occasion and we were treated to excellent and attentive service.  We both had the Seasonal Inspiration menu:
1. Poached Scottish lobster tail with lardo di Colonnata, vegetables à la Grecque and coral vinaigrette
2. 'Carbonara', Iberico ham and four year old parmesan.
3. Assiette of spring vegetables cooked en cocotte with Périgord truffle
4. Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, spiced shoulder sausage, chou farci with crushed potatoes and spring onions
5. Rove des Guarrigues with confit beetroot, toasted amaranth seeds and Manni olive oil
6. Green apple and lime sorbet with shiso, avocado and eucalyptus
7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm 'Eton mess'
All of the dishes were tasty and well-presented.  The highlight for me was the sucking pig dish - you got a sample size of pork done many ways, my favourite part was the crackling.
I also enjoyed the 'carbonara', there were obviously a lot of different cooking techniques which went into this dish, to ensure that the pasta was cooked to the right level and the egg yolk was still runny.  The green apple and lime sorbet was a refreshing dish which came as just the right stage of the dinner: it really hit the spot.
The assiette of spring vegetables just seemed like a plate of nicely cooked vegetables to me, nothing too special about that one.  In the same way, the final course was simply strawberries with meringue.  With application, I'm sure we could find a nice punnet of strawberries ourselves to enjoy at home.
The service was slick and well-practised, however, I sometimes found myself thinking about when the next course was coming, which I hadn't experienced at other 3-star michelin star restaurants.
Overall, an excellent evening, but the minor points noted above contributed to my 4-star rating.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"It's been several months since my meal at Gordon Ramsay, and while many of the  details of that night have escaped me, I'm as certain now as I was that day - this is one of the top restaurants I've experienced, and likely every will.
Everything about GR was perfect, from start to finish.  The food (of course) was amazing.  But the service is what I'll remember, and is the standard that I'll hold any top restaurant to from this day on.  As a tourist in London, I can honestly say that they made me feel completely welcome and taken care of, and I could not have felt more at home if I were in my own dining room.
I have no doubt that years from now, I'll still look back on that night with warm memories, and I look forward to the time that I might once again experience that magic.  Bravo.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I have been there for the first time last November (29th to be specific)- and I remember it with a big smile on my face
It was my partner's birthday and I booked it two weeks in advance (wash chuffed I was able to find a table) 
The fact that you have to enter your credit card details in order to secure the booking was not thrilling and I kept of receiving calls to confirm the booking every day on the week of the booking ( I was not available to answer) 
I expected it to be posh and it was so so posh - it is traditional restaurant when it comes to the setting but everyone around you makes you feel you have to act in a certain way! 
It was the poshest place I have eaten at in my life. 
Having said that I was so relaxed with the service - I have to thank them for making my night- they are friendly, they joke, and they suggest things to do after dinner, they even celebrated my boyfriend's birthday and send a complimentary tiny cake to our table. 
It is a service I can' t forget 
We went for the taster menu and it was divine 
I thought I won't get enough food out of smaller portions but by the fourth course I was full 
Beside the extremely delicious artistically presented dishes, the wine selection is incredible. 
I obviously have nothing to say about Gordon Ramsey Restaurant other than excellent",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,2,"Let me preface this by saying I am very sure we had a fluke experience here.  Something went very, very wrong on our visit that is obviously not the norm. But it was such a dramatic departure from every other Michelin *'d restaurant I've visited that I feel the need to share.  When we travel we choose the restaurants we visit very carefully and after our service fiasco at RGR I really wish we had chosen another place to complement the (exemplary!) Fat Duck on our London trip.  
I also sent the below feedback directly to the restaurant and... received no follow-up.  Not a word.  So this is long, but hey! Now I've got a bone to pick. :)
In the restaurant's online follow-up survey, I chose ""fair"" to describe the service; a more accurate description would have been ""Flawless, followed suddenly by a flip to confusingly terrible.""  After the listed courses on the menu were complete, we were offered coffee (which I accepted and my husband declined) and were told that ""chocolates"" would be forthcoming. The coffee arrived, I drank it, and time passed.  Other tables were continuing to be served.  Eventually my empty cup was taken away and I declined further coffee.  Perplexingly, my husband than received a clean plate in front of him (I did not).  We sat.  More time passed.  We started to think this was a bit awkward but continued to wait and enjoy each other's company.  
Eventually (after about half an hour from when coffee was served) we were offered to see the kitchen, which we accepted.  Upon our return from the kitchen, I saw my place also now also had one of the mysterious plates and we assumed the (alleged) chocolates would arrive shortly.  Adjacent diners finished their meals, left, and the tables had new people seated at them. After another 15 minutes of being ignored entirely by staff we decided it was getting ridiculous.  We actually had to flag down a server and ask what was going on. (!)  
The gentleman who I assume is the front of house came to our table and said that we hadn't pushed our plates away and therefore it was assumed we wanted more coffee?  Which was quite odd, given that we had both explicitly turned down more coffee, and in any case if the plates were coding this no one actually ever came by to offer it to us.  Not to mention the fact that my husband never actually HAD any coffee in the first place.  
We asked about the chocolates he had mentioned earlier, and he said, yes, the white chocolate course.  Pause.  We said we hadn't had it.  He said, ""Yes, with the liquid nitrogen?  The strawberries and white chocolate?""  (As if we would have perhaps forgotten a course with a centerpiece of dry ice?)  We again said that we had not received this course and in fact had been ignored for the last 45 minutes.  He said he would get it and then about five minutes later it finally arrived.  Then we finished, paid, and exited, completely confused by what had just happened.  
At no point did any of the service staff acknowledge that it is completely weird and inappropriate for diners to be left on entirely their own for nearly an hour, without so much as a cursory check-in, certainly at a restaurant with such a reputation for exemplary service.  To be forgotten is one thing; to not have even the slightest acknowledgement of the inconvenience and confusion it created in our evening is quite another thing on top of that.    
We have had the pleasure of dining at many Michelin two- and three-star restaurants, and this was by far the most bizarre service experience we have ever had at an establishment of this calibre.  Unfortunately the experience at the end of our meal soured what would otherwise have been almost a literally perfect evening out.   (On the other hand, it has given us a hilarious story to share with our friends, which we certainly have been.)
 
All in all it was a lovely evening that ended up in bizarro-land, followed by what appeared to be a completely oblivious unawareness from staff that anything was even wrong.  Funny though it is in hindsight it was also really disappointing!",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I can't believe that there is anyone who would give this establishment less than 5 stars. In fact, I don't even think 5 stars does it justice. I feel like either Yelp needs to create a 6th star or I'd have to downgrade all of my other 5 stars to be fair!!! The only possible negative I can think of  is the price, but it was worth every penny for a special occasion and I'd feel lucky to have the opportunity to experience it again!
My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and it couldn't have been better. I have been to a number of 3 michellin star restaurants but this was aboslutely THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE of my life, not only because of the food but because of the service. I often feel uncomfortable with the level of service that goes along with these types of restaurants but they did an excellent job of making our 25-year-old selves feel at home. From the moment you enter, they find out what brings you there and a bit about you. For the rest of the night, every person who served us knew we were from NYC and that it was our anniversary. They had the level of great service without the things that I find to personally be over the top or uncomfortable, e.g. they don't have a person working in the bathroom but they still escorted me to it and opened the door for me when I went. 
The food: UNREAL. We did 3 courses from the a la carte menu with unbelievable wine pairings. I rarely like wine pairings because I'd rather choose wines that I prefer but the wines that the excellent sommelier recommended not only transformed our meals but we also left with a new favorite dessert wine. 
Our menu:
Boyfriend's starter: Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a lemongrass and chervil velouté 
My starter (the BEST foie gras of my life...and I try foie gras pretty much every time its offered): Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, new season rhubarb and blood orange
Boyfriend's entree: Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, homemade sausage, chou farci and braised leg with crushed potatoes and spring onions
My entree: Fillet of line caught sea basswith cucumber, rock samphire, oyster and caviar sauce
Boyfriend's dessert: Smoked chocolate cigar with blood orange and cardamom ice cream
My dessert: Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet
We LOVED everything. They were also incredible about my food allergies. They made dairy substitutes where necessary without compromising the integrity of the dish and where they didn't think they could make substitutes (like the oyster & caviar sauce on my fish) they discussed it with me. In the case of the sauce, we decided together to put the sauce on the side so I could put the amount that I thought was good for me. I wasn't planning on not having dairy on a night like this but it definitely improved my experience to have them working out for me. 
So... definitely go! And definitely make a reservation in advance! It is very small and well spread out so there is not much availability.",1

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"When in London, UK we splurged. Month in advance is required for reservations but I made it 5 months prior, an opportunity i was not going to miss. The Heart of Gordon Ramsay and I was not going to miss to try his food, in his home town. Loved this place. Small, quaint and elegant. As we walked through the doors and sat down at our table we were well taken care of. Three course meal was more than plenty of food, I couldn't have imagine how much food 7 course would have been. Between each course, they would come clean our table from crumbs (very fancy), and each time we had to get up to go to the washroom they walked us to the restroom door and came back to the table to refold our napkin. (very elegant). 
Lobster Ravoli was to die for, I recommend it! It was mouthwatering.
I haven't had a better meal since Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"This was our splurge meal during our London stay and I will tell you this, believe the hype.  Most of us know Gordon Ramsay from his various tv shows and people think he's a prick (myself included) but damn, the man has a tremendous restaurant.  
There were only 13 tables at this table and the waitstaff was very accommodating.  All white decor and people were dressed well.  We went for lunch which has an excellent 3 course menu (coming in at 45 poounds).  Their regular 3 course lunch menu is 90 pounds and they have a tasting menu coming in at 120 poounds.  
I had the 45 pound menu which consisted of an octopus salad with salsa verde, followed by a roasted halibut and dessert.  Everything was so well cooked and delicious.  Presentation was beautiful, service was great and meal was outstanding.  Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had.  Don't go to the other Gordon Ramsay restaurants and just visit this flagship one.  You won't be disappointed.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"While Gordon may not ..the food should exceed your expectations. 
What  one expects from one of those that preaches the ""best"". 
A Michelin 3 star restaurant - that features amazing food and service.
You will have to book months in advance to secure a table.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Superb!!
This was the best restaurant experience I have ever had. Now I understand why Gordon Ramsay cannot stop talking about his Michelin three starred restaurant on TV. 
First, the restaurant itself is quite small. They only had twelve tables set up when we went and amazingly, each night, they only serve one party per table. So, you can take your time enjoying your magnificent meal. The decor is simple with lots of neutral and clean color. 
Their excellent service is what truly makes this place stand out. ALL the staff (I mean there are so many people tending to you. There's your main server, then there's the butter guy, water guy, bread guy, wine guy, truffle guy, open-the-restroom-door-for-you guy, etc.) were so polite and friendly. They were not snobby at all. 
They give complimentary amuse-bouche. One of ours was soft boiled quail eggs wrapped in ham, lightly battered and deep fried (scotch quail eggs). It was perfectly cooked and so cute! 
For the starter, I had the seared scallop with apples and walnuts. Scallops were perfectly cooked and the autumney sauce was not over powering at all but very flavorful. 
All of their main dishes sounded so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our server told me his favorite was the lamb dish, so I went for it. This is how they describe it on the menu, 'Best end of Cotswold lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of autumn vegetables and vitelotte potatoes.' So, it's like a tasting menu of 'best of lambs'! Meat was so tender and it was one of the most beautifully plated dishes I've ever had. 
For dessert, we got the chocolate cylinder and apple tart but they also gave us complimentary white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls, dark chocolate truffles, and rose Turkish delights! We were absolutely well taken care of. 
The highlight of the dinner was definitely the tour of the kitchen! Kitchen was small but spotless. It was so exciting to see all the action! 
All in all, it was one darn awesome night!!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Absolutely perfect.
I have never had a better meal in my life than at Gordon Ramsay's. Our table chose the 7 course tasting meal, and everyone was blown away by the flavors, plating, and creativity of each and every piece. At the table were a vegetarian and a vegan, and were easily accommodated, no problem whatsoever. Special plates were made for them, and were served at the same time as everyone elses. I can't recommend this place enough. Be prepared to pay the large bill for an excellent meal. It will take about 6 hours if you are enjoying yourself, which is fine for the amount of money you are paying. Again, if you get the chance, go here!",1

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"After my mother and I booked our trip to London, we made a reservation at the only Michelin 3-star restaurant in the city.  Two months and various confirmation e-mails and phone calls later, we arrived at this lovely little restaurant on Royal Hospital Road, ready for a treat.
We were the first to arrive and were promptly seated at a little table set in crisp white with a centerpiece of white roses in a silver vase.  The space is small and charming, with good light and an aura that evokes mellow wine in gently clinked glasses.
The service throughout the meal was phenomenal.  The staff:patron ratio was around 1:1, and various polite and friendly gentlemen attended to our table to welcome us, check on us, clear our crumbs, perfume our feet...okay, that last bit didn't happen, but maybe only because we went with the cheapest menu option?  Our primary waiter was wonderful, charismatic and helpful.  He deserved a blue ribbon for unobtrusive small talk.
There were at least five bread options, and we sampled the olive, the baked potato honey, and the rosemary potato.  The best was the rosemary potato, but they were all fresh and yummy with knived dabs from the swirly beehive of yellow butter.  Incidentally, you get a choice of salted and unsalted butter, which I was surprised to note as unusual.
The amuse bouche was a tomato consomme with a cute baby-shrimp-sized curl of langoustine accompanied by peas, fava beans, olive oil, and a teeny black cluster of osetra caviar.  It was mild and refreshing.
We went with the daily lunch menu priced at £45 a head, with three options for appetizers and entrees, and four for dessert including the cheese plate (with a £3 supplement).  Our waiter indicated that should either of us have any dietary restrictions, the kitchen would be more than happy to accommodate us.
I started with the salt cod brandade with Noir de Bigorre ham, poached quail eggs, chargrilled red pepper, olives, and rocket salad.  My mom got the saffron risotto with clams, mussels, langoustines, and tomato, ""paella"" style.  (It was meant to come with chorizo as well, but my mother doesn't eat pork - I know, crazy.)  The brandade was a pleasant blend of pureed cod and potato with a smooth texture enhanced by the meatiness of the fish, great for spreading on the accompanying toasted rosemary crostinis.  The brandade was wrapped in a strip of ham and topped with the quail egg with the veggies and olives nestled on the side.  The olives were excellent on their own and as an accompaniment.  The risotto was beautifully cooked and pretty flavorful, and I imagine it would've been better with chorizo.
For our mains, I opted for the roasted saddle of rabbit with sage, Bayonne ham, trompette de la mort, and stuffed Provencal vegetables, and my mom got the fillet of daurade royale with navet, carrot, radish, baby gem lettuce, and artichokes baurigole.  The rabbit was nice, herb-stuffed and wrapped like my starter in yummy fatty pig.  It came with teeny little rabbit kidneys looking all cute and un-organ-like on the side, along with a wonderful stuffed shallot and a wonderful stuffed cherry tomato.  The sublimely juicy vegetables were the elevating component on this plate.  The daurade royale, a simply cooked sea bream in a light creamy sauce, was elegant if unexciting.
For dessert we went halfsies on the banana parfait with passion fruit and salted caramel ice cream and the lemon meringue and almond tart with fromage frais sorbet.  The parfait was a block of dry icy reconstituted banana coated with dark chocolate, topped with unmemorable ice cream and sitting atop a meager drizzle of passion fruit.  On the whole, it wasn't awful, but I would've preferred a good commercial dessert.  In fact, the texture wasn't too far off from a very frozen Klondike bar.  The tart was much better, a thing of beauty - circular crust topped with gorgeous layers of lemon curd and nestlike meringue stuck with almond slivers, with narrow strands of caramel sauce leading out from the tart base to a perfect ball of sorbet - and quite delicious to boot, a perfect blend of sweet and sour.
After dessert came two splendid extras.  First was a silver tree of spherical silver chocolate truffles.  They were fun to pick off and eat.  The meal ended with strawberry ice cream balls coated with white chocolate, served in a pot smoking with liquid ice.  The ice cream itself was pretty mediocre, but the presentation was so delightful I didn't really care.
Overall, I was happy with my experience at Gordon Ramsay, though I wasn't quite wowed.  Other than the banana parfait, everything was great, but nothing was mind-blowing.  Since the place does have the three stars I suppose I was expecting more, but I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.  The food was solid and the service superb.  I probably won't go back as I live abroad but it's worth a try, especially for £45.",1

Chef Claire is at the top of her game! the food was cooked perfectly and delicious. Make sure to order their soufflé, it's one of the best I've ever had period. The staff put in that extra effort,  such as when the waiter entertained my girlfriend while I was in the men's room. After dinner, we were taken on a tour of the kitchen with a photo op in front of the Gordon Ramsay plaque. Thank you so much to the staff at Gordon Ramsay. Highly recommended!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"The restaurant was on the out skirts of the busy city.  I felt like I was at a little chateau .  Only a hand full of tables and minimal decor.  White table cloths and orchids as decor.  I Liked the style.  
I was greeted immediately by the host with a huge smile!  Everyone welcomed me in as if I'd come home.  The matradee had a great since of humor.  I love when the wait staff has a personality!
My meal was equally as good.  Presentation, quality, and taste were a 10!  I can't wait to experience Restaurant Gordon Ramsay on my next trip to London!",1

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road. This is definitely one from the archives but which I still feel compelled to blog about. Most people either have a positive or negative impression of him. A lot of them commented on his swearing in Hell's Kitchen. I actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show. 
Lately, he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills.
 I came here a while back for the tasting menu. 
 
I especially liked the second canapés. Wafer thin and crispy, it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness. 
Pressed foie gras with Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble
 
Pan fried sea scallops from the Isle of Skye with peas, crispy bacon, quail's eggs, baby gem lettuce
 
Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney, vinaigrette
 
Fillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce, leeks and cep sauce
 
Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit shoulder, ratatouille and thyme jus
 
Roasted pigeon from Bresse with grilled polenta, smoked pork belly and date sauce
 
Selection of cheeses or pre dessert
 
Pineapple soup with toasted coconut and rum
 
Bitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granite
 
I was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course. With all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around London, I think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered. 
I hope to see that from Gordon Ramsay.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"A couple of years ago, I celebrated 5 years with my girlfriend by taking her to restaurant Gordon Ramsay.
The first experience was trying to get a booking: not easy. If you're not a celebrity, you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you'd like to go. You can only book 2 months (or 3, I forget) in advance, and it's so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am. We couldn't get the exact day we wanted, and had to settle for a 10:15pm slot!
Nevertheless, it was a pretty phenomenal experience all around.
The restaurant is just one room, and not more than ten tables or so. It's white, surprisingly (to me) bright, and not that fancy. The focus is on the food.
The menu was full of incredible choices. I don't remember now what each course was, but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite. As with this type of food, portions aren't huge, but there were a few rounds of amouse-bouches (and amusing they were, especially the bacon-and-eggs one) between courses that actually made us full at the end.
While very classy, the serving staff didn't make you feel stupid if you weren't an expert at which utensil to use next. The sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36-page (!) wine list. Some special, recently-obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box, but we declined. Can't say enough about the staff: attentive, upscale, but chatty and helpful.
The price was, obviously, immense. You know what you're getting into when you come here. If you're trying to treat someone, they have two menus, one with prices and one without.
If you can get in, and you've saved your pennies to splurge for (for most of us) a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Gordon Ramsay's delivered for us.
Did my girlfriend enjoy the experience? Well, she's now my wife.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I may be reinventing the wheel here, given the uniformity of the positive reviews, but when you experience something this wonderful and challenging, you feel inclined to sing it from the rooftops.
Truly, this was a standard-setting meal.  Impeccable pacing, interesting, but not fussy food.  Exquisite service, no stuffiness or pretension here.  The restaurant decor is the height of simplicity, all clean lines and white linens, which serve only to highlight the extraordinary, almost-architectural quality of the food. 
My companion and I went with the £90 a la Carte menu.  Like alcohol, I can never resist sweetbreads, so the foie gras and sweetbreads was a must, and was highlighted by the sweetness of the almond velouté (foam - hand spooned onto my plate - of course).  I went with the sea bass for the main course, which was perfectly cut and cooked and absolutely irresistible.  To finish I went with the Granny Smith parfait with blackberry foam, honeycomb, and cider sorbet - which was structured almost like a Mondrian painting, all right angles, but fantastic.
If you have the means, please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an amazing dining experience.  Quite simply, the best I've ever had.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"My first Michelin 3 star outside of the states.
Each establishment I've been to is characterized with an ""experience.""  For example, at Per Se, I felt like I experienced true flavor for the first time in my life.  Gordon Ramsay would be no different.  Recently taking a trip to London, Paris, and Edinburgh for merely a week, my sister and I had our itinerary filled to the rim.  After arriving at 11am and spending the rest of the day seeing the sites London has to offer, our dinner reservations were at 930pm.  Having found a Tube station somewhat nearby (according to the maps), we were on our way.  I must have miscalculated the distance, because the journey from the Tube to the restaurant is no joke (at least 20 minutes), however it might have been exaggerated due to being unfamiliar to the surroundings.  
After a nice stroll through Chelsea, we were warmly welcomed into the small restaurant.  There are only 14 tables, so it's small.  The decor I would label as Earth-toned on white with a contemporary flair.  Customarily there were a couple Amuse Bouche compliments of the chef which were fantastic.  Instantly I was transferred back into my seat at Per Se when I felt like a new born baby whom had just tasted his first morsel of food.  We went for the tastes of the season 7 course menu.  Everything was prepared nicely, with the flavors exploding onto your palate.  Clare Smyth is a marvel hands down.  Our Maitre d' Jean-Claude Breton's charm rivaled only my own.  Of course he noticed my bow tie and his attention to detail was superb.  
The meal is concluded with a plethora of sweets, desserts, and nitrogen concoctions unique to the styling Gordon Ramsay.  You are invited to stay as long as socially permitted at the end of the night, and of course a cab is waiting for you outside.
From the moment you enter to the second you are let off the cab, you are treated with majestic manners fit for a royal for a royal price.  This is fine dining at its most prestige.  I would invite anyone in England to dine here.  Flying out from the states?  Maybe not solely for this reason, but you won't be disappointed.  I'd just take a cab to get there in haste.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"Interesting to see how many of the existing reviews are from Americans (myself being one of them).  I think it's definitely worth trying once - the service is definitely at a completely different level.  How many waiters do you need to serve a table of 4 (apparently 3!)?  The food was really good but at least in my mind, forgettable.  To get a full 5 stars, the food would need to leave an indelible mark in my memory.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"My first Michelin 3 starred experience.  I called about 2 weeks in advanced and was only able to score a 1030 pm table on a weekday.  The wife and I were in town celebrating our 1 year anniversary.  What better place than to go to the place where Gordan Ramsey started it all off.  A decade of 3 Michelin stars is what it advertised on its website.  Truffle season was upon us and they offered a truffle inspired menu.  Our expectations were super high.
The food: 
1st course: Assiette de legumes: braised en cocotte with Perigord truffles.  A pretty good start.  Essentially a variety of vegetables cooked and shaved truffles.  The truffles had a mild flavor to them, very subtle.
2nd: Scottish Langoustine steamed in truffle mousse, linguine and aged parmesan emulsion.  One of my favorites of the night, flavorful and delicate.
3rd: Loin of wild Highland venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear and smoked pork belly. A pretty poor transition from the previous dish.  From light and delicate to heavy and gamey.  The flavors were there but slightly overpowering.
4th: Livarot wrapped in crispy potato with smoked duck, endive and caper salad, truffle sauce: Probably should have been the 3rd course, It was enjoyable but the previous dish kind of took over.
5th: Caramelized blood orange panna cotta: The best panna cotta Ive ever had, period.
6th: White chocolate and hazelnut praline mille feuille:  no wow factor but was decent.
The various amuse bouches were very tasty.  The thing that stood out was the service, probably the best service Ive ever had in a restaurant. The food was good, but not great.  And for spending 500+ dollars for 2 we were expecting more.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Until now, Gary Danko in SF has been my favorite overall spot...until I came to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in London. My girlfriend and I were the first ones in on a Monday night, so it was a bit quiet - but the restaurant (all of the 15 tables or so there) filled up pretty quickly. The service is much better than most of the upscale restaurants in NY - you get attention from virtually every waiter, and they all are quite knowledgeable about the items on the menu. A note - I am not sure what goes for 'dressy' in the UK, but the website (at least when I visited it), strongly implied that a jacket was a good choice for men to wear. And every other guy there was wearing one when we went...so better to be overdressed than underdressed, right?
We both got the 7-course tasting menu (unless you feel strongly about ordering your own dishes or don't want to shell , do this), which was absolutely delicious. First was a roll with lobster, langoustine, and avocado - absolutely a perfect match of a slightly heavier veggie with small, fresh pieces of tender seafood. Also served on the house were soft-boiled quail eggs that were lightly fried on the outside (they have a richer flavor than the regular eggs from the grocery store) and a cracker with salami inside (tasty!). The amuse bouche was langoustine in a tomato consumme, which was probably one of the more unremarkable dishes of the night (but was still very delicious).
The main course - fantastic. You get started off with pressed foie gras topped with jelly. I've had foie gras pate before that I was not a fan of, but this was out of this world. The combination with the peach had all the flavors working amazingly together...wow. Second course was seafood ravioli (lobster and langoustine). As with all of the dishes, they aren't large, but you savor each bite, and this tasted great, particularly with the sauce that was added by the waiters (note: the waiters added some kind of sauce, for both food presentation and taste, for almost every dish). The turbot, a fish I don't think I've had before (at least by this name) was delicious - a meatier fish that had 'chicken juice' poured on top that really accentuated the texture of the plate. My only mistake of the meal was ordering the pigeon (hopefully not the ones frequenting the city streets) instead of the lamb, which my girlfriend got. The pigeon was good - very smoky flavor - but the meat was a bit tougher than I would have liked. The lamb was outstanding from the bites I had, and I would recommend it if you're going to do the menu. The cheese selection (I don't know much about cheese, so I let the waiter pick a selection of 5) was delicious but a bit big if you're parsimonious on the cracker-to-cheese ratio: the waiters came around and asked me a few times if i was done. The creme brulee (my girlfriend's selection) was very light, but the highlight is the shot of apple juice (or smoothie, perhaps more appropriately) that adds a blast of fruitiness to the dessert. The mango/passion fruit with whip cream is a nice refresher, but is a little small to warrant being an entire course. The last dessert was delicious, but since I was too far in food heaven by this point, I forget right off what it was (aside from having delicious fruit sorbet in it).
Since it was my girlfriend's birthday, we also got 3 more desserts - a box with pieces of pure chocolate ganache (so rich and so freakin' good...blows away the chocolate shops that sell individual pieces), pieces of Turkish Delight (the weakest link of the extra desserts, but still very good), and pieces of strawberry ice cream covered with frozen chocolate (like a bite-sized ice cream bar, except way better) that was frozen with dry ice...freakin' awesome.
This put a hurtin' on the wallet (the US conversion came out to $500), but you have to have a food experience like this at least once in your life. Now I know what 3 Michelin stars tastes like...it tastes delicious and is full of epic win.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"On our trip we sampled the cuisines of Joel Robuchon, the Ledbury, Maze, Hélèn Darroze, Alain Ducasse, Lucas Carton, Pierre Gagnaire and Gordon Ramsey's Hospital Rd restaurant. The food at his restaurant was truly exceptional and, up until the end of the meal, the service excellent. However, at the end of the meal a young lady of Asian features with red painted nails brought the card reader for us to pay our bill. She stared into my guest's eyes for several moments, shrugged her eyebrows and broke into a seemingly contrived long laugh. This terribly rude behavior made my guest extremely uncomfortable and sadly became her most vivid recollection of our dinner at Gordon Ramsey's flagship restaurant! For that reason I have only given the restaurant four stars and that may be generous.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,4,"We took the opportunity of being in London to try this highly rated restaurant of Gordon Ramsay. Having tried other 3 michelin star restaurants in New York such as Daniel and George, we had pretty high expectations for our visit. First the 5 star good: service was impeccable, staff were both knowledgable and organized with great attention to detail. Food was amazing though we thought the quality had been better in other 3 michelin restaurants though those had been dinners and tasting menus. The four stars: we thought the ambience was a tad of a disappointment, i.e we had expected some more privacy and exclusivity than being in a dining hall which was a little awkward when food takes time to prepare and you are trying to focus on having a good conversation with your date. Price wise we thought as well that it was a little high for the overall lunch experience vs a tasting menu even dinner at other three michelin star restaurants in New York.",1

The food was amazing, the service was flawless, and the atmosphere romantic and comfortable. At the end of the evening, we asked for a list of the wines that were paired with our meals, and by the time we arrived back in the US an email with everyone had arrived. (Thank you Sharon!)

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"I have really wanted to go here for quite some time.  I'll admit it, his celebrity fame brought my attention to the restaurant but let's be honest... that's how most of us found out about this guy.
I booked what I thought was plenty ahead of time, but realized there were very few choices left.  It seems to me that they only book one per table a night, but you get to choose the time.  My friend and I were in the first time slot at 6:30, but many guests were already seated when we arrived.  The entire experience takes a good 2+ hours so plan for that.  There are about ten or twelve tables in a room that was much smaller than I thought.  The decor is really nice.  Not overwhelming and inviting.
The staff is pretty ridiculous.  I think we sifted through at LEAST 12 different people while we were there.  Not a single dedicated waiter, and everyone took turns refilling water.  (you will be lucky if you get past a couple centimeters without a refill.  But the staff is incredibly friendly and not annoying at all.  They do leave you alone during your meal but are very attentive and can smell the slightest bit of concern and are willing to fulfill your needs.  Only one of the staff members bothered me.  He seemed like a French pretentious high class hipster or something, but in a funny way.  Another staff member looked like the muscle straight out of Russia in case anything went awry, he was cool.  Overall, very friendly and courteous staff.
The food... without a doubt the best I've ever had.  Three stars isn't kidding around.  I had a three course meal.  Scallops, lamb, and souffle.  We were given two separate starters, some sort of hors d'oeuvre finger foods that were amazing, followed by some sort of tomato based soup, but not like you think.  The broth was clear and served with some baby vegetables and prawns I believe.  Very small, just a taste.  The scallops were so good, I could eat that as my meal.  Best I've ever had.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing.  I had a bite of my friend's beef, and I thought it was better than the lamb, but now I'm being picky.  Both were delicious.  Before dessert we were given these mango coolies of some kind with glass straws.  Very refreshing.  The souffle I had, the only one I ever had, was of the banana variety and INCREDIBLE.  I'm not a dessert man at all, but it was freaking GOOD!  Then some finger sweets like Turkish delights and chocolates at the end.  So if I'm not forgetting anything, it's basically seven ""courses"" ... the portions may seem small upon appearance, but when you are finished with everything you leave perfectly satisfied.
I'd recommend this to everyone, but the price tag is no joke.  90 quid each for the a la carte.  Yikes.",1

It's recently been refurbished, and for thee Michelin stars it's far from stuffy.  We were eating from the three course lunch menu, but even so we were offered a fantastic pre-starter of pea and mint infused ricotta with edible flowers. It was so light and fluffy you would barely know it was cheese.  I then had the warm summer vegetable salad, and my husband the smoked mackerel salad.  We both opted for the roast cod, which was perfectly cooked, slightly translucent still in the middle.  I had the roast pineapple with coconut sorbet, which was superb.  My husband opted for the safety of the cheeseboard.  After the meal we were offered elderflower jellies, flash frozen white chocolate and strawberry, and peanut brittle dark chocolate.

Seriously though, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is amazing. The food was nearly perfect as my hot date (and generous patron) and I had the scallops, foie gras, sea bass and duck. All rated among the finest I've ever sampled - I doubt you could go wrong anywhere on the menu.
This may sound weird, but the service was really the highlight for me. The pacing of the meal and the knowledge of the staff complemented the food, drink and slick atmosphere. There's nothing worse than going for a posh meal and having it ruined by an uninformed, oversolicitous or inattentive waiter. After a quick tour of the kitchen we did have a bit of awkward interaction with the front of the house in getting them to bring us the bill, but any slight annoyance was forgotten with a sculpture of chocolate truffles.

When I was here, we got the tasting menu, which is basically around seven courses of small portions, chosen by the chef. I managed to annoy everyone by flaunting my vegetarianism, and thus meaning I had a little menu of my own. But hey, why even be vegetarian if it doesn't annoy someone?
The food was AMAZING. Just perfect. The ingredients, the presentation, the taste, everything was just fantastic. The service was exceptional, but that may well be because we'd ordered the tasting menu, and were thus something of a priority. The wine list was fantastic, as was the pre-seating bar, and I must admit that I was GOOD and drunk by the time the later courses rolled around. 
The friendliness of the staff is also note worthy. We were allowed into the kitchen to watch the chefs at work, were given the time to have a quick chat with the head chef, and I was given a French cookbook I'd been reading in the bar simply because I asked where I could buy it from. The head chef also signed the inside of the book.

It's a beautiful restaurant with only 14 tables, so very intimate. Everyone serves everyone. They not only serve, they chat. They constantly circle the room. It's almost dizzying if it weren't so phenomenal and well orchestrated and personal.
The first thing, a man walked up with what looked like a lidded cigar box. It had a couple of truffles in it, and he showed it to us and let us smell them. This was their ""feature"" item of the night. Then another man came and chatted with us. He asked what made us choose to visit and I said it was the highlight of my trip; and that I booked it because I watch all the Ramsay shows and this was to treat myself. 
I got the 7-course tasting menu. There were more than 7 courses though because they served up all sorts of extra surprises. My daughter decided to have the 3-course menu, which meant she got full-sized servings, but also many of my surprises. Hers actually cost more than mine because she got the pasta special with shaved truffle on top and I misunderstood: It wasn't 40 pounds for the entrée...it was 40 pounds extra just for the truffle shavings on top of the pasta entrée! Oh my! Good news is that she loved it. Bad news is, the whole dinner cost ~$500 US dollars. Still, it exceeded my expectations.
One woman came back throughout the evening with a tray of fresh bread slices of about 5 varieties: Wheat, white, olive, rosemary, etc. They asked if you wanted salted or unsalted butter and then proceeded to put a super soft, perfectly round ball of said butter on a slate slab on our table.
I am not remembering it all, but I wrote down what I could remember as soon as we got back to our hotel. It was something like this:
1. Surprise x3 for both of us: A plate with 3 mini appetizers on it. 
     a. Crab and avocado filling in a mini cone
     b. Mini quail Scottish egg
     c. Cracker with prosciutto or some sort of nice salami in it
2. Amouse bouche (spelling catastrophe): Duck and parmesan fried ball in chestnut soup.
3. Veal sweetbreads and sauteed foie grois (to die for!)
4. Some white bean and Scottish mini mushrooms with Cornish turbot (white fish)
5. Lobster, salmon and langoustine ravioli (this was my daughter's appetizer, so she got an extra large version and it was one of my 7 courses, so I got a slightly smaller version)
6. My main dish: Cotswold lamb and veggies (I forget the details). My daughter's main dish: Pasta with truffle!
7. My dessert: Some special Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice. Yummy! My daughter got an assortment of ice creams and sorbet. They came as small scoops on top of a brick of ice. It was impressive but the photo does it no justice.
8. Extra: We both then got mango smoothies as palette cleansers
9. Surprise for both of us:
     a. Strawberry ice cream bon bons with white chocolate coating on dry ice
     b. Chocolate truffle bites
     c. Lavender gelatin squares (this was the only thing that wasn't too tasty)
So when all that was said and done, one of the waiters came over and asked me if I'd like to see the kitchen since they had filmed back there before and he thought I might enjoy seeing the inner workings of their kitchen! Totally cool. So he escorted me and my daughter back to the kitchen where we met the executive chefs and they showed us all the stations and explained how they operated. It was spectacular. The whole evening exceeded all my expectations! 
One for the memory books for sure...",1

Food and service in an intimate setting are amazing.
Wine list is superb and the sommelier so knew his stuff.
It isn't cheap but who cares?
Ask to be taken into the kitchen!!!!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"When I think of a perfect dinner the first place that comes to my mind is this restaurant. From the very moment we entered this place we were greeted and our coats taken. We were seated promptly, just taking the atmosphere was a treat as well. We both ordered our appetizers and were gobsmacked by the level of perfection. I had the quail and my date had the artichoke to start off  perfectly cooked and at a temperature that made me forget it was just cooked! The main course was decadent I having the pork and my date had the chicken I think (I don't remember hers exactly). I had a Portugese wine accompanying the main course which was superb as well. Finally the dessert came I had a cheese cart and my date had the Belgian chocolates. We were disappointed to even go it felt like a passing dream we wanted more of. The cost was high a whopping 183 pounds but well worth it, to this day I still keep the receipt in my wallet to remind me of how superb service should be! Next time I am in London I will definitely be coming back here for another round!",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"The partner & I love this place -- we go for his birthday, my birthday, our anniversary... and any other occasion we drum up for a treat to ourselves from time to time.
 On a slightly negative note, let me just say that none of the other GR restaurants in London compare. I find Claridges particularly disappointing.
 Everything I have to say about the RHRoad restaurant is highly complimentary. J-C is incredible -- he could sell me a worn shoe for a main course and I would devour it eagerly. The man is charm incarnate. There appears to be some turnover in other staff, but overall the service is irreproachable. The ambience is muted and unimposing.
 The seafood ravioli is to die for. For the mains, we tend to order the beef or ox cheeks whenever available. Note the restaurant is extremely accomodating on the tasting menu -- we were there a few weeks ago, made two substitutions and the waiter did not bat an eye.
 And how can anyone not love a restaurant that serves trees of chocolate balls and strawberry ice cream in dry ice???",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Phenomenal, outstanding, incredible.
 That could be all of my review, but I will expand :)
 This is the 3 Michelin star Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Therefore, I cannot stress enough how incredibly good the food is.
 A 3 Michelin star experience is something I would recommend to anyone for a special occassion. Most people go to this type of restaurant for an anniversary or a special birthday, etc.
 From beginning to end the experience was unique. The maitre was a French man that made us feel comfortable and was attentive to our every need, like all the waiters and waitresses. If anything, there was one French waiter that had a very strong accent and I could not really understand. That was the only 'negative' thing I could highlight of the night :)
 There are different menus to choose from and we chose the £90 for 3 course menu. To start with, they brought some small appetizers for us to try that were not part of the menu, and then we continued with the 3 courses, all of this accompanied with gorgeous different breads and some wine.
 Then we were taken to the kitchen and were introduced to the head chef and could see how all the chefs were preparing the dishes. That was very special indeed.
 Finally, we were taken to a small and romantic table outside the reception area where we were given some white chocolate truffles to finish the night in style.
 I can positively say that this is the best restaurant experience I have ever had and it was worth every penny.
 I will be back, hopefully!",1

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"This place is stunning and a must do.
Bring a credit card with a very healthy limit!  I used the online booking system...and typically, only 1700 or 2130 were available.  Service is impeccable starting from when they greet you at the door by name.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the food, its preparation, and are more than willing to make recommendations that are spot on.
You have a choice between three courses for 90 pounds, Menu Prestige 6-7 courses (depending how you look at it) for 120 pounds, or their Truffle Inspiration seasonal special of five courses for 175 pounds.  I chose the three courses and a special starter for that night...which was duck breast I think in puff pastry...but forget about that and go right for the fois gras--OMG...I know it's not politically correct to like fois gras these days, but this was probably the best slice that I've had.  It melted in your mouth.  The sommelier had recommended a glass of German pinot noir (Ziereisen) which was surprisingly exceptional...who knew?!?!  For the main, I chose the loin of wild Highland Venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear, and smoked pork belly.  Divine!  The third course is dessert...and yet, after dessert, they bring out all these little treats that others have mentioned.  You almost don't really need to order dessert.  All totaled, I spent 170 pounds.  C'est la vie!!!!  
What sets this place apart is the attention to detail.  The sommelier wrote out each of the wines I had had and placed in an evelope for me to take with me.  Since the receipt only said, ""A La Carte"", I asked for someone to write out what I had had for each course so that I could remember it later.  They presented me with a very nice copy of their take away menu that they had the head chef sign.  Impressive and suitable for framing. 
A wonderful experience and I can't think of anything they could have done better.",1

The food, the drinks, the dessert, the service, everything. You really have to be there to know what I mean. Honestly, after eating here, no service will ever be food enough. There are probably just as many waiters and waitresses as the number of people dining there. 
Though it may seem pricey, it really was worth it. 
Everything was served beautifully, and the waiters were very knowledgeable. They were able to give explanations and descriptions of each dish. 
Just when you thought you were done, the dessert just blows your mind. We got assiette de l'aubergine (every dessert  for two). AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL! I loved loved lovedddd the Soufflet. IT WAS SO GOOD! But I mean, everything was good. 
I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Probably not a huge group (because the bill would scare you) but it was one amazing experience. Too bad I forgot to tour the kitchen.. I forgot to... but this is somewhere you must eat if you're in London.",1

Not only was the meal itself to die for, but the staff was exceptional and they oversaw our every culinary need.  My husband and I often suffer when it comes to service when we dine at finer establishments since we are on the younger side (i.e. mid-twenties); but, that was NOT the case here- the staff was so friendly and welcoming.  We can't wait to return for another meal.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"my friend and i are doing 5 michelin star restaurants in one week because we are spoiled kids. this is restaurant #4/5.
when i tasted the pork belly, i think i just made an incoherent sound like 'hukk!!' which translated means, this is the best pork i've ever had. it was brilliant. definitely five stars on yelp, definitely 10 years of 3 star michelin rating deserved.
service was good of course- especially when i asked for madeleines on a course thing i didn't order (but was willing to pay extra for them) they just said they will bring them out, and they were baked fresh, and were the best madeleines ever. 
the dessert- banana parfait was not really my thing. of course delicious, but not as good as i expected. loved the surprises between and after courses ;) i'll leave that as a surprise.
alain ducasse, i felt more pampered but the main course was better here. it also came out to be more expensive,since no wine, water, or tea included in teh menu so we were surprised to be charged all those things.",1

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"We went here on our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience. The service was truly amazing. The entire staff seems to look out for all the tables (rather than just having one server per table) and as a result you are constantly looked after but not interrupted. Because they do a staggered seating (no two tables are being seated at the same time), you are on a different cycle than the other guests dining which makes it feel like you're the most important guest when you arrive, order, and leave. The dining room is intimate and beautiful. I had the scallops to start, and it was my favorite course.  We also thought that for a 3 star Michelin, it was reasonably priced. We look forward to returning.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"My friend Mark is a Gordon Ramsay fanatic, and as he is a bachelor and his mortgage is only £320 a month (for a 2 bedroom house) he can afford to occasionally splash out on places like this. It was great.
We were surrounded by a swarm of different waiters from the get-go, and it was a bit intimidating at first, since we'd booked for lunch (cheaper and available) and we were the first in. The maitre-d' took very good care of us. We were offered champagne, which we astutely declined, since it would have cost £12 a glass. My friend got the only menu with prices in, so we quickly skimmed to the back where the £45 lunch menu was. I chose the three Rs: Risotto, Rabbit and Rum-Baba. I selected an English white wine at £28 a bottle, but was told it was unavailable. That suited me, since there was a cheaper wine we had been too snobby to select, so we had that instead (£22 a bottle.) This was cheaper than ordering by the glass and compares favourably to pub prices. The wine was stored in a chilled bucket and was absolutely delicious. Difficult to see how a more expensive wine could have tasted better. 
An amuse bouche started, a little rosemary oil soup thing which we had to eat with little teaspoons, which annoyed me, so I didn't finish, which actually produced a comment from the m-d.
The risotto was perfect. No other word for it. Every little bit of seafood was cooked exactly right. It made us sorry to finish it. The rabbit was perfect as well, absolutely delicious. Rabbit pancakes were the first meal I ever ate in France, at Madame's in Le Touquet (5 course meals every night, real hot chocolate every morning) back in 1987, so it seemed appropriate. (Just realised the old girl is probably dead now.) I made my friends jealous with the rum baba, which was big and light with a huge dish of cream and a jug of pure rum. I was told I could ask for more rum (!) 
Because I had told the maitre-d' my friend had been to other Gordon Ramsays in Tokyo and New York (perfectly true, he likes spending his money) we were invited to have a look round the kitchens! Where we met the woman of his dreams, Clare Smyth, and had our photo taken with her. After that, while waiting for our coffees in the little front area, we were given chocolate truffles and ice cream balls wrapped in white chocolate. Lovely. The coffees were perfect. (so they should have been at a fiver each.)
My only minor quibble was the decor, the panelling of the walls struck me as a bit strange- a bit like a hotel somehow. But it was a grand experience. i recommend it if you want to impress a potential mate or their parents.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"For a 3 michelin star restaurant, I have very high expectations for Gordon Ramsay's flag ship restaurant.  This was quite possibly one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in terms of the food.  I am usually not a big fan of foie gras but whatever they did to it, I loved it.  The gamey aftertaste was gone.  The highlight of the meal was the pork belly though, so tender and so flavorful.  I would fly back to London just to have that again.  Other highlights would be the fruit smoothie with pop rocks.  
As with most of these types of restaurants, the service was exceptional.  They were very attentive and accommodating.  I highly recommend the 7 course tasting menu.  Yes, it's 120 pounds but when else are you going to go to Gordon Ramsay?",1

Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road. This is definitely one from the archives but which I still feel compelled to blog about. Most people either have a positive or negative impression of him. A lot of them commented on his swearing in Hell's Kitchen. I actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show.
Lately, he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills.
I came here a while back for the tasting menu.
I especially liked the second canapés. Wafer thin and crispy, it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness.
Pressed foie gras with Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble
Pan fried sea scallops from the Isle of Skye with peas, crispy bacon, quail's eggs, baby gem lettuce
Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney, vinaigrette
Fillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce, leeks and cep sauce
Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit shoulder, ratatouille and thyme jus
Roasted pigeon from Bresse with grilled polenta, smoked pork belly and date sauce
Selection of cheeses or pre dessert
Pineapple soup with toasted coconut and rum
Bitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granite
I was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course. With all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around London, I think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered.
I hope to see that from Gordon Ramsay.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Unbelievable - Food was amazing - I had the prestige menu, one of the top 5 meals I've ever had.  They are good and they know it - it's expensive",1

The food was stunning, with a subtle depth of flavour to every dish. Service was attentive, and pleasant, and the atmosphere was relaxing. 
The staff were very accommodating, helpful and relaxed, happy to aid in every aspect of your dining experience. 
The only aspect with this restaurant that might cause an issue is its demand. If you wish to have dinner here then I recommend booking at least two months in advance, if you're having lunch then six weeks.",1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,5,"Despite what you may think about Gordon Ramsay the man, this restaurant remains #1 on my all time list.  Everywhere we go gets compared to Gordon (if going to a man's restaurant gives you permission to be on a first name basis).
Of course everyone knows Gordon Ramsay. But it hadn't actually entered my mind to want to eat here until a friend went and just wouldn't stop going on and on about it.
So when we got the chance to expense up to £200 on dinner it was the perfect opportunity.
SERVICE......excellent.  As to be expected at a place like this, there were a lot of servers and other people to cater to your needs.  I liked how even with just 2 people they gave us a big table (same as a party of 4) to ourselves and seated us both on the same side facing the room (no one has to fight over who has to sit facing the wall).  I liked how when I got up and looked around they room they discreetly waved in the direction of the toilet.  I liked how when we ordered wine, and we're not that knowledgeable about wine, we just asked them to bring recommendations and they went off and did all the work figuring out what we ordered themselves without having to ask us.  I liked how they didn't bother us during to the meal to ask how it was, or if we were done, or if we needed anything.  I liked how they knew when to clear the plates - when we were both done (and yes, it helps greatly if you know proper table manners).  In short, they were knowledgeable, alert and very discreet.  The best service I've ever received and I probably rave about as much as I do the food.
FOOD.... ah the food!  I could go on and on.  I won't even try to remember what hubby had but I ordered the foie gras and kobe steak.  However, what I remember most are the amuse bouche.  A spoonful of gelatin that was the essence of tomato.  And don't forget dessert.  Not sure if it's still on the menu but be sure to get the special dessert that's a sampler of the menu.  Tiny pots of chocolate, lavendar creme brulee, etc, etc.  We must have gotten at least 8 miniature desserts.  And especially don't forget the coffee.  It comes with 4 different kinds of chocolate including miniature ice cream cones (if you are too full at this point you can ask them to box up the chocolates to take home).  
The reservation was for 6 and we were seated promptly.  We didn't leave until 10:30.  But at no time did we feel like food was coming out too slow.
At the end of the evening we even got a tour of the kitchen and met the chef.
Of course all of this comes at a PRICE... which was worth it.  The total meal came out to around £250ish with 2 prix fixe meals (extra for the kobe steak), 2 glasses of champagne, 2 glasses of white wine with starters, 1 bottle of red with meal and coffee/chocolates.  Service is included in the price so you don't need to worry about that.",1

french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"I am not really sure what to say about this place 
Shall I say about the food? the place? The price? or the celebrity-eccentric-business man? 
A bit of everything.
 The food: is a classic 2 michelin star restaurant anywhere else in the world. I really don't get why to be the only 3 star (which actually does not worth) in London, for such many years? (For me is obvious that connections work well..). Why French? You are in England, show us something F**g traditional English! You think you can challenge French 3-star? Don't think so..
 The place: I know what minimal is but your place is bloody bad. A small room (that's fine) old decorated, probably modern when it was first launched..
 The price: Overpriced, but someone needs to pay this guy's name! 3 people had 3 courses and glasses of wine for each course (not the dessert) and we payed £600+ ...
 The Celebrity under Gordon Ramsay's name: I was really disappointed overall. I expected something extraordinary from the only 3 star restaurant for so many years in London but that's not the case. I would like to see the chef, talk to people and be friendly like SO many great chef's who worth in throughout the world. He was probably busy opening another branch somewhere I guess..
 Overall: Over rated, friendly staff, average food (for what it is comparing it to other 3 star restaurants).
 How can we compare this guy's restaurant with the amazing chef Arzak in San Sebastian in Spain?... And that is just an example!",-1
french,7ODDYFI3lFWbgwB-zsw8fg,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,"3 Michelin Stars (the food seems to be about equal from 2 stars to 3, only difference I can see is the ridic attention to detail (service wise))
Slightly difficult to get into so book ahead of time.
The foie gras dish here is so different and unique from any other variation I've had. It's serious. Most of the seafood courses were okay, but the sauces just made them so much better. I had pigeon for the first time. According to the waiter, they were the kind from the woods and not from Trafalgar Square. Also, just in case you were curious, pigeon meat is very tough and red. It was alright. The smoked pork belly that came on the side wow! Just wow! It's a bacon lovers dream!
Okay now onto the cheese. Wow such a large selection of cheeses and the cranberry bread that came with them was amazing! Pre-desert (hah! love this, that the term pre-desert exists that is) was a creme brulee variation with a side of freshly pressed apple juice. It was like a non alcoholic wine pairing and it worked perfectly together. Next was a strawberry champagne smoothie and we finished off with a chocolate and hazelnut concoction. It had ginger mouse on top and was of course wonderful. Arriving with the check, was what looked like a pot of dry ice (it was underneath). It was white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream! I love how fancy restaurants always give you gifts of food throughout the meal.
