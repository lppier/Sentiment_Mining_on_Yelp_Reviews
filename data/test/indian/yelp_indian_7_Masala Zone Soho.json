And overall, not really friendly at all.\nI wish now I had gone with the traditional Thali, but the dish I ordered sounded very good on paper. Noodles with prawns and squid.\nThe dish came out very quick, considering their menu mentions giving them time to prepare everything fresh. Now the sauce was delicious. Very very good. But given the price of the dish being over £17, there was very few prawns and only a couple pieces of squid.\nWhen I finished eating, it took a long time for anyone to check on me and get my bill (I had to ask for it). Even though I saw them attending to other tables.\nTherefore, given the poor service and price, I give it 2 stars.",

The food is exquisite and the flavors are not spice overpowering which makes the food delightful. \nIf you are not too much in to the super hot and spicy, there are great options. The waitress Sahana took the time to ask preferences and Based on answers she made excellent recommendations from appetizers, to main course, side dishes and dessert. Highly advise to order the  Butter Chicken, delicious! , and  Chicken Saffron Korma.  Make sure when you eat here to ask for Sahana she will ensure you will leave this place in love.\nThe  value was great for the quality of food! \nThe restaurant is posh and chic! \nThe Host was kind and very attentive,  and not having a booking was not a big deal.",

We looked them up on Yelp and saw that the reviews were encouraging so we took a chance on a Friday night and showed up without reservations. They were about a 15 minute walk or less from Leicester square. They were fairly busy and we waited at least 10 minutes but still a very reasonable time to wait on a Friday night WITHOUT reservations. \nThe service is NOT great but you get over that pretty quickly because of the food. The samosa was amazing. Both of our meals were great. The drinks were excellent. The ambiance was awesome. The bathrooms were even cool. We wanted to order and eat so much more but we were full on the food we had ordered! All in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back the next time I am on \"holiday\" (vacation) again in the United Kingdom.",

Mini-chains of Indian restaurants is not something we see in the States, so I was intrigued to see what the results would be.  The place was buzzing and very busy for lunch and we were seated right away.  The décor did not seem much like a chain restaurant in my opinion, it is modern, but also warm and cozy at the same time.\nThe menu is very busy and there is a lot to choose from.  I had the chicken saffron korma and we also got the butter chicken thali.  Additionally, we got garlic naan and rice.  Everything was very good.  Nothing was amazing, but not one thing that hit the table was mediocre.  I really liked the chicken saffron korma.  I have not seen it at many restaurants back home.  \nOne thing that was lacking here was the service.  We waited for a long time for our server, ultimately ordering from the host.  We got our drinks from one server, food from another server, drinks ordered from another server (which never came) and the bill from someone else.  A little annoying as we ended up being in a bit of a rush to get somewhere after.",

Sure, sometimes it's REALLY busy and you may need to wait a little bit, but overall the service is very good. \nTo be honest, I still don't really understand how to order the Thalis, but whatever does come out is always yummy. We tried the shrimp curry and it was delicious. I love all the options you have with a Thali. The flavors are always so diverse and interesting. \nOne of my favorite appetizers is the dahi puri- it's like this spicy puff filled with cool yogurt. AH! SO GOOD! And the mango sorbet is a delicious finish to any meal. \nOn another occasion we decided against the Thalis and just ordered curry. They were also good but I think we've learned we can't handle heat as much as we thought we could ;)",

Pressed for time we walked into Masala zone.  It should  be called the \"coriander zone\" for their  heavy handed use of the  spice.  The veggie samosas had large offensive seeds that I had to spit into my napkin. The korma has so much coriander it was inedible. \nAlso, I'm confused about the curries. They were more like  soup than actual curry.  The butter chicken lacked any kind of subtlety or depth. It was more like tomato soup.  \nFinally the rice didn't get eaten and the naan was bland. Such a bummer and I have to wonder how this place gets so many 5 star reviews.\nOn a positive note the staff was pleasant and the atmosphere appropriate for a soho restaurant.",

The place does seem a bit overdecorated but the vibe and the atmosphere is pretty good - I can definitely see this place being a good date dinner venue.  \nService was pretty lacking. Their payments system was down, and staff didn't seem to do a very good job communicating with each other so there was quite a bit of confusion and a pretty significant and frustrating delay. I ended up needing to pay in cash since they couldn't really sort out what was wrong. \nThe food is delicious and very heavily spiced - the spicy offerings are actually quite spicy. They have thali sets that come with a little bit of everything if you like variety. The grand thali can be split between two people easily. Portions are reasonable although Masala Zone is a bit on the pricey side, although I don't think it's egregious for the area.",

This place does try to make you wait too long for a table even when they are clean and you are next for it. They seem to be content with leaving you at the bar and hoping you order a drink to pad your bill. When you're hungry this is a nuisance. The decor is great and if it was quiet it could even be romantic. That isn't possible however since this is close to soho's many bars. Service was pretty good for London.\nDefinitely recommend you go but get a reservation so you aren't one of the many groups being pushed back out the doors.\nAlso the doors are weird.

It quickly filled, however, so I'd recommend a reservation (but it obviously worked out for us, so don't be deterred). \nThey have a collection of curries that they serve on a platter with set sides, delicious chutney, and a few other things (called a thali). You can get a regular thali or a grand thali, which has a few more bells and whistles. You can add on another curry for a bit extra. We got the butter chicken (suuuuuper creamy) and the lamb curry (lamb was super tender). \nIf you are moderately hungry, adding a curry to the grand thali would sufficiently feed 2. We didn't realize that and added the chicken kottu parantha. Kind of glad we did, though, because it was delicious. Spiced chicken with lots of veggies and delicious things. They warned us it would take longer to cook, but I thought it was served quickly.",

The curry could be served hotter, it was a bit cold when I received it.\nPortion wise, it was big enough than I couldn't finish it.\nThe restaurant is classier than regular Indian restaurants, the service was also good. The waiter checked on us several times, and in the end he asked us to fill the feedback form.

                "description": "Open concept and beautiful decor. Definitely should have gotten a reservation prior to arriving. Only waited 30 minutes at the bar. I tried the Chai Negroni which I didn't like but in the restaurant's defense, it was labeled bitter and spicy. I tried something new; they aren't all winners. The Narial Punch was the perfect amount of sweetness and creamy texture. As for the meals, the food overall was incredibly full of flavor with different levels of heat. I highly recommend the cheese naan bread. I ordered two for myself, it was that good. Now to the bad stuff. As an American, I am comfortable in cargo shorts and a hoodie. Just because I look casual doesn't mean I'm broke or a poor tipper. I had to ask several times for more water AND when someone finally brought it, it was as if I was inconveniencing him for even being there. The food was divine, I can't deny that. My thing is I felt judged for how I prefer to dress. I still paid in full and as the tip was included in the bill, I can say my experience didn't warrant the 12.5% already added. Normally I tip 20% for excellent service. 0% would have been more appropriate.  As I am zaftig, I have no issue spending money on food. So now, I judge the service here and hope future experiences with people won't feel as overlooked as I did tonight.",

The star was a punch that is a twist on a chai tea and served in a metal tea cup with crushed ice. There is also a take on a. Gin and tonic that was delightfully bitter and a floral cocktail with a hint of prosecco. All of this melded perfectly with the meal, the thali with mangalore chicken. It's nice to know that you can swap out the main for the thali.",

Carry on.\"\nNot that it's a super fancy place, but it's clean, shiny, and you certainly don't smell that pungent oily fog of curry that permeates your clothes for days after. \nMany of us opted for the thalis, which is the usual order for indecisive people like myself. Why have one dish when you can opt for like nine things on a big silver platter. You have a choice of GRAND and regular, so being American, I of course supersized mine, so the thali gained kachumber (tomato & onion salad), raita, and an appetizer. Both types of thalis have a choice of meat curry, two veg curries (root & leaf), chapati, rice, and papadum.\nThe fish curry was fine as my main, though it could have used a kick in the spice levels. The chutneys and side sauces were on the blander side as well, but still mighty tasty. This might be an issue of getting used to more subtle flavors versus the sodium assaults of the curry houses I usually frequent.\nGreat place for large groups of hunger diners since we were a group of eleven and were seated immediately, right around dinner time on a weekend.",

I came with a group of 5 friends around 8 on a Thursday. Since Masala is large and spacious, we were quickly seated.\nBased on Yelp photos, I decided to opt for a curry. I forget what it's called, but it was spicy (two chilies on the menu) but with nice coconut-y undertones and with large pieces of dark meat chicken. The curry doesn't come with rice, so I ordered some Yellow lemony-Jasmine rice which was perfectly seasoned, spiced, and I even found a roasted lemon rind mixed inside.\nI tried my friend's Butter Chicken curry, which was a different type of spicy. Not in the sense of hot-spicy, but more like a flavorful, almost sweet spicy. She ordered garlic naan on the side, which came out slightly fluffy, fresh and warm. Other friends ordered the Thalis, which are definitely meant to be shared. I sampled their small side dishes - the lentil stew was mediocre but everything else was great. Also, good service!\nTl;dr - authentic, affordable Indian food in Soho.",

                "description": "Came here on the recommendation of Rick Steve's London guide. Mind you, he's not that type of a traveler that knows good food. However, taking his advice on this chain while being in the neighborhood was a pleasant suprise.\nMasala Zone are a chain of retaurants with various themes, this one having the theme of an Indian marriage with close to 100 vibrant puppets from Rajasthan suspended from the ceilings. Definitely a great conversation starter.\nMenu is vast, but I went straight for one of the Thalis combo. I love my favorite Indian place in Glendale that does a great job on Northern Indian Thalis, so I had to see if this one stood up to it. \nI went with the The Grand Thali, which is equal to a starter and main course combined. It comprises a Canapé,  a choice of  curry, 2 vegetables (one green and one root), Dal (lentil), Raita (yoghurt), Indian salad, Papadum & Chutney, freshly-made whole wheat Chapatti (Indian bread) & Rice. You get to choose the meat. Be forewarned that when you say mild, it's VERY mild. You won't drip one bit of sweat at all. If you're like me and like to actually taste some spice in your food, medium should be good. Anywho, as noted on their website, the etiquette of eating a Thali is to spoon a small portion of food from an individual dish into the area next to the rice, and then combine it with the rice. Repeat this process in sequence. This enables the flavour of each dish to be appreciated individually. Do not either mix more than one dish simultaneously with the rice, or mix the rice in the individual bowls. Chapattis are eaten with the food by using a piece of chapatti to scoop the food from one of the dishes.\nFor a chain restaurant, the Thali was great and a good portion. It's not \"home made\" Indian food, but it's food that's tasty and you can try different combos. After walking an entire day around London, this did the job for a casual sit down. Definitely make a reservation if you're going to eat at 6pm and after or be prepared to wait and wait at this location.",

                "description": "I have visited the Bayswater location twice and had a fabulous experience. The food was excellent, including the kabobs, butter chicken, rogan josh, thali, pav bhaji, chaat, etc. however, I had a terrible experience at this location. \nYesterday, I came to this location for dinner. After a wait, we were seated and I ordered a lassi and then lamb seekh kabob and garlic naan. After 20 min, the kabob came out but the naan did NOT. After failing to get a waiters attention, I finally flagged one down and told her about the naan. She noted it and then continued working. 15 min later, still no naan. \nI finally flagged another server and she said she'd get us a naan. 10 min later, the naan showed up. It was flat, doughy, undercooked, and there was NO garlic. If you order garlic naan and you are being charged EXTRA for it being a garlic naan, there better actually be some garlic! And this wasn't a naan! This was a doughy chapati! And I know Masala Zone can do better since I had a good naan at the Bayswater location. I finally got the attention of the original server and asked him to send it back. He apologized briefly and offered to get me another one and check with the kitchen. 10 min later he finally came back and just said \"apologies for the naan\" and then went off again. \nWe wanted the bill but the servers did not come by for another 10 min. Finally he came over and explained that he hadn't charged us for the naan and he had taken off the service charge. I was very disappointed by the customer service at this location and I probably won't be coming back. It's a shame.",

It was a beautiful restaurant and when you first walk in, the wonderful smell of the Indian food was enough to make get rid of my doubts of this place. We ordered the thali and the grilled chicken. I ordered the Indian yoghurt drink and it tasted great. The food was amazing and everything was perfectly flavored. It was proportionate and filling. The service was good. A reservation is probably a good idea for this location since it was packed before 8 pm on a Saturday night.",

                "description": "Three stars indicates just ok, but let's be clear, I actually like the food here just fine. It's not your momma's cooking, no, but it's fresh, clean-tasting, and everything actually tastes different (you know the ol' takeaway curry joint trick of making a giant vat of bland base gravy and then just adding a dash of tomato paste, saag, spices, etc to make it into separate dishes, yeah? yeah, this place doesn't do that, as far as I can tell).\nI would say that the stand-out dishes are almost exclusively the veg ones. Chicken tends to be a little dry and tired; lamb tends to be only ok. The veggie offerings are really quite nice, with a good range of starches and pulses and some solid paneer-based offerings.\nThalis are a good size.\nSo why the three stars? Primarily it comes down to price. Yeah, you can come in, get just a veg thali (£11.15) and their cheapest drink (tea or filter coffee, I believe, at £1.80) and have lunch for £14.57 when you add in gratuity. But that's an expensive lunch for Soho when you can get a solid, fresh falafel wrap etc for under £7 with a drink around the corner. And let's be real, you don't want just the thali: you want to try the appetisers (all sadly overpriced and not good value for the size, also generally underwhelming in terms of taste) and have a drink (also expensive), and maybe tack on a second curry to pad out your thali (£3.50). \nThe last time we went (yesterday, actually), we dropped just under £60--ouch!--for lunch: lassi, iced tea, thali with extra curry, a curry main, two appetisers, two desserts (both of which were awful), a tea, and a coffee.\nWhat gets my (roast) goat here is that the pricing always feels vaguely like a scam about to happen. It's always a little different; this time it was \"If you order a main and a drink, it's 20% off!\" Hey, that sounds really good-- no, wait. \"The 20% off is already reflected in the menu. If you want the full-price menu, we can offer it.\" What even is this? Seriously, guys. It's not classy, and your poor servers have to keep explaining it like it's reasonable. Don't do it. Just admit your food is grossly overpriced and then offer a discount from the price you want to charge, if that's what you're after.\nFood also does take forever to come out. Granted, yeah, things are being made mostly to order, but let's be real, the kitchen doesn't hustle, and there's no excuse for dessert (pre-made sweets and a lump of ice cream) taking 15 minutes to appear. Basically, you can't just nip in for a quick lunch here. Set aside two and a half hours.\nI don't hate this place, though I do sort of hate how it's structured. But after this last wallet-searing experience, I'm done. I really am. So, how about it, fellow Yelpers: is there a decent Indian place anywhere near-ish to Soho?",

I head things like \"it's really good\" and \"there are clearly Indians making the food *and* eating there...\". I guess I should have asked for more elaborate descriptions.\nFor a chain (famous last words), it's good. Better than just okay. You walk into the restaurant and it's undeniably aromatic, fresh spice and charred goodness emanating from the tandoor. Your palate whet with anticipation.\nMy date and I dined on the Dari Puri and Goan Crispy Prawns to start. I didn't detect any chickpea in the Dari Puri, nor any chutney (perhaps it was the drizzle), but there was sure a mouthful of yogurt. The Goan Crispy Prawns were more crispy than prawn, and tremendously greasy. For our mains we had the Paneer Makhanwalla and Roghan Josh. Both mediocre, lacking the signature depth that we've all come to know and love from Indian cuisine, and falling a bit flat. The portion size was also slightly less than satiating.  \nMoral of the story: in a pinch, lack of similar alternatives, and need to get away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford and Regent, duck in here... it won't be offensive.",

All of which were very tasty, however, it is a bit pricey for the portion of food that you get, but it is central london.

One of my friends is Indian and she thought the gol guppa were too tiny and were not filled with enough filling.  My favourite dish was the ghel, a puff rice and peanut salad.

                "description": "My experience at Masala Zone Soho was good and I can see how you could give the place more stars. However, I wasn't overwhelmed by my experience so I am giving three stars in my review. But the place really does Indian food very well and there is a lovely ambience. There are a good selection of street food. The dahi puri were delicious. Unfortunately the aloo chaat had been taken off the menu, as I was looking forward to ordering that. The thali and grand thali meal options are really good. They offer a balanced Indian meal. In general dishes are a good portion size, which is nice because you can avoid eating too much.",

Quite functional.\nHowever, it does serve a wide range of Indian food you don't tend to see elsewhere.  Food which claims to be \"Street Food\", rather than the typical Chicken Tikka Masala.\nIt's the only place I've had a salt lassi with herbs (and that isn't a type of dog).\nTip: although the Thali is really cost-effective, you can easily fall into the trap of mixing everything up and getting an oddly featureless mush.  Discipline is needed to try to eat one thing at a time.  I've given up on that now, and go for the starter, main course, dessert route, to guarantee more distinct tastes.",

The place is quite lively and filled up quickly. The acoustics was pretty bad, but we still had a very nice time together. \n \nMy friend Lee selected Masala Zone for its Thali, which we all ordered. Thali is a medley of different dishes served on large platters. I selected the butter chicken for my meat course (you can choose chicken, lamb, shrimp, etc), which came with curry vegetables, lentils, raita, chapatis (whole wheat bread), and rice, all for about £11.50. Everything was scrumptious and the chicken tender! \nWhile this is a chain restaurant, I thought the food was well prepared (the flavors of each dish blended well), and reasonably priced, especially in expensive London. I would definitely return here the next time I'm in London. I'll have to search out for a similar type of place where I live.",

The menu has a lot to offer and we ordered a butter chicken and thali with a coconut chicken base. Both were tasty. Other people at our table also got different thali meats, beef and veggies. Reason for 3 star was due to service. After we just sat down our waiter asked if we want an appetizer and we said no but ordered drinks. After 10 mins we got our beers and then ordered.  We ended up ordering an appetizer and the waiter made a smart remark \"oh now you want an appetizer\" we didn't say anything. After everyone dishes started to come out we got our butter chicken but no thali. We waited till everyone else at the table got their food and after a good 5mins I had to ask for it. The waiter grabbed his pad and doubled check everyone's order and said oh I'll get it now so it looks like the kitchen either missed our order or a runner brought our food to someone else. By the time we got the thali everyone else was done eating so we rushed to finished ours. We also asked for water 3 times and didn't get it till the end of the night. I think the over all experience could of been better because there are waiters, food runners, managers and busboys but we some how couldn't get water when we ask 3 different people for it.",

Soft lighting throughout the restaurant but still very upbeat with a combination of large party groups and tables for two.\nWe each ordered the Grand Thali, thanks to our gluttonous behaviour!\nThe Grand Thali consists of a canapé, papadum and chutney, a choice of curry, two vegetables, dal (lentil), raita (yoghurt), salad, chapati (indian bread) & rice. It sounds like a lot of food, but each of the dishes come out in mini bowls so you get to try a bit of everything. Price was 10-12GBP each. \nAlso on the menu is a good selection of starters; cold and hot, as well as 'street food' appetizers. We wanted to try some; however, resisted since our eyes are always bigger than our stomach.\nVery satisfied with this meal, as it was the end of our Europe trip.",

I had trouble finish it up but forced my self anyway.Something to keep in mind, for next time, I should skip lunch if I am heading out here for dinner. \nMy husband had the butter chicken with naan and a chicken biryani. The portions were huge and he was able to finish it up quite easily. \nService is very good. I was quite surprised how attentive the waiters were.Always had our glasses of water topped up. \nOne of the few good Indian restaurants in the Covent Garden area. Good find, definitely going back.",

                "description": "I come here a lot. \nI mean, a LOT.\nMainly because of a promotion (no longer participating :() that gets me half price food to be honest. This makes their thalis a great lunch treat if I'm feeling like a chilled lunch. The grand thali is a fantastic beast comprised of a curry of your choice alongside several vegetable side dishes; always different, always a delight. Round it off with some rice, chutneys and a chapatti and you have yourself a meal. I'm that weird kind of person who doesn't mind taking a gamble on menus so this sort of pot-luck approach to the thali is awesome and encourages repeat visits. \nQuality of the food is good. The meat is cooked decently, never dry, and the curries have a great combination of flavours. The fact that the majority of your meal is in fact vegetarian and still fantastically tasty is testament to the chefs here (yeah, I'll say it, a lot of vegetarian food is bland and pointless)\nAt full price the dish is decent value; at half price I'm planning my return trip on the way out of the door.\nOh, one word of warning. Don't order the masala cola. Grim.\nUpdate on the taste london card discount: they no longer do it. However their lunch deals are still reasonable (starter and a regular thali for a tenner) so it's still not terrible value for money.",

The whole layout of this particular place is pretty nice, simple, oak/wood decor, bar like seating in some areas, not usually crowded.\nI don't know if there is a specific way, or a specific order to eat everything on these trays, but I just graze about, trying all the different colored & textured randomness. Works for me every time. \nI don't like the yoghurt they serve with the entrees, nor do I like their special herb sodas, SOO GROSSS. Don't do it, don't. \nThis place is better than any other Indian place I've tried.

As if that wasn't enough the cocktails are delicious! \nThere are a couple of negatives... I'd say that its a little impersonal and sometimes rushed.

However when that chain has the parentage of the much respected Veeraswamy and Chutney Mary restauarants you tend to ignore that. Indeed as a 'chain' it has grown considerably but the quality of the food has not changed since there were one or two of them.\nThankfully I have at least a good enough comparison of food having been to India and living in an area where there is a large Indian community and award winning restaurants. So I can say that this is very well done and very well presented food. The spicing is as it should be and pungently aromatic at times. Well priced for the West End and with friendly and efficient service, this is a favourite of mine.\nIt can easily cater for couples or groups as they have tables of varying sizes. The menu caters for what they call 'street food' and is presented really as a fast food Indian experience. But that would be doing it down as these dishes are well worth savouring. \nIt's not a restaurant to bring a romantic date nor is it one where the wine list will leave you breathless but for excellent and extremely tasty Indian food, well presented and efficiently served, you can't go wrong.",

                "description": "The Masala Zone chain is a favorite in general for reliably good Indian food, but this location seems to be the best of the bunch.\nIt's located on a quiet street behind the bustle of Regent and Carnaby Streets, and is a welcome respite from the flotillas of stressed-out holiday shoppers. \nI almost always go for the chicken tikka kabob, which changes flavors on a daily basis so we can be surprised when it arrives.  And the garlic baby spinach dish from the side order menu is a must have which we always share no matter what else we order.\nDon't let the fact it's a casual dining chain keep you away - Masala Zone is under the same ownership as the fantastic and upscale Veeraswamy on Regent Street (which you must treat yourself to at least once in this lifetime).",

We tried the sampler plate & they were all good. The chaat may not be as grand as that which you get in Delhi or Mumbai but it comes darn close.\nFor mains we ordered the regular 'thali' and there wasn't one thing in there that we could complain about. The thali was fairly spicy, though (both my husband & I had to blow our noses once through the meal). The portions are large, so we were stuffed & didn't try the desserts.\n      \nThe service was friendly & quick (we went after peak time & the restaurant wasn't full). We had 2 different restaurant staff walk over & ask if everything was OK.\nThe bathroom area door is deeply recessed & you don't get to see the insides of it each time someone opens it (yay!)\nThe \"show\" kitchen is visible from the dining area but it's pleasant to watch the activity in there. There main kitchen is behind recessed double doors & not visible. I liked the understated decor here (Warli murals on the walls) no Maharajas in gilded frames. The place is well lit.\nIt is handicap accessible (call ahead for assistance).",

                "description": "I typically start with one of their delicious Mango lassis and then jump straight into either a Grand Thali or Regular Thali plate depending on whether I am going to share. The Thali plates come with a bunch of little bowls filled with dal, various vegetables, yogurt, and other things that are great for dipping. You also get to choose a curry. I can personally vouch for the butter chicken, chicken mangalore, and the other spicy green chicken curry.\nThe prices are already pretty reasonable, but if you want to have a very reasonably priced meal and there are two of you, try splitting a Grand Thali and throwing in an extra nan. You can also throw in an extra side bowl of curry. Even with the lassis the two of you can probably escape for just around 20 GBP. \nI think the only area that Masala Zone could significantly improve on is their nan. It lacks the freshness and fluffyness of excellent nan.\nCheers",

                "description": "Lets say you were dating someone that was British-born Indian and you had never really had curry before and you asked them to bring you somewhere legit for your first curry experience.  Would you expect to be brought to a chain restaurant?  \nLet's just say I was mildly furious at the lack of effort. \nLet's also acknowledge that the term 'mildly' is an understatement. \nSo I have to say the only curry I had before this was on a flight on Air India on which I was weighing the probability of statistical outcome on which would kill me first:  the shotty plane, the pilot that seemed to like to create turbulance where it probably didn't exist, or the botched airline food that came in containers, none of which I could identify other than the one that said \"water\"... \nSo this being my first \"curry\" and living in the land of \"curry or go home\" I expected to prepare and deliver some speech on how \"oh gosh, this is what I've been missing, I feel so cultured\"  but instead I recited, \"hmm ok... well, thanks for ordering for me.\"\nMaybe Indian food isn't for me, it was ok, I've since walked by what seems like zillions of Masala Zones and have yet to be tempted to go back in.  As my date pointed out, there were other Indian people eating there and that was a good indication, so apparently it's somewhere close to legit.  \nI've been taken to two other places since then, one was supposed to be the top top top amazing and one was apparently supposed to be \"pretty good' for Brick lane standards, and they all tasted and looked the same to me but had different price tags.  I say this with the caveat that I'm apparently not a curry-person, but if someone is making me go get one with them, I'd rather just go to Brick lane.",

However, since I only ever come here about once every year and it is pretty low on my list of places to go for an indian, I think honestly, the verdict is leaning towards \"no, I don't particularly like it\".  \nMy friend and I arrived at peak hour- just after 8 and were asked to wait for a few minutes to be seated- however, during the 10 minutes we waited, there was a table close to the door that was free, and lo and behold! that was our table.  I guess this was to be expected as all the staff seemed very busy and in my personal opinion, the restaurant could have benefited from at least 1 if not 2 more servers this evening.  I was impressed that the staff were calm and friendly after running around in frenzy, although they did forget our extra order of poppadoms and had to be prompted for them.\nWe both had the butter chicken thali and the chicken was good, spices were well balanced.  The chapati was a large round pita/ naan without substance rather than a traditional chapati, so I was a little disappointed as I expected well, a chapati.  Personal bugbear of highly spiced poppadom was here and the daal tasted like Chinese red bean (aduki bean) soup without the sugar, underspiced and under salted (total failure in my point of view).  Aloo gobi was ok and the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced.  Actually I take that back; the poppadom was so over spiced, I believed the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced- I am not entirely sure on that one.\nI really like the idea of a fast food type thali restaurant serving good quality Indian food at reasonable prices.  However, I also believe that good indian food is delicately spiced- i.e. bursting with flavor; you can taste all the spices but not all screaming bloody murder in your mouth at the same time, then replaced by a bland hotness.  Masala zone comes in a little heavy handed with their spices, and that is just not the kind of indian that makes me food happy...  I want to taste be able to taste all the different dishes, I don't want to just slop different types of goop in my mouth.\nAll in all, I probably won't come back for at least another year, and by that time I would probably have forgotten what made me upset about the Masala Zone.  It is a lot of food for the money they charge though.  \nAt least I have tayyabs to look forward to tomorrow!  Yum.",

That and the fact that their food is quite good.\nTheir focus is thalis, and in my mind, this really is the best way to serve Indian food if you're not into the \"all you can eat buffet\" kind of thing.  A thali is pretty much a complete meal served on a large steel platter.  The rice is in the center and it is surrounded by small bowls (katoris) of condiments, side dishes, and whatever the kitchen was in the mood for making that day.\nThe ordering process is a little confusing at first, but easily understandable:\nStep 1: Decide on which thali you want, regular or grand.\nStep 2: Decide on your main protein or veg (e.g. chicken, prawn, veggie, etc.)\nStep 3: Decide on the style of your main protein or veg (e.g. curry, tikka masala, butter chicken, etc.)\nStep 4: Wait for your platter and chow down.\nThalis come in regular or grand, and they're a pretty good deal ranging from 9-12 pounds for a complete meal.  \nPapadum are so thin, you can almost see through them.  Chapatis are whole wheat and have a nice texture too.\nStaff are friendly and eager to guide you through the maze of choices on their menu.\nAtmosphere and decor is hip and casual.\nComplain all you want about the chain restaurant thang, but I'd kill for a masala zone here in the States.",

I like dining here when I come to London on my own as it's relatively cheap to get a complete meal for one person with starter, main course, rice, naan and condiments without breaking the bank.\nThere is a lot of flexibility as to what you want on your thali plate as well as how many curries etc, with price obviously increasing with the number of items you choose. There is also a nice section of starters, which can be ordered separately.\nFor me, the food is competent and the portions are generous but the flavour is average.

                "description": "Full review with pictures can be found here \ncheap-eat-london.com/200…\n \n Time Out describes Masala Zone as \"Soho's best Indian, no contest\" and therein lies the curry lover's problem: NO CONTEST!\nThere's a real dearth of good ol' Indian curry houses in the West End with a few sporadically dotted here and there, but most notably a small cluster of dingy restaurants on Denman Street in the Soho area. If you're ever unfortunate to walk into one of these places, might I suggest negotiating 10% off the menu price first. They usually oblige and you might feel a bit better knowing you salvaged something to go with that slab of ghee swimming in your belly.\nMasala Zone have thrived in part due to any lack of alternative choices but also through innovation (or modernisation), if I can call it that: Big, illustrated and descriptive menus; a bright interior; spacious seating; and well trained waiting staff that don't wear waistcoats. Most importantly of course is the food which I found to be a commendable effort. Previous visits with friends have taken in their renowned Thalis - a complete meal on a tray made up of several small dishes - and they've kinda dissapointed. The meat curry dishes aren't swimming in oil but at the detriment of any real flavours. Same with the vegetable dishes which were slightly on the cold side. At £11 for a thali, I'd also question the value - sure the variety seems impressive but an espresso cupful of rice, some shredded onions with green bits and a pot of minty yoghurt does not fool the tummy.\nThis recent visit with my buddy Nige saw us share: he, his lamb madras and I, my chicken mangalore. Supplemented with rice, chapatis and garlic spinach. For little more than a couple of thalis I'd say that it was a more fulfilling eating experience.\nThe madras was delicious - heavy on the chilli and tempered by tamarind. Lamb seemed a tad overcooked but it could've been a bit too lean. The Mangalore chicken was just right in it's combination of spice and coconut, with ginger being most prominent. The chicken was a bit dry though and I'm finding this to be a common occurence in all their meat dishes.\nWe decided on the Rasmalai for a sweet thing but other choices are standards - Golub Jamun, falouda (a sweet drink with colourful noodles) and kulfi almond ice cream. Rasmalai was a great choice - light, spongey, milky patties soaked in a saffron flavoured milk sauce and topped with pistachios went down a treat with the chai teas.\nMasala Zone is a pretty good Indian that provides a more contempory experience to the traditional restaurant and if they figured out a way of serving meat that isn't overcooked to a high turnover of customers then I'd say it'd be excellent.\nThis was my second visit and it was a more positive experience than the first one.\n£40 for the two of us which includes 2 mains, rice, chapatis, sides, drinks, desserts and chais.",

The thali is basically like a set meal which comes with  sides of veg, potato, and lentils of the day, along with two sauces to eat with your popadoms, and then of course the main which is normally rice with whatever curry you choose. I usually go for the Prawn Malai. To me this curry is a perfect blend of creamy coconut milk based sauce with a barely there spice. \nMy partner likes to get the Lamb Korma. I am a pescatarian so I cant personally comment on this curry, but I take it from the numerous people that have tried this dish that it is pretty damn good.  \nThere isn't really any difference between the regular and large thali as you aren't getting larger portions with the latter. In fact, the extra bit is some naan bread, little salad, and small samosa. Regular thalis are about £6-7. I definitely recommend this set as you'll get to taste a little of everything without spending more.  \nDining in is also a nice option since staff are very congenial! The place itself is not posh but more casual. The look they're going for is maybe an underground clay like hut but creative and Indian inspired nonetheless. \nCompare this place to all the little restaurants on Brick Lane and Masala Zone would still come out on top for me. Only reason why this place didn't receive 5 stars is out of homage to my Indian friend's mum's cooking, who by far is the best at Indian cooking ever!",

I went to this one on Marshall St and had a very tasty meal with a friend.\n We started with Bhel Poori, which my dining companion had never had before but I recommended. It's like a crunchy mix of raw ingredients with a tamarind tang. Yum.\n The main courses were good too and the wine went well with the moderately spiced food. I was quite surprised by the good standard of food from a restaurant that is part of a chain, and the prices were very reasonable.",

Lovely range of non-alchoholic drinks (though booze is available for those as wants). A balanced selection of vegetarian to meat dishes available in combinations that illustrate the range of flavours from across India.\n As my record shows, I am a stern critic of sub-standard Indian/South Asian food. I can't bear insults to that culinary heritage such as bright red/orange sauces with generic chemical flavours which are an insult to the palate and do not represent 'Indian' food. If you want a curry out of a jar then get some muck from Sainsbury's or wherever but don't insult India's millenia of food tradition by calling it 'Indian' food.\n Masala Zone compliments India by serving proper Indian food - long may it stay that way!\n Prices are reasonable with excellent deals for 2/3 course lunches for between £8.50/£13. Dinners attract similar deals so you can be sure to fill up for £15.",

Special wishes were not handled, especially not that of having the food spicy / hot / authentic. What a pity. Yet, the service was anxious.

                "description": "Masala Zone is the little sister of the stalwart Chutney Mary and Veeraswamy. Voted best value Indian in Soho by Timeout magazine, it's a fantastic Indian restaurant that has a great location, feels like a proper restaurant (to people like me who're usually on a budget anyway!) and doesn't break the bank.\n Masala Zone is built in a split level kind of way and has a lot of room - but it is so popular, you may have to wait a few minutes before you get a table, especially if you visit on Friday or Saturday night. I don't think it is possible to book ahead. The decor is nice and uncluttered with none of the kitsch that afflicts most Indian restaurants. The kitchen is located behind a glass panel and you can watch the chefs put your food together from the dining room. The service is polite and friendly and very quick.\n The food is essentially North Indian with a lot of curry and rice combinations. The chilli factor is clearly indicated and quite accurate. Try the double chilli options only if you really like spicy food! They also have a nice Indian drinks section, with the yoghurt based lassi being the thickest, creamiest lassi I've had in this country. Nimbu pani is the Indian lemonade and they also do a mean masala chai among other things. They have a liquor licence so you can also order from a selection of wines, beers, and a limited selection of cocktails. Everything I've eaten here has been good but among the starters a special mention goes to the seekh kabab which just melts in your mouth. The curries are all good; I haven't tried the noodle pots but if they really are the Indian version of Chinese (which is NOTHING like real Chinese!), then they should be worth a try.\n Their thalis seem to be very popular and are great value for money. Thalis are basically a full Indian meal served on a large metal plate (aka a thali). There are options in terms of the number of items you want and you can choose at least one of the items but in general a thali contains 2-3 vegetable curries, an optional non vegetarian curry, a poppadum, some rice, a lentil dish, and some sweet chutney. They also do a special ayurvedic thali for diabetics though I haven't tried this.\n In terms of prices, considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's located in Soho, it's very good value. My husband and I have stuffed ourselves for £55 for two people but we've also gone as a group of 4, and the bill has come to £68. It's possible to have a good meal and a drink there for under £15. So all in all, Masala Zone is great place to eat if you're in Central London.",

My dish was actually very extraordinary mix of potato and banana (yes!) in a curry sauce and not bad at all. Creative at least! My friends experiences varied, but overall the food was ok. It was the service that gave us the empty feeling. \nThe waitresses were really fast, and little too effective, and gave us this in-and-out fast food restaurant feeling.

The time I went it was noisey, a bit too noisey and I couldn't hear the waiter properly but he didn't seem much interested either. The food seemed to be favouring heat rather than flavour and we both felt disappointed especially as it came on a good recommendation. I would have to agree with another poster here it did have a McMasala feel to it. Not somewhere I would go again as I prefer somewhere with a more intimate feel.",

For that reason I believe i'm hard to please.\nI have heard these people has something to do with Camelia Panjabi, an indian cook living in London. I bought her book and I thought the recipes were rubbish. The same book they promote for the web. Irrelevant? let's talk about the restaurant then.\nMasala zone looks like of the interior decorator of Macdonalds came to advice them. It's indian and so cliche that feels really unnatural. You could feel the chainish effect in the waiting system, in their uniforms.then10 minutes for a Masala coke, which is great, but 3poundsand gosh, is just lemon juice, mint and coriander (i reckon) with coke.\nfood? I do better butter chicken. Roghan josh was of sorts, so was naan. service was unhelpful.\nWith so many indian restaurants In london i certainly can't see the point in McMasala, Try little restaurants in esta London. they always deliver",

Been here a few times and the chicken always seemed to taste horrible! You could literally see the fat on the meat and it looked as if the poor creature had been hastily slaughtered and cooked (ok, im exaggearting) but i'm sure this place can do better!",

I was a little unsure when my mate at work told me about Masala Zone as I thought it would be another restaurant that serves unauthentic indian cuisine. I was so wrong. It's the best indian food is found in people's homes, in india. The menus present an exciting combination of flavours and offerings. we have something for everyone- freshly prepared. The quality of ingredients, the presentation and quality are not compromised by the price level. Meal for 2 person, without alcohol comes to about £15 per person. Value for money.",

The Decor is very homely with very original wallpaper designs. The red colours make it feel extremely warm. It offers all the most favourite indian dishes though the best bet is the indian Thali. This is especially good for those of us who can't decide as it offers a bit of everything in small bowls. Okra, Chicken, Fish, dahl and rice all in one big combo dish. THey serve Kiran beer at a reasonable price and the waiters are extremely friendly and helpful.",

                "description": "A definite no no. \nA while back I don't doubt that the quality of the food was good but the freshness of the food is somewhat questionable, probably due to the fact that the restaurant was pretty much deserted.\nOn entering we had to wait in the entrance for 15 minutes (timed - no exaggeration) before being seated. Fine. Bad service doesn't particularly bother me - if the food is good, I couldn't care less.\nMy friends and I ordered vegetarian thalis. On reading the terrible reviews before my visit I had braced myself for the worst, but it was worse than I could imagine. The starters were okay albeit overpriced but as they were cold starters it was bearable.\nThe thali was the worst indian food I was ever tasted.\nThe poppadums within 1 minute had become soggy and there was no liquid on my plate but they tasted stale and were not crisp in the slightest, instead they had the texture of wet cardboard. The curries were COLD and I don't mean tepid, I mean COLD! They were completely lacking spice which is fine, I don't particularly want to eat food which has me running around screaming for water, but there was absolutely no flavour. So I had been presented with poor service, stale poppadoms, old cold tastless curries and at a price which is certainly not unbeatable!!\nDon't make the mistake I did in just taking a chance, because I can assure you it will not pay off!",

The street food, and the thalis are particularly fab.",
