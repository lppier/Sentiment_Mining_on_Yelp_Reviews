                "description": "Not gonna lie. I'm a Gordon Ramsay groupie and the only thing I wanted to accomplish during my London layover was to check off this box. \nATMOSPHERE:\nIntimate, minimalist, no music, no wall decor - aka the 3-Star Michelin formula to make you pay attention to the food and service.\nSERVICE:\nFlawless - inconspicuous, fluid, comfortable. The manager and sommelier made frequent rounds and were very engaging. We had a very annoying dietary restriction that they accommodated beautifully on the fly. The only bummer was that we were the last table before closing, so we didn't get a kitchen tour, which is fine because the last time I had a tour that late, all you could see was a sparkling clean kitchen and a lonely pastry chef.\nFOOD:\nThe two of us each took one of the tasting menus and shared - the only thing better than having one Gordon Ramsay meal is having two! Only one suckling pig course was overworked and weird, everything else was tasty and we cleaned the plates. Most of the food wasn't knock-my-socks-off-keel-over-delicious, but solid. To me, I'm pretty happy with a meal if I can walk away feeling like one thing was exceptional enough that I will remember it - for us it was the foie gras terrine, absolutely the best terrine I've every had. The sorbets were also killer.\nDAMAGE:\n2 tasting menus + 1 wine pairing with gratuity automatically added came out to be ~ $700 USD. Considering that the average bill in a 3-Star US Michelin for one person is often more that that, we can't complain.\nOverall, an exemplary 3-Star, worth a visit when in London. I will continue to binge-watch Masterchef when the next season comes out.",

                "description": "In my opinion, the experience of a Three Star Michelin restaurant is comprised of the total experience.  We had the last 2:15 pm lunch seating and enjoyed all but the last 15 minutes of our meal when housekeeping decided it was time to start steaming the tablecloths for the evening service which was to begin in 2.5 hours. My wife asked if they could hold off until we finished but for some reason they would not.  We were moved to the lobby at which time my wife was escorted to the ladies room only to have a male attendant remain in the room.  With that, she was disgusted and left the restaurant and I followed.  \nWe had the menu Prestige with the wine pairing.  They set the pacing of the meal and everything was perfect until those unfortunate final minutes.\nThe service was outstanding and the finesse was superb.  We have dined at numerous great restaurants but have never been moved out of the dining room so they could prepare for the next seating.  I did ask for a manager but none was available.  We did not get to enjoy the dessert or the wine pairing for it.  We won't be back.  I would suggest that a manager stay in the establishment until the last service has been completed.\nMy original rating was a one star but in reflection the food and service was amazing until they were ready to begin preparations for the dinner seating.  A management failure.",

                "description": "****1000th Review****\nThis was my first Three Michelin star restaurant I have dined at and it did not disappoint. This small, intimate restaurant lives up to the hype and will be one of the best experiences you will have. For the price, I believe it is very reasonable for what they charge. Tasting menu with a high profile celebrity chef could easily cost way more than that price they charge.\nI suggest planning ahead on this one, it's a very small restaurant with a paced tasting menu. This isn't a place where you will walk up and get a seat. Plan ahead! The experience is awesome and I highly recommend trying to get a table here. The service is excellent and flow of the menu is just right. One piece of advice is to ask for the check, from what I was told USA vs Europe has different etiquette surrounding the check delivery. If you don't ask for it, you may sit awkwardly for a bit.\nThe food is amazing, this was the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. Everything start to finish was delicious and perfect. They cook at such a high level here, every dish on the menu is something I would order again. The food was so well prepared and lived up to the Michelin accolade, can't get much better than what they offer. I would go back here the first chance I got, wish this one was closer to me. This is my #1 meal and I encourage you to try them out!",

Of coz, I would expect more at one of 3 Michelin star restaurant in London. \nIt was NOT incredibly expensive as 3 Michelin star restaurant (compared with Paris).  \nWe ordered tasting menu and dishes were phenomenal!  \nPressed foie gras - It's light but tasty\nLobster Ravioli - It's so delicious\nPoached Halibut - presented beautifully but halibut taste a bit raw...\nLamb in 3 ways (Braised, confit and roasted) - it's cooked perfect on each way.\nRoast Pigeon - I would say Chinese Roast Pigeon a bit better.. LOL\nSoup **So different and special** - Pineapple coconut, it liked a drink than a soup to us. Taste so fresh and good.\nSorbet - English breakfast tea with mint.  We needed grind the mint by ourselves and put the sorbet into stone mortar and pestle. \nWhite chocolate covered strawberry sorbet balls - That's so cool with dry ice presentation\nLemon Parfait - I personally don't like sheep milk and didn't expect bergamot would taste so good with lemon parfait.\nAfter big meal, the manger chatted and  offered us to visit the kitchen.  It's pretty impressed for medium size kitchen and staffs can make such quality of dishes.",

In particular, the lamb was delicious but the ravioli and lemonade parfait were ordinary. I was hoping that this restaurant would top my list of favorite Michelin experiences in London, but unfortunately that didn't happen.

While my friend and I were traveling and exploring London I made sure to make reservations here. I was a little under the weather and had lost my voice. The staff was so kind they brought me hot chamomile tea with honey, on them. \nThe food was incredible. So flavorful but lite. I had a wonderful plate of roasted vegetables with a balsamic reduction and my friend had Gordon's signature suckling pig cooked 5 different ways. We enjoyed every bite surrounded by the most attentive service we've ever received. \nThe manager even offered us a tour of the kitchen! I guess it was obvious we were tourists but getting to see all of the chefs at work bustling around and how organized the back of the house was just made our experience that much more memorable. I am so thankful that I was able to experience something like that!",

                "description": "Shame on you, Gordon Ramsay. I feel robbed. I'm no food expert, but I do know what a true 3 star restaurant should feel and taste like. I had the pleasure of dinning at French Laundry a couple of years ago. This experience was a joke compared to it. \nFor my first trip to London, I begged my husband to dine at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. I was a huge fan. He agreed, and I was able to book a reservation 2 months in advance. I looked forward to this for 2 months. \nWhen time came to it, we dined, and I left feeling like I wasted my money. My husband and I both ordered the prestige tasting menu. (priced at £145 + added £10 cheese supplement)  The food was okay. It started good, then went down hill significantly after the main dish. My pigeon was overcooked, my dessert was lackluster, and the server forced me to eat bleu cheese even though I specified that I don't like bleu cheese after he asked for my preferences. \nThen it took the servers 30 minutes to give us the check. They ignored our table for the last half of the meal. This was such a disappointing experience. At £155 each, I expected much better. Not worth it.",

                "description": "It was my first time visiting London and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was one of reasons why I booked tickets to London. I watched every single tv show Gordon Ramsay was in because I was his big fan!\nWe went there on Oct 20, 2017. I have been checking opentable consistently every day for weeks and luckily got one a month before our trip to London.\nMy bf and I ordered the tasting menu each. Everything was wonderful and very flavorful.\nWe had Lemonade parfait and there was a piece of paper towel in my dessert. I have been to many michelin restaurants... but that never happened to me once, but it can happen. people can make mistakes... so I understood. I called the manager right away and notified the issue, and he brought us a complimentary dessert which was Manjari chocolate delice and guess what. I had a hair in that dessert this time.. hair stuck inside my dessert.. having issues twice in a row.. haha I couldn't believe it. what a great experience when you pay more than $700 for dinner and wine.. I was very surprised and disappointed at the same time. I immediately notified the issue again to different server (spoke to the oldest waiter.. because I couldn't find the same one)... and he brought a new dessert which I left almost more than a half because I already lost my interest in their food. He offered a kitchen tour and also offered some dessert wine as well. He tried so hard to make it up to us which is why I am giving them 2 stars, instead of 1.. \nAtmosphere here is great and very quite. so many waiters though.. they had almost the same number of waiters as customers. I also didnt understand the purpose of having a \"wine open performance\" - lighting up the candle while opening the wine, etc..\nI understand that Gordon Ramsay is a big inspiration to people, but I personally think this is what happen when the main chef is not in the kitchen.. All of staff was very kind. but I am truly sad and disappointed about what happened. I will still love Gordon Ramsay though!",

                "description": "Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a restaurant where I would travel back to London just to eat here. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a truly pampering experience. From the amazing service to the incredible food. Words cannot experience how wonderful our experience was here. \nHubby and I visited London a few months ago and while preparing for our trip, one of the first things we did was book a reservation several months in advance for dinner here. You can book your reservation on Opentable. \nOn the night of our reservation we hopped into a black cab and off we went to experience a night we will always remember. \nDo you know why I liked it? It is a restaurant is where you can chuck your tie, girls can wear flats, take a bottle to the face, and enjoy heavenly 3 star Michelin food with first class service.....with no judgement. My kind of night. \nHere are some of the highlights of our night : \n* The hilarious bellman/doorman out front who is the worlds best photographer. \n*Ladies, there is a small seat behind your table to place your purse. I loved this little touch of detail and consideration. \n*Intimate elegant dining room with cozy-comfy dining chairs. \n*If you are going with multiple people, have some fun sharing a seasonal menu and prestige menu. Although each experience is exquisite and delectable on its own, it becomes a higher level of complexity and extravagance when combined (in my hubby and I opinion). Especially during white truffle season. The planning of ingredients merged with platting of choice heightens ones senses boosting the excitement of sampling each piece of artwork(dish).  \n*Get a bottle, not a glass. Its acceptable/expected to get wine drunk here.\n*The great staff and service will keep you laughing and smiling the whole night. Their teamwork also is commendable. No one is ever sitting with a dirty empty plate, empty glass of wine, nor crumbs on the table ever. To pull off this feat in such a tight and small space while also working in sync with the kitchen staff is amazing.  (I probably appreciate and value this more due to the fact that I use to work in the food industry).  \n*Heavy fresh shavings from the enormous and fresh white truffle? Yes please! \n*People watching within any restaurant is always fun. For example, here it was fun to watch the different styles of table manners from around the world being used.\n*The staff in addition to their professional service are extremely open, friendly, yet chill which I love. They are open to telling you about their background/life and travel/food tasting plans. Its always fun to meet people from around the world and just simply have a quick chat. \nMichelin start restaurants are all about the experience and journey they take you on during your visit. Here, it is enough to make a special trip for another visit, which is what a 3 Michelin star stands for. \nExcellent!",

                "description": "My second UK three Michelin star experience left me even more impressed than my first in February. From the moment I stepped into the waiting room, I was attended to by a staff member at one point or another throughout the entire night. Michelin says that execution here is flawless and it really is-- I've griped about the waiter bumping into my dining partner's chair throughout the night at Eleven Madison Park and the bizarre music that was played at Alain Ducasse, but the attention to detail given at Gordon Ramsay was unbelievable. The maitre d', Jean Claude, is world class. He memorized my name and addressed me by it every time he came and chatted with me.\nFor food, I selected the menu prestige option:\n 1) Pressed foie gras: Foie gras doesn't really do anything for me regardless of the restaurant, but this course was still extremely pleasant.\n2) Ravioli: a single piece was all that was needed. Absolute savory perfection, it's been on the menu for 23 years for a reason\n3) Poached Isle of Gigha Halibut. Looks like a pillow of air, and tastes just the same. It melted in my mouth with no bad fishy after taste.\n4) Braised, confit and roasted lamb: a selection of five different cuts of lamb, all of which were  the most tender I've had. The confit lamb was unbelievable.\n5) Selection of cheeses from the trolley: I selected one of each of the different groupings of cheese, and told my waiter \"the stronger, the better.\" He did not disappoint. Their fromagerie is local in the Marylebone district of London\n6) Sorbet: I had to work for this one-- my instruction was to crush the liquid nitrogen dried mint in my mortar and pestle bowl, and roll the sorbet around it.\n7) Lemon parfait: Simply exquisite, and a perfect finish to this meal\n8) Bonus course: I'll leave this one for you to find out on your own ;)\nI'll be back to England in February for a visit to the Waterside Inn so I'll have a third of now five (to include Araki's addition to the three star list) to compare then.",

Service was definitely what was expected from a three Michelin star restaurant. The food surprised me. Each dish had an individual taste that foreign to my taste buds. I adored how there were so much contrast in each dish that made the flavors pop. Presentation was well put together. The only complaint I would truly say I had was that towards the end, I did feel that timing was a little off. It might be from my slight jet lag, but I was nodding off during the last two courses. Great experience and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great food.",

                "description": "I won't be posting all pictures as I think they are the same as all recent reviews. So just the two worth noting is one on duck foie gras - excellent crispy on the outside and buttery inside. It was quite heated-warm on the outside but just cold-warm inside. The halibut was superb. Never had it this way. Very soft like sashimi.\n \nPros - when you go to a 3 stars mich resto, you expect your dishes to be superb. Yes you will get superb food.\n \nCons - We were 10min late. And upon arrival, we were advised that we may need to drink our coffee outside at the reception area. Is that how you treat your guest?\n \nTables are really small for two-persons. Need to relocate my glasses everytime when food came.\n \nTables are really crowded as well. The person from the other table next to me was really just right next to me.\n \nThe dining area is really packed and busy. Waiters and waitresses were walking back and forth non-stops, not serving food tho, just checking on people to see if they were finished or not. Keep on coming up to refill the water even just after one sip. Gosh, so stressed. Not really fine-dinig atmosphere.\n \nWaiters were fine. But the waitresses all look so uptight and no smile at all...\n \nI think what put together a 3-star resto means more than just the food. Also the atmosphere, services, comfortness. Gordon Ramsay's resto only has quality food. All the other 3 points are lacking. I would just give it a 2-star...",

The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed.  \nThe service is impeccable from the moment you walk in. \nThe food was exquisite to look at and as delicious tasting.  We had the menu prestige and every course was worthy of all three stars.",

                "description": "This was by far, the most expensive, yet the most amazing gastronomic experience I've ever had in my life. \nWith 3 menus to choose from, I did the classic tasting menu to get the full treatment. To make a long story short, each of the items that I had were prepared beautifully (just look at the photos), oh and they all tasted very good to brilliant. \nI was up sold on the truffle pasta special, The fancy ordeal of the truffle shavings and the sauce was great fun at 35 pounds.\nWhat made my bill go so astronomical after it was all said and done (346 pounds but who's counting), was ordering glasses of wine, willy-nilly, not realizing the price or not caring, to be quite honest.\nOverall, I was completely satisfied, amazed, and had the best eating experience of my entire life! In fact at the end of the event the maître d' took me into the kitchen to take a look! I loved that. I don't know if he did it out of pity or they normally do that but I loved it. \nWas it worth the cost, no... but would I do it again... yes - but knowing what I know now, I'll be a little more strategic in what I order and thus, more cost-effective.",

                "description": "My wife and I ate at the restaurant on Monday, November 20th, 2017. We were one of the first tables seated for the evening.\nInitially, things were going great. We were greeted nicely, the staff helped us to take off our coats and escorted us to our table. We both ordered the Menu Prestige and asked for the selection of cheeses to be added on.\nThen, our experience went downhill. I ordered a wine supplement with my meal. This included five glasses of wine for a price of around £110-130. This price range was specified in the menu. After ordering, one of the servers came up to the table and asked us who is paying for the bill. Then, he opened the menu to the page that listed the price of the wine supplement, and asked us if we are aware of the cost. I was very confused by this - I've never been asked if I was aware of the cost of something I was ordering. It seemed a bit insulting - as if we would not be able to afford the (very reasonable) price. Neither my wife nor I were under-dressed for this occasion of a fancy dinner. I even wore a tie. The service continued to be rather pretentious throughout dinner, as if we were being looked down upon.\nOn to the food. The initial courses were outstanding - the foie gras, the ravioli, and the poached halibut. Unfortunately, the mains were underwhelming. My wife did not enjoy her roast pigeon and I did not feel that the lamb was anything special - definitely not for a three-star restaurant. The dessert was tasty but not particularly memorable.\nThe experience of the cheese course was strange. Our server brought a trolley, from which we could make a selection of four. My wife and I asked our server for recommendations and he asked us what cheeses we liked and did not like. We stated that we did not like bleu cheese or similar cheeses. He insisted that we must try it and placed it on our plate against our wishes. We decided not to make a fuss about it.\nAfter eating and having our table cleared, we awkwardly waited around 20 minutes for the bill. Eventually, we got the attention of one of the servers, who did apologize for taking so long with the bill. We felt that given the price we were paying for the experience, such a wait was unwarranted.\nWhen the bill did arrive, we seem to have been overcharged for the selection of cheeses. The price on the menu was £10, but we were charged £18 each. I did not notice until we have left the restaurant, and going back or calling to complain over £16 seemed unnecessary. The lack of attention regarding billing was a bit disappointing. Perhaps the menus need to be updated if the price did, in fact, change. I've uploaded a photo of our bill, along with a screenshot of the menu from the restaurant's website.\nOverall, my wife and I were not happy with the experience. We have eaten at three-star and one-star restaurants prior to visiting Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and have had much better experiences at each of them. We did not expect to be so disappointed by Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.",

Sorbet at end of meal looked kind of like a turd.\nWine:  not sure how a wine pairing with their tasting menu isn't a standard request...  \nService:  A member of our party had a nut allergy.  They served her a dish with a nut in it.  They said there wasn't a nut in it.  But there was.  She could have died.  Good thing she mushed up stuff under the fish before taking a bite.  Staff didn't really care about how big their fuckup was.  The reason for the fuckup is because:  a) too many people involved and b) they take the weekend off so when Friday night comes around, everyone is already checked out.\nBottom line:  Gordon Ramsey checked out of this place a long time ago to move onto bigger things.",

Not hovering, but exceptionally cognizant of what you need. They're attentive & friendly, willing to answer questions.\nFood (vegetarian review):  outstanding. And filling. By the 4th course or so, it was getting to the point of uncomfortably full. \nThey have a vegetarian menu that has several choices to piece together a 3 course meal. It does not include dessert- it's an add-on.\nYou can opt to make it a 7 course ('prestige') meal as well, which is pretty much everything on the vegetarian menu (you have to choose between a cheese plate or a soup). It comes with both desserts. \nI'm sure the menu changes, but they did some cool things- I crushed leaves in a mortar w/a pestle as part of dessert, balls of ice cream came out in dry ice, and there were all sorts of crackle-y, crispy things to crunch your way through. \nDress code: \nMen- no running shoes, Vans or Converse. They'll make you change into a loaner pair, and they might not have your size- my husband had to wear a pair that looked like clown shoes. \nLadies- jeans are ok. Same as above. I assume guys can wear jeans as well (nice jeans), but not 100% sure. \nAt the end of the meal, they'll offer to call you a cab.\nGreat experience!",

While I had high expectations, I was also quite excited to try this restaurant.\nSeared foie gras (5/5): this was very well done. the pairing of the flavor with the sauces and the cherry was outstanding. Also because i just LOVE foie gras.\nPigeon (3/5): while I do like pigeons and the skin was crispy and delicious... this dish was way too salty. The saltiness overpowered the taste of the pigeon and the other wonderful ingredients.\nLemon yogurt dessert (4/5): i forgot the exact name of the dessert but it was kind of citrusy with some goat yogurt, if I remember correctly. It was delicious but not something that was spectacular. Though, the presentation was beautiful.\nService was lovely though, and the ambiance top-notch.",

At one point, a server poured sparkling water in my glass half full of still water...And it was quite clear that the still bottled water was in front of my glass and the sparkling water bottle was in front of my boyfriend's....So that was strange. There was a lot of hovering and a lack of smooth rotation, in my mind.

We loved our conversations with Jean Claude the maitre d.  He has a fantastic way of connecting with people and made us feel so warm and welcomed. \nWe decided to go.with the 3 course lunch menu and ordered the Buckwheat gnocchi and Dexter beef tartar, followed by the Roast Cornish skate and roast venison and finally finishing off with the custard tart. It's hard to say which was our favorite because they all tasted so fantastic and hard to single out one.\nIn addition to what we ordered, we were presented with many surprises from the chef that were so delicious that words alone cannot describe what we had. The complexity of the flavors and beauty of the presentation was phenomenal. Hats of to Matt Abe, head chef, which we had the great pleasure of meeting when Jean Claude invited us to a kitchen tour. \nThere is a reason this is a 3 Michelin star restaurant and it was well worth it.The food and staff shine here.",

                "description": "This is one of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in London so I have decided to splash out and try it since I am a foodie.  \nThis establishment is located in Chelsea and it is quite a walk from the tube station so do plan your journey a bit.  We were lucky to get a table for 2 about 3 weeks before the reservation date as I think there was some cancellation.\nThe restaurant is actually quite small and very intimate.  I was hoping the atmosphere was going to be quite chilled and relaxed.  However, due to the number of people in the room, everyone was talking away and it is actually quite noisy for a Michelin starred restaurant.  I was here with a friend and not a date so it didn't really bothered me.\nThe service was beyond perfect and I give them full marks for it.  Very attentive waiters and waitresses and no mistake done.  We are not locals and we could see quite a few tables with foreigners here but everyone was treated with respect and with no attitude.  This is what makes a good restaurant.  \nThe wine list is extensive.  We asked the sommelier to recommend wines that go well with our courses and all of them were perfectly paired.  If you want to pair it with your 7 courses, it is usually about £100 per person but you may have less and pay less so it really is up to you. \nI am not going to go into details on each of the dishes that I have tried.  I had the seasonal tasting menu and my friend had the prestige tasting menu.  The pictures that I have posted speaks for itself and what you will be expecting from the dishes.  We also tried a bit of each other's food so that we know how the food was compared to other Michelin star restaurants.  \nUnfortunately for us, the food I have to say is not up to a 3 Michelin star quality.  Maybe we went in expecting too much from this restaurant but I have been to some 1 & 2 starred restaurants and the flavour and taste of their food did surpass Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.  I believe that the quality and taste of the food is more geared towards a 1 star quality especially for the price that I am paying.  The Prestige menu was priced at £145 and the Seasonal menu was priced at £175.  Of course, the Seasonal menu tasted better than the Prestige menu since it is more expensive.  \nI think this is a one in a lifetime experience which I agree as it is after all a 3 Michelin star restaurant from Gordon Ramsay.  However, I don't think I will come back as we came here to give a 3 star a try.  Just not value for money and definitely not a 3 Michelin star I was expecting food wise.  Sorry but I do think you guys can definitely do better on the food.  The rating I have provided reflects the value and also the quality & flavour of the food when compared with other Michelin starred restaurants I have tried.",

My cousin and I each had the menu prestige, and made slightly different choices to try to cover as much variety as possible. (see photos)\nMy favorite dish was the ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon. What really blew me away was the texture of the dish. It was perfectly folded and completely packed full of seafood. \nTo keep it short, every dish was cooked exactly as described to perfection. The dishes are influenced by local flavors (you'll see it in the herbs, especially) so it is a good way to become intimate with that cuisine. \nThe decor could have used a little help. The wood paneling on the walls makes me think they're getting ready to pack up and close shop. The seating is intimate, and we had a wonderful table right next to the window. \nThe service itself from making the reservation to leaving the restaurant was beyond expectation. No detail is too small for their staff.",

They brought out a small starter to awaken the taste buds which was a truffle mouse in an egg shell.  My first Course was the lobster ravioli which was stuffed with delicious lobster meat and my husband had the homemade pasta dish w a frothy prosciutto sauce. For second course I had the lamb which prepared in a few different ways and my husband has the Red Deer Venison. Both were great...of course my lamb was the best! ;) For dessert we both had the cheese Course which came out on a large cart. It was glorious! We ended with coffee which they bring to everyone with some tasty little treats. \nI was so stuffed!! The wine list was all I could have hoped for too with plenty of Bordeaux to chose from! And they even took us on a tour of the kitchen! \nI highly recommend! Of course as a Michelin star restaurant be ready to pull out your wallet!",

The fare matched or exceeded the finest of our US dining experiences, including the French Laundry. Our son had a huge smile and his camera ready as each impeccably-served course was laid before him, including the apple gratin with caramel sauce for 2, which he polished off all on his own. We were prepared to splurge on a 'prestige' wine and were pleasantly surprised when the sommelier (1 of 3 on duty that night) helped us choose a reasonably priced and delicious Argentinian Carmenere. We typically prefer our meals a bit more rustic, but would count this in our top 3 meals of all time.",

I was really looking forward to this, I've been a Gordon Ramsay fan for a long time and couldn't leave London without experiencing this for myself.  As a matter of fact, I picked the dates for our visit to London based on the time I could get a reservation!\nOur reservation was for 6pm, and our plan was to come a little early and start with a cocktail at the bar.  We accomplished this, except Restaurant Gordon Ramsay wasn't open when we arrived, so we found ourselves at Maize Grill also owned by Gordon Ramsay.  That was a great experience too, but back to this review.  \nEverything at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is very precise. Every member of staff gives you a great deal of attention. The dining room itself is fairly small, it can't be easy to maneuver around room without running into each other, but they do a flawless job.  They don't quite stand by your table, but they politely guide you through the experience.  There were two sommeliers to make recommendations as well as to serve and explain the wine with each course.  \nEven as efficient as the staff is our meal lasted three hours (and I was trying to go slowly!) This is the first Michelin stared restaurant I've ever been to and it sets the bar quite high for any experiences yet to come.",

We had the last reservation time for the afternoon service and you could not tell that it was the end of service.  We were treated like anyone else without any rush or hurry.  Service was excellent and white gloved.  Waiters, waitresses and head of the house was very informative, friendly and very knowledgeable of their food.   We had their seasonal menu.  Presentation of each course was absolutely a work of art! It broke my heart to eat them but once I took the first bite my heart mended and was filled with love and warmth of the chief's hard work.  \nBeing the last patron in the dinning room, we were invited by the manager to take a tour of the kitchen.  WOW! We were shocked on how many chef's were in there.  From entrees, pastry, and dishware section, it was such a delight to go into the kitchen and to be shown around.  Too bad that we didn't run into Gordon Ramsey but we were told that he does stop by often to cook and run service.  \nThe experience was a delight and I am truly honored to have eaten here.",

                "description": "Wow.\nHonestly, did you expect anything else? The volatile celebrity chef really does know what he's doing when it comes to restaurants. \nEasily the best dinner experience of my life.\nCame here on a Monday evening with 2 other acquaintances visiting from Italy. Since we are all from America and only staying in Europe for short time, we figured we might as well treat ourselves to a extremely special dinner. \nThe service was wonderful. The sommelier, instinctively telling that we were college students, gave my friends (I don't drink) a cheap but wonderful wine recommendation, which they eagerly accepted. The matire'd, apparently renowned in London for his welcoming nature, greeted us, asked where we were from, and genuinely seemed interested in a trio of kids that didn't seem to belong. \nAll three of us got the tasting menu, The food was stunning. Everything was prepared incredibly carefully, and the presentation was a visual masterpiece. We couldn't help but to take pictures of the food, which I feared would make us stand out in a room of the mature and sophisticated. \nIt started with a small collection of starters that included scotch eggs. Next camethe pressed Foie Gras, which had a smooth texture and sweet tartness to it due to the green apples.Then we moved onto the Isle of Gigha Halibut, which was presented with this ras el hanout infused broth. The flowers that laid atop the delicate fish were a delightful surprise, both visually and in flavor.\nThe Ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon is undeniably the star of the show, being one of the signature dishes. Easily the best ravioli I've ever had in my life, I was saddened when it so quickly disappeared off my plate. I eased the pain away by licking the delicious bisque that accompanied it.\nNext were the Cotswold lamb, Mango Jasmine and passion fruit soup, Cucumber sorbet (which was used as a palate cleanser), and finally dessert with Lemonade parfait. The Lemonade parfait was truly an incredible way to finish off the meal. It was possibly the most beautifully extravagant concept for a dessert I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The transparent sauce that aligned the plate was especially delicious. \nAfter our meal, the matire'd actually invited us into the kitchen. We were eager to see Claire and thank her for the meal, but unfortunately she had left by the time we finished. The kitchen trip was a unique experience in its own right, as I have never seen the kitchen of a restaurant before, much less that of a 3-star Michelin one!\nAfterwards, our maitre'd bid us farewell, wishing us a good night and safe travels back to our respective homes in the states. I was astonished he actually remembered all of our cities, but in retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised such an impressive man would be in charge of such an incredible restaurant.\nIt's been a few months since that night, but I still look back upon it with fondness. Hopefully one day I will be able to return to Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and enjoy another unforgettable meal.",

The pig skin was the best I have ever had, ever. To get that texture takes a lot of experience and time. Great great dishes.\nThe compressed foie gras is complex. The texture and temperature were done perfectly but the dish came out underwhelming in taste and seasoning.

                "description": "I won't go into a lot of detail here, there are legions of other reviews for that.  The key points about my experience:\n1.  The food was phenomenal\n2. We were treated a little weirdly at times\nHere's some detail on point 2: We are American, we are well versed in fine dining.  Does anyone come here who isn't?  You can't exactly walk in off the street or stumble into a reservation...  Anyway, the first weird thing was that we requested the wine pairings.  The pairing isn't like a typical tasting menu where there is a published price, they give you a range because they claim to select wines on a case by case basis after discussing likes and dislikes with you.  That's fine.  The weird thing was that when my husband told a server that we were interested in pairings, she asked us who was hosting the dinner.  We were perplexed, never having been asked that question before, there were only two of us (married couple).  After a painful few moments we discerned that she was asking who would be paying for dinner and then verified that we were okay with the range of prices that had been printed on the menu that we had *just* been perusing.  Yes, we ordered the pairings, we are prepared to pay within the listed price range.  The second weird thing was when we selected our chosen main course.  I ordered the pigeon (or squab as we yanks call it) and the server (I think the GM?) asked if I was fine with it being cooked med. rare.  I said yes, that is fine with me, that is how I prefer it.  It seemed as if he didn't quite believe me and then basically proceeded to try to talk me out of going with the chef's recommendation.  He said \"I don't know, are you sure?  It is served *quite pink*, we can cook it more for you if you prefer...\"  I'm not sure what this was about, perhaps they've been burned by too many stupid Americans sending back a beautifully cooked dish to be cooked more?  Or I was just being profiled as a dumb woman who doesn't know anything?  I can't be sure.  Regardless, the squab was perfection and I ate every bite.  Perhaps this gentleman recognized that he'd misjudged us, he gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal, presumably to compensate for his somewhat poor behavior earlier in the meal.\nUltimately, the meal was fantastic, the food was fabulous and the weirdness didn't ruin it, but I thought it was notable, I've never been treated this way in such a highly regarded restaurant before.\nHopefully someone from the restaurant reads this so that they can take the feedback, but I have a feeling that management at establishments such as R GR don't give a hoot about yelp reviews...",

                "description": "So we made reservations for two people six months ahead of time as that was how far out they were booked \nI had the Menu Prestige (£145) and my date had the Season Inspiration Menu (£195)- both choices were terrific in their own right. The evening started off with three little sets of complimentary dim sum-like gems from the kitchen. Each bite was exquisite and we saw that no two tables had quite the same complimentary gems to start. Good touch! \nThe plates from Menu Prestige are as follows: \n1. Pressed foie gras, green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - This was good but it wasn't as good as the other dishes. \n2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel - This was easily the best savory dish from the whole set. It was just heavenly. \n3. Isle of Gigha halibut, Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth - The prettiest broth I have ever seen - it reminded me of colorful sakura blossoms drifting about on pond water. \n4. Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey, orange and sautéed foie gras (you can opt for the Cotswold lamb if you wanted to) - this was the main dish. They used every part of the pigeon and it was cooked to perfection. \n5. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Simple, wildly fragrant and not too sweet - it was perfect \n6. Green apple sorbet with chamomile and marigold - This dish had the most interesting presentation; you are given a mortar and pestle to pound away (gracefully of course) at the frozen herbs to be eaten with the green apple sorbet. Refreshing!\n7. Lemonade parfait, honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet - The most amazing dessert presentation that I have ever seen. The honey had been crystallized to form a perfect centerpiece to complement the yogurt sorbet. \nAfter we were done with our dinner, we were invited back to see the magic in the kitchen. Amazing service and superior attention to detail from the whole staff. Best dinner experience in London.",

I better walk away with something to remember, something deserving of praise, and something that will make me say...i will never be able to make that myself.  Well, the halibut in the lime and rose infused broth is to die for.  I spent a good minute just smelling, starring, and appreciating this work of art.  It was so beautiful, my heart cried a little as I carved into the masterpiece.  But then the joy was restored as a party ensued in my mouth.  Unforgettable. \nMy party was the last to leave the restaurant and it was already past midnight, but we didn't feel rushed at all.  If every dinner was like this, I think I would die an extremely happy and round-bodied glutton.\nThe loss of a star is simply secondary to comparison with other 3 michelin star restaurants I've been to...gotta have some standard of comparison!

From the outside, it looks so unsuspecting \n- It gets quiet noisy actually as the people fill in\n{SERVICE}: 5/5\n- One of the best, always someone to be folding your napkin when you go to the restroom or to help you out of the chair. \n- Staff was very welcoming and took the time to explain the menu to us commoners and give recommendations :p \n- They even took out my fish and showed me how it smelled before serving it to me all nicely plated \n{FOOD}: 4/5 ~ Everything was good and plated amazingly, but it was nothing impressive.

They give you a bunch of entremets in between courses.  \n[Appetizers] \n- Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel: Um it seriously looks like a giant wonton and taste like a wonton.

The server told me it was one of their signature dishes that had been on the menu for 10+ years.\n- Pan Fried Sea Scallops: Yum, the sauce was especially lovely. \n- Cornish Brown and King Crab with radishes, kombu, sesame and oyster emulsion: Similar to a crab salad? I kept thinking it looked like a imitation crab salad from a Japanese restaurant. But it tasted way better and was quite delicious\n[Entree] \n- Roast Pigeon: Never tried pidgeon before and it was a intriguing experience. It's definitely something to try! I liked it very much and just taste a bit like duck.\n- Cotswold Lamb: Definitely worth to get. The meat was so tender and great. \n- Cornish Turbot: Just amazing, the fish was so buttery and just melted in your mouth. They bring out the fish for you to see before they plate it and smelled wonderful.. \n- Filet of sea bass: was alright. \n[Dessert] \n- Souffle: a MUST get. This was the best dessert by far. The souffle was so poofy and tasted absolutely like a cloud. Just stunning. \n- Caramelised tarte Tatin of apples with tahitin vanilla ice cream: Just like a giant apple pie honestly. Two people have to order this but I thought it was too much for me to handle half so I just ended up eating the apples lol. \n- Caramel Milk Chocolate, praline and malt mousse with treacle granola and hazelnut milk: A very beautiful chocolate cake pretty much. Would recommend if you like taking photos of pretty food or chocolate desserts. \nOverall, the experience was quiet pleasant and nothing less expected from a 3 michelin star restaurant. However, I saw nothing special and unique about it.",

Disappoint.\nThe whole \"performance\" the waiters put on is just perfection. You can not find service like this in america. From the pulling out your chair, to a brand new glass/silverware with each plate, to sweeping the crumbs off your table because the pig you are. Every single dish I had was an eye opening shock. The combination of flavors were out of this world. I had a very late reservation so I was able to get a mini tour of the kitchen which makes you feel a little important. This place is a must if you're ever in London and are prepared to spend at least 350 pounds on yourself alone. \ntreat yo self.",

                "description": "Three Michelin stars does not disappoint!\nMy husband is a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and so when we were planning our trip to London we had to stop off and eat at one of his restaurants!\nWe planned the trip very last minute so we were not hopeful of getting a reservation. As everyone says, looks like you have to book months in advance to secure a table, we had weeks lol. I watched the opentable reservations like a hawk and managed to score a last minute lunch reservation for a Thursday!\nMake sure you leave ample time to make your reservation as we had to call an uber to get over to the Chelsea area as there was a tube strike occurring. \nWe made it on time and were seated at once. The service was impeccable. We were started off with a glass of champagne followed by our choose of butter and breads. There's one with bacon, a pretzel roll, and Irish soda bread. All the breads are delicious so you should have all of them and a lot of them as much as you can!!\nThen comes the hard part, what to eat? We were really tempted to try the prestige menu which had 7 courses which is what the restaurant was known for but it was lunch time and we wanted to save room for more snacks and food as we explored London a little more. So we went with the 3 course lunch menu and added on wine pairings for our starters and mains. I had the agnolotti with fresh peas as a starter while my husband went for the steak tartare. My agnolotti pasta was soo good. The flavors were very delicate but had a lot of flavor! My husband looked happy with his steak tartare as well.\nFor the mains, I ordered the Cornish cod while my husband ordered the poussin. I loved all the flavors of the cod and loved the shiitake mushrooms. The poussin was cooked very well as well.\nThe funest part was the desserts. Not only were our desserts delicious, we got extra desserts as well! The white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls were served in a tin with dry ice so that was a fun effect! My favorite of the extra dessert with the peanut butter brittle. Soo good.\nYes it's worth the money to come here! The service and food here are all top notch! I'll be watching the dinner reservations on opentable to come back for the prestige menu!!!",

I think my expectation was too high. \nWe got the 7 courses menu. \nPros: \nI thought the portions were just right. \nGreat service! - but with one oops at the end by the biller. For some reason, she was unable to comprehend splitting the bill by 1/3 and 2/3. It took 3 tries to get it right. \nThe food overall looked good and tasted decent. \nThis was by far the most expensive chef choice I've tried so far likely because the pound is so expensive. For some reason, the food just did have enough wow factor for me. Definitely not bad food though. \nMy favorite were the cucumber sorbet mixed in the mint, lemon verbena and burnet salad. Very creative and tasted refreshing. \nWe also had:\nFoie Gras with green apples, turnips watercress and smoked duck. - well prepared but did not leave a lasting memory in my palate. \nLobster Ravioli - somewhat bland for my taste. \nHalibut with King Crab and lime, Cauliflower Cous-Cous and Ras el hangout infused broth - The broth compliment the halibut really well. The flavor was fresh. The fish was cook to perfection. The dish was also very pretty. I enjoyed this dish a lot. \nCotswold Lamb with vegetable  \nBresse pigeon\n- both decent but not memorable.\nGood one time experience.",

                "description": "Had the opportunity to come here for Valentine's Day. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the world. Things to take note of is that this restaurant and it's staff/chefs are extremely well trained. The design of the restaurant is simple and elegant, allowing for the service and food to shine.\n- The service staff is phenomenal. They are attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable. They seem to make it a priority to anticipate your needs. It is almost as if they can read your mind. Their timing and delivery of service is impeccable.\n- The cooks/chefs have food put together and delivered in appropriate time. Every dish was always spot-on, well plated, eye catching, and of course delicious beyond words. Every item we received from the menu had obviously been very well thought out. Flavors worked/melded in a way that accented the ingredients used to develop a symphony of deliciousness. Though I enjoyed every dish, the one item that would consistently bring me back to the UK and this restaurant would definitely be their ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon in a light bisque with lemongrass and chervil velouté. That is bar none, one of the most wonderful things I have ever had. I was literally licking that plate clean. \nIn my experience with all the restaurants that I have visited in the world, this is by far one of the front runners and very deserving of it's Michelin stars. The service is a dream and the food is so wonderful that I doubt even the magic of a unicorn and skilled fingers of Santa's elves could possibly make any better. Bravo Mr. Ramsay, bravo.",

They say that you should go out of your way and even travel to a country for a three star restaurant, but this food was more on par with the one stars I've been too. In fact, my favorite part of the meal was the dessert, a grapefruit custard with mascarpone sorbet. The main, roast venison, was quite well-prepared but nothing to write home about. It was not impressive. The service, too, was quite rude. My group of 6 was not treated the same as the other clients, as we were obviously half the age as everyone and were from America. We were not seated immediately because our last party member was not there yet, but another group after us was seated immediately even though they said they were waiting for someone as well. What's more, our friend was made to change into leggings from her jeans, which is totally acceptable given their dress code, but then we saw another woman with shorts on who had not been made to change. Additionally, the host kept on asking us if we knew what tartare and venison were and asked us to tell him what it was just to make sure we knew... if we didn't know, would we be there ordering it? Overall quite disappointed by the incongruence between price and taste as well as the rudeness of the service.",

Having gone to most of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in the Bay Area (aside from Manresa at the time of writing), I was looking forward to trying out this place on my visit to London. We came during lunch time (they open their reservation MONTHS in advance, and at 4 months before, I was only able to grab lunch spots). Their menu availability is the same for lunch and dinner, in addition to a lunch special menu that they only offer during lunch time. My boyfriend and I went a la carte during our meal. As always, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and I decided to go with the option that lets you try every dessert they have. I didn't realized how big their portion sizes are, so by the time dessert came, I was already way too full. I got the foie gras for appetizer and fish for entree. They're definitely more of a \"traditional\" fine cuisine place. So if you're into traditional French cuisine such as The French Laundry, this is your place. My boyfriend and I prefer more adventurous takes on cuisine (our favorite is Benu in SF), so the food here is a bit boring. But don't get me wrong, the food was amazing and perfectly prepared!",

                "description": "Gordon Ramsay creates the most unsurpassed French cuisine in London's culinary scene.\nFor some, the word \"London\" spawns images of famous monuments like Big Ben, the London Eye, and Buckingham Palace. Others imagine the cabbies, fashion, and pub scene. \nBut hardly anyone can attest that London is known for delicious food. The statement itself is an oxymoron.\nUntil you try Gordon Ramsay's in Chelsea.\nI have been a huge GR fan since the first season of Hell's Kitchen. Attending a live dinner service is on my bucket list just to try a dollop of his award-winning sauces. And even though Gordon may have his anger management issues on the show, the man can cook. Then I realized, what am I waiting for?? I should just come to him! So I did...\nBut don't take my word for it. Ask Michelin. Gordon Ramsay is a recipient of three prestigious Michelin Stars, the highest accolade one can receive by the Michelin brothers. \nThe Michelin guide began in 1900 as a handy-dandy manual for those traveling within Europe for reliable gas stations, eateries, and service tips. In 1933, it launched its Red Guide that inspected restaurants all around Europe under the highest caliber of secrecy and standards. The inspectors to this day are anonymous (even the parents don't know their line of work), and the secret diners are funded by the Michelin company, not the restaurant. \nThe grading scale is 1 to 3 stars: One being good in its category, two being excellent and worth a detour, and three being exceptional and worth a journey in itself. The Michelin grading system has received worldwide respect and to date, less than 100 restaurants around the globe have been bequeathed with the 3-star honor.\nWith that said, I was beyond excited to try this place. I had booked my reservation at least four months before I set foot in London. Service was spot-on with our waiter epitomizing the perfect blend of cordialness and humor. He grew up in Dijon (France) and was extremely passionate about the menu. My bf and I ordered the Prestige Menu and the Seasonal Inspirations Course. \nEach seven-course dish was impeccably crafted and presented. The poached lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli held remarkable flavor. My foie gras was embedded with the sweet juice of duck confit and pickled pears. The next protein courses were the halibut and suckling pig with crispy skin that I could have nibbled on the entire evening. After the soup, cheese and fruit course, we were pretty stuffed. But lo and behold, the desserts shined brightest for us. \nOne was a Milk Chocolate Truffle Tree. This literally was a silver tree stand with truffle-infused chocolates awaiting our degustation delights. Like Ancient Romans plucking grapes off one-by-one, we fed each other these signatures confections with smiles and laughs. The second dessert was a White Chocolate and Strawberry Ice Cream platter on dry ice. As if that wasn't enough, the best was yet to come.\nThe most memorable part of this experience was being secretly escorted \"behind the scenes\" to the kitchen where all the magic happens. When the manager found out that we had visited all the way from Hawaii, they asked if we'd like to see the chefs at work. Unfortunately, Chef Gordon himself was in New York but Chef Patron Clare Smyth (Chef of the Year winner by UK Food Guide and the only female UK Chef to win 3 Michelin Stars) was leading the team, mastering the finishing touches on every dish sent out. Their kitchen was absolutely spotless, and every member of the kitchen was working harmoniously like instruments perfecting the tunes before it hit the audience's ears.\nI still remember the tray of mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup about to be served to the dining room, poised in a champagne flute and glass straw. Chef Clare stopped the waiter and placed a drop of sugar water on the end of each straw to ensure it was perfectly presented in taste and vision. \nThis experience took my breath away and we talk about it every so often when we relive our European getaways. I look forward to meeting Chef Gordon in person one day to express my gratitude to him and his staff for a lifetime of delicious memories.",

From the greetings to the last gesture when we were leaving, the service was not too much or on your face. The maitre d, knowing we were tourist, chatted with us a bit, sharing his story too. It was a nice touch. My glass of water was never empty for more than 8 seconds, it was that attentive. All were professional and friendly, definitely the true definition of dining service. \nThe food was too perfect, every single bite was memorable and if only I could keep the sensation in a jar and savor the moment again and again. We ordered the 3 course dinner menu, and let me tell you outright, the amuse bouche were as good, and some were even better than the 3 course menu. My personal favorite is this white egg, potato soup and truffle serve in an egg shell. I did not know it was a potato until I asked (I guess I missed their explanation at the start, probably admiring their accent too much). And also this strawberry ice cream dessert something. \nI had the lobster ravioli for appetizer and it was super juicy and easily be my second favorite. My friend ordered the foie gras. We ordered pigeon and suckling pig for entree and then we opted for the all-dessert menu. I would run out of vocabulary to describe all the food here and will sound repetitive because every description will entail the word \"excellent, perfect, outstanding, impeccable, splendid and unmatched\". \nA true and special dining experience.",

                "description": "Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a 3 Michelin Starred Restaurant in a quiet area of London. I unfortunately made the same mistake of booking a very late reservation (the only one available a few weeks ago) and sure enough, this was not as great of an overall experience as I'd hoped. Made the same mistake of booking 9:30 PM reservations at three other NYC 3 Michelin Star restaurants (Le Bernadin, Jean Georges and Daniel before it lost a star) and all of them were just OK to me - nothing special whatsoever. You would think that a restaurant is responsible for quality no matter what the time but I'm finding that this just isn't the case consistently. \nWhen it comes to high end \"French\" restaurants, you hold a very high standard to how every dish is prepared and that the flavors of the courses are that which you only find at that restaurant in the entire world. Other Yelpers had a great experience but again, I'm assuming that the late reservation impacted our total experience completely. \nMy girlfriend and I entered and were walked to our table in the very minimalistic yet cozy dining room. Most of the tables were filled but I can presume that since it was already 9:30 PM, some diners already finished their dinner.\nYou have the option of an a la carte, a traditional Prestige menu or a \"Seasonal Inspiration\" menu. What is cool is that you aren't obligated to order one menu per table so my girlfriend requested the Prestige and I did the Seasonal.\nThe Seasonal one:\n1) Poached Langoustine with caviar and celery - Surprisingly very fishy and did not taste at all fresh. Did not finish.\n2) Linguine with black truffle and mushroom - Excellent!!\n3) Dover sole - Another fishy flavor unfortunately. Did not finish.\n4) Roasted loin of Highland Venison - The gamiest venison I've ever eaten at any Michelin Star restaurant.\n5) Vacherin Fondue - So good!!!! A very great flavor on a traditional cheese fondue.\n6) Lime Sorbet with shiso and coconut mousse - Pretty good but not memorable\n7) Clementine Parfait with orange mint and lemon thyme - Pretty good but not memorable\nThe Prestige menu:\n1) Pressed Foie Gras with green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - Enjoyed\n2) Ravioli with lobster, langoustine, salmon, oxalis and wood sorrel - Again felt was fishy but she enjoyed\n3) Poached isle of Gigha halibut - Alright but not memorable\n4) Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey and blood orange - GAMEY\n5) Soup with mango, jasmine and passion fruit - Good\n6) Sorbet with green apple, chamomile and marigold - Alright but not memorable\n7) Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt - Very good\nThey ended the meal with pretty cool white chocolates (I believe) that came out in a very smokey box. \nService was impeccable for sure. The food and experience were just not my taste compared to every other 3 Star around the world - the fish were fishy tasting and the meats were gamey and difficult to cut and eat (not cooked all that well).\nAlso not a fan that they didn't leave us with any takeaway, not even a takeaway menu of the experience. :( \nDO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING LATE NIGHT RESERVATIONS!!",

Chef Patron Clare Smythe is absolutely brilliant at the helm, her dishes interesting, delicious and beautifully presented. \nThe Maître D' Jean Claude is extremely attentive, knows every dish, and gives you the full explanation upon its arrival. The staff are excellent, always there when you need them, while never hovering or interrupting. All of the staff make you feel extremely welcome. \nJean Claude asked if we would like to see the kitchen and meet the Chef before we left which we did. Clare was also very welcoming. The kitchen was very well organized, and probably the cleanest I've ever seen.\nI had the pressed foie gras, braised confit and roasted Herdwick lamb and Lemon soufflé. The wine selection is excellent and they add nice touches between courses of little complementary tasting dishes from the Chef. One of which after desert and before coffee were handmade ice cream sweets in white chocolate shells served in liquid nitrogen. \nThe prices are very reasonable for the experience you get and well worth paying. I'll definitely be back.",

I came in for lunch because all the dinner reservations were booked in advance, but either way, you can still order the 9 course meal during the lunch hours too.\nUnfortunately, I had another 9 course meal waiting for me that evening so I just settled with their 3 course lunch menu. It was cheaper too at only  £45. And even with the 3 course meal, it still fills you up. Because you actually get more than 3 courses. It just keeps coming and coming.\nI was even entertained by Jean-Claude, the maitre d' of Gordon Ramsay who gave me a book to read while I was waiting for my meal. And he also gave me a tour of the kitchen and got my menu signed by Clare Smith, the head chef of Gordon Ramsay.\nI realize now why dinner reservations book up so quick. I really enjoyed my time here and when I come back to London, I'll make it a top priority to come back and this time to try out their \"Menu Prestige.\" \nJob well done there, job well done.\nMichelin 2 stars 2012",

There are dishes that are not that good, but one can only satisfies someone so much.  The king crab halibut was bomb the aroma of the broth that was poured on top of it gave it a very balance feel, I'm not big cooked fish fan...I'm not sure if they cooked the halibut more mushy to blend with the consistency of the king crab. Main course was the lamb served in 5 ways (can be a bit gamey for some) but prepared right in my opinion with the different cuts. Cucumber sorbet was bomb. Overall the service was the best I've had out of all the Michelin star chef choice restaurants. At the end of the meal even visited the kitchen. If only the bill clerk knows her math than I would say the service is as flawless as it can be",

On a scale of 1 to 5, it was a solid 10!\nWe were greeted warmly and taken to a great table in a relatively small restaurant--and a place they do not strive to turn their tables.\nMaitre d' Jean Claude immediately came to our table.  He was the perfect host to us and the other diners at this sold out service.\nHead Sommelier Jan was flawless as he helped Nancy select a wine that was just right for her.  She sampled several as he narrowed down to the target wine.  It must have been over the top, as she had 4 glasses of it.\nWords cannot describe the seasonal tasting menu prepared by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.  The food was delicious and plated so beautifully.  This was their first day back following a long Christmas holiday.  She and her staff did not miss a beat.\nThe manager for the front of the house left about 6 months ago and his assistant has been promoted to manager.  He was absolutely delightful and his staff took excellent care of us all day.\nOn a sad/happy note--Chef Smyth will soon be moving on to captain her own restaurant.  We we fortunate enough to be able to catch her for a brief moment to wish her well and assure her that we would find and support her new endeavor.\nAny who follows Chef Ramsay must see how he supports women in their efforts to achieve greatness.  This is a prime example of just that.  I hope Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In organization is taking note and giving credit to this fine man and great mentor.",

In 2001 it was awarded the three michelin star restaurant. There are two three michelin star in London: 1. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay 2. Fat Duck. This is the only three michelin star restaurant in London at the moment since the \"Fat Duck\" has been closed down for its renovation. Hence booking a spot for lunch or dinner is very difficult for even some celebrities and politicians. This was probably one of the best three michelin star restaurant I have dined.

                "description": "Everybody knows it, lovers and haters. In two words, Gordon Ramsay. And this is his flagship restaurant. Here you do not dine out, this is a food experience, this is a culinary trip. You don't get here by chance, and every single dish, every single instant will be stuck in your mind for a long time. But yet, small imperfections caused the lack of the \"top quality seal\" approval (yes we have a seal!) from me and my lovely lady.\nAs soon as we entered here we got the feeling this was a place like no others. The cure for details is maniacal, from the door to the tables. But here we also started to notice the first issues: the place is quite small, as it should be, but it's rather busy: we were lucky in receiving a table on the wall, but a couple in front of us (really, at less than 1 m with the corridor for waiters in between) was right in the middle of the hall, something completely uncomfortable giving the amount of tables on the wall. It seemed to me they really pushed their capacity over the limit, and that's a serious error.\nBut as we said, the decor both of the place and on the wall is incredibly refined and classy. Quite minimalistic in the style, it has several little classy touches both me and my lady love. Incredible.\nThe waiters were nice and warming, very accommodating (even too much perhaps, given that we were on a romantic dinner) and they spoke to us in several languages. But from the other side, some of the waiters lacked in appearance, with a wrong make up messed-up hairs. Something you don't want to find in a three stars restaurant.\nBut then, let's speak about the main reason we get there, the food! First time we came here, we wanted to try all the classical dishes the restaurant is acclaimed for, so here we go with the tasting menu. We chose a half bottle in order to get something a little bit more special, and we received the service we expected considering the age and the caliber of the wine, candle, decanter and so on.\nAt first I prepared an awesome review with every single dish carefully described, but the maximum size of 5000 words on yelp is really too much for me. Hence, I just want to speak to you about two dishes, my personal favourite ones.\nThe first one is a dish I waited for years: \"Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon\". Wow. Already the name is something to blow up your mind, putting together the sweetness of the lobster, the delicacy of the langoustine and the heavy and powerful taste of salmon. And the result is so good it can't be described, you need to taste it. Served with a delicious bisque with sorrel giving that extra citric needle, it's just one of the best things I ever tasted in my life. A dish so delicious they should name a star with its name.\nThe second one is another famous masterpiece for Gordon Ramsay restaurant: Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth.\nNow, let's start from the beginning: presentation is ridiculously perfect: the dish comes with the halibut and the crab on top, and they proceed to serve the broth (at room temperature) all around the halibut (like they do with the bisque and the ravioli). The difference is that the broth is liquid, transparent and with flower petals and the composition of the dish rapidly becomes a painting. A wonderful painting, relaxing and intriguing. And the broth, oh my the broth. Incredible, powerful, with 4 thousands flavor all balanced between each other, it's like a Kandinsky frame on your mouth (yes keep going with art paragons!), you can always feel something different and something new, evolving and moving, but the big picture, the big screen is always appealing and entertaining. This dish alone deserves a dinner here. Full stop. If you don't like such a perfect combination of taste, smell, sight I don't even want to be a friend of yours on yelp. And I'm serious.\nIt's painful not to speak about every other dish, as every single plate on our table was a piece of art, even the ones we didn't like, but each one had a history and was perfectly concepted and realized. It's amazing.\nUnfortunately, as every adventure, we had to end our trip. We started good, we had some initial issues, we had some awesome surprise and we reached home safely. All in all it's a wonderful dining experience, but because of some strange errors I found it does not deserves the 5 stars. Not now, not this time.",

As we were visiting from the USA, I had made reservations online for the 4 of us and the restaurant called the week before to confirm the time.

I knew it was going to be expensive and wondered if it would live up to the expectations and it way exceeded them. Jean-Claude the maître de was phenomenal. The service was impeccable, he regularly checked back on us without being intrusive. The other wait staff were polished and smooth throughout the service.\nThe food was the best that I have ever had, every course beautifully presented. The taste out of this world, the menu descriptions do not do justice to the taste on your tongue.\nAt the end we were shown the kitchen; smaller than I expected and was able to thank Claire for a most wonderful experience.\nI think it speaks volumes that although Gordon is hardly ever there, his high standards are maintained.\nOnce in a lifetime experience, wish I could do it again",

One look at the tiny dining room (with 30 seats, tops) and the large number of servers (about 10, by my count) told us that we would be in for a pampering.\nAnd it was. What a feast for the senses! We both ordered the Menu Prestige prix free menu and a lovely bottle of chinon to go with it (recommended by the friendly sommelier who also suggested that my wife pick up a pair of Hunter wellingtons to make our trip extra-British). \nEvery dish was thoughtfully prepared and engaging to all the senses. We were invited to smell the sauces before they were poured. The dishes themselves were works of art and tasted like heaven. Some dishes delved slightly into molecular gastronomy- honey that crunched and bread that literally melted in your mouth. The sight of the squad of waitstaff moving through the dining room with poise and precision fascinated everyone. And the invitation to walk through the kitchen was so thoughtful.\nSure, we blew a good chunk of change on this place, but it was worth every penny. We left excited, full (which always surprises me at places like this), and invigorated.",

                "description": "I was so anticipating this visit as one of the highlights of my London trip that I was worried I would end up disappointed. Not so.\nThe restaurant's atmosphere was pure understated elegance. I was slightly intimidated walking down the long entrance hallway, but that feeling mostly faded as the friendly staff guided my mom, sister and I past the waiting space and into the single-room dining area. It was surprisingly unassuming, filled with soft beiges and mauves. Throughout the meal the servers were warm, helpful and professional--the only hiccup came when my sister's turbot arrived a bit too early and had to make a brief retreat.\nNow for the food. The meal began with three tiny, unexpected hors d'oeuvres: a fluffy little parmesan dumpling (good), a cheesy, crunchy ball topped with salty iberico ham (excellent) and a seaweed-wrapped, sashimi-like cured salmon (excellent). The next surprise item was a bright green ricotta dish, beautifully plated with fresh vegetables (tangy and salty, every bite slightly different).\nThen the appetizers: I was a served a single giant lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli, surrounded with a wood sorrel sauce (also bright green). It had a balanced, hearty seafood flavor, and the savory wood sorrel was oddly addictive. My dining partners both had the scallops--I'm not normally a fan, but these were probably the best I've tasted. They came with two sauces: a nice sweet apple-based one and another (even better) that was concentrated with walnut flavor.\nEntrees: My sister had the turbot with greens and an unidentified vegetable (sea beet?)--nicely seasoned and meaty, but not really a standout. My mom and I had pork five ways. The chou farci (stuffed cabbage) was my least favorite, salty but otherwise unexciting. (There was also a smidge of applesauce that I tried but mostly avoided.) The sausage was also slightly disappointing, but still well-spiced and quite decent. The loin was elevated by some slightly acidic potatoes and bite of thin, perfectly crisp bacon. The suckling pig was tender and flavorful, accented by sweet bit of pineapple...\n...And then there was pork belly. Oh, the pork belly. This razor-thin rectangle of salty, fatty goodness was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The brilliance of it was the contrast in textures: immaculately crispy on the top layer, melt-in-your-mouth tender on the bottom. It came with two preparations of apple--one baked, one fresh and thin-sliced. It was good with them, it was good without them. It was just good.\nAnother intermission: a sweet, brightly flavored mango-passion fruit beverage that was a lovely pre-dessert palate cleanser. We split our three desserts evenly between us. The peppermint souffle was immensely fluffy--so much so that it was essentially a minty egg foam. A bit strange, but better with the chocolate sorbet (which there should've been more of). The chocolate, praline mousse and granola dish was very nice, possibly the best of the three and a nice mix of sweet and pleasantly bitter. The lemonade parfait was easily the most interesting one, jam-packed with sweet and sour flavor. It came with a beautifully spun honey tuile ring, a creamy sheep's milk sorbet and a tangy bergamot gel.\nFinally, three more mini-surprises. The elderflower Turkish delight was an appropriately floral gelatin treat. The thin wafers of chocolate peanut brittle were nothing very unusual, but delicious with a balanced sweet-saltiness. The white-chocolate-dipped morsels of strawberry ice cream, immersed in dry ice fog for maximum effect, were a memorable end to a spectacular dinner.\nMy meal here was delicious and inventive, with several hits and only a couple of partial misses. I would love to make a return pilgrimage someday and try their even more elaborate \"prestige\" or \"seasonal inspiration\" menus. I'll look back on this dinner with fondness for a long time to come.",

                "description": "Although the food was exquisite, the service, unfortunately, was not. \nI had lunch at the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant on Nov 4. I showed up and was charged 200 pounds directly to my lunch meal. I understand the importance of no-show fees, but here's what was wrong. \n- 2 people in our party of 4 couldn't come, and my friend had called a week in advance to change the party size (the restaurant requires 48 hrs advance notice)...only, the restaurant didn't actually change our party size. \n- The people who showed up (myself and a friend) were charged 100 pounds/person for the people who didn't show, even though I wasn't liable for the reservation. My friend who couldn't come had made the reservation, and the charge should've gone to the card on file for the reservation (her card).\n- Gordon Ramsay restaurant has conflicting \"no-show/cancellation\" policies on their OpenTable home page, their website, OpenTable confirmation email, and information relayed by the restaurant representative. Only the person making the reservation on OpenTable had access to the \"accurate\" policy -- which apparently is that the party size has to be successfully changed. Notifying the restaurant isn't enough.\n- Also note, the per person no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch menu is only 65 pounds per person.\nDuring the actual dining experience, the manager stopped by all tables except ours, and I was told to contact the restaurant via email. \nIt then took 10+ emails for the manager to admit that Gordon Ramsay should've charged the card on file. Turns out, he didn't charge the card on file because the process is longer and more complicated (he has to go through an account executive at the main office). Regretfully, the manager didn't realize that as he cut some corners on the correct process and charged the fee directly to the meal of people who did show up, my dining experience was negatively affected. I still have yet to receive an apology for the miscommunication from Gordon Ramsay and the way in which the no-show fees were handled. \n  \nSo here is my sad, but quick tip to you: \n- If your complete party can't make it, order the lunch set menu for the \"invisible people\" in your party. You'll save 35 pounds per person. The no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch set menu is only 65 pounds.",

                "description": "The dining experience at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay's London Mother Ship is wonderful, memorable, elegant and unparalleled in service.  The servers are all good looking in their formal attire, and friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and professional to boot!\nWe chose the 7-course Prestige tasting menu, and along with 2 extra chef \"surprises\", took 3 hours to complete.  The interior is cozy and elegant in dove gray, muted whites and crystal, so it is a soothing place in which to spend lots of time savoring the atmosphere and food presentation.\nAnd it is all about the presentation.  Each dish was uniquely creative, sometimes with surprising ingredient pairings.  Each plate is a visual masterpiece, which led to much speculation about how they actually do it!  Razor thin slices of baby vegetables and roasted shallots dressed the foie gras with amazing grace.  This could be said of every single plate in this menu, which contains many of the restaurant's signature dishes.\nBut here comes my inner comment:  the food mostly looked  better than it actually tasted.  A small square of poached fish surrounded by delicate flower petals and broth was-- bleh.  A beautiful mousse of egg white, potato and toasted truffle served in an almost-whole egg shell was -- hard to swallow.  It's like deliciousness was sacrificed for artistic merit.  I almost feel like it's The Emperor's New Clothes, where everyone is so busy oooohhing and ahhhhing and being devoted foodies that they have not stopped to taste the food and admit that this was not the best meal they ever had.  \nHaving said that, I'll run and hide from all the rotten tomatoes that will be thrown at me.  \nSigned,\nDesperately Seeking Umami",

                "description": "The two-hour meal I savored during my first trip to London in early July ranks as the best belated birthday present I have ever received. My father and stepmother treated me to a lunch I will remember for the rest of my life.\nThe petite dining room features a mere 14 tables, yet it packs enough charm and splendor to fill a big box store. Never attempt to eat here sans a reservation. Secure a spot at least one week in advance just to be safe. My sister, who lives in London, placed a call almost a month prior to our visit.\nGordon Ramsay's posh flagship on Royal Hospital Road employs enough wait staff to allow each member to serve a specific course. Another paramount consideration: This is not a fast-food, dash-in and dash-out establishment. A leisurely, glacial pace of food consumption is essential if you want to appreciate the myriad flavors married by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.\nWe ordered from the lunch menu and elected for the three-course option, which costs 55 pounds per head. As the five-star rating should indicate, not one pound of the exorbitant bill was wasted.\nThe extravagant cuisine adventure commenced with a complimentary consomme. The made-from-rich-flavored stock was drinkable, with baby radishes, heirloom tomatoes and chives delicately assembled in the center of the bowl. I did not leave a trace of this delightful opener on the plate.\nI opted to start with the roasted quail with soy honey, togorashi, pickled vegetables and herbs. The house-made soy sauce and dijon mustard rim delivered a perfect accompaniment for the two wing cuts of soft roasted bird. I cannot remember enjoying another quail dish more than this.\nNext, I selected the roasted rabbit loin with Bayonne ham, salted baked turnips, toasted hazelnuts and pickled mustard seed. The exquisite presentation of this and every other dish served at the restaurant merits museum enshrinement. The many components at work on the wide plate bonded beautifully. The mustard seed and savory sauce enhanced the wonders of each diminutive bite.\nThroughout the afternoon, one wait staff member offered three different breads paired with finely sculpted salted and unsalted butter towers. The onion bacon brioche ranked as my favorite.\nFor my last official course, dessert, I chose the chocolate bars with toasted milk mousse and tonka bean ice cream. As much as I love caramel popcorn, I would not have pictured it as a sinful ally in a gourmet dessert dish. Each bite of popcorn with a splash of the milk mousse was even better than the previous one. The caramel, dark and milk chocolate bars melted in my mouth. You can't buy candy this delectable at a convenience store.\nPatrons also receive a complimentary dessert tray with four ice cream balls served in a bowl of steaming dry ice plus two lemon Turkish delights and two chocolate ganache squares.\nThe championship clincher of this five-star experience: Waiters had eavesdropped on our table during an earlier birthday toast and brought me a sixth course, a miniature but wicked chocolate-hazelnut cake complete with a candle. That they nailed my favorite sweet combination, most often referred to as Nutella or Bacio, has to be the greatest instance of dumb luck ever. Wow!\nWait at least one minute after receiving each dish because servers tend to return in a few moments with extra goodies and garnishes for your selected item.\nThis extraordinary day also included the British Museum, the London Eye and Coldplay at the Royal Albert Hall. I will be back.",

Still Ramsay in name but maintaining three stars from Michelin under the direction of Clare Smyth as each of 45 seats are pampered by formal yet friendly service amidst an art deco décor bathed in white it obviously comes as no surprise that a visit to Royal Hospital Road proves a far more elegant experience than fans of the Scottish chef's celebrity might expect and although some may call the cuisine a touch too 'safe' I prefer the term precise, not a single element of the \"Menu Prestige\" out of place as a parade of ornate plates shined bright.  Admittedly not the best way to showcase Chef Smyth's skills yet at the same time far more broad in scope than the shorter prix-fixe it was of several Ramsay signatures that my meal comprised and with courses such as the tender ravioli and delicate halibut every bit deserving of their legendary status served alongside Milliat nectars, a top tier bread program paired to Bordier, plus a cheese cart rich in selections from Antony not a single detail seemed overlooked.  Delving into a few modernist flairs as the meal transitioned to sweets it was only here that I diverged from the \"Prestige\" path and although commanding a £20 premium the Assisette de l'Aubergine was every bit worth the price - a trio of the restaurant's daily desserts paired with an individual portion of the restaurant's signature tarte and capped by a full sized soufflé, itself bearing a £20 tag if ordered a la carte.  Beleaguered by some due to its namesake's antics but every bit worth its celebrated status suffice it to say that whether Chef Ramsay himself has cooked on Hospital Road recently is irrelevant, the kitchen remains in good hands while the front of house flows with an effortless affability far too infrequently seen amongst Europe's mostly highly ranked.",

The sommelier came over to discuss the style of wine we were looking for. Her reco was spot on.\nThe starter of scallops with apples and walnuts was perfect.\nFor mains I chose the suckling pig cooked four ways.\nDesert choice was chocolate cylinder with ginger mousse.\nEach course was perfectly presented and composed with winning taste combinations. I could have been happy with any of the dishes on the menu and making a choice was hard. Fish & seafood seems to be a particular standout here so maybe I should have opted for a fish main course also. The dishes are sophisticated expertly created yet the menu descriptions are straightforward. I like that lack of pretension.\nA good variety of interesting of amuse bouches added more excitement between courses and the Maitre D' stopped by for a chat. A nice touch which just added to the overall pleasant and relaxed ambience.\nEvery member of the staff excelled and the whole meal was so well coordinated it was perfection.\nA special dining experience that I would love to repeat again. A key metric for me is value for money but that doesn't mean everything has to be cheap. But expectations are high when the price is high and Gordon Ramsay delivered.",

Despite being a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, this was sadly the most painful 3-Michelin star dining experience I've had in ages, and I'm not referring to the price. The service at Ramsay's was well-balanced and not overly stuffy. Everything about the restaurant was immaculate--elegant and on point. But that was it, it was a bit too sterile and the dining room was not particularly inviting.  \nWe opted for the Menu Prestige. The only items that stood out for me were the lobster ravioli (which was both nice to look at and had great flavour) and the desserts (which were all very pretty but unpalatable -- it took a great act of will to finish my plate as I did not want to be rude, but hubs didn't even bother and pushed his plate back). The entire meal looked amazing but the focus was too much on presentation and not enough on flavours and textures. So this was a massive disappointment. \nSadly, we shall not be returning after an unimpressive culinary experience.",

                "description": "Had dinner at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay this past week and it was most definitely the best meal I have ever had in any restaurant!  From our arrival to our departure more than three hours later, everything about our evening was totally perfect.  We were warmly greeted and shown to our table in this beautifully decorated dining room.  Our party chose the 7 course seasonal inspirations tasting menu and everything was so delicious.  We were brought several 'amuse bouche' dishes ahead of our tasting menu and the bread basket was brought round every time there was a new course.  Unsure what wine to choose, I asked the sommelier for advice and he provided excellent suggestions on different wine pairings.  \nAs each course arrived, there were usually 2 or 3 waiters, serving the food to each of us in unison - so perfectly choreographed!  The Maitre D' was great and came by our table several times for a chat, but was not intrusive at all.  At the end of the meal he invited us to visit the kitchen and we were treated to an amazing sight of the chefs putting together their wonderful creations.  I was surprised at the quiet and calm in the kitchen, with so much concentration - it was not at all noisy as I might have expected. \nDuring coffee they brought my husband a birthday cake and all of us chocolates - a nice unexpected surprise.  We were also given a copy of the menu signed by the executive chef - this was a lovely memento to bring home with us.\nThe meal was most definitely the most memorable dining experience of our lives so far and we would return in a heartbeat - they deserve all 3 of their Michelin stars.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.",

One of the employees greeted us as we got out of the taxi and led us to the door of the restaurant where another guy was there ready to check in our coats.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected, and it felt very cozy.  The service was exceptional.  May of the staff are there to attend to your every need.  At one point during the dinner, I was getting up to go to the bathroom.  As soon as I moved my chair back slightly to get up, the waiter already anticipated my action and moved the chair back for me.  He proceeded to direct me to the restroom where another staff member was already there holding the door open for me.  They called the taxi for us at the end of the dinner and gave us a tour of the kitchen while waiting for the taxi.\nThe food is spectacular..as expected for a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  We ordered the prestige menu offering seven courses.  More if you counted the three small appetizers and amuse bouche.  We started with the Foie Gras...very light and flavorful as you eat it with a few small slivers of duck on the side.  The lobster ravioli was excellent.  I wanted more, but knew I had to save room for more courses.  I ordered pigeon for my entree.  Very tender...not as gamy as a quail.  I really enjoyed it.  I also tried the lamb from my sister's plate..also spectacular.  The desserts were my favorite treat.  presented like a piece of art in front of you.\nOverall, an excellent experience.  Not to be missed when you are visiting London.",

                "description": "I went here a couple of weeks ago while on vacation with my girlfriend. This restaurant was absolutely amazing. Probably some of the best food I have ever had. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. They always made sure we had what we needed and were constantly refilling our drinks right when we needed them refilled. They knew what to do before I even knew. I was also really nervous as I had never eaten a 3 michelin star restaurant so I didn't want to accidentally do something wrong.\nAnyway, I ordered off the lunch menu and got the globe artichoke, rabbit loin, and vanilla parfait. The globe artichoke was probably the best appetizer I have ever had in my life. It was so delicious. Just absolutely amazing. The rabbit loin I had after was also absolutely delicious in every way. One of the best entrees ever.  Cooked perfectly and absolutely amazing in every way.\nThen the dessert came and that was OUTSTANDING. Probably the best dessert I have ever had. They poured frozen olive oil on it and I just couldn't believe how good the vanilla parfait was. It was hard for me to believe, even now, that a vanilla parfait could be that good. \nThey also had a chicken mousse soup starter and these white chocolate balls with some squares for dessert. All of it was amazing. And for a fancy restaurant the food was actually quite filling. We also were here for a while but it didn't feel like that long as there was always food on my plate or there was about to be food on my plate.\nI highly recommend if you can get a reservation to go here. Great restaurant!",

                "description": "My first Michelin 3 star restaurant as well! :)\nAmazing amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing decor.\nYou have to book months in advance to secure a table. I booked it back in May for my July trip and I was only able to book a lunch :(. They take down your credit card number so if you don't show up or don't cancel within 24 hrs, you get fined 100 pounds--about $162.\nI ordered the Menu Prestige, which consists of 7 plates. I highly recommend this menu to sample all of Ramsay's food.\n1. Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble - This foie gras had a harder texture and was less buttery than the others I've tried, but still very good.\n2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a chervil velouté - DELICIOUS dish!! So good. It was a fatty ravioli with a generous amount of lobster. Sauce was amazing--went together very well.\n3.Roasted fillet of line caught turbot with English asparagus and morels - Can't decide if this or the ravioli was my favorite. This fish was delicious! Couldn't taste the sea flavor, which is a definite plus.  So good I forgot to take a picture :(\n4. Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of summer vegetables - not a fan of lamb, but if all lamb dishes tasted like this, then I'm sold! Super tender and the vegetables were a good addition.\n5.Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice - So GOOD. One of the better creme brulee's I've tasted. the Granny Smith apple juice was unbelievable!!!! BEST apple juice I've tasted. I think all apple juices should be made from Granny Smith Apples. Yum! I might even blend some for myself.\n6. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Yum!! This \"soup\" was so good! \n7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm Eton mess with vanilla ice cream wafer - Wasn't a fan of this dessert. :( I dont really like sorberts. But I did like the wafer and the plating was absolutely beautiful.\nBonus: Silver Chocolate Truffle Tree - So unique and so pretty. Fun to pick off of and pop in your mouth.\nBonus #2: White Chocolate Covered Strawberry Balls in Smokey Dry Ice - Again, another unique dish. The smoke coming out of the dry ice was such a cool effect. \nGreat experience. Never had such attentive waiters. But of course, this amazing-ness comes with a hefty price tag. My meal amounted to about 136 pounds, which is about $220.",

                "description": "Gordon Ramsay was my first Michelin star dining experience in London. Since I've been to many others, I keep rethinking my five-star review, and I think that it really doesn't deserve that fifth star. \nDon't get me wrong. I had a great time. The food was exceptional. It just wasn't memorable. Nothing wowed me. (Check my previous review for my experience there.) It was just lacking something that I had experienced at other three-Michelin star restaurants. I thought it was perhaps those were just exceptional, but now that I've gone to other ones in the UK, I've come to realize that Gordon Ramsay just doesn't hold up to these others.\nIt still gets four stars though. Mostly because my lovely other half bought me a cooking Masterclass here for my birthday. In case you didn't know, they offer one occasionally. I showed up bright and early at around 9 am where they had pastries and coffee waiting. We then went into the kitchen and prepped a three-course lunch for the next three hours. Then you and a plus one get to eat your three course menu with pretty much unlimited wine. It was fantastic. I had an amazing time learning kitchen skills and hanging out with the sous chef and some of the other chefs at the restaurant. Our meal consisted of salmon and lobster tortellini (similar to the ravioli, but smaller), mini beef wellingtons and a salted caramel chocolate fondant. At the end they give you the menu with the wine pairings and recipes for all the food you've cooked.\nGranted it's not cheap, but it makes for one hell of an experience if you know someone who loves to cook. It's quiet and intimate just having a lunch with the people in the class and their plus ones. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. In fact, I would recommend it over actually dining at the restaurant. There are far better places to go have a nice meal, but not many where you can actually help cook it!",

It was an appropriate restaurant for the occasion and we were treated to excellent and attentive service.  We both had the Seasonal Inspiration menu:\n1. Poached Scottish lobster tail with lardo di Colonnata, vegetables à la Grecque and coral vinaigrette\n2. 'Carbonara', Iberico ham and four year old parmesan.\n3. Assiette of spring vegetables cooked en cocotte with Périgord truffle\n4. Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, spiced shoulder sausage, chou farci with crushed potatoes and spring onions\n5. Rove des Guarrigues with confit beetroot, toasted amaranth seeds and Manni olive oil\n6. Green apple and lime sorbet with shiso, avocado and eucalyptus\n7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm 'Eton mess'\nAll of the dishes were tasty and well-presented.  The highlight for me was the sucking pig dish - you got a sample size of pork done many ways, my favourite part was the crackling.\nI also enjoyed the 'carbonara', there were obviously a lot of different cooking techniques which went into this dish, to ensure that the pasta was cooked to the right level and the egg yolk was still runny.  The green apple and lime sorbet was a refreshing dish which came as just the right stage of the dinner: it really hit the spot.\nThe assiette of spring vegetables just seemed like a plate of nicely cooked vegetables to me, nothing too special about that one.  In the same way, the final course was simply strawberries with meringue.  With application, I'm sure we could find a nice punnet of strawberries ourselves to enjoy at home.\nThe service was slick and well-practised, however, I sometimes found myself thinking about when the next course was coming, which I hadn't experienced at other 3-star michelin star restaurants.\nOverall, an excellent evening, but the minor points noted above contributed to my 4-star rating.",

                "description": "Let me preface this by saying I am very sure we had a fluke experience here.  Something went very, very wrong on our visit that is obviously not the norm. But it was such a dramatic departure from every other Michelin *'d restaurant I've visited that I feel the need to share.  When we travel we choose the restaurants we visit very carefully and after our service fiasco at RGR I really wish we had chosen another place to complement the (exemplary!) Fat Duck on our London trip.  \nI also sent the below feedback directly to the restaurant and... received no follow-up.  Not a word.  So this is long, but hey! Now I've got a bone to pick. :)\nIn the restaurant's online follow-up survey, I chose \"fair\" to describe the service; a more accurate description would have been \"Flawless, followed suddenly by a flip to confusingly terrible.\"  After the listed courses on the menu were complete, we were offered coffee (which I accepted and my husband declined) and were told that \"chocolates\" would be forthcoming. The coffee arrived, I drank it, and time passed.  Other tables were continuing to be served.  Eventually my empty cup was taken away and I declined further coffee.  Perplexingly, my husband than received a clean plate in front of him (I did not).  We sat.  More time passed.  We started to think this was a bit awkward but continued to wait and enjoy each other's company.  \nEventually (after about half an hour from when coffee was served) we were offered to see the kitchen, which we accepted.  Upon our return from the kitchen, I saw my place also now also had one of the mysterious plates and we assumed the (alleged) chocolates would arrive shortly.  Adjacent diners finished their meals, left, and the tables had new people seated at them. After another 15 minutes of being ignored entirely by staff we decided it was getting ridiculous.  We actually had to flag down a server and ask what was going on. (!)  \nThe gentleman who I assume is the front of house came to our table and said that we hadn't pushed our plates away and therefore it was assumed we wanted more coffee?  Which was quite odd, given that we had both explicitly turned down more coffee, and in any case if the plates were coding this no one actually ever came by to offer it to us.  Not to mention the fact that my husband never actually HAD any coffee in the first place.  \nWe asked about the chocolates he had mentioned earlier, and he said, yes, the white chocolate course.  Pause.  We said we hadn't had it.  He said, \"Yes, with the liquid nitrogen?  The strawberries and white chocolate?\"  (As if we would have perhaps forgotten a course with a centerpiece of dry ice?)  We again said that we had not received this course and in fact had been ignored for the last 45 minutes.  He said he would get it and then about five minutes later it finally arrived.  Then we finished, paid, and exited, completely confused by what had just happened.  \nAt no point did any of the service staff acknowledge that it is completely weird and inappropriate for diners to be left on entirely their own for nearly an hour, without so much as a cursory check-in, certainly at a restaurant with such a reputation for exemplary service.  To be forgotten is one thing; to not have even the slightest acknowledgement of the inconvenience and confusion it created in our evening is quite another thing on top of that.    \nWe have had the pleasure of dining at many Michelin two- and three-star restaurants, and this was by far the most bizarre service experience we have ever had at an establishment of this calibre.  Unfortunately the experience at the end of our meal soured what would otherwise have been almost a literally perfect evening out.   (On the other hand, it has given us a hilarious story to share with our friends, which we certainly have been.)\n \nAll in all it was a lovely evening that ended up in bizarro-land, followed by what appeared to be a completely oblivious unawareness from staff that anything was even wrong.  Funny though it is in hindsight it was also really disappointing!",

I often feel uncomfortable with the level of service that goes along with these types of restaurants but they did an excellent job of making our 25-year-old selves feel at home. From the moment you enter, they find out what brings you there and a bit about you. For the rest of the night, every person who served us knew we were from NYC and that it was our anniversary. They had the level of great service without the things that I find to personally be over the top or uncomfortable, e.g. they don't have a person working in the bathroom but they still escorted me to it and opened the door for me when I went. \nThe food: UNREAL. We did 3 courses from the a la carte menu with unbelievable wine pairings. I rarely like wine pairings because I'd rather choose wines that I prefer but the wines that the excellent sommelier recommended not only transformed our meals but we also left with a new favorite dessert wine. \nOur menu:\nBoyfriend's starter: Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a lemongrass and chervil velouté \nMy starter (the BEST foie gras of my life...and I try foie gras pretty much every time its offered): Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, new season rhubarb and blood orange\nBoyfriend's entree: Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, homemade sausage, chou farci and braised leg with crushed potatoes and spring onions\nMy entree: Fillet of line caught sea basswith cucumber, rock samphire, oyster and caviar sauce\nBoyfriend's dessert: Smoked chocolate cigar with blood orange and cardamom ice cream\nMy dessert: Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet\nWe LOVED everything. They were also incredible about my food allergies. They made dairy substitutes where necessary without compromising the integrity of the dish and where they didn't think they could make substitutes (like the oyster & caviar sauce on my fish) they discussed it with me. In the case of the sauce, we decided together to put the sauce on the side so I could put the amount that I thought was good for me. I wasn't planning on not having dairy on a night like this but it definitely improved my experience to have them working out for me. \nSo... definitely go! And definitely make a reservation in advance! It is very small and well spread out so there is not much availability.",

The Heart of Gordon Ramsay and I was not going to miss to try his food, in his home town. Loved this place. Small, quaint and elegant. As we walked through the doors and sat down at our table we were well taken care of. Three course meal was more than plenty of food, I couldn't have imagine how much food 7 course would have been. Between each course, they would come clean our table from crumbs (very fancy), and each time we had to get up to go to the washroom they walked us to the restroom door and came back to the table to refold our napkin. (very elegant). \nLobster Ravoli was to die for, I recommend it! It was mouthwatering.\nI haven't had a better meal since Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant.",

Most of us know Gordon Ramsay from his various tv shows and people think he's a prick (myself included) but damn, the man has a tremendous restaurant.  \nThere were only 13 tables at this table and the waitstaff was very accommodating.  All white decor and people were dressed well.  We went for lunch which has an excellent 3 course menu (coming in at 45 poounds).  Their regular 3 course lunch menu is 90 pounds and they have a tasting menu coming in at 120 poounds.  \nI had the 45 pound menu which consisted of an octopus salad with salsa verde, followed by a roasted halibut and dessert.  Everything was so well cooked and delicious.  Presentation was beautiful, service was great and meal was outstanding.  Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had.  Don't go to the other Gordon Ramsay restaurants and just visit this flagship one.  You won't be disappointed.",

                "description": "Superb!!\nThis was the best restaurant experience I have ever had. Now I understand why Gordon Ramsay cannot stop talking about his Michelin three starred restaurant on TV. \nFirst, the restaurant itself is quite small. They only had twelve tables set up when we went and amazingly, each night, they only serve one party per table. So, you can take your time enjoying your magnificent meal. The decor is simple with lots of neutral and clean color. \nTheir excellent service is what truly makes this place stand out. ALL the staff (I mean there are so many people tending to you. There's your main server, then there's the butter guy, water guy, bread guy, wine guy, truffle guy, open-the-restroom-door-for-you guy, etc.) were so polite and friendly. They were not snobby at all. \nThey give complimentary amuse-bouche. One of ours was soft boiled quail eggs wrapped in ham, lightly battered and deep fried (scotch quail eggs). It was perfectly cooked and so cute! \nFor the starter, I had the seared scallop with apples and walnuts. Scallops were perfectly cooked and the autumney sauce was not over powering at all but very flavorful. \nAll of their main dishes sounded so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our server told me his favorite was the lamb dish, so I went for it. This is how they describe it on the menu, 'Best end of Cotswold lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of autumn vegetables and vitelotte potatoes.' So, it's like a tasting menu of 'best of lambs'! Meat was so tender and it was one of the most beautifully plated dishes I've ever had. \nFor dessert, we got the chocolate cylinder and apple tart but they also gave us complimentary white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls, dark chocolate truffles, and rose Turkish delights! We were absolutely well taken care of. \nThe highlight of the dinner was definitely the tour of the kitchen! Kitchen was small but spotless. It was so exciting to see all the action! \nAll in all, it was one darn awesome night!!",

I can't recommend this place enough. Be prepared to pay the large bill for an excellent meal. It will take about 6 hours if you are enjoying yourself, which is fine for the amount of money you are paying. Again, if you get the chance, go here!",

                "description": "After my mother and I booked our trip to London, we made a reservation at the only Michelin 3-star restaurant in the city.  Two months and various confirmation e-mails and phone calls later, we arrived at this lovely little restaurant on Royal Hospital Road, ready for a treat.\nWe were the first to arrive and were promptly seated at a little table set in crisp white with a centerpiece of white roses in a silver vase.  The space is small and charming, with good light and an aura that evokes mellow wine in gently clinked glasses.\nThe service throughout the meal was phenomenal.  The staff:patron ratio was around 1:1, and various polite and friendly gentlemen attended to our table to welcome us, check on us, clear our crumbs, perfume our feet...okay, that last bit didn't happen, but maybe only because we went with the cheapest menu option?  Our primary waiter was wonderful, charismatic and helpful.  He deserved a blue ribbon for unobtrusive small talk.\nThere were at least five bread options, and we sampled the olive, the baked potato honey, and the rosemary potato.  The best was the rosemary potato, but they were all fresh and yummy with knived dabs from the swirly beehive of yellow butter.  Incidentally, you get a choice of salted and unsalted butter, which I was surprised to note as unusual.\nThe amuse bouche was a tomato consomme with a cute baby-shrimp-sized curl of langoustine accompanied by peas, fava beans, olive oil, and a teeny black cluster of osetra caviar.  It was mild and refreshing.\nWe went with the daily lunch menu priced at £45 a head, with three options for appetizers and entrees, and four for dessert including the cheese plate (with a £3 supplement).  Our waiter indicated that should either of us have any dietary restrictions, the kitchen would be more than happy to accommodate us.\nI started with the salt cod brandade with Noir de Bigorre ham, poached quail eggs, chargrilled red pepper, olives, and rocket salad.  My mom got the saffron risotto with clams, mussels, langoustines, and tomato, \"paella\" style.  (It was meant to come with chorizo as well, but my mother doesn't eat pork - I know, crazy.)  The brandade was a pleasant blend of pureed cod and potato with a smooth texture enhanced by the meatiness of the fish, great for spreading on the accompanying toasted rosemary crostinis.  The brandade was wrapped in a strip of ham and topped with the quail egg with the veggies and olives nestled on the side.  The olives were excellent on their own and as an accompaniment.  The risotto was beautifully cooked and pretty flavorful, and I imagine it would've been better with chorizo.\nFor our mains, I opted for the roasted saddle of rabbit with sage, Bayonne ham, trompette de la mort, and stuffed Provencal vegetables, and my mom got the fillet of daurade royale with navet, carrot, radish, baby gem lettuce, and artichokes baurigole.  The rabbit was nice, herb-stuffed and wrapped like my starter in yummy fatty pig.  It came with teeny little rabbit kidneys looking all cute and un-organ-like on the side, along with a wonderful stuffed shallot and a wonderful stuffed cherry tomato.  The sublimely juicy vegetables were the elevating component on this plate.  The daurade royale, a simply cooked sea bream in a light creamy sauce, was elegant if unexciting.\nFor dessert we went halfsies on the banana parfait with passion fruit and salted caramel ice cream and the lemon meringue and almond tart with fromage frais sorbet.  The parfait was a block of dry icy reconstituted banana coated with dark chocolate, topped with unmemorable ice cream and sitting atop a meager drizzle of passion fruit.  On the whole, it wasn't awful, but I would've preferred a good commercial dessert.  In fact, the texture wasn't too far off from a very frozen Klondike bar.  The tart was much better, a thing of beauty - circular crust topped with gorgeous layers of lemon curd and nestlike meringue stuck with almond slivers, with narrow strands of caramel sauce leading out from the tart base to a perfect ball of sorbet - and quite delicious to boot, a perfect blend of sweet and sour.\nAfter dessert came two splendid extras.  First was a silver tree of spherical silver chocolate truffles.  They were fun to pick off and eat.  The meal ended with strawberry ice cream balls coated with white chocolate, served in a pot smoking with liquid ice.  The ice cream itself was pretty mediocre, but the presentation was so delightful I didn't really care.\nOverall, I was happy with my experience at Gordon Ramsay, though I wasn't quite wowed.  Other than the banana parfait, everything was great, but nothing was mind-blowing.  Since the place does have the three stars I suppose I was expecting more, but I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.  The food was solid and the service superb.  I probably won't go back as I live abroad but it's worth a try, especially for £45.",

                "description": "A couple of years ago, I celebrated 5 years with my girlfriend by taking her to restaurant Gordon Ramsay.\nThe first experience was trying to get a booking: not easy. If you're not a celebrity, you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you'd like to go. You can only book 2 months (or 3, I forget) in advance, and it's so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am. We couldn't get the exact day we wanted, and had to settle for a 10:15pm slot!\nNevertheless, it was a pretty phenomenal experience all around.\nThe restaurant is just one room, and not more than ten tables or so. It's white, surprisingly (to me) bright, and not that fancy. The focus is on the food.\nThe menu was full of incredible choices. I don't remember now what each course was, but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite. As with this type of food, portions aren't huge, but there were a few rounds of amouse-bouches (and amusing they were, especially the bacon-and-eggs one) between courses that actually made us full at the end.\nWhile very classy, the serving staff didn't make you feel stupid if you weren't an expert at which utensil to use next. The sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36-page (!) wine list. Some special, recently-obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box, but we declined. Can't say enough about the staff: attentive, upscale, but chatty and helpful.\nThe price was, obviously, immense. You know what you're getting into when you come here. If you're trying to treat someone, they have two menus, one with prices and one without.\nIf you can get in, and you've saved your pennies to splurge for (for most of us) a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Gordon Ramsay's delivered for us.\nDid my girlfriend enjoy the experience? Well, she's now my wife.",

Impeccable pacing, interesting, but not fussy food.  Exquisite service, no stuffiness or pretension here.  The restaurant decor is the height of simplicity, all clean lines and white linens, which serve only to highlight the extraordinary, almost-architectural quality of the food. \nMy companion and I went with the £90 a la Carte menu.  Like alcohol, I can never resist sweetbreads, so the foie gras and sweetbreads was a must, and was highlighted by the sweetness of the almond velouté (foam - hand spooned onto my plate - of course).  I went with the sea bass for the main course, which was perfectly cut and cooked and absolutely irresistible.  To finish I went with the Granny Smith parfait with blackberry foam, honeycomb, and cider sorbet - which was structured almost like a Mondrian painting, all right angles, but fantastic.\nIf you have the means, please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an amazing dining experience.  Quite simply, the best I've ever had.",

                "description": "My first Michelin 3 star outside of the states.\nEach establishment I've been to is characterized with an \"experience.\"  For example, at Per Se, I felt like I experienced true flavor for the first time in my life.  Gordon Ramsay would be no different.  Recently taking a trip to London, Paris, and Edinburgh for merely a week, my sister and I had our itinerary filled to the rim.  After arriving at 11am and spending the rest of the day seeing the sites London has to offer, our dinner reservations were at 930pm.  Having found a Tube station somewhat nearby (according to the maps), we were on our way.  I must have miscalculated the distance, because the journey from the Tube to the restaurant is no joke (at least 20 minutes), however it might have been exaggerated due to being unfamiliar to the surroundings.  \nAfter a nice stroll through Chelsea, we were warmly welcomed into the small restaurant.  There are only 14 tables, so it's small.  The decor I would label as Earth-toned on white with a contemporary flair.  Customarily there were a couple Amuse Bouche compliments of the chef which were fantastic.  Instantly I was transferred back into my seat at Per Se when I felt like a new born baby whom had just tasted his first morsel of food.  We went for the tastes of the season 7 course menu.  Everything was prepared nicely, with the flavors exploding onto your palate.  Clare Smyth is a marvel hands down.  Our Maitre d' Jean-Claude Breton's charm rivaled only my own.  Of course he noticed my bow tie and his attention to detail was superb.  \nThe meal is concluded with a plethora of sweets, desserts, and nitrogen concoctions unique to the styling Gordon Ramsay.  You are invited to stay as long as socially permitted at the end of the night, and of course a cab is waiting for you outside.\nFrom the moment you enter to the second you are let off the cab, you are treated with majestic manners fit for a royal for a royal price.  This is fine dining at its most prestige.  I would invite anyone in England to dine here.  Flying out from the states?  Maybe not solely for this reason, but you won't be disappointed.  I'd just take a cab to get there in haste.",

                "description": "My first Michelin 3 starred experience.  I called about 2 weeks in advanced and was only able to score a 1030 pm table on a weekday.  The wife and I were in town celebrating our 1 year anniversary.  What better place than to go to the place where Gordan Ramsey started it all off.  A decade of 3 Michelin stars is what it advertised on its website.  Truffle season was upon us and they offered a truffle inspired menu.  Our expectations were super high.\nThe food: \n1st course: Assiette de legumes: braised en cocotte with Perigord truffles.  A pretty good start.  Essentially a variety of vegetables cooked and shaved truffles.  The truffles had a mild flavor to them, very subtle.\n2nd: Scottish Langoustine steamed in truffle mousse, linguine and aged parmesan emulsion.  One of my favorites of the night, flavorful and delicate.\n3rd: Loin of wild Highland venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear and smoked pork belly. A pretty poor transition from the previous dish.  From light and delicate to heavy and gamey.  The flavors were there but slightly overpowering.\n4th: Livarot wrapped in crispy potato with smoked duck, endive and caper salad, truffle sauce: Probably should have been the 3rd course, It was enjoyable but the previous dish kind of took over.\n5th: Caramelized blood orange panna cotta: The best panna cotta Ive ever had, period.\n6th: White chocolate and hazelnut praline mille feuille:  no wow factor but was decent.\nThe various amuse bouches were very tasty.  The thing that stood out was the service, probably the best service Ive ever had in a restaurant. The food was good, but not great.  And for spending 500+ dollars for 2 we were expecting more.",

                "description": "Until now, Gary Danko in SF has been my favorite overall spot...until I came to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in London. My girlfriend and I were the first ones in on a Monday night, so it was a bit quiet - but the restaurant (all of the 15 tables or so there) filled up pretty quickly. The service is much better than most of the upscale restaurants in NY - you get attention from virtually every waiter, and they all are quite knowledgeable about the items on the menu. A note - I am not sure what goes for 'dressy' in the UK, but the website (at least when I visited it), strongly implied that a jacket was a good choice for men to wear. And every other guy there was wearing one when we went...so better to be overdressed than underdressed, right?\nWe both got the 7-course tasting menu (unless you feel strongly about ordering your own dishes or don't want to shell , do this), which was absolutely delicious. First was a roll with lobster, langoustine, and avocado - absolutely a perfect match of a slightly heavier veggie with small, fresh pieces of tender seafood. Also served on the house were soft-boiled quail eggs that were lightly fried on the outside (they have a richer flavor than the regular eggs from the grocery store) and a cracker with salami inside (tasty!). The amuse bouche was langoustine in a tomato consumme, which was probably one of the more unremarkable dishes of the night (but was still very delicious).\nThe main course - fantastic. You get started off with pressed foie gras topped with jelly. I've had foie gras pate before that I was not a fan of, but this was out of this world. The combination with the peach had all the flavors working amazingly together...wow. Second course was seafood ravioli (lobster and langoustine). As with all of the dishes, they aren't large, but you savor each bite, and this tasted great, particularly with the sauce that was added by the waiters (note: the waiters added some kind of sauce, for both food presentation and taste, for almost every dish). The turbot, a fish I don't think I've had before (at least by this name) was delicious - a meatier fish that had 'chicken juice' poured on top that really accentuated the texture of the plate. My only mistake of the meal was ordering the pigeon (hopefully not the ones frequenting the city streets) instead of the lamb, which my girlfriend got. The pigeon was good - very smoky flavor - but the meat was a bit tougher than I would have liked. The lamb was outstanding from the bites I had, and I would recommend it if you're going to do the menu. The cheese selection (I don't know much about cheese, so I let the waiter pick a selection of 5) was delicious but a bit big if you're parsimonious on the cracker-to-cheese ratio: the waiters came around and asked me a few times if i was done. The creme brulee (my girlfriend's selection) was very light, but the highlight is the shot of apple juice (or smoothie, perhaps more appropriately) that adds a blast of fruitiness to the dessert. The mango/passion fruit with whip cream is a nice refresher, but is a little small to warrant being an entire course. The last dessert was delicious, but since I was too far in food heaven by this point, I forget right off what it was (aside from having delicious fruit sorbet in it).\nSince it was my girlfriend's birthday, we also got 3 more desserts - a box with pieces of pure chocolate ganache (so rich and so freakin' good...blows away the chocolate shops that sell individual pieces), pieces of Turkish Delight (the weakest link of the extra desserts, but still very good), and pieces of strawberry ice cream covered with frozen chocolate (like a bite-sized ice cream bar, except way better) that was frozen with dry ice...freakin' awesome.\nThis put a hurtin' on the wallet (the US conversion came out to $500), but you have to have a food experience like this at least once in your life. Now I know what 3 Michelin stars tastes like...it tastes delicious and is full of epic win.",

The food at his restaurant was truly exceptional and, up until the end of the meal, the service excellent. However, at the end of the meal a young lady of Asian features with red painted nails brought the card reader for us to pay our bill. She stared into my guest's eyes for several moments, shrugged her eyebrows and broke into a seemingly contrived long laugh. This terribly rude behavior made my guest extremely uncomfortable and sadly became her most vivid recollection of our dinner at Gordon Ramsey's flagship restaurant! For that reason I have only given the restaurant four stars and that may be generous.",

Having tried other 3 michelin star restaurants in New York such as Daniel and George, we had pretty high expectations for our visit. First the 5 star good: service was impeccable, staff were both knowledgable and organized with great attention to detail. Food was amazing though we thought the quality had been better in other 3 michelin restaurants though those had been dinners and tasting menus. The four stars: we thought the ambience was a tad of a disappointment, i.e we had expected some more privacy and exclusivity than being in a dining hall which was a little awkward when food takes time to prepare and you are trying to focus on having a good conversation with your date. Price wise we thought as well that it was a little high for the overall lunch experience vs a tasting menu even dinner at other three michelin star restaurants in New York.",

I'll admit it, his celebrity fame brought my attention to the restaurant but let's be honest... that's how most of us found out about this guy.\nI booked what I thought was plenty ahead of time, but realized there were very few choices left.  It seems to me that they only book one per table a night, but you get to choose the time.  My friend and I were in the first time slot at 6:30, but many guests were already seated when we arrived.  The entire experience takes a good 2+ hours so plan for that.  There are about ten or twelve tables in a room that was much smaller than I thought.  The decor is really nice.  Not overwhelming and inviting.\nThe staff is pretty ridiculous.  I think we sifted through at LEAST 12 different people while we were there.  Not a single dedicated waiter, and everyone took turns refilling water.  (you will be lucky if you get past a couple centimeters without a refill.  But the staff is incredibly friendly and not annoying at all.  They do leave you alone during your meal but are very attentive and can smell the slightest bit of concern and are willing to fulfill your needs.  Only one of the staff members bothered me.  He seemed like a French pretentious high class hipster or something, but in a funny way.  Another staff member looked like the muscle straight out of Russia in case anything went awry, he was cool.  Overall, very friendly and courteous staff.\nThe food... without a doubt the best I've ever had.  Three stars isn't kidding around.  I had a three course meal.  Scallops, lamb, and souffle.  We were given two separate starters, some sort of hors d'oeuvre finger foods that were amazing, followed by some sort of tomato based soup, but not like you think.  The broth was clear and served with some baby vegetables and prawns I believe.  Very small, just a taste.  The scallops were so good, I could eat that as my meal.  Best I've ever had.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing.  I had a bite of my friend's beef, and I thought it was better than the lamb, but now I'm being picky.  Both were delicious.  Before dessert we were given these mango coolies of some kind with glass straws.  Very refreshing.  The souffle I had, the only one I ever had, was of the banana variety and INCREDIBLE.  I'm not a dessert man at all, but it was freaking GOOD!  Then some finger sweets like Turkish delights and chocolates at the end.  So if I'm not forgetting anything, it's basically seven \"courses\" ... the portions may seem small upon appearance, but when you are finished with everything you leave perfectly satisfied.\nI'd recommend this to everyone, but the price tag is no joke.  90 quid each for the a la carte.  Yikes.",

We were eating from the three course lunch menu, but even so we were offered a fantastic pre-starter of pea and mint infused ricotta with edible flowers. It was so light and fluffy you would barely know it was cheese.  I then had the warm summer vegetable salad, and my husband the smoked mackerel salad.  We both opted for the roast cod, which was perfectly cooked, slightly translucent still in the middle.  I had the roast pineapple with coconut sorbet, which was superb.  My husband opted for the safety of the cheeseboard.  After the meal we were offered elderflower jellies, flash frozen white chocolate and strawberry, and peanut brittle dark chocolate.

All rated among the finest I've ever sampled - I doubt you could go wrong anywhere on the menu.\nThis may sound weird, but the service was really the highlight for me. The pacing of the meal and the knowledge of the staff complemented the food, drink and slick atmosphere. There's nothing worse than going for a posh meal and having it ruined by an uninformed, oversolicitous or inattentive waiter. After a quick tour of the kitchen we did have a bit of awkward interaction with the front of the house in getting them to bring us the bill, but any slight annoyance was forgotten with a sculpture of chocolate truffles.\nCertainly you won't decide whether or not to go to RGR based on a Yelp review, but Jesus H.

Just perfect. The ingredients, the presentation, the taste, everything was just fantastic. The service was exceptional, but that may well be because we'd ordered the tasting menu, and were thus something of a priority. The wine list was fantastic, as was the pre-seating bar, and I must admit that I was GOOD and drunk by the time the later courses rolled around. \nThe friendliness of the staff is also note worthy. We were allowed into the kitchen to watch the chefs at work, were given the time to have a quick chat with the head chef, and I was given a French cookbook I'd been reading in the bar simply because I asked where I could buy it from. The head chef also signed the inside of the book. \nA fantastic meal out. But REALLY expensive. Naturally.",

                "description": "The splurge of a lifetime for a meal, to be sure...but nonetheless, Gordon Ramsay exceeded my expectations.\nIt's a beautiful restaurant with only 14 tables, so very intimate. Everyone serves everyone. They not only serve, they chat. They constantly circle the room. It's almost dizzying if it weren't so phenomenal and well orchestrated and personal.\nThe first thing, a man walked up with what looked like a lidded cigar box. It had a couple of truffles in it, and he showed it to us and let us smell them. This was their \"feature\" item of the night. Then another man came and chatted with us. He asked what made us choose to visit and I said it was the highlight of my trip; and that I booked it because I watch all the Ramsay shows and this was to treat myself. \nI got the 7-course tasting menu. There were more than 7 courses though because they served up all sorts of extra surprises. My daughter decided to have the 3-course menu, which meant she got full-sized servings, but also many of my surprises. Hers actually cost more than mine because she got the pasta special with shaved truffle on top and I misunderstood: It wasn't 40 pounds for the entrée...it was 40 pounds extra just for the truffle shavings on top of the pasta entrée! Oh my! Good news is that she loved it. Bad news is, the whole dinner cost ~$500 US dollars. Still, it exceeded my expectations.\nOne woman came back throughout the evening with a tray of fresh bread slices of about 5 varieties: Wheat, white, olive, rosemary, etc. They asked if you wanted salted or unsalted butter and then proceeded to put a super soft, perfectly round ball of said butter on a slate slab on our table.\nI am not remembering it all, but I wrote down what I could remember as soon as we got back to our hotel. It was something like this:\n1. Surprise x3 for both of us: A plate with 3 mini appetizers on it. \n     a. Crab and avocado filling in a mini cone\n     b. Mini quail Scottish egg\n     c. Cracker with prosciutto or some sort of nice salami in it\n2. Amouse bouche (spelling catastrophe): Duck and parmesan fried ball in chestnut soup.\n3. Veal sweetbreads and sauteed foie grois (to die for!)\n4. Some white bean and Scottish mini mushrooms with Cornish turbot (white fish)\n5. Lobster, salmon and langoustine ravioli (this was my daughter's appetizer, so she got an extra large version and it was one of my 7 courses, so I got a slightly smaller version)\n6. My main dish: Cotswold lamb and veggies (I forget the details). My daughter's main dish: Pasta with truffle!\n7. My dessert: Some special Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice. Yummy! My daughter got an assortment of ice creams and sorbet. They came as small scoops on top of a brick of ice. It was impressive but the photo does it no justice.\n8. Extra: We both then got mango smoothies as palette cleansers\n9. Surprise for both of us:\n     a. Strawberry ice cream bon bons with white chocolate coating on dry ice\n     b. Chocolate truffle bites\n     c. Lavender gelatin squares (this was the only thing that wasn't too tasty)\nSo when all that was said and done, one of the waiters came over and asked me if I'd like to see the kitchen since they had filmed back there before and he thought I might enjoy seeing the inner workings of their kitchen! Totally cool. So he escorted me and my daughter back to the kitchen where we met the executive chefs and they showed us all the stations and explained how they operated. It was spectacular. The whole evening exceeded all my expectations! \nOne for the memory books for sure...",

From the very moment we entered this place we were greeted and our coats taken. We were seated promptly, just taking the atmosphere was a treat as well. We both ordered our appetizers and were gobsmacked by the level of perfection. I had the quail and my date had the artichoke to start off  perfectly cooked and at a temperature that made me forget it was just cooked! The main course was decadent I having the pork and my date had the chicken I think (I don't remember hers exactly). I had a Portugese wine accompanying the main course which was superb as well. Finally the dessert came I had a cheese cart and my date had the Belgian chocolates. We were disappointed to even go it felt like a passing dream we wanted more of. The cost was high a whopping 183 pounds but well worth it, to this day I still keep the receipt in my wallet to remind me of how superb service should be! Next time I am in London I will definitely be coming back here for another round!",

I find Claridges particularly disappointing.\n Everything I have to say about the RHRoad restaurant is highly complimentary. J-C is incredible -- he could sell me a worn shoe for a main course and I would devour it eagerly. The man is charm incarnate. There appears to be some turnover in other staff, but overall the service is irreproachable. The ambience is muted and unimposing.\n The seafood ravioli is to die for. For the mains, we tend to order the beef or ox cheeks whenever available. Note the restaurant is extremely accomodating on the tasting menu -- we were there a few weeks ago, made two substitutions and the waiter did not bat an eye.\n And how can anyone not love a restaurant that serves trees of chocolate balls and strawberry ice cream in dry ice???",

                "description": "Phenomenal, outstanding, incredible.\n That could be all of my review, but I will expand :)\n This is the 3 Michelin star Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Therefore, I cannot stress enough how incredibly good the food is.\n A 3 Michelin star experience is something I would recommend to anyone for a special occassion. Most people go to this type of restaurant for an anniversary or a special birthday, etc.\n From beginning to end the experience was unique. The maitre was a French man that made us feel comfortable and was attentive to our every need, like all the waiters and waitresses. If anything, there was one French waiter that had a very strong accent and I could not really understand. That was the only 'negative' thing I could highlight of the night :)\n There are different menus to choose from and we chose the £90 for 3 course menu. To start with, they brought some small appetizers for us to try that were not part of the menu, and then we continued with the 3 courses, all of this accompanied with gorgeous different breads and some wine.\n Then we were taken to the kitchen and were introduced to the head chef and could see how all the chefs were preparing the dishes. That was very special indeed.\n Finally, we were taken to a small and romantic table outside the reception area where we were given some white chocolate truffles to finish the night in style.\n I can positively say that this is the best restaurant experience I have ever had and it was worth every penny.\n I will be back, hopefully!",

I used the online booking system...and typically, only 1700 or 2130 were available.  Service is impeccable starting from when they greet you at the door by name.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the food, its preparation, and are more than willing to make recommendations that are spot on.\nYou have a choice between three courses for 90 pounds, Menu Prestige 6-7 courses (depending how you look at it) for 120 pounds, or their Truffle Inspiration seasonal special of five courses for 175 pounds.  I chose the three courses and a special starter for that night...which was duck breast I think in puff pastry...but forget about that and go right for the fois gras--OMG...I know it's not politically correct to like fois gras these days, but this was probably the best slice that I've had.  It melted in your mouth.  The sommelier had recommended a glass of German pinot noir (Ziereisen) which was surprisingly exceptional...who knew?!?!  For the main, I chose the loin of wild Highland Venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear, and smoked pork belly.  Divine!  The third course is dessert...and yet, after dessert, they bring out all these little treats that others have mentioned.  You almost don't really need to order dessert.  All totaled, I spent 170 pounds.  C'est la vie!!!!  \nWhat sets this place apart is the attention to detail.  The sommelier wrote out each of the wines I had had and placed in an evelope for me to take with me.  Since the receipt only said, \"A La Carte\", I asked for someone to write out what I had had for each course so that I could remember it later.  They presented me with a very nice copy of their take away menu that they had the head chef sign.  Impressive and suitable for framing. \nA wonderful experience and I can't think of anything they could have done better.",

They were able to give explanations and descriptions of each dish. \nJust when you thought you were done, the dessert just blows your mind. We got assiette de l'aubergine (every dessert  for two).

                "description": "We went here on our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience. The service was truly amazing. The entire staff seems to look out for all the tables (rather than just having one server per table) and as a result you are constantly looked after but not interrupted. Because they do a staggered seating (no two tables are being seated at the same time), you are on a different cycle than the other guests dining which makes it feel like you're the most important guest when you arrive, order, and leave. The dining room is intimate and beautiful. I had the scallops to start, and it was my favorite course.  We also thought that for a 3 star Michelin, it was reasonably priced. We look forward to returning.",

                "description": "My friend Mark is a Gordon Ramsay fanatic, and as he is a bachelor and his mortgage is only £320 a month (for a 2 bedroom house) he can afford to occasionally splash out on places like this. It was great.\nWe were surrounded by a swarm of different waiters from the get-go, and it was a bit intimidating at first, since we'd booked for lunch (cheaper and available) and we were the first in. The maitre-d' took very good care of us. We were offered champagne, which we astutely declined, since it would have cost £12 a glass. My friend got the only menu with prices in, so we quickly skimmed to the back where the £45 lunch menu was. I chose the three Rs: Risotto, Rabbit and Rum-Baba. I selected an English white wine at £28 a bottle, but was told it was unavailable. That suited me, since there was a cheaper wine we had been too snobby to select, so we had that instead (£22 a bottle.) This was cheaper than ordering by the glass and compares favourably to pub prices. The wine was stored in a chilled bucket and was absolutely delicious. Difficult to see how a more expensive wine could have tasted better. \nAn amuse bouche started, a little rosemary oil soup thing which we had to eat with little teaspoons, which annoyed me, so I didn't finish, which actually produced a comment from the m-d.\nThe risotto was perfect. No other word for it. Every little bit of seafood was cooked exactly right. It made us sorry to finish it. The rabbit was perfect as well, absolutely delicious. Rabbit pancakes were the first meal I ever ate in France, at Madame's in Le Touquet (5 course meals every night, real hot chocolate every morning) back in 1987, so it seemed appropriate. (Just realised the old girl is probably dead now.) I made my friends jealous with the rum baba, which was big and light with a huge dish of cream and a jug of pure rum. I was told I could ask for more rum (!) \nBecause I had told the maitre-d' my friend had been to other Gordon Ramsays in Tokyo and New York (perfectly true, he likes spending his money) we were invited to have a look round the kitchens! Where we met the woman of his dreams, Clare Smyth, and had our photo taken with her. After that, while waiting for our coffees in the little front area, we were given chocolate truffles and ice cream balls wrapped in white chocolate. Lovely. The coffees were perfect. (so they should have been at a fiver each.)\nMy only minor quibble was the decor, the panelling of the walls struck me as a bit strange- a bit like a hotel somehow. But it was a grand experience. i recommend it if you want to impress a potential mate or their parents.",

                "description": "For a 3 michelin star restaurant, I have very high expectations for Gordon Ramsay's flag ship restaurant.  This was quite possibly one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in terms of the food.  I am usually not a big fan of foie gras but whatever they did to it, I loved it.  The gamey aftertaste was gone.  The highlight of the meal was the pork belly though, so tender and so flavorful.  I would fly back to London just to have that again.  Other highlights would be the fruit smoothie with pop rocks.  \nAs with most of these types of restaurants, the service was exceptional.  They were very attentive and accommodating.  I highly recommend the 7 course tasting menu.  Yes, it's 120 pounds but when else are you going to go to Gordon Ramsay?",

                "description": "Pics @ Chopstix2Steaknives\nchopstix2steaknives.blog…\n \nGordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road. This is definitely one from the archives but which I still feel compelled to blog about. Most people either have a positive or negative impression of him. A lot of them commented on his swearing in Hell's Kitchen. I actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show.\nLately, he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills.\nI came here a while back for the tasting menu.\nI especially liked the second canapés. Wafer thin and crispy, it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness.\nPressed foie gras with Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble\nPan fried sea scallops from the Isle of Skye with peas, crispy bacon, quail's eggs, baby gem lettuce\nRavioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney, vinaigrette\nFillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce, leeks and cep sauce\nCannon of Cornish lamb with confit shoulder, ratatouille and thyme jus\nRoasted pigeon from Bresse with grilled polenta, smoked pork belly and date sauce\nSelection of cheeses or pre dessert\nPineapple soup with toasted coconut and rum\nBitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granite\nI was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course. With all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around London, I think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered.\nI hope to see that from Gordon Ramsay.",

                "description": "Despite what you may think about Gordon Ramsay the man, this restaurant remains #1 on my all time list.  Everywhere we go gets compared to Gordon (if going to a man's restaurant gives you permission to be on a first name basis).\nOf course everyone knows Gordon Ramsay. But it hadn't actually entered my mind to want to eat here until a friend went and just wouldn't stop going on and on about it.\nSo when we got the chance to expense up to £200 on dinner it was the perfect opportunity.\nSERVICE......excellent.  As to be expected at a place like this, there were a lot of servers and other people to cater to your needs.  I liked how even with just 2 people they gave us a big table (same as a party of 4) to ourselves and seated us both on the same side facing the room (no one has to fight over who has to sit facing the wall).  I liked how when I got up and looked around they room they discreetly waved in the direction of the toilet.  I liked how when we ordered wine, and we're not that knowledgeable about wine, we just asked them to bring recommendations and they went off and did all the work figuring out what we ordered themselves without having to ask us.  I liked how they didn't bother us during to the meal to ask how it was, or if we were done, or if we needed anything.  I liked how they knew when to clear the plates - when we were both done (and yes, it helps greatly if you know proper table manners).  In short, they were knowledgeable, alert and very discreet.  The best service I've ever received and I probably rave about as much as I do the food.\nFOOD.... ah the food!  I could go on and on.  I won't even try to remember what hubby had but I ordered the foie gras and kobe steak.  However, what I remember most are the amuse bouche.  A spoonful of gelatin that was the essence of tomato.  And don't forget dessert.  Not sure if it's still on the menu but be sure to get the special dessert that's a sampler of the menu.  Tiny pots of chocolate, lavendar creme brulee, etc, etc.  We must have gotten at least 8 miniature desserts.  And especially don't forget the coffee.  It comes with 4 different kinds of chocolate including miniature ice cream cones (if you are too full at this point you can ask them to box up the chocolates to take home).  \nThe reservation was for 6 and we were seated promptly.  We didn't leave until 10:30.  But at no time did we feel like food was coming out too slow.\nAt the end of the evening we even got a tour of the kitchen and met the chef.\nOf course all of this comes at a PRICE... which was worth it.  The total meal came out to around £250ish with 2 prix fixe meals (extra for the kobe steak), 2 glasses of champagne, 2 glasses of white wine with starters, 1 bottle of red with meal and coffee/chocolates.  Service is included in the price so you don't need to worry about that.",

The price? or the celebrity-eccentric-business man? \nA bit of everything.\n The food: is a classic 2 michelin star restaurant anywhere else in the world. I really don't get why to be the only 3 star (which actually does not worth) in London, for such many years? (For me is obvious that connections work well..). Why French? You are in England, show us something F**g traditional English! You think you can challenge French 3-star? Don't think so..\n The place: I know what minimal is but your place is bloody bad. A small room (that's fine) old decorated, probably modern when it was first launched..\n The price: Overpriced, but someone needs to pay this guy's name! 3 people had 3 courses and glasses of wine for each course (not the dessert) and we payed £600+ ...\n The Celebrity under Gordon Ramsay's name: I was really disappointed overall. I expected something extraordinary from the only 3 star restaurant for so many years in London but that's not the case. I would like to see the chef, talk to people and be friendly like SO many great chef's who worth in throughout the world. He was probably busy opening another branch somewhere I guess..\n Overall: Over rated, friendly staff, average food (for what it is comparing it to other 3 star restaurants).\n How can we compare this guy's restaurant with the amazing chef Arzak in San Sebastian in Spain?... And that is just an example!",

It's serious. Most of the seafood courses were okay, but the sauces just made them so much better. I had pigeon for the first time. According to the waiter, they were the kind from the woods and not from Trafalgar Square. Also, just in case you were curious, pigeon meat is very tough and red. It was alright. The smoked pork belly that came on the side wow! Just wow! It's a bacon lovers dream!\nOkay now onto the cheese. Wow such a large selection of cheeses and the cranberry bread that came with them was amazing! Pre-desert (hah! love this, that the term pre-desert exists that is) was a creme brulee variation with a side of freshly pressed apple juice. It was like a non alcoholic wine pairing and it worked perfectly together. Next was a strawberry champagne smoothie and we finished off with a chocolate and hazelnut concoction. It had ginger mouse on top and was of course wonderful. Arriving with the check, was what looked like a pot of dry ice (it was underneath). It was white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream!
