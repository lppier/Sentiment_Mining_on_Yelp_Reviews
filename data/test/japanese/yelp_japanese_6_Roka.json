The cooks constant shouting of \"Hey!\" on the other hand Is completely unnecessary and frankly, annoying.  \nService was friendly, knowledgeable and slow.  An interesting menu with lots of choices, great wine and spirit selections and a central grill area surrounded by bar seating are all pluses.  Unfortunately, if it's terrific food you're after you're going to be a bit disappointed especially at their price point.  I had a seaweed and watercress salad, kimchi (Japanese?), kyoza, grilled eggplant and ribs.  Meh.",

                "description": "So delicious!  My husband and I luckily got some last minute reservations here the last night we were in London.  Pro tip- even if the online reservations says its full, call them!  That's what we did.\nAs far as the food, my only complaint was that it was hard for us to tell what would be a larger plate and what would be more of a small plate.  We started off ordering a few things, and based on the size of the first 2 dishes, we thought we might need another 2.  The third dish came out, and it was so much more food!  We regretted getting those extra plates (even though they were good, we were just so full!).  So, either ask or just be aware you might get a surprise large serving!\nOn to the food!\nThe first thing we got was the sashimi plate for 2.  This came with salmon, a medium fatty tuna, snapper, prawn, and a small bowl of tuna tartare.  Good way to start out the meal- simple, great quality fish.  I really liked that they included the med fatty tuna - a nice surprise.\nHubs got a few extra pieces of sushi which was also very good and clean tasting.\nThird dish (the big one!) was the crab hot pot.  This was so good!  The rice is a bit creamy but not porridge-y, lots of crab, and tobiko sprinkled throughout for texture.  However, it was easily 4 servings and we struggled to finish it.  We could have stopped here but we didn't know it was going to be such a large serving!\nWe next got two of the specials, the cuttlefish and the kobia.  The cuttlefish was ok, hubs liked it more than me.  The kobia, on the other hand, was delicious.  Make sure to stir this dish before serving yourself!  There are pieces of fish, some sort of grain, a sweet corn mousse, and \"micro asparagus\" (not sure what they were but that's what we called it!).  You want to make sure that corn mousse gets distributed around the plate, because it is awesome!  Also fair warning, this was not as large of a serving as the hot pot was, but it was a bit much for our end of the meal.\nWe also had sake and drinks which were lovely (they feature a lot of floral flavors which we like).\nHighly recommended!",

                "description": "We had a wonderful evening at Roka. The evening began with cocktails including chilled saki.  They have an extensive menu and almost every type of saki is available. The staff was Friendly and knowledgeable.  Standouts were black cod crab dumplings and sweet potato tempura cooked to perfection. We had four maki rolls and all of them were a twist on a traditional sushi concept.  Expertly seasoned is how I'd describe all dishes. Much of the food is grilled out In the open by an exuberant team of chefs.  \nThe decor is exceptional.  Wood grain and glass gives the sense of tradition with a modern flair.  A great place to impress a date or client for that matter.  You have a wonderful view of the street and you can people watch to your hearts content.  The staff is extremely attentive. Pork belly with a little spicy vinegar sauce and sliced apples on the side was a stand out. The baby back ribs with cashew nuts and lime were fun but the sliced, rare duck was the best of the best.  Desserts all had an original feel. We ordered donuts with Carmel although- we were stuffed and happy as can be at that point.  Dishes are fun for one but easy to share.  Roka truly is one of the best restaurants in London.  Try it.",

I don't remember every course but there were no let downs.  Some of the things that particularly impressed\n--  The quantity of food.  Plate after plate, and not small plates. I probably would have preferred slightly slower pacing but overall it was a ton of food.\n--  Went with the Wagyu upgrade on the tasting menu, one of the best food decisions of my life.  I don't have Wagyu very often (I prefer a US style steak) but it was incredible.  It was clearly Wagyu, not a hybrid where you can't tell the difference except by looking at the price.  It was fantastic flavor and texture.\n--  The sashimi course was great.  Very fresh fish and even the scallops (I normally don't like shell fish sushi) was not too chewy\n--  The yuzu truffle dressing that comes with the yellowtail carpaccio was incredible, best sashimi/carpaccio I have ever had\n--  The seared beef with black truffle was also incredible, tasted like typical Japanese beef appetizer but the truffle made it very special\n--  Dessert was over the top.  I huge plate with great fresh fruit, multiple ice creams and a molten chocolate cake\nService was better than I had been warned about.  Overall, great experience.",

The kitchen is very strict on serving times, if you don't order your food within the given guidelines, the kitchen may request you came back another time.  I was able to order in time but was highly rushed by my waiter.  \nI ordered their signature dish yellow tail sashimi salad with truffle dressing which was really good. I also ordered the lamb cutlets with korean spices.  It came with a small amount of chilli sauce and I ordered a side dish of rice (which was a bit undercooked).  The juice of the day pineapple, spinach and ginger was just ok and came in a tiny cup.  The lamb was just ok but for that price I expected it to be amazing.  Overpriced in my opinion. \nIt was nice to see the chef's cook the food in front of you in the open style restaurant. \nMy personal waiter didn't particularly come across as friendly and didn't smile despite my efforts to engage him. Most of the other staff are pretty friendly.\nThere is also wifi available.\nOverall I would say most of the staff are great, premises clean with service efficient, but as for the food I can get the same quality of food elsewhere for a much cheaper price.",

The food was something of a mixed bag, but let me qualify that:  I'm from California and we get GREAT sushi.  The sushi and rolls here are good but I've certainly had better in California.  The absolute highlight was the yellowtail sashimi with truffle oil - that was amazing!  I'd go back there just for that.  We had the Rotaba beef, which was good, but in my opinion, needed more salt.   The experience was really nice and the neighborhood had a cool vibe.",

The ambiance was very modern and lively.  I had made reservation very last minute so was able to only get a table for 2 that was in the bar section.  Although we were not in the main dining area, it was still very comfortable.  This was a high-end restaurant so the prices were on the expensive side but the portions were good for sharing for two.  I got my favorite rolls, negi-toro (fatty tuna with scallions)...it was so yummy!  My friend got the soft shell crab rolls and she said it was delicious.  We also got a mushroom rice hot pot for sharing which was not your traditional Japanese dish but it was really good.",

                "description": "So my wife tells me \"Five, it was an excellent meal.\"  And it was.  But it was so rich that, being used to very low fat food, I would have liked to have had a little rice to serve as ballast.  But most people would not have that problem.  I enjoyed the meal a great deal, each of 8 courses surprising and delighting the palate.  And this was only the ordinary tasting menu.  Service was unimpeachable, the decor was terrific, and, of course, my company was unparalleled.  We had to rush.  We did not have a booking ahead of time and even though we arrived early, to finish all of our courses by 8 when they had bookings that were going to be filling all of their tables, we had to keep eating.  This was not a problem, as the wait staff brought courses 2 and 3 at a time, only waiting for us to finish devouring each in a fit of gustatory delight.\nYet I will still fault them for having an insufficient amount of starch and vegetables to go with the fried courses, each resplendent in the glisten of delectable oils.  Sometimes too much of a good thing is unbalanced.  And I'm afraid I would conclude that you should come prepared to have an unbalanced meal.  Unless you request rice.  And, if you can make it stretch over a little longer than 2 hours.",

                "description": "A couple of weeks ago we went to ROKA Charlotte St.  a superb Japanese Izakaya western twisted cuisine restaurant in London, just a five minutes walk from Goodge Street Tube station, it was totally sugoi!!!! \nUpon arrival, the staff welcomes you with a nice and lovely smile, since the moment we got in, the service was wonderful, very discreet and attentive from the beginning, everybody is friendly and will do anything they can to improve your experience in a crowded but at the same time relaxed ambience, with nice music and dime romantic lights, loud and clear enough to have a conversation and read the menu without any trouble.   \nThere are two areas, downstairs where you could find their amazing Shochu lounge, here you may enjoy a nice Japanese or classic cocktails with some Nihon tapas, or one of the 50 different references of Whiskies they have from the rising sun's country, among other interesting things, before you go upstairs to have your meal. \nThe main attraction is the Robata bar island, in the middle of the room, which allows you to observe the skills of the chefs and obviously their show cooking with some Japanese shouting orders, and at the same time it guarantee the freshness of every single ingredient and of course that they make everything at the moment, for me is the best place to seat.\nWhat an impressing meal, absolutely everything was prepared and presented more than very well with a perfect timings of serving, our table was always with food on it. We went for omakase style, Daniel one of the managers looked after us, and together with the waiter did the unforgettably order for us, excepting for the salty edamame and sakemaki or salmon hosomaki for my daughter, I ordered for her, she cannot visit a Japanese restaurant without eating it.\nWe started with the aburi sake tataki with ponzu sesame out of this world dressing and very crispy sweet potato, fantastic balance between acidity and creaminess, very light but flavorful at the same time, we just loved it. One of the best western twist salmon tataki I ever had. The deep fried Nasu (eggplant) salad with sesame miso dressing and bonito flakes, really surprised me, the texture was firm, I couldn't feel any oil at all, the touch of the spring onion, miso and katsobushi gave it the perfect combination for a nice umami, it melted in my mouth. At the same time we had a crispy soft shell crab tempura in ponzu sauce with shichimi togarashi shiso, kizami nori and some arare, it was sublime, but the jewel-like squid tataki with yuzu shallot dressing was even better. The Scallops from the robata served with a wasabi and shiso cream and the tenderstem broccoli with ginger and moromi miso were delicious too.\nRegarding the sushi, I must say the sashimi moriawase was one of the best ever in a long time, they offer different sizes depending on amount of persons, you will always have a selection of sashimi chosen by the chef, usually sake and toro are fixed included, there were hotate (scallops), lobster sashimi with different dressings (depends on season) this time was Mandarin Koshu, salmon tatar, hamachi, sea bream and ama ebi with imperial osietra caviar, all of it with nama wasabi, the fish was unquestionably of the highest grade and well execute, more than oishii. Unfortunately the maki selection was not at the same level, the ingredients and fusion were more than ok, but the quality of the rice was not the proper one, was too dry, however the temperature and the flavor was very good, my favorite was the wagyu tempura maki, quite impressive and nice move.   \n  \nAt least but not less important we enjoyed the tai no miso-yaki which is a fantastic sea bream fillet with miso and red pickled onion The fish was cooked perfectly, falling off with ease and silky soft inside, the taste of the miso was amazing, this dish impressed me a lot, it was a clear example that sometimes less is more.\nIf you were waiting for the sweet part, let me tell you that the dessert platter was 100 times Sugoi!!!!! I do not know how to start, lets see.... It was a simply beautiful plate with assorted of exotic fruits with some real good ice creams, a lovely soft and warm dark chocolate brownie with a surprise viscous green tea pudding fondant inside, had a peanut, vanilla and chocolate sundae with sesame poki sticks and banana tempura, this one was my favorite, but the coconut and passion parfait, pineapple and kiwi fruit simply blowed my daughter's mind away.\nDefinitely Roka, rocks!",

Beautiful modern decor, excellent service, and extremely tasty and well-prepared dishes make ROKA an excellent choice for those who wish for authentic Japanese cuisine beyond the usual sushi/sashimi restaurant fare! The grilled fish and grilled vegetables were delicious! We especially enjoyed the grilled cobia and kampachi fish and the grilled eggplant and portobello mushroom offerings!\nWe went after theatre, needing reservations, as the restaurant was packed full on a Thursday evening at 10:30pm!\nHighly recommended!",

Expect to order Shared/group Tapas style.  It's loud, and it's fun.\nThey have an extensive drinks menu, and one that I found particularly tasty was their Bentai-san, basically a Manhattan made with Tequila.  Quite good.\n The Grilled lamb chops (called cutlets) here are an excellent starter.  The duck is fantastic too.  Sushi is high quality, but don't some here just for that.  \nThey have a tremendous selection of Sake and also Shochu (basically Korean vodka).\nIf you are looking for a fun meal, get a reservation and someone else's wallet!",

This is the perfect kind of \"Girls night out\" restaurants I like to go with my girlfriends so we can put on some cute dresses & heels and chat about our boyfriends or husbands over wonderful champagne and sake. It's like an ultimate pedicure for your belly.\nFood at Roka is wonderful, we loved the sashimi platter, posu yellow tail sashimi, black cod on hobo leave, and many other dishes. The portions are rather small but very delightful. Expect a rather pricey bill at approx 100 pounds / person, a bit more if you drink a lot... but it's worth it.",

This particular restaurant specialises in islandic type Japanese cuisine with a modern an playful twist. All the dishes including my sea vegetable salad was made with fresh authentic ingredients. The overall atmosphere and neutral contemporary interior, combined with that stunning natural light made this a perfect early dinner hot spot for a summer evening. Our starting cocktails gave a perfect balance of fruit and alcohol. The impeccable service and selection of dishes and 'made-to-table' concept of the venue made my birthday evening memorable. Worth going for a late lunch also. The terrace had a great seating area outside too.",

                "description": "Very disappointing meal at Roka. Quite simply not up to scratch across a range of factors, but mainly the service, quality of food and value for money.\nLet's start on service: I cannot stand when waiters continuously try to up sell more dishes and 'recommend' the most expensive items on the menu. Ours did this on at least three occasions, grating on us more and more each time and generally just spoiling our mood.\nOn quality of food, the sushi was really poor. Nizuni across the street serves better at about 2/3rds of the price. \nOn the dishes that did deliver, the price left a sour taste. Their black cod is undoubtedly amazing, but should be about £10 cheaper. Again you can get great alternatives elsewhere in this area for much more reasonable prices. Willing to overlook price if the restaurant delivers on amazing overall experience, but the poor service just compounded my negative feeling towards this place.\nI've been told the new Aldwych branch is a much better operation, so given the strong reputation of the chain, I may give them a 2nd chance via a visit to that location.",

I live in California and I am not Japanese, so I am not an expert, but at the same time... I have a mouth and I have taste buds and I have other senses like telepathy and kinship with treefolk and who cares what else I am capable of, I know what good sushi is.\nLondon sushi always disappoints me. Always. It is at the point where I actually don't think it should disappoint me anymore, but somehow it still does.\nRoka is highly regarded. I think it even got some Michelin attention, but that could be fabricated and I didn't bother to check on that one. Anyway, people say you should go here and as a guy here for a table of one, it still took a while to find a spot, so people clearly still think they should go here.\nIt was just nothing special and the price was acting as though it was. The rolls I ordered all had some sort of gluten containing ingredients that weren't listed on the menu, so I had to send them back. Gluten in your food? Not a problem. Secret gluten in your food? Problem.\nThe nigiri was fine, but it wasn't that great. I had a rum and coke and that was the best part of my meal.\nI went to Tesco after and got some food to snack on. I won't be coming back, though I will say that the service was pretty good. If you live in London and you are content with the sushi you have had in your city thus far, you may like it here.\nBut, be warned... you have poor taste. I'm sorry that I have to be the one to tell you this! Really, I am. I don't even know you. So I'm sure that stings a little. But it's true, and someone should tell you. So, it's me.\nCome to California and eat our sushi. Or better yet, go the other direction and go to Japan. Then bring back what you learned and start your own restaurant. Please. I will visit you and pay you money for you to feed me.",

                "description": "Horrible, incredibly rude experience!\nI've eaten here many times, and have enjoyed it until recently. Unfortunately, my last two experiences were sub-par, and the most recent so bad I cannot imagine returning. They've lost their edge, and are no longer worth it. \nActively avoid this place.\nWe made dinner reservations in advance. Within minutes of sitting, we ordered the tasting menu, at their suggestion.  I've had it in the past; it's a large tasting menu, with many courses (twelve?).  The food was generally good, but it took them a long time (30-45 minutes?) to start serving us, and once they did, it was very, very rushed.  We were eating very quickly--even by American standards, and by European standards it was a flat-out race to finish.\nToward the end, they were bringing us multiple courses simultaneously, and taking away dishes before we could finish them.  Finally, they brought the desert--which looked pretty. I wish I could report on how it tasted.\nUnfortunately, as they brought the desert, they also informed us that they had people waiting for our table, and they needed us to leave. They acted as though we had done something wrong. This before we'd even had a chance to eat our dessert! We pointed out to the manager that we had been eating as quickly as they served us, and that we wanted to finish the meal.\nNow, here's the crazy part--the manager actually came and took our desert away while we were eating it, informing us that it was time to leave!\nSo here's my response:\nWe did not design their tasting menu. We ordered the most expensive item on their menu, and ate it as fast as they delivered it. It is not our fault they took a long time to get started, nor that they are booking tables too closely together given the menu they have designed, and their ability to serve it.\nWe didn't expect them to take as long to serve the meal as they did (2.5 hours total). And I hate feeling rushed by a restaurant who clearly cannot get their own act together.  But to actually come to the table and remove food, which they've charged us for, and tell us (in front of our guests) that we had to leave because they had booked the table, is simply inexcusable.  \nHey Roka: if you want your tables turned more frequently, don't take so long to start serving, and don't design and recommend a menu that you cannot serve in the time allotted!\nThe food is okay.  \nThe price is very high (£120 per person, without alcohol).\nThe service sucks.  \nAvoid.",

Good thing about eating lunch at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon is there was no wait. However, that is not to say the restaurant wasn't busy. I reckon you have to make reservations in order to eat here for dinner.\nThe services are was amazing, especially by London standard. We sat down and immediately we were handed warm towels. After learning that my friend has gluten allergy and is lactose intolerant, our waiter went away and came back with a list of dishes on the menu that are safe for her. And when he served the food, he made sure to put all the sauces in front of me, so she wouldn't accidentally use them! \nHowever, due to the dietary restriction, I have to say, the flavor of my meal was compromised a bit. We basically ordered simply grilled dishes. The sea bass grilled over banana leaf was delicious, especially the smoky flavored part that was close to the slightly burnt leaf. Roka offers a tasting menu that looks divine, especially the dessert boat I saw on the neighboring table. I had serious food envy that afternoon. I am definitely coming back for the full tasting menu.",

When our main dishes arrived - duck and sea bass - we poked around at the dishes but were generally uninterested in consuming our meals. \nDid we just order the wrong dishes??\nFrom the minute we arrived, we were excited to devour the food and keep ordering to hearts' content. This didn't happen :( \nI also ordered the sorbet dessert and the waiter was kind of rude. I wanted my dessert while my friend was still eating her main course. The waiter refused to serve my dessert until the entire table was clear and we were both done with our main dishes.

The service was great, they even made me a Special Michelada once they caught wind of me trying to make my own! Turns out the head bartender is from South America and knows all about making good Michelada's in London! Afterwards we walked downstairs to the bar, which was equally awesome.

Both menus provided tons of food, you will definitely be full afterwards.\nMy favourites were the yellowtail sashimi and the black cod.  I think the rest of the menu was just ok and the sushi definitely was not the best I've had.\nService was attentive but some servers delivering the food had no idea what it was or which menu it came from which was a bit annoying.\nOverall thought it was expensive for what it was but if you want to try something there, just go for the black cod and maybe a couple of other dishes to share.  The cod and overall atmosphere was enough for me to bump it to 4 stars instead of 3.",

I came here for a work dinner, so we could order a lot more than my un-rich self would have been able to afford, and sampled all kinds of stuff on the menu. It was fairly hit and miss - some items were delicious, some just good or okay.\nIf you come for dinner without a reservation, you will probably need to sit at the bar, but I liked that anyway because we could watch the chefs prepare the food. My favorite dishes were the nigiri with quail's egg and the desserts (we ordered a few and shared, and I honestly don't remember which ones - it was a whirlwind of food entering my face!) We also had some tasty wine, but again even the cheapest of glasses and bottles is pricey.\nFor London standards, I think this is fairly good sushi. But I've been to a few London sushi places now, and I'm realizing that the standards aren't very high. Strange, because most of the sushi I've had so far has been in the midwest US, and it doesn't seem like it's even on that level. I would say I'm going to the wrong places, but Roka is so highly rated for sushi! Oh well, London does plenty of other food well!",

I tried both the robata and maki.  Neither were even remotely as flavorful as a mediocre restaurant n NYC or other parts of London like Spicy Fish",

                "description": "My new favourite Japanese restaurant in London. Really excellent and meticulously presented Sushi. If you want a hip trendy albeit very expensive Japanese experience this needs to be on your short-list.\nI tried several dishes and was happy with all of them. Really enjoyed the beef gyoza (gyuniku to goma no gyoza or something like that!) and the tuna tataki salad. I only had sushi and appetizers but next time I will try some of the mains, they looked amazing. The cocktails were great as well, can't remember what I ordered but it had sake, cucumbers and some goodness. Service was attentive though one overly eager waiter seemed annoyed when I tried to pour myself water from the large bottle of Voss.\nIf you're in a small party, ask to sit by the Sushi bar, so you can see the chefs work their magic. The bar itself is made from several enormous trees which adds to the experience. The crowd is fashionable, so do dress up if you go.",

And I've had quite a lot. But Roka is the full package: Ambience, service, location, design and of course the food. \nI was there for lunch and my friend and I agreed that there was not a singe thing on the entire menu we wouldn't love to have. The bits we selected were awesome, but I can't wait to come back to try more stuff. \nIt's expensive, yes. But it's worth it if you want to splash out. You won't regret it. For a super-stylish, super-delicious eat in London, Roka is the safe choice.",

Only slight negative was being informed at time of booking that we would have a 2 hour time slot for the table which always irritates me slightly, especially at an expensive place.\nSushi and sashimi were excellent although my order of marinated sea bass sashimi was so small it was perched in tiny shards on top of a lemon half. At first I thought it was an amuse bouche from the chef due to the diminuitive portion . Gyoza very good. Great tempura and grilled sea bass (again) was simple and excellent. \nAttentive and friendly service and well organized. Cocktails were another high point. I like the open grill in the middle of the room. Buzzy vibe and cool understated decor. \nLooks like they have a cool cocktail bar downstairs. Maybe try that out in the future. \nOverall quite a pricey meal but high quality. Not an every day place but for a special occasion.",

In the first five minutes we felt rushed. And then all of a sudden we were left alone for a very long stretch before our orders were taken. It was 6pm and the lounge was nearly empty. Kimchi was so salty it was inedible.  Being korean I have a high tolerance for salty kimchi. The lamb chops which are usually superb were just average and cooked unevenly. Temperature of all the food was a bit too cold. All in all still a decent meal but far from the standard i expect at this price and from this restaurant in particular.  I feel bad giving it just three stars as nearly every meal I've had except the last one has been superb.",

Our expectations were pretty low when we arrived at this Japanese restaurant, but I walked away proclaiming that this was the BEST JAPANESE MEAL of MY ENTIRE LIFE.\nWe ordered everything from the grill (rotabayaki): Baby Back Ribs (AMAZING, flavored like Pork from a Chinese Butcher shop -- trust me, this is a good thing), Filet Mignon, Salmon, and Tofu. All were delicious with a unique flavor that I haven't experienced anywhere else. For dessert, had the black sesame mochi ice cream and a chocolate soufflé/pot dish. Both were PHENOMENAL!!!!\nGreat ambiance, service, and above all, food, I wish I could eat at this place more often, but for now, will have to wait until the next time I am in London...maybe in 10 years? Would love to try the sushi next time, but don't know if can resist all the things i ordered this visit!",

It took about 30 minutes of waiting to get seated (not bad) but we sat at the counter as all tables were booked. (There is a downstairs bar where can grab a drink while you wait, although we just stayed outside.) The counter is a nice option, though, as it allows you to watch the chefs as they work in the 'open kitchen' in the center of the restaurant. \nThere are plenty of food options here and a range of alcohols. The beer selection is pathetic; how about some Baird, Ise Kadoya or Hitachino? (These are all Japanese craft beers.) Anyway, we had the glazed pork ribs, roast duck, edamame and beef dumplings. Everything was very, very good. The duck was more succulent than you could ever imagine, and I would recommend it. The prices for some of the dishes aren't actually that bad; a the medium-sized rack of pork ribs ran about 10 quid. All in, the meal was a little over 40, which didn't include any drinks.\nThe service here is excellent and everyone from the matre d' down to the bus boys is really on their game. Even the head chef bid us farewell as we departed. The ambiance overall is great. I can't really find fault with any aspect of this restaurant - except maybe for the beer, but I'm guessing I'm one of very few people with this qualm. Well worth a visit.",

                "description": "Excellent service and food.\nThe concept of Roka is family style eating but on a very small scale. The dishes are very small (our server recommended ordering 4-5 dishes per person). For example, the chicken and spring onion dish only includes two skewers. Our table of 4 ordered too many dishes to count and we ended up leaving about 3 dishes total at the table. I think a better recommendation would be to order 3 dishes per person and then order more if you are still hungry. The prices of the dishes add up very quickly!\nAs a side note, the menu on Roka's website is not inclusive of everything they offer. They have a much larger selection than what is noted on the website.\nWith 12.5% service included in the bill, our table of 4's bill was £225 which included food, one glass of wine, one mixed drink, one bottle of Coke (200ml), and one bottle of sparkling water.\nBelow are the dishes we ordered and our thoughts:\n-Edemame - very large serving, nice sea salt on top\n-Spicy tuna maki - the smallest rolls I've ever seen but excellent (nice crusty touch on the rice)\n-Chicken and spring onion skewers - our favorite\n-Salmon - excellent\n-Sea bream - too meaty for our taste\n-Sea bass - good but as a warning, it is served with skin on (deboned)\n-Beef dumplings - excellent\n-Lamb - excellent\n-Duck - chewy, would not order it again, left all but two thin slices\n-Chili beef - excellent\n-BBQ ribs - very little meat, would not order again\n-Chicken wings - even less meat than the ribs, tiniest wings I've seen\n-Steamed rice - nice serving size, cooked well, needed salt (no salt or pepper on the table)\n-Asparagus - grilled to perfection\n-Broccoli - cooked perfectly, excellent taste\nThe only reason why I did not rate Roka with 5 stars is:\n1. Serving utinels are not provided with the dishes, so you are forced to use your chopsticks or cutlery to cut off pieces or scrape pieces off skewers (e.g. asparagus). My husband and I met his friend and her husband for dinner and it was a bit strange to have everyone's cutlery touching all the food, especially since this was the first time I had met them.\n2. There is not enough room on the table for all the dishes, so staff was constantly moving plates around to make more room for the additional dishes as they were coming out of the kitchen. Perhaps it is just me but they always seemed to move my water glass or another dish near my right forearm, so my arm was either always almost knocking over my water or rubbing in one of the dishes. They need to invest in some sort of tiered structure in the middle of the table that can swivel. The table was too cluttered and it was impossible to pass dishes around as there was nowhere to set them after you have taken your portion off the plate.\nOverall, excellent experience. The nicest restaurant we have eaten at in London after having lived here for a year.",

Basically you add £25 per person on the tap and we definitely made the most out of the £25. I think they might've stationed a staff at our table just to refill our glasses because it was constantly filled. \nDrinks aside, food was good. Standard Azumi restaurants quality. Fish was fresh, I've had more buttery yuzu cod, more flavorful tuna tartare and fattier o-toro from the same chain. But nonetheless really fab food by London jap food standard. I loved their fried eggplant dish. It's so simple and delicious. The green tea molten cake was also surprisingly good and I love how watching green juice gushing out of my dessert makes me feel like an extra-celestial being. \nSo yes, overall 4-star because they made my sunday afternoon absolutely fabulous. It won't make a 5-star because I'm an uber-snob when it comes to Jap food. My advice is, go on Sunday, have a blast and take Monday off. oh, and go soon because if my friends and I keep going back there they might cancel their champagne offer very soon.",

                "description": "Roka does real special food. It's a fantastic restaurant doing modern, exciting and brilliantly tasty Japanese food. The main bit of the gaff on street level is open, casual with a little dash of Swedish minimalism and centred around the big robata grill where most of the fish and meat gets a roasting, if you're not eating it raw obviously. The menu is varied and as with all these sorts of restaurants best eaten shared with a group of people - the whole place has got a social vibe. For a little bit more romance ask to sit downstairs in the shochu lounge where the feel is totally different, red and black, soft sofas, big cocktail bar and pretty much the same awesome food as upstairs. \nRoka has won loads of awards which is cool but in sometimes the place itself can seem overrated or hyped by the media. Not so here, this is a quality dining experience, great for mates packing a good wallet, your parents, your work do and maybe a date you want to impress with a bit of class food and pre 'who knows what' atmosphere.",

We called ahead earlier in the day for a reservation but could only get something around 10:00pm.  We walked around Charlotte street for a bit and left our names for a seating by the grill and actually opted for that instead of waiting another 45 minutes.  Roka is a robatayaki restaurant (Japanese grill) so it was pretty cool to be seated by the action (kinda like sitting by a sushi bar) .  We also ended up sitting beside Jared Leto.\nI loved the atmosphere of the place.  It was busy, live and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Around the grill was an interesting carved wood table top.  It was a little uneven but added to the feel of the meal.\nThe food was really good too.  We had a couple orders of maki, some sashimi, meat from the robatayaki and a few small dishes here and there.  It was well made and the fish was fresh.  I like the black miso cod, but it wasn't quite as good as Nobu's.",

                "description": "Roka is a high end Japanese chain with two locations in London - one on the west end and another branch in Canary Wharf.  Overall it is excellent sushi and Japanese cuisine; however, you'll pay for it.  The Canary Wharf location is located on the third floor of an office building overlooking a nice park / square.\nThe decor is nice - they have a very unusual cut outs in their wood paneling around the restaurant.  It has a very modern and hip feel, which is designed to appeal to the Bankers on expense account.\nService is efficient, especially by London standards.  The waiters and waitresses come by often to replenish drinks and check in on the table.  Food is delivered promptly and with a minimum of fuss.\nThe food is top notch; although, serving sizes are small.  Their blackened cod is particularly good - it comes served marinated in miso and served on top of a banana leaf.  The sashimi is good - the fish is definitely fresh.  The rolls are not that great - but then I'm spoiled by LA sushi.\nPrices are high - aimed at people who wear Rolexes and have expense accounts.  Sushi Rolls are typically around GBP 12, the Blackened Cod was about GBP 30.  \nThis is one of the better sushi places I've found in the London area and highly recommended if you're on expense account or have a special occasion.",

While I'm usually in it for the 'best value', I will be upfront and say this is a special occasion, splurge fancy affair, but the quality of the food, service and ambiance seems worth the dough. Or quid, if you will. \nWe were invited out with some new and old friends here (and it happened to be Valentine's Day so we made this our celebration as well) and everything was incredible...not just for London standards but right up there with the best of SF and NYC too. \nWe shared a boatload of sushi rolls, sashimi, meat and drinks...more than I can possibly remember, but my favorites included (but are not limited to) the lamb chops dipped in a spicy sauce (tenderoni) the salmon sashimi (like butta), and this insane Wagyu beef roll with truffle shaving (worth a decadent dance). Oh, and my fav dessert--although stuffed, we did not pass up--was this caramel sponge cake thing that I can't describe other than heavenly. \nCome here, drop lots of cash, eat lots of amazing sushi and Japanese meat and be happy (until you step back outside into the freezing rain.)",

                "description": "I really don't understand how anyone could have had a bad experience here. We ate here last night, and I was blown away by how good the food was here!! Coming from NY, I've had the opportunity to dine at some excellent restaurants. When people say there is no good food in London, I tell them they just haven't been to the right restaurants. I think without a doubt that Roka is one of the best restaurants in London!!\nWe originally had a reservation for a table in the lounge downstairs, but one look at it and I asked to be reseated upstairs. While the lounge wasn't terrible, it was just very loud and more of a lounge to have drinks in, not dinner. Luckily, there was a table outside, so that was great, even though we didn't get to sit inside by the robayata grill.\nEverything was perfect, from our food selections, the drink suggestions, and dessert (ok, so the only thing we didn't care for was how incredibly slow the service was, but the amazing quality of the food compensated for that). \nDo be warned that the portions are small, and not cheap. Here's what we ordered:\n- Edamame: standard fare, nothing exceptional\n- Spicy tuna roll - small but really tasty\n- Black cod and crab dumplings - amazing!! One of my favorites from dinner\n- Tuna tartare with quail egg yolk - amazing!! Must try\n- Hamachi tartare with yuzu - very good. Can't beat the texture of a good hamachi\n- Lamb chops - probably some of the best lambchops I've ever had in my life. Soft, succulent and extremely flavorful\n- Sea bass with yuzu - this was sooo amazing. The skin was perfectly crisped, the fish was buttery, soft yet firm, and the yuzu flavor was incredibly fresh.\n- Steamed rice - I know, how can you improve steamed rice, but here they added cracked black sesame on top, which made it very nice\nDessert:\n- Chocolate pudding with matcha tea - very nice, rich chocolate taste, however it completely overwhelmed the flavor of the green tea\n- Chawanmushi with fruit - incredible, satisfying and so comforting.\nI was lucky to have my birthday dinner here last night. You should definitely check it out, too!",

Then before we had barely sat down, they were asking for our order, a bit too efficient, I thought as I had barely had\ntime to read the drinks menu, let alone decide on which course. \nThe sushi when it arrived was amazing, arriving in a bucket of ice, and which mixed with the sauce just melted in your mouth. So I would definitely give them top marks for the freshness of the food, the presentation and the thought which had gone into creating the dishes. But I found the service a little too intrusive as they came by every 5 min to give the table a wipe, or clean away barely used dishes. Also at the end I found the price overly expensive. \nSo to sum up, fantastic food, as good as it gets really, but the steep prices and over efficient waiting bring the experience down somewhat. I would say it is not an every day eatery, more of a special occasion place that should definitely be tried once.",

If that's what you're looking for, then it's perfect and sometimes that is what I'm looking for. However, I generally go for the hole-in-the-wall sushi place that  serves me amazing fish; no deep fried rolls, no cream cheese with my sushi, no silly salads: simple fish, done simply and simply delicious. I know those places in LA and I'm hunting for them in London. I'm determined to find them. In the meantime, Roka gets 4 stars for great quality fish and a beautiful atmosphere - even if it is a scene I wouldn't generally choose for myself.",

                "description": "I had to eat at the London Roka as a promise to the staff at the Roka Akor in Scottsdale AZ, where I had my first Roka experience on vacation in September (reviews of places from my September vacation on its way!). They were curious to know how the 2 restaurants would compare on separate continents.\nBoth restaurants are dominated by a robata grill in the middle of the restaurant where you can see the chefs at work.\nDrum roll..... well I preferred the Roka in Scottsdale though the London venue is also a good place to try Japanese food without breaking the wallet too badly. My gripes with the London venue are that the restaurant is crowded with tables close together and you do feel quite rushed with dishes flying in even though there's not always space on the table for them.\nI had the premium tasting menu and again at the London restaurant, you do feel short-changed. In Scottsdale, the sashimi in the premium tasting menu includes top fish like toro whereas the London restaurant served salmon and tuna. Don't get me wrong, what did arrive from the London kitchen tasted great and I would wholly recommend a meal there but in comparison to the Scottsdale restaurant, it just came up a notch short.\nThe tasting menu allows a variety of dishes to be tried and is probably a good introduction for those new to Japanese food. Presentation is beautiful with the signature Roka trick of presenting the fresh food on huge chunks of ice carved from a block at the bar.\nMy personal favourite dishes were the scallop skewers - the scallops were huge and sweet and given a kick from the spices. The lamb cutlets with Korean spices were also tender and yummy. An unusual dish I've had at Roka was the kamameshi rice pot, a sort of Japanese risotto with king crab and a kick from wasabi pearls.\nSo a nice restaurant but Scottsdale wins.",

Once again, trying too hard. What they do, they do very well but if they toned it all down a bit the experience would be enhanced significantly.\n The decor is fantastic, very modern, chic and enticing. The staff are excellent, attentive and knowledgeable if just a bit cold.\n About the food - when I eat sushi I look for three things; freshness, flavor and simplicity. If you're adding all kinds of ancillary crap to a plate of sashimi then I'm immediately going to be suspicious of the actual fish itself. Roka cannot be faulted on the quality of their food though, it was fresh, flavorful and well presented. If they move away from the haute cuisine just a bit and focus on their great product just a bit more then they'd be able to compete with Zuma and Defune. Yeah, I said it, what of it. I think Defune is better.\n One of the things that garners them an additional star in my book is their wine and drinks list. You'll struggle to find better in quality of quantity.\n I'd go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

They have dropped the crispy squid from the menu, and the there are no real amazing dishes here. Most recently I ordered the shrimp tempura (it was AWFUL), an assortment of sushi (flavourless and forgettable), miso soup (white which had a nice bit of oyster pieces, but overly salty), black cod (it was OK) and some hamachi tartar (which was awful).\n On the whole, the food was either bland, poorly prepared or overpowered by sauces.

I have no idea what the bill was, but I am sure it was a lot. \nThe place is cosy with contemporary interior and with a big open grill on the first floor.

We were constantly attended to and they were more than happy to help work through the menu.\n The sashimi was brilliant but that is a given so I will talk about the things I tried that was new to me and might be for you as well. The Ko Nasu (Eggplant) was magical. Seriously, it melted in the mouth and the flavours of the ginger and other marinade just made my tongue squeal. The asparagus with seasame seeds was also amazing, in fact my heart is skipping a beat as I write this - gosh food can evoke emotions - it was so exciting to eat something so familiar yet served up in such a different way.\n The only thing I wasn't so impressed with was the dark chocolate and maccha pudding (that had ROKA etched all over it!!) - it was YUCK but hey you might love it. It might as well have been marmite on a plate for me. There was some noxious looking green goo leaking out of it as well which I think the waiting staff (that recommended it!) mentioned was green tea somethingIt just looked like slime to me.\n The ladies toilet (I can't help but mention them in my reviews :blush:) was clean, small and dark. The lighting could have been better but I loved the dark wood and chrome. There were individual hand towels which I thought was a nice touch but no hand cream which was a bit blah.\n We stayed upstairs in the dining area so I can't comment on the bar below but it sounded really buzzy. I also know they do great cocktails or at least I have heard so but as I didn't try any last night I can't comment on this. My date and I went through a few bottles of rather lovely dry white wine though.\n All in all, I found it a great dining experience but although the company was much better last night and the food just as good, I would still choose my Umu date over it as my Japanese restaurant of choice in London purely on the understated glamour & exclusive stakes alone (oops does that sound as shallow as it reads?!). The atmosphere is a LOT more lively at ROKA though so it depends on what you are looking for.\n Can't comment on how expensive or not it was because I did not get to see the bill but I do know that I would happiy return regardless of who was picking up the bill!",

We had no booking, and as it was just the 2 of us we sat at the central bar that surrounds the kitchen. Only drawbacks to the whole experience; the staff were too intrusive as they came a cleaning every 5 minutes, and the prices even for London were exorbitant.",

I a college student and I look young--and so did the friend I was with. I don't know if this contributed to the poor service we received, but it was very disappointing. When the bill came, we refused to pay the 'discretionary' service charge and were harassed by the waiter. Definitely never going back. The only reason they get any stars at all is that the food really was very good.",

                "description": "Since day one Roka has catered to a trendy crowd who want Japanese food but not the formality of a Japanese restaurant. Glass walled on two sides, walls which fold back to allow a terrace on warm summer days and nights, with the main robatayaki grill square in the middle edged by an elm bar and closely packed tables of simple yet elegant design, it's a place to be seen in.\nThe food is very expenive. Here though it should be pointed out that no Japanese restaurant is cheap. Top quality raw fish is expensive and the penalty of eating non-quality raw fish doesn't need spelling out. I would particularly recommond the aubergine from the grill with mirin, ginger and soy. This made this sometimes unassuming vegetable take on new depths of flavour.\nA word of advice-steer away from the £50 taster menu. It gives you a full variety of the dishes on offer; but with some help from the waiting staff you can get some more interesting dishes at better value..",

Like many Japanese restaurants the portions are fairly small and, before you know where you are the bill mounts up. With drinks you can easily spend £70 to 80 a head (including the 13.5% service charge that's automatically added to the bill). But the food is ingenious, beautifully prepared and quite excellent... leave space for one of their sweet dishes which are absolutely superb.",

                "description": "I love japanese food. Even more than chinese food, and considering I am of chinese descent, it means a lot.\n I've been to Roka a few times, all were 'special occasions'. It's that kind of place, with it's trendy decor (love that bar made from a beautiful piece of tree) and it's even trendier bar downstairs (overrated methinks). The main attention here, is it's robata grill. Sitting in the middle of the restaurant, it's hard to avoid the lovely smells coming from here. And it's also the thing to remember when you are looking at the extensive menu wondering what to order.\n Anyone who has been to Japan knows that the restaurants tend to specialise in a particular type of food. It might be something simple like ramen, or something special like hokkaido hotpot. So, when you go to Roka, look at the grill, look back at the menu and order something that will come off the grill. I have had the tastiest asparagus ever experienced from that grill. Lamb chops, smoky and marinated in a lovely sauce, amazing. And from the grill. Everything else, including the sushi - not bad, not amazing. Desserts - rather disappointing in fact. Service, pleasant. Bill, look away and drop your credit card quickly.\n I'll be back for sure - Roka sits in the list of places for those special occasions where I want to go somewhere nice and have a great meal. I've paid more for much less. Much much less.",

It isn`t cheap but it far exceeds anything I`ve tried in other up market oriental restaurants. We didn`t book so we sat on the bar in front of the grill. I think I`d rather have a table if I were going with a party of four or more as you all have to sit in a row. The bar downstairs is intimate and dark with lots of stained wood and soft lighting but I wouldn`t go there for the bar alone. £9.60 for a glass of sauvignon was just too steep.",
