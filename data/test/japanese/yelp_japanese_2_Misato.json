                "description": "Misato is easy to miss from the street, but it'd be a shame if you did! In a city where large, comforting portions in a thoroughly unpretentious setting can be hard to find, Misato is a breath of fresh soup. They have a large menu with udons, curries, katsus, tempuras, udons with katsu and curry in it, you get the idea. \nHere's what you should do. Come hungry, with cash, and be prepared to wait for just a short while, maybe 15 minutes. There are many tables and they move quickly but it is very popular, for good reason! Order some tempura for the table and crack open an Asahi Super Dry, or a ramune for the kids. Then enjoy your plate of crispy katsu drowned in curry, or your hearty bowl of udon or soba. Leave with a full belly and satisfied grin.",

                "description": "Honest review from going to this place for over 6 years.\nFood:\nThe is generally quite enjoyable with a good variety of Japanese style dishes, although the authenticity of the restaurant I wouldn't say is high, some dishes have their own more unique taste, rather than authenticity Japanese. I suggest dishes with teriyaki sauce, although abit sweet. Ramen/Udon dishes are also a solid option, the sushi tends to be abit dry but overall good. Quite cheap, dishes costing generally £4.50-£7 for mains, £2-£5 for sides.\nAtmosphere/Facilities:\nThe restaurant is often quite busy, more so on evenings during Thursday-Sunday. In the summer the restaurant tends to get quite hot and humid if you need to sit more deeper inside the restaurant, I recommend trying to get a table near the entrance during the summer. The restaurant appearance of the restaurant is dated and would benefit from a refresh such as making all the walls more brighter and the tables/chairs being updated. The toilet is downstairs that could also do with the same treatment as it's quite dark the locks on the doors aren't strong/stable\nStaff: The are generally friendly, some more talkative than others, but always at least polite. The staff can often be busy so you may need to wait to get service. I would say the more polite staff is the male cashier.\nOverall Misato is a cheap spot in Chinatown you get what you pay for, good taste, although not highly authentic, nevertheless give it a shot, you may enjoy it like I have over the years",

I ordered the following:\n- Curry beef udon\nThe curry arrived with a neat mound of curry paste in the centre of the bowl which needed to be stirred in which I thought was a nice touch. I like dishes that are left incomplete to encourage an interaction with your plate for the added sense of freshness and satisfaction that you have in some small way contributed to your meal. The taste however was a little sweet for me with nowhere near the amount of savouriness it needed. The half boiled egg it arrives with was also boiled a minute or two too long resulting in no added creaminess which could have helped.\nThe beef slices were tender and the noodles also nicely spongy however so it does have some redeeming features. The staff were also fast and efficient so I may come back in future (perhaps in another few years!).",

The restaurant is small and I wouldn't consider the food top quality but people come here for a no frills dining experience - everyone knows the drill, which is to order, eat, pay and leave because you know there's always people waiting. I came here with a friend on a Friday night and only had to wait a couple minutes. The staff aren't the friendliest but they're definitely efficient. \nMy friend and I got the chicken katsu curry. First thing I noticed was the portion size - it was huge! There were about ten strips of chicken next to a heaping pile of rice and some side salad. The chicken katsu was crispy and juicy, and the curry sauce was so flavorful, it tasted like it had been cooking overnight. I was so content after my meal and the best part is, it only costed me £7!\nMisato will become my go-to spot.

They were pulling it from a fridge and plopping some raw fish on top. It was cheap, sure, so I suppose you get what you pay for.

If you go at lunch, probably 2:00 for less queuing, and if you decide to go for dinner, go at 5pm or 7pm to avoid that traffic of people all wanting a piece of that cheap but delicious food. \nDonburis (less of a rice bowl, more of a rice plate because it's too much to fit in a bowl with the salad, meat and rice). The bento boxes are good but if you go to Misato and want to get your money's worth and feel full and satisfied go with donburis. Bentos are like £11(?) Donburi's like Gyudons cost £6.50 and go up from that. Ramen is alright, nothing really that authentic IMO, broth is clear but meat is lacking when it comes to the ramens, and I wouldn't recommend getting udons as your noodles. \nStaff is an it overworked (dropped a piece of tonkatsu as they brought out my dish) but they're still polite if you're not a total poo towards them. \nThe place is quite small and so you'll share tables unless you're lucky. And the place is cash-only as I recall. \nDrinks are a bit overpriced, ramune drinks (carbonated soda that tastes like lemonade but with a marble inside that reminds me and every east-Asian whether Chinese/Japanese/Koreans of their childhood).",

The drinks came pretty quickly, a beer and a aloe vera.  Then my companion was served his dish and he had almost finished his meal before I was able to get the attention of any of the waiters who were busy running around at the back of the restaurant or sorting out payments at the front of the restaurant, and at no time look over to where I was sitting and waving for their attention.  Finally, caught an eye of one waitress who said she would check.  Then a long wait before my meal came.  And what a disappointment. The beef was so shredded that it looked like it was the left over bits. The texture was really weird and tasted strange.  I did not enjoy it at all. Also the soup was much too salty.  \nI then had to ask several times for the bill.  After the third time, it finally came.  When I went to pay, I gave them enough to pay for the meal without the service charge and the girl who had just returned from her break, asked if everything was ok, and I said not really, although the sushi was good. \nI have never had a bad Japanese meal, even very cheap ones, so the experience here was very disappointing.  A pity.",

I just love the hole-in-the-wall-ness and the fact that everyone piling in is there for the good eats. I find that in these cases, everyone queues nicely, politely. You sit, order, eat, pay, and clear out because you know there are people waiting for your seats. There's no pretence, it is exactly what you see, and the event of sit-order-eat-pay repeats itself hundreds of times a night. The servers know their roles inside out, and everything runs like clockwork. \nI had katsu curry and rice, although their bentos looked good too.  Food was hearty and tasty. I was perfectly happy and full by the time I left.",

Japanese inspired cuisine, with HUGE portions and really low prices.\nThe menu is quite wide, rice based dishes, sushi, sashimi, rolls, curries... There are vegetarian/vegan options. Just so you have an idea of how big the portions are, please check the photos.\nThe tofu balls filled with rice, are absolutely spectacular, sweet tofu and well cooked rice on the inside (but really filling beware), and the tofu steak rice is also amazing, it comes with a generous amount of white rice, an amazing sauce in the middle and grilled tofu with a big side salad. The dressing is mayonnaise based, so if you are vegan please ask for this to be aside.\nMy friends have ordered Katsu Curry more than once and the amount of chicken is ridiculous, I will say this again, I hope you are hungry when you get there!\nCheap, good, filling. My favourite 3 words when it comes to a restaurant :)",

And only 6£.\nThe stuff were no Japanese though...by the way.\nIt's bustling with people, cramped and not really comfortable.

Ordered takeaway to take back to my office last night (sad I know...) and was happy with the price, but not that happy with how long it took. The Katsudon was ready and bagged and happily steaming away inside it's cellophane wrapped bowl, but the sushi was nowhere to be seen. It was only 10-12 minutes later that the sushi roll turned up.\nHowever, the food was good, a good amount of wasabi was provided as well as a bowl for mixing and dipping (rare!). The egg in the donburi had cooked maybe a tad more than I had wanted and there wasn't quite enough 'stuff' to go with the rice, but it was a good meal.\nI'll head there again for takeout as it was some good food. But I'll make sure that I order just one dish at a time. Warning if you're getting takeout, there is a chair but you'll be bumped every time someone walks past (which happens often). Standing is an option but there really isn't a place to wait.",

For most dishes the price for one dish is under £10 - although you need to consider the 10% service charge with the meal. It has quite a variety, and the place is usually quite busy because of its popularity. The restaurant isn't very big, but I personally enjoy the food there so I tend to come there a lot when I can - particularly if I'm aiming to be cost-efficient with food.",

That's mostly because whenever I'm around in Chinatown I don't usually have a Japanese meal in mind (even though I love it). But yesterday I was out with some budget-conscious, sushi-loving friends and we decided to give it a try. \nIt was past 9pm so there was no queue. The local itself is small and rather plain, doesn't look pretty or anything. But it's not the wrapping, but the gift itself, so... The staff were very polite and took our orders quickly. The food came in giant plates. I had Tendon (tempura veggies and prawns over a bed of rice and a side salad) and was quite good. The bento box the girl next to me had was the biggest I've seen in London.\nI wouldn't classify this as gourmet food, but it wasn't bad at all, either. Very good price/quality ratio, specially considering it's Japanese food, which tends to be on the pricier end of the spectrum. We spent about £10 each and were really satisfied!\nI'll probably come back some time again :)\nP.S. It's cash only, so remember to bring some before going in (there's an HSBC nearby on Gerrard St).",

I am willing to give this place another try, however, as the sushi looks very good. If you are from the SoCal area, I'd just pass on this place, if I were you. If you are a local, this restaurant might good to go to if you happen to be in the area.",

                "description": "Are you a student? Are you broke? Are you always hungry? Do you always complain about portion sizes and prices?\nCOME HERE FOR A £4.50 CHICKEN DINNER!!!\nI love this place so much like this place fulfills all of my needs. I can get CHEAP and YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD and BE FULL and NOT BROKE!!! That is pretty much all you need to know. \nBut if you want to know more, they have quite an extensive menu and everything is considerably cheaper than other establishments considering how expensive London is! Like, this place is cheaper than McDonald's, LOL. I have a relatively big appetite and I'll admit, even though I finish all of my food here, I could still definitely eat more. But the important thing is that I won't be hungry here, I don't get bloated but I am full! At a great cost! The place is quite \"hidden\" but it's worth the search! It's along the right side of entering Chinatown from Shaftesbury. Food comes out super quick and even though there's a mandatory 10% service charge, it's still well worth it. I have had their Zaru Soba, Tori Karaage Rice, Tori Teriyaki Rice, and Tonkatsu Curry Rice! Curry Katsu is more expensive, it's like £6.50 but it's still way cheaper than elsewhere. Also, all of the rice comes with a side salad which is AWESOME and wow...their cherry tomatoes? Only one, but so refreshing and awesome from all of the heavy comfort food. Nice touch. \nOkay, so you definitely can't beat value. Taste wise, it is also super good. Their wasabi is really weak though, which surprised me. But, that's pretty minor. I probably wouldn't recommend ordering the Zaru Soba (£5.00) since it isn't really filling but it's a solid tasting dish (dipping sauce could be better). Tori Teriyaki Rice was REALLY good though, their chicken is crisp on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. They cook their chicken really well! The teriyaki sauce was also fantastic, just enough sauce and subtly sweet. Same goes for the Tori Karaage, which was battered perfectly! Outside had a nice crunch and was crisp while the inside still remained juicy and succulent. The rice is also amazing too, like it's nice and sticky and short grained!!! Great texture and taste, it is seriously some good rice. Tonkatsu Curry was  pretty good, but the meat itself was lean at parts. But when you eat the fatty parts...YUM. It was nicely battered and crisp with your standard curry, which was pretty good. I wish they gave you more curry though, since portions are massive LOL. Food tastes essentially like japanese comfort food, and everything is really well cooked! You really can't beat the price and the quality of the food.\nPortions are bigger than a human head and you will definitely be full and happy here! They don't skimp on ingredients and the food is really well cooked, despite how constantly busy this place is! There's always lines at your standard dinner/lunch time so if you're not looking to wait, try to come a little later or earlier than the typical meal time. However, the wait wouldn't be really long and they're super efficient and quick. Their take out is also fantastic, great packaging (they use plastic tupperwares and it pleases me greatly) and portions still!!! Anytime I'm in London and hungry, this is the place I ALWAYS go to. I brought my friend from Nagoya to eat here and she loved it and I quote, \"it tastes like I'm eating real Japanese food back in Japan!\". So, I guess this place is pretty authentic too, LOL. \nAlso, MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH! This place is cash only!\nI LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!",

Curry is okay and I would not order any of the soups again. Although I have to say they don't taste like full of sugar or salt as usually in other restaurants that are considered to have better seasoning in their food. \nTheir drinks are quite fun, you can get some stuff that is a bit different than anywhere else and are cheap as well.\nSo if you are in the area, quite hungry but angry at the society for pricing other ramens around 10 quid a portion, this is a great place to go to.",

If you are at the M&M emporium, it's across the street, quite small and could be hard to miss. \nI've only ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry because it's such a great deal. I would highly suggest going to Misato for lunch, as you'll surely be filled till the next day. My friend ordered their soba noodles which looked fine as well, just not as much food if you're looking for quantity.\nMy only slight complaint is they add a strange gratuity or tax? I wasn't sure, and no one at the cashier explained it well so I just paid. Overall, this place is so inexpensive it really doesn't matter much. The service wasn't the most attentive, so you may have to call someone over to your table a few times. \nThis place is quite popular but small, even when my group went for a meal at 4pm.",

                "description": "Once upon a time there was a student studying for hours in Senate House Library. It became very late and she became very hungry, suddenly craving Japanese food for dinner. Using her trusty Yelp app she found a place called \"Misato\" that was not very far so she walked to Chinatown to go eat there. And the rest is history. \nSeriously tasty food and shockingly inexpensive! The katsu curry is absolutely perfect in portion and flavour, very authentic (even the little salad that comes with it!). I could literally rave about the breading on the pork cutlet for days. I was so hungry when I got here but I left extremely full and satisfied. \nI also ordered cucumber maki sushi as a side and that was also wonderful. 6 pieces for only £2.50! I would come back here just for the sushi alone.\nCame here after the dinner rush so there was no queue and got a seat immediately. Despite the dinner rush being over all the tables were full so it took a little bit of time for the food to finally arrive. Also, I'm pretty sure I saw a sign that said cash only so bare that in mind! \nThis is now my \"go-to\" place in London for Japanese food. Especially considering the hit or miss of the surrounding places in Chinatown, you can't beat the prices or the quality of Misato.",

If you want to lower the prices, that's first thing you cut. And i'd rather they don't do cuts on the quality of the food.\nWe came quite early in the evening so we didn't queue. The staff was nice and efficient. We were served fast which happened to be extremely convenient for we were starving. \nWe ordered sushi makis, sashimi and a Tori Soba for me (soup noodles dish with fried chicken).\nI was surprised the makis were as good as the ones i'm used to at my favourite Japanese place at home. The sashimi were a generous portion of thick cut salmon. All these dishes were really cheap (6 makis starts at £2).\nThe Tori Soba wasn't exceptional but the chicken was reaaaally well cooked. I regretted not taking the curry udon. \nAll in all i was satisfied and i'd happily return to try out more things. \nNote that it's not your full-on traditional japanese food restaurant.",

This is what Yelp is all about: finding a hidden gem that you would never hear of otherwise, and supporting a local business too. \nThis place can best be described as \"cheap and cheerful\", like a Japanese greasy spoon. Generally a young student-age crowd due to the incredibly low prices. It was £3.50 for six piece salmon and avocado rolls, which actually tasted super fresh and were generously portioned. The huuuuge pork Katsu curry plate came with large spoonfuls of Japanese rice, a big portion of meat and a small dressed salad, all for £5.50. \nService is quick and impersonal, but tap water refills come free and often. Expect a wait at dinner time of around 10-15 minutes, which you'll spend lined up in the narrow entrance hallway. But it's well worth it for a filling, tasty, and cheap Japanese meal.

It is in the \"heart\" of Chinatown, but like aaaall the way down the street. The interior is pretty humble and simple. At around 7:45 on a Wednesday night, it was still quite packed and I waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. I ordered the curry pork katsu-don as soon as I sat down, because that's what I was craving, so didn't even look at the menu. (The server was like \"... LOL ok????\")\nIt took some time but wow, the portions are indeed very large. I usually eat a TON for someone my size and rarely find things filling enough that I can't find room for dessert, but that's exactly what happened! It was so good that I wiped my place clean. \nThe pork cutlet itself was not as thin as I expected, but it wasn't the most tender, either. Granted, you do get quite more than what you pay for. A small downside is that the curry seemed a little cold... maybe because it was mixing with the salad? Everything was running together, but that was understandable.\nOverall, good place to drop by if you're on a budget! Heads up that it is cash only.",

They gave a very generous portion which I feel could easily be split into two meals. But I ate the entire plate in one sitting because I simply could not stop eating - it was that good! The chicken katsu was perfectly crunchy and there was a lot of it too. The side salad was good. The rice was good. \nDamn, everything was great. I will definitely be visiting again!",

                "description": "I was with a friend attempting to try Shake Shack. Put off by the horrendous airport check-in queue, we decided to head to Chinatown at her request to try a small Japanese place she'd heard good things about.\nThus we found ourselves at Misato, a tiny Japanese cafe looking place with nary any indication it was a shop, apart from the A4 piece of paper in the window showing the name of the place. This in no way hinted how amazing the food would be once inside.\nThere was a small queue when we arrived, around 8-10 people and seeing the size of the place, we expected to have to wait ages. Luckily!, as we arrived, a table opened up for 2 people and we were shooed right in. So get this, if you want a table quickly, go in small groups of 2. Otherwise like the unfortunate people with 3 or more in their party, there is a long wait due to the limited number of group tables. As we ate during that 45 mins, the queue only got LONGER.\nThe food itself is brilliant on two levels. First, the value for money is astounding. The Unagi Nigiri (That's the Sushi wraped in Eel) which is normally a little pricy in other places was £2 for 2 pieces of reasonable size. 6 pieces of sushi ranges from £3-6 from California rolls to salmon. My jaw dropped. Not to mention the main dishes were served in giant portions for £4-9. Katsu curry, Bento boxes...I cannot fault the value here.\nSo a place that does cheap sushi probably tastes cheap too right? Wrong. I've eaten in quite a few sushi places of varying quality and I can honestly say this place serves the most tasty sushi in the whole of london. It wasn't bland, dry, nor too cold, plus had the right amount of vinegar in the rice, good amounts of filling and the Unagi Nigiri was so succulent...and the california rolls to die for. I just don't know how they do it. \nMy main arrived, the Chicken Teriyaki and again, lettuce smothered in delicious mayonaise (I think Kewpie) a mass of real breaded chicken, big rice portion and again, delcious Teriyaki sauce. I'm just salivating thinking about this meal.\nFor sure I'll be back, and will be in a group smaller that too. I mean the important thing is that I get in. And once in, I shall feast like a king on a budget.\nSeriously, if you're in Chinatown and in a small group. At the risk of making this place even more popular that it already is, consider Japanese. Consider Misato. Just look out for the A4 piece of paper in the Window and no actual name where you'd expect a shop name to be :)",

This place definitely caters to the former.\nA couple friends and I came here on a Friday night and the place was packed. Thankfully we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes before being seated. They also hand you the menus to look over in line, so we ordered pretty much right after we got seated. I wanted something light so I ordered the Tofu Steak (grilled tofu & sauce, w/ salad) and asked for the salad dressing on the side. When the dish came out I was already a bit disappointed. Not to be picky, but they didn't remember to put the dressing on the side. Ok, fine. Whatever. Maybe the dressing will actually taste good? Unfortunately not the case, as it tasted super watery. The dish also came with a mysterious brown sauce (which I assume was for the tofu). Curious, I dipped my chopsticks in and gave it a taste. It literally tasted like diluted soy sauce. Not a fan. By this point I had pretty much given up, so I was actually pleasantly surprised when I tasted the grilled tofu since it was decent, although - again, this seems like a trend but - watery. Nothing special to say about the salad either - I mean, what can you really say about lettuce and a tomato?\nOverall I was not impressed. The service was fast and I appreciated that they constantly made sure our water glasses were filled, but honestly the food was so subpar I can't even justify the incredibly low prices (mine was 4 pounds). I wanted to love it, because it would've meant good food for low prices - which is definitely a struggle in London - but I just couldn't. I will not be returning.",

Massive portions, fresh and tasty food enjoyed equally by Asians and Europeans. There is always a long queue in the street, that says it all. Although you do not usually have to wait more than 15/20 minutes.\nDo not expect the nicest place ever, though, this is not about style, this is about real food and the restaurant could have easily gotten a new look one decade ago. The toilets are clean, but damn, I guess you better wait a bit and use the loo somewhere else where you do not get oil de parfum just by going downstairs.\nThe main dishes are great, but I would recommend you a bento box with a bit of sushi and a bit of rice with meat or fish, they are just delicious (and the best option if you can't decide!).",

The fish was very fresh and was set out simply and very humbly.

We waited about 25 minutes for our order to be taken although food did come out quickly after that. Once we finished our meal I was still a bit hungry and wanted a second roll as well as a beer. The language barrier was so thick between the staff and myself I ended up receiving no roll and all and a second person coming around to inquire about the beer since the first person forgot to ask which I wanted. On top of all of this, my communication with the staff was very rudely conducted over the heads of the guests next to us since the tables are oriented against one another. \nThe in my opinion the only redeeming quality of this restaurant is the fantastic volume of food you receive for only a few pounds.",

Stop. Awesome, the only thing I usually hate from asian restaurants (it's a problem I saw in several of them, thai, chinese, japanese, you name it) is the size of the menus. And the lower the quality, the bigger the menu! \nWe ordered sushi, sashimi, and chicken katsu. Now, it must be said that the quality per se of the food is not excellent, but if you compare the quality of the food for the prize that's where it gets the 5 stars!\nNow, on my personal list this actually got two different grades, a 4 stars for the sushi  (good, but that's it) and an awesome 5-stars for the katsu, so.. if you want a quick and big portion of katsu don't look further, otherwise you can still consider it as an option but nothing more than that. Unfortunately the service is... a bit rushy! yes they are going to bring the menu while you are still in queue, yes they are going to to ask for ordering while still in queue, but you know, it's central london, I ckind of understand that!",

My friend and I shared an eel and sea bass nigiri, which tasted fine (though I wish the eel tasted a bit fresher).  \nThe most delightful part of my meal- besides filling my then-starved belly- was trying a Japanese drink I never heard of, Calpico, which is a sweet yogurt and milk based soft drink.  I want to think I'm moderately adventurous, so I thought \"why not,\" and I'm glad I did!  If you like sweet drinks I'd recommend you try it (cost £2).\nWould I go back?

                "description": "I was on a lone late Sunday wander in Soho headed for my usual haunt of Wong Kei only to find it mysteriously closed for 'refurbishment'. Being still hungry and, having originally been dead set on a giant, juicy plate of Singapore noodles, I found myself lost in a sea of unfamiliar Chinatown eateries, casinos and unorthodox revellers. It took me a few moments to collect my thoughts, but then I remembered: what about that tiny Japanese place that I had read about somewhere on the social media train? Always a queue, I had heard. But maybe at 9pm on a Sunday, there might just be a free spot for one.\nWalking down towards Leicester Square, I kept looking out for Misato as I thought I'd missed it, but stopped in time. Menus printed on A4 paper and placed inside plastic wallets in the window. A spot visible through said window! I went in and after a quick look at the menu, instantly ordered a can of Sapporo beer, some miso soup and a katsu curry.\nThe soup was warm and comforting, and the curry just giant. The portion size was reminiscent of dishes I'd cook up during my student days. Two breaded cutlets of pork slathered in Japanese curry sauce, with a dressed salad and an extremely generous heap of sticky rice. All were pleasing to this ravenous kid recharging his batteries after a hectic weekend.\nThe bill? £11.50 including tip. Some may baulk at the 'optional service charge' suggested at the foot of the bill. I've read many a review shrieking about waiters asking for tips and customers refusing through their rigorous, dogmatic obligation to take offence wherever humanly possible, but let's be honest, these are people earning tuppence trying their luck. So what? I paid it anyway and left.\nFive stars. Will be back with a friend next time.",

I wish that was an exaggeration. \nI decided when I was in London I'd grab a quick dinner before seeing Book of Mormon, and with this restaurant being just around the corner, and with takeaway being an option, I decided to go for some chicken teriyaki. \nThe restaurant inside isn't very big, but it was relatively full. The menu offers little but I've often found that menus who offer little do what they do best. Unfortunately this wasn't the case here. I didn't wait very long for my food, and when I got it I went and sat in Leicester square to people watch as I ate. The chicken was cooked, but that's probably the best thing I can say about it. It was alright, but I probably wouldn't go back. The teriyaki sauce wasn't very sweet, but the rice was nice and fluffy, so I suppose there's positives and negatives. \nAlright if you're in a rush, but I wouldn't return for a sit down meal. Also it should be noted that they don't accept card!",

A couple of us had a hankering for proper Japanese katsu curry (and not the cheap mess you get from the likes of Wasabi), so we asked Yelp. \nMost of the top reviews paid homage to Misato's katsu curry, and it did not disappoint. I took away 4 (four!) containers for £6, which made up the salad, rice, sauce, and chicken. It was great that it was separated as you could mix it as you like; the chicken wasn't soggy by the time you got back to the office so retained that amazing crunch from the coating. The sauce was a little sweeter than I expected, but I can't complain as all katsu curry is different depending on where you try; and I'd thoroughly recommend you try this one.\nI didn't sit down at the restaurant itself but it was busy, with a great atmosphere, and very friendly staff. It seemed small but bustling, in a good way, and pleasantly decorated. I did miss the entrance going past as there is nothing more than a piece of paper in the window, but once you're in, you're set for great katsu. We were most pleased!",

It is perhaps one of the cheapest Japanese restaurants in London if you excluded the likes of Itsu and Wasbi. While far from top notch, the pork katsu curry here is solid, very smooth and consistent in texture, plenty of mild sweetness and spiciness. Don't order starters or side dishes unless you are a big eater as the portions here are almost twice as much as most other restaurants nearby.",

                "description": "Fantastic Japanese food at great prices in central London. Hidden away on the edge of China Town is this small Japanese restaurant, if your not careful you will walk past it (I know I have a few times and I know where it is). They have noodle, sushi and bento boxes on their menu, so far I have only tried their noodle dishes which are delicious and cheap. \nIf you go at a busy time you may have to wait for a table as it's such a small restaurant with only few tables inside. It is most definitely worth the wait and I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

But if you're looking for extremely yummy food that's cheap and comes in big portions, then this is your place! \nCame here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a Queue outside the door already. Luckily, it was a sunny day and we only had to wait for about 15 Minutes until we were seated.\nThe restaurant is fairly small and has no decoration or anything that might entice you to take your time while having your food. However, I felt that it's part of the charm - basic wooden tables and chairs, crammed together to seat as many people as possible. \nThe waiters seem a bit stressed and rather reserved, but friendly. There's a really big selection of Katsu Curry dishes and nice Bento Boxes, as well as Sushi and Udon. I had the Salmon Teriyaki Bento and he had the Chicken Katsu Curry. My bento box was big, with a more than generous piece of juicy, perfectly cooked Salmon, a big serving of rice, salad, to makis as well as two pieces of fried pork and a seaweed salad. His chicken Katsu portion was ginormous (yes, that is totally a word) and could have fed two people. The food is really tasty and it's great value for money. Is the food worth the Queuing-outside-the-door? Yeah, I'd say it is - as long as you don't expect an amazingly unique dining experience, but really solid, tasty Japanese staple food.\nWill definitely go here again!",

To paraphrase Vizzini, I find the assessments \"inconceivable\"!\nIt was easy to spot the restaurant. A long line. Does long line = good? That was our mission. Luckily, while waiting in line, we got a good look at the food. I pressed my face against the glass, steaming it up, and stared down the food as it passed into unsuspecting customers.\nThe tuna had an off-color. Not good. The soba arrived wilted and sad. It wasn't even on a bamboo plate. Not good. OK, I thought, can you really \"see\" unpalatable-ness? Maybe it will taste good.\nAs we progressed in our line, we got a good view of the cashier's area. In the area was where they apparently prepared drinks. I saw filthy water cups washed by simply wiping them with rags. The large novelty sake bottles were re-filled from sake-in-a-box. They also prepared some other concoction by mixing instant powder.\nI suppose this might be part and parcel of any restaurant operation, but it was disconcerting seeing them do it so nonchalantly in front of customers.\nThe food. I ordered sashimi. The salmon wasn't bad but the tuna was. It felt like someone had defrosted it. My friend ordered tonkatsu rice...\nNow imagine, if you will, that there exists a planet beyond our solar system made entirely of eggs. Suppose the inhabitants crafted a ship and landed it on your tonkatsu. That's what happened. A huge UFO of an egg was plopped onto the tonkatsu. Really? \nThe breading on the tonkatsu was far too thick. The worst part is I could TASTE fish oil in the breading. In other words, they probably have a huge vat of oil and just throw everything in it. Yuck.\nYes, it was cheap. But would you pay even a cent for crap?",

For less than £10 you could very easily feed yourself quite comfortably. The food itself is very good and I eat the Tempura Udon most times I go and it tastes great. Drinks aren't the cheapest things in the world but it's a small price to pay for such a good restaurant. The atmosphere is what you'd expect, mostly Japanese people however you will find the occasional tourist. You might have to wait for some time before being seated but even at lunch I haven't waited for any longer than 15 minutes. There aren't many tables but they do clear quickly. In my opinion this is one of my favourite places to eat in London.",

Well, this simply comes down to the lack of air conditioning (at least the last two times I visited). It is very warm in London right now and it was very warm in Misato yesterday. Almost too warm to eat, except...\nWell, except that the food and service in Misato is always excellent. So are the prices. As some other reviewers have said, the restaurant is not a sandblasted, ultra modern place. It looks more like a slightly student-like place in terms of its appearance. But the food is outstanding, the portions are large, they come quickly and the price is great. \nThe food is also very nicely presented in traditional Bento style. I had the curried pork steak yesterday, with rice and salad. It was so tasty I almost miaoed. Yes, it was that good. On the other hand, it was probably not the wisest thing to eat on such a warm day when there was a lack of air conditioning.\nAnyway, the food (the curries and noodles especially) and the service are excellent. I highly recommend visiting Misato when you're next in Soho China Town. \nReally delicious!",

                "description": "Very torn here because there are so many great reviews and I've only tried two things from the menu so maybe other things are good. The lady eating next to me raved about her order and said its her favourite meal and she eats it every week. The Chicken katsu curry was massive but also not very nice. Chicken was brown, very fatty and heavily breaded with a very thick sauce that we didn't love. Portion size is huge, it could easily feed two people and yes it's very cheap. But I'd rather have nice/food. Maki rolls are ok, just plain nothing amazing. They don't do hand rolls which I was really craving. For such cheap prices i wouldn't except the meat or fish to be of any good quality which put me off. Side note, the staff were amazing, incredibly nice and helpful. My 5 year old left his museum map on the table and started crying 5 minutes after we left when he realised he forgot it. We ran back and they fished it out of the bins for us even though they were so busy. Very nice people!",

                "description": "Having lived the better part of the past six years of my life in Japan, I was looking forward to enjoying some familiar favourites at the highly rated Misato. What I got instead was a confusing derivative loosely based on Japanese food.\nOur party of three overzealously ordered enough food to feed five people from the lackadaisical staff who only acknowledged us when we drew their attention. The portions were quite generous, despite the fact that half of the large plates were taken up by shredded lettuce slathered in dressing. \nThe katsudon with its bland, overcooked egg, lacked any type of onions, was not cooked with the pork cutlet and was served on a plate instead of a bowl (the \"don\" in \"katsudon\").\nThe katsu curry was edible, but the pork was dry and the curry sauce was quite sour and definitely not the same slightly sweet flavour of a Japanese style curry.\nThe pork and ginger rice dish was passable, approximating the flavour of the sauce well, but the preparation of the pork seemed very lazy. The slices of meat were far too thick and rigid.\nPerhaps the most offending item was the tori karaage, which was a disastrous, soggy, greasy mess of overcooked meat.\nFortunately there were several dishes that helped save the experience. The tempura was acceptable and the tofu steak was enjoyable, though you have to question the difficulty of lightly frying a piece of tofu.\nPerhaps I am being a little harsh, as the generous portions meant that we all left with very full stomachs, and this kind of food is perfect for a quick, cheap and filling meal for lunch. However, if you're looking for a Japanese food experience, look elsewhere, because while this was a very filling meal, it was also a very unfulfilling experience.",

                "description": "A good evening is generally accompanied by food, or at least that's the rule my friends and I abide by. Slight issue was money - neither of us had much. So cheap and cheerful was the brief. And Misato was the solution. \nI met my Korean/ NYC friend, Crystal (great name huh?) outside and I have to admit, during the couple of minutes I'd had sneaking a peek at the menu before she arrived, I wasn't too keen. \nAlthough I love Japanese food, I'm more keen on the sushi and the rolls as opposed to the big udon soups and noodle dishes. And whilst I have a special spot for Katsu, I associate it with Wagamama's and therefore only eat it there (yes, yes, ridiculous, i KNOW). However, I jumped in and opted for the Tempura with rice. whilst Crystal opted for the Katsu with egg sauce. \nTempura was standard and for the price, decent enough. What caught my attention though was the egg sauce on the Katsu. Firstly, egg sauce just sounds wrong and this wobbly, semi solid 'mess' looked absolutely rank if I'm being honest. I eventually plucked up the courage to sample a bit of the gelatinous, globby gloop and to my surprise, if you can get over the weirdness of, it's actually pretty tasty. \nService was quick and efficient and the lychee juice was the perfect option for a sticky evening. \nBill came to just under £20 for a giant meal and drinks (1 beer, 1 lychee juice) and yes, I'd def go there again for something cheap, casual and easy (sounds a bit like a description of some tacky pick-up joint...)",

                "description": "If you like Wagamama and fancy bigger portions for a lower price then Misato is the place for you. Having said that, apart from the menu, the two couldn't be any more different.\n Misato is a tiny little Japanese restaurant, only slightly longer than it is wide, hidden away on Whitcomb St, right next to Leicester Square. It is instantly recognisable in that there is nearly always a queue which often stretches out onto the pavement, past the shop front and blocking the doors of its neighbours. If you weren't looking for it, you'd miss it.\n The menu is varied, from sushi and bento to katsu curry, and it all looks great. The portions are big and unless you're very hungry you're unlikely to polish off a whole curry as the volume is simply overwhelming. Some of the dishes are a little too salty for me but for the price you pay, which can be as low as £5-6 a plate, it doesn't hurt much.\n The staff are great, but unless you go when it is a bit quieter, it can occasionally feel like they are rushing you out to get the next customers in, and with the restaurant seating maybe only 40 at a time, it can take a while to get to the front of the queue, but I would advise anyone to stick it out.\n My only other criticism is that it does get very hot in there sometimes due to the lack of air conditioning, but hey, good food, cheap and cheerful with a great atmosphere. As long as you brought good company, you're in for a lovely time, and a filling meal.\n (I've also updated the info to reflect its actual location on Whitcomb St, not Wardour St!)",

I also ordered a miso soup to warm up from the cold. Food was incredible! What made it even better were the HUGE portions.

But ask them not to put dressing which is basically mayonnaise. I was going to order Chicken teriyaki, but was told that it was deep-fried (menu said grilled), so I changed my mind. I have never heard of deep-fried teriyaki (teriyaki means grilled and basted with glaze) in my life. The popular dish we saw was the Chicken Karaage Rice.  It looked huge but had guey sauce on top - in Japan, it comes without the sauce - and I think it's way too heavy for me.

This is a great option if you're looking for a large filling meal for under 10 pounds in the West End. \nMisato serves the usual homestyle Japanese/Korean food including katsu curries, bentos and noodles, but for a price that is extremely reasonable. There are definitely better quality restaurants serving this kind of food all around the West End (Tokyo Diner comes to mind), but few other places do it for as cheap or as quick. Service is bare bones, but its mostly what you can expect in Chinatown and at this price point. \nThe place fills up quickly on evenings with tourists and the student crowd from Asia, so be prepared to wait in line if you don't come early!",

There are almost always queues out of the door and the service reflects this with an emphasis on speed often making it a little brusque. They also won't let you sit down until your whole party has arrived so no sneaky queue tactics. I usually go for a bento box as they are excellent value and provide a bit of variety so you don't have to choose between sushi and a full meal. Not only are the portions massive but the food is also pretty good. Most people are young and pretty cool and you get the impression that they're all also regulars. Definitely one of my favourite London restaurants.",

The sauce was delicious, and there was a lot of meat and a lot more rice. I ended up giving one third of the chicken to my dining companion because I simply couldn't finish!",

The menu is simple and honestly you don't have a lot of dishes to choose from but the price and the amount of food is unbeatable. I ordered a Sushi bento and was enough naive to add a small bowl of rice... I seriously had some trouble finishing it!\n The food is very good and, having been in Japan, really authentic. They use wasabi in the sushi rice and this little detail tells a lot about how really japanese this place is. It's difficult to spend more than 15£ because people cannot understand how cheap this restaurant is until they go and eat there. Moreover, there is no service charge, but leaving Misato without leaving some kind of tips would make you feel very, very bad.",

It is a canteen syle place and you are in and out very quickly. The waiting staff doesn't give you lost of time to look at the menu, they mixed up the order a couple of times and most of them hardly speaks english.

It's cheap for sure and you get tons, it's almost like the Japanese noodle king (bethnal green road). I think for 3 people with a drink each was under £20 which in London for satisfying food is pretty amazing.\n What impressed me most was the quality of the Ten Don. Usually this is quite an expensive dish, and even for somewhere in the region of £6 it was good enough to go back again for. I wouldn't be against paying double for that in another restaurant.\n Meals starting around £4.50 and going up by a few pounds, you're pretty much spoilt for choice since everything seems affordable, and looking around at other tables, everything seems to look pretty tasty too!\n I'd only say 4*s because it's the kind of place that you come away feeling like you've just eaten cheaply, and although I don't want to spend lots of money on every meal, you don't really come away wanting to tell people about the place.. I guess it depends, but I'll be going back in the not to distant future I'm sure!",

                "description": "This place really doesn't need any reviews as the queue speaks for itself- any weekday a queue snakes out of the door even when it's raining! \nWhy, when there are so many excellent japanese places in this part of london? The main attraction has to be the prices- standard for many of the Ramen places but exceptional when you have sushi and sashimi options, tempura and chicken in addition to the Tonkatsu set and other ramen house classics.\nI often go for one of the bento options- nicely presented compartmented boxes with a couple of salads, some chicken, some rice and then your option - sashimi or sushi. All the portions are big no matter what you order and the price of a main course ranges from £6 for a large rice-based main course to just under £9 for a big bento box. And all this just a stone's throw from Leicester Square where everything is poor quality and overpriced!\nSo you arrive, and size up the queue. It'll take about 25 minutes to get inside. At least another 10 to order and then 10-15 for the first food to arrive. Should you wait? And it's starting to drizzle... \nOf course you should! You won't get better value for your money or better quality japanese food locally!",

Taste-wise, the food is ok, nothing spectacular, but you don't really go to Misato for the taste. You go for the portion and the portion alone. For less than a tenner, you leave Misato with a happy tummy. Don't expect five-star environment or service. The place is tiny and the queue is long. Not a first date kind of place.",

                "description": "Now, I guess most people need to have their mindset refined before visiting Misato - it is a truly no frills restaurant. Imagine a restaurant version of easyjet and you are about there.\n Misato serves fairly decent food, true, you cannot sit there for long before their staff give you the bill, shortly followed by the stare, but for the price charged, I would not honestly expect more in the central London location. Their selection is not bad and the food comes pretty quickly so it does the job - granted the queue can be fairly lengthy if you arrive late, but for those that like cheap Japanese food, I cannot pick a better place in central London.",

If ravenous, go for the chicken katsu, which is massive. They also have pretty good bentos. The crowded atmosphere is like any unstuffy eatery you'd find in the big Asian cities like Hong Kong or Singapore, but then again, the crowd, as many reviewers have said below, speaks for itself.",

The katsu curry is huge!!!! I dare anyone two eat two of these bad boys..... The shame is, that because I'm a bloke I will always go for the curry. In truth, the sushi is really good, the bento boxes are really swimmingly good, and their tempura is excellent. Washed down with a couple of kirin's this place is a perfect place to go before a heavy night out, or even a light lunch.",

                "description": "Misato is a cute Japanese restaurant which despite its basic layout, cooks excellent Japanese meals. Within the main streets of China town, in the centre of London, lies a small sized Japanese restaurant that owns queues, of customers, that end outside its door. The traditional cuisines provided such as pork kato curry, chicken teriyaki or katsudor are absolutely amazing. The menu has a trademark salad and I always wonder to myself, how do they concoct such a tasty salad crème? What's the recipe ? Give it to me! Another bonus is the price that is as cheap as £6.50 which is a bargain considering how large the plates are for such quality foods. You definitely get your moneys worth here as well as your traditional Japanese cooking. What I would suggest is to avoid the busy hours and come in advance such as 1pm or 5pm. No matter what day it is, the food is always in demand because its dishes are 'totemo subarashii' (super duper) and you can even get take away.",

Ive been to this restaurant several times before because the food is very good value for the portion size but today I vowed that I will never go to Misato again. The staff must have some basic English yet they behave as if theyre mute, they dont seem to know the meaning of the word MANNERS as they do not greet customers and youd think theyd get shot if they were to manage a smile and a hello, instead they can just about mumble How many? as they point to the table. When you order theyre not attentive, the waitress today didnt have the common sense to think that as there were 2 of us that wed both want drinks, so several minutes after my partner got his drink, I brought this issue to her attention and she just rolled her eyes, didnt apologise and then just dumped the drink infront of me. Then when my partner had just about finished his meal the waitress quickly grabbed his plate away before he barely had the chance to put his chopsticks down! Keep in mind this wasnt peak time, it was mid afternoon and there wasnt the usual long queue and lack of seats. Then to top it all off, when the bill came the waitress gave us the wrong change and when we approached her about it she just slapped it onto my hand, again no apology, no thank you, no goodbye etc etc. If the staff were somewhat nice then I may have just left them the 5 Pounds as a tip but theyre not even worthy of 1p!!! If youd like to experience the epitome of WORST STAFF SERVICE then by all means go to Misato, otherwise spare yourself the misery and go elsewhere.",
