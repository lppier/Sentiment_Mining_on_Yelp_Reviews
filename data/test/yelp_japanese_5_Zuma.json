Seafood and meats galore, grilled to perfection in a wonderfully delicate and exquisite taste! We had the black cod, amazing Chilean bass, baby chicken, king prawn, skewered meats, maki rolls and the juicy Iberico pork- everyone is just happy!",

The staff on the phone suggested I do not wear them (so I switched to heels). Upon entering the restaurant, I saw a couple of men eating near the bar wearing trainers themselves!",

                "description": "In short, over-rated.I apologize if I'm gong to be brutal here. \nSo I have been told, that Zuma is amazing. Likewise, the way Zuma treats their customers, you'd think they have something to give.  So,  I was totally excited to dine.afterall I'm such a Japanese food freak, I was all set for this dinner! \nMy husband and I arrived first,  he said that Zuma finally got our reservation in and they had us booked in a private room. That was really cool.  But since the rest of the party didn't get in yet, we decided to hang out at the bar. The place looked like any other modern Japanese Fusion restaurant you'd find in Vegas & New York, w/ an open kitchen concept to the diners the tables were set lower but it's inter-mingled with the bar.. making it look packed. To me, its more a mess.\nOthers may perceive it as cozy, & bustling. To me,  its just crowded & a total cluster! If you're claustrophobic,  avoid the place at peak hours. I got myself a non - alcoholic cocktail drink called Norisan, made of fresh mint, passion fruit,  pineapple, shaken w/ orange. But honestly, it's just orange juice w/ some crushed ice mixed w/ some crushed mint leaves. Lol. That's how it tasted to me. \nA couple of photo shoots here & there, our friends started arriving. The bars main focal point was the impressive display of different saki bottles.  You'd think that was the only alcoholic drink they serve. Lol.\nWhen everybody finally assembled together,  we asked our host if our table was ready. They told us they'd check on it. 5mins passed, nothing.  15mins.nothing. So my husband decided to ask again.Now we are all thinking maybe they made a mistake in giving away our room to someone else. \n2 minutes after the second time my husband checked, we were lead to our private room. It had a nice wooden table. They handed each of us our own menus & we all decided to order & share it w/ everyone. We got Edamame, Miso Soup, Wagyu Beef, a Sashimi, Sushi & Maki Roll assortment, soft shelled crabs, eggplant salad, etc. Photos attached.\nTo me, the edamame, salad & miso soup should've been served first as they seem to be a first course dish & the rest would've been best served all at once.  But instead, they served them one at a time. With a crowd of 6, it was a bit awkward. Not for nothing,  it would've been ok if their servings were enough for 6, but when a dish comes out good for 1 or 2 people,  a restaurant should be thoughtful enough to think ahead.  But not Zuma I guess. The plates went from one side of the table back & forth. All of you can request them to do that next time you dine to avoid this. \nThey offer you two types of water, still or gas.  We got both. My preference was still.The server was in a rush to kick us out towards the end of our meal that he poured seltzer into my glass which totally ruined my water. Extremely a huge faux pax!\nMy miso soup was ok. It tasted like a regular. Nothing exceptional.The Edamame were just medium sized. We get plumper Edamames in the US. The Wagyu Beef, I was excited to try,  but they were tasteless.  I'm wondering if they didn't season them for a reason except drizzled peppers on top of them? So not impressive.  I'm very particular w/ my steak. The only steak so far that impressed me the most came from Ruth's Chris & John Howies. Other than that, I make my own & my kids rather eat the steak I make than to eat outside at a restaurant. This steak was a fail. As for the Sushis & Makis, we are from the Pacific Northwest & we've traveled to far & wide where Sushis almost a staple.. conveyor belts of Sushis graze airports & restaurants like a fast food joint. I've tasted the best sushis in Washington & Japan. This one was just mediocre. But I can say the seafood they used was of exceptional quality.  That is commendable. But that does not say much of its flavors. Likewise, the eggplant salad, it was ok, but nothing memorable. It didn't leave anything in my palate wanting for more.  You have to put a zinger!\nBut there is one dish Zuma did right & tasted wonderful! That's the Soft shelled crab! It was perfectly fried, cut, soft, crusted & seasoned,  perfectly presented w/a side of lemon as it should be for every seafood, & a dipping sauce.  It reminded me of the flavors of the ocean w/ a hint of garlic & a touch of citrus,  totally satisfying in every bite. I would totally get just 2 orders of that & a bowl of rice & I'd be happy at Zuma. \nFor what could've been $100 worth of a dinner in the US or at any Sushi place, we spent €350 w/c is equivalent to $485. So be prepared if you want to spend that much. If it is just to scratch off a bucket list, think twice.. I'd say totally NOT worth it. Explore the world,  there's better places to get better food out there,  you just have to discover it yourself.",

The atmosphere is sleek and stylish, with an open kitchen and contemporary decor. The employees cater to you as soon as you enter, with the welcoming hostesses quickly checking our many shopping bags. The great service only escalated as our waiter led us through the menu. We absolutely loved our meal! Each dish was innovative and delicious, with such unique flavors. The fish was so fresh and we found ourselves wondering how anyone could possibly think that London lacks a quality food scene. One of our personal favorite parts of the meal was the tempura popcorn- you've never had anything like it! Our experience at Zuma was truly memorable, and made for a wonderful first dinner in London.",

                "description": "Finally came here after a university friend had recommended this restaurant to me about 2 years ago. As I just found out Zuma is a sister restaurant of Roka, which is also really good - it is no surprise that they have quite high standards. As much as I love the food here I have to admit that the taste of tuna has changed over the years.. this might be an environmental problem but the fatty tuna here just does not taste like the one I have had in Japan. Either way, it was a very pleasant experience as I popped in during the holiday season without a reservation and still was able to get seated rightaway. I had the seared beef which I could highly recommend and the yellow tail sashimi which also was a delight! The lobster as a main, what else could a person ask for, the most satisfying low carb meal I have had in a very long time - happy new year folks!",

If there were 6 to give on Yelp, I'd give them that. \nIt's that good.\nWe last Sunday night, & although we had tried to book a few weeks ago it was already full. I understand why now. The Hostess was lovely & accommodating, & offered to try to seat us at the sushi counter 45 mins later, & would come find us at the bar. That 'can do' & friendly attention to service permeated our evening: the bartenders were attentive, friendly, and so efficient that the replaced half-empty bowl of edamame was like a sleight of hand. And the bar was packed!\nWhile waiting to be seated, I was perusing the insanely good collection of wines in their glass wall case, & as I was about to take a picture of some very rare Petrus, one of the staff came rushing up saying \"No, no sir!\", & then with a smile, opened the case & said \"you'll get a much better picture up close!\". Nice!\nFive minutes later (after about 20 waiting), the hostess found us and sat us.  The Sommelier came over to talk to us (a charming young American with an excellent pairing knowledge), and helped us make a great choice (sadly, not the Petrus). Then, the food.  I can literally blather on for hours with food porn descriptions, so let me just say: if you just stick with the specialities (although its ALL unbelievable), you cannot go wrong. Get it all.\nZuma was a terrific experience! If you love great food & wine & want to be wowed by some, while being treated like royalty..go to Zuma.",

The patron mix is varied, younger, older, European, Arab, visitors and locals alike all seem to love Zuma.\n     We've now been 4 nights in a row (without reservations) on our 5 night visit to London from Honolulu.  Got seated twice without a wait, but you'll want to make reservations. We ordered different dishes each night to see if it were just a few that were amazing.  All 15 dishes we tried had flavors that definitely rival the greatest restaurants around the world. You will not be disappointed. Sushi rivals Nobu & Morimoto even though the sushi portions seemed slightly smaller.  The fire grilled meat & seafood (Robata) are done perfectly every time. \n     If it's just two of you get a pair of the 15 seats that surround the grill and watch the cooks in action. You will be very impressed by the level of detail that goes into each dish. The menu is extensive, each dish is a unique creation of well paired flavors.  It was impressive watching the head chef check the temperature of each grilled entree and inspect every dish before releasing it. By far one of the best restaurants in London.",

The restaurant manager made the whole experience disappointing and overall 1 star - perhaps even 0 stars.  \nTo sum up the horrible experience - My wife and I stopped in about 6:45 PM on Tuesday with no reservation.  The receptionist indicated that they could seat us, but they needed the table back at 8:30 PM.  We indicated no problem.\nWe told the waiter that we had a time limit, he assured us there would be no problem.  This was our first time at Zuma, and he wanted to make sure we enjoyed the meal and the service.  He also indicated we would have time for dessert.  This was all true.  We finished our meal by 8:00 PM and finished dessert well before 8:30 PM.  We asked for the bill, but then waited.  After about 20 minutes, one of the restaurant managers came to our table and indicated that their 8:30 reservation had arrived - politely expediting us.  What it did was infuriate us.  Why didn't she coordinate with the wait staff?  We had asked for our bill but were waiting for it.\nAfter paying for the meal, I requested to speak with the restaurant manager.  First the reception manager, Agnes Moravecz apologized.  She indicated that it was all a mistake.  She offered her business card and told us she would help us with any reservations in the future.  She handled it well.  \nI asked to speak with the restaurant manager.  The woman who expedited us came by and told us she was one of the managers.  She didn't offer her name or business card.  She didn't really listen to our complaint nor did she seem to care at all.  I told her that she really put us off and she seemed to become quite defensive and literally pushed us out the door.\nWe will not be visiting this place again.  Further, we will spread the word about what rotten management they have.\nIf you are looking for excellent Japanese food nearby, try Kurobuta or Nobu.",

I had the seared black cod wrapped in a leaf for my main and it was melt in your mouth wonderful. This is one place were you can really just take one slow bite at a time to savor the flavor. The other interesting thing here is the vast selections of sake, served warm or cold. The sake sommelier will help you match the right sake to your meal.\nFinally, I will warn you this place in not inexpensive. While the atmosphere is casual and the dress is informal (but well heeled), the meal will soon add up. Also note that this is a favorite for athletes and celebrities, on my first visit the paparazzi were camped out front waiting for some footballers to leave.\ntripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUs…",

We were seated towards the very back facing a wall with an emergency exit. We asked if we can switch tables since there were 3 available tables in the front of the restaurant. Our waitress told us she would call the supervisor, but that never happened. She came back to us less than a minute later telling us that the tables have been taken up already, when clearly they were not. We did not get to enjoy the atmosphere of the place at all.. Also another thing that threw me off was that our waitress was speaking over our open bottle of water that we had ordered. She had stopped at another table before approaching ours and began speaking into the bottle as the cap was in her other hand. I honestly expected more from this place.",

                "description": "This review is for the sushi and service at Zuma.  From reading other reviews, it's clear I should have ordered from the Robata grill.  Though, the service still leaves an incredible amount to be desired, considering the price point.\nLet's start with the sushi.  At best, it's \"not bad.\"  Typically, the sushi rice should be about room temperature to warm -- mine was cold, as if it had been in the fridge.  The fish should be chilled to cool, but mine was room temperature, as if it had been taken in and out of a cold area too many times in the evening that it was no longer cool or firm.  The botan ebi was mushy.  The toro was not marbled at all, and I'm confident at most places, they would simply call it tuna.  The sake (salmon) was ribbed and stringy. \nI also ordered soft shell crab.  It was good. Honestly, probably the best part of the meal, but the bar here is low. If you've had one fried softshell crab with a wasabi mayo, you've had them all.  They did not mess this up, and it was good. \nNow let's switch to the service -- three complaints -- \n1) The sushi bar was not full, is claimed to be first-come, first-serve, but they refused to seat me without making me wait for 30 minutes.  When they did seat me, they put us in two seats that had been empty the entire time I was at the cocktail bar.  I have no idea who they were saving them for since again, it's first-come, first-serve at the sushi bar. \n2) The waitress was very nice and took my order promptly, and the food came promptly, but it took multiple requests and a lot of waiting to get a bottle of still water. We were mostly through our softshell crab by the time a bottle of water finally arrived. I stopped short of going up to the cocktail bar to order my own.\n3) At the end, the waitress brought the check, and had tacked on a ton of food and drinks I didn't order.  It was our check, but like it had been merged with someone else's.  When I pointed this out, she basically made me review my own check again, instead of realizing I hadn't ordered half the things on the bill.\nIn the end, go to Nobu if you want sushi. It's cheaper and the service and quality are substantially better, across repeat visits. I should come back and try the robata grill.  For the price (which is very expensive) and reputation of this place, none of the above should have happened or been tolerated.  One star.",

The outside of the building was quite unappealing, but once you get into the restaurant you will see they did a nice job of decorating.\nThe food is fresh and everything tastes delicate and decadent at the same time. I have never have had a bad experience here in terms of food quality or service. I have only eaten in the main dining area - I have never eaten at the bar.\nFavorite Food:\n-Wagyu Beef\n-Rock Shrimp\n-Black Cod (this and Nobu's are my favorites)\n-Edamame (they don't overcook or undercook it - just the right amount of crispiness)\n-Sushi and maki - All of it. Seriously the freshest sushi I have ever had in London \nI would also recommend having someone make a reservation a little a head of time.  \nNow that I think about it, I like this branch over the Zuma's in Istanbul and Dubai. The staff doesn't have the attitude I saw more of in the other branches. Ex: The Dubai branch charged us a ton for ordering chili sauce and chilli pepper flakes because, as they put it, anything else you put on the food would ruin the quality of it. I totally get and understand the concept, but they should have told us they would charge us a hefty amount... eh, to each their own I guess.",

                "description": "The food here is really, really, stupidly good.  There was basically nothing we ordered that wasn't absolutely top-qaulity in presentation and taste:  the black cod was as good as everyone says, I am still thinking about the steak tartare (seriously, I'll be back just for that), the fish was all top-quality, and even the dessert (green tea banana cake) was special.  Next time I'm in London, I'll be back.\nSo why only four stars?  Because the service was worse than awful.  I've been there twice at the sushi bar, and both times (different) servers seemed really irritated to have to bring people food, take orders, get drinks, etc.  Both nights (with different people) we were forgotten about for stretches of time, and both nights there were really odd pacing issues with the meal that didn't seem attributable to the pace of food from the kitchen.\nSo, while this place is worth a trip--the food is that good--the service keeps it from being among the very best of the best.",

                "description": "We were a party of 10 people, it was a Wednesday, and the joint was packed and in full swing. Our group didn't have to wait much to be seated (reserved for 7pm), and once we were there the army of attentive staff just kept it all coming with impressive efficiency.\nZuma is all about the 'family style' arrangement of food, and the host of our particular group did just that as he proceeded to order a large selection of dishes for everyone. Once the first platter arrived, it seemed to never end as we were brought plate after plate of beautifully presented and masterfully crafted seafood, fish, and meats. My glass never stayed more than half empty either which was comforting, as the sake (they have many to choose from) was a delight.\nSince I didn't actually do the ordering I have no idea what the dishes are called but there were a few notable things you should look to try when you go.\n-Chopped scallops with a wasabi dressing of some sort\n-Black Cod (i'd heard of this in other reviews, and my god is it good)\n-sweet corn tempura dish kind of looks like popcorn and is highly addictive.\n-The sashimi is also top notch\nThe only thing that was slightly unpleasant was that we were effectively asked to make way for the next reservation toward the end. As far as I'm aware they give you some sort of warning beforehand about this, but after an enjoyable night with a hefty tab mounting it's not so nice to have to go stand at the crowded bar again when all you want to do is sit back a bit and carry on the conversation.\nHowever, all that aside, Zuma was an experience I highly recommend and the food was really quite excellent. Go check it out.",

                "description": "I know a lot of fellow Journalists love this place because of the diversity of food and - as the Lords who run my Journalistic Manor are kind when it comes to my expense account - I have eaten here on a number of occasions, but mainly because it appeals to the victim I have chosen to eat out with and pump for information. Therefore, working on the basis that the snitch is always right, until they spew out the goodies, I have been accommodating.\nWould I choose to eat here by myself or with a friend? No!\nWhy? Well, to be very frank, the cuisine is not always constant. Whether the owners have a dose of 'Change the Chef often before he get's lazy' or whether that character is fickle, I have no idea. I haven't attempted to grill him to find out. I only take the bright lights to put in politicians eyes, besides, Chefs are usually already conditioned to heat.\nI am presuming that the restaurant was named after Zuma Beach in Malibu, California and the owners have spent time there watching the Beach Babes and not enough time watching the staff - or perhaps too much time watching the staff nick the silver, because every time I have been there, I see new faces, but same type of menu. Which I should mention always looks superb on paper: asparagus tempura, crispy fried squid with green chilli, wagyu beef, black cod with miso, and sushi etc.\nI am prepared to say, in defence of the place that anything that hasn't been well cooked is not usually my cup of Twinings, therefore, perhaps my comments could easily be put down to seeing too many people eat Sushi. Then again, being a person who likes consistency and good service, I do try to be objective. In that department I must say they really never came up to my standards. But, as I could say the same about Horror Films with giant crabs in them, you can swallow all my criticism with a light grain of salt.",

I didn't eat at Zuma so I can't tell you about the food or food service. \nBut as a lounge it has a swank decor, plenty of space, low lighting and an upscale crowd. This is the kind of place where you dress to be seen and while you're at it, take a look around yourself. \nIt's definitely a good place to go for a pre- or post-dinner drink, especially if you want a sophisticated feel and large beverage choice.

                "description": "Zuma opened in Knightsbridge in 2002. I was young(er) back then, but I knew amazing food when I tasted it. My opinion of Zuma has changed only slightly in the past decade, swayed by occasional visits here and there. Either the food has become even better, or my adult senses have developed more attuned receptors.\nThe restaurant bills itself as serving 'contemporary Japanese cuisine', but for some odd reason the place itself always reminds me of Africa. A weirdly jolting contrast to make, but for me that's a positive. The tables and chairs are all chunky light-coloured wood, the walls bear matching panels, there are green potted plants peppering the dining area and the base of the bar is formed from uncut stone, like an organic boulder of granite that grew naturally at the heart of Raphael Street. These rustic elements are juxtaposed with a lot of glass and the suave cosmopolitan clientele. It is hard to find a table here in the evenings, booking is definitely recommended, while at lunch time you may be asked to wait on busy days.\nThis was the case the other day, but we made it back to find the largest table in the place ready for the three of us. We weren't positioned in the main dining area, but from my seat I had a clear view of the kitchen, aromas and all.\nWe ordered the Crispy Fried Squid with Green Chili and Salt - hands down the best crispy fried squid I've ever had. Not only in taste and texture, but also in its consistent excellence (I always order it). The batter is light enough to taste the squid underneath and fine enough to form an irresistible crunch. The seasoning is sublime. It tasted so good but I was unsure about exactly which ingredient was doing all the flavoursome work. Upon asking the waiter, I was told that the fried squid is tossed with shichimi pepper, a Japanese mix of anything from red chilli pepper, Sichuan pepper, ground ginger, black and white sesame seeds and even roasted orange or Yuzu peel. A juicy squeeze of lime and I'm telling you it's perfect (we ordered a second round).\nWe also ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi in Ponzu Sauce with Crispy Garlic. The fish is soft and supple, while the flavours are strong and refreshing.\nThe Thinly Sliced Seabass with Yuzu, Truffle Oil and Salmon Roe was equally fantastic, with that distinctly appetising scent of truffle emanating from the plate as soon as it arrives to your table. Again, the fish is of the highest quality and so each piece melts in your mouth. Each slice is so delicate and dainty but altogether the dishes accumulate to ensure you are full in the nicest of ways.\nAn absolute favourite of mine is the Aubergine with Miso Paste, which probably pips Chutney Mary to the crown for best aubergine small dish in London. I will also definitely be re-ordering the new-ish Mackerel Roll wrapped in thin slices of cucumber for the delicacy and freshness of its ingredients. It's a roll without rice, which makes it lighter and more refined to taste, so that you really enjoy the soft mackerel meat and the contrasting crunch of the cucumber. It is served marinating in a dish of pickle juice, which adds a subtle tangy flavour. Such a fine and enjoyable dish.\nTwo other delicious rolls are the Dynamite Spider Roll and the Salmon and Avacado inside out roll. The former comes stuffed with tempura soft-shell crab and a dab of chilli mayonnaise on top, adding a luxury hint of creamy spice to the crispy interior - another must-have dish.\nI haven't really come across a non must-have here, and I look forward to returning again and again over the next decade to sample even more of their dishes and try something from the Robata grill. Presentation, service, decor, food - it's all crème de la crème. Zuma is the place to go to for exquisite food and a buzzing ambiance. Expect to have to book, to pay the price for the quality, the name and the location - then nothing can disappoint you. Just enjoy.",

                "description": "Dear London: if this is the best Japanese you have to offer, New York totally owns you in this category (as well as some joints in California as well). That's not to say that the food wasn't good here - it was definitely above average - but given the exorbitant cost of food here in the UK, you have to live up to some pretty high standards to make the cut...and I've been to places in NYC that cost less than half of what I paid tonight that was a better overall epicurean experience than this was.\nWe did the omakase because...well, you figure you're going to get the best the restaurant has to offer. Courses often came out two at a time, which was nice because it meant we weren't waiting for the food to come out. The first two courses were very delicious - tuna tartare on a rice cracker and the sea bass in truffle oil. The former is something that is very simple but works well, as most of the tuna tartare I have had is plain. This was lightly seasoned and had very thin cuts of scallion with it, adding a nice little twist. The truffle oil on the sea bass was a revelation (it's not something I've had anywhere else); the mushroom-infused marinade worked very well on the sea bass, and the side of ikura worked well to add a touch of saltiness to the platter. The other fantastic dish was the tempura-style langoustine with a vinegar-based dipping sauce. Regular tempura is akin to beer battered fried food, but this was done very lightly instead, with the crispiness looking more like fuzzy threads coming off of it...but it works because it doesn't dominate the dish and allows for the langoustine's flavor to come through. The black cod wrapped in banana leaves (or was it lotus?) was done well for a fairly standard Asian dish; I liked the accompanying citrus dip that took the edge off the heavily baked-in miso marinade.\nThat said, I took issue with a couple of the main dishes that were served: the wagyu beef and (very unfortunately, since this is crucial to a good restaurant) the sushi/sashimi combo. I've had amazing beef at shabu-shabu and cooked over a stone, and that is delicious. This beef was clearly cooked as a full filet and then subsequently cut up...as such, instead of all of the pieces being a tender medium-rare, a quarter of them (towards the ends, and even some in the middle) were closer to medium-well and well-done - definitely not the aspired result. The accompanying sauces were banal - a standard sesame-soy dipping sauce and a mayo-based dipping sauce that didn't have that needed kick. The sushi was disappointing because we got all of 2(!) pieces, and one of them (the yellowtail) was probably the worst quality I've had at a high-end Japanese shop. The other (a piece of aburi sushi) was absolutely delicious, which makes me wonder why there's so much inconsistency. The sashimi was equally inconsistent: the semi-fatty tuna was very good, and the mackarel was on the better end of what I usually get in this fish, but the rest was unmemorable: the sea bass was way too chewy, the salmon didn't have that fresh buttery taste or deep flavor you get from the truly fresh stuff, and the grouper (with some kind of vinegar jam on top) was bland. Bland ain't grand; it's forgettable.\nDessert was a bit on the large side (six dishes served in a huge bowl of ice; Zuma does like serving lots of its dishes on ice) and was a microcosm of the inconsistency of the main course. The best was the chocolate lava cake filled with chocolate caramel; this was absolutely delicious, with the caramel adding a nice layer of flavor to a dish that is usually chocolate on top of (and inside of chocolate). The banana cake with regular caramel was also quite tasty, although it tasted a little too much like banana bread with caramel syrup added to it. The coconut pudding with fresh fruit was tasty, but the problem here is that the consistency of the pudding was different: it was quite thin (almost liquid-like) at the top, but quite a bit more viscous at the bottom. As for the ice creams served, the vanilla was bland (I think someone forgot to add sugar or anything that would make it sweet), the green tea was green tea (i.e. unexciting without being paired with anything else, like red beans), and the coconut was the best, but the flavor of the fruit was muted (probably the same deal as with the vanilla).\nService was pretty decent, but for 96 pounds a person + 20%(!) tax + 15% 'optional' gratuity (why is it called optional when every place I've been to adds it automatically?) + 4 pounds for edamame (the most expensive edamame I've had, and not noticeably different at all) + 4.50 pounds for flat water(!!!), I could've spent the money better elsewhere. The food was alright, but if I did come back, I would save money by picking individual dishes instead of going with the tasting menu. Pick the dishes that are good, and not only will you not be disappointed, your wallet will feel better as well. That's what I call a win-win.",

We ordered a selection of plates for 5 people, but didn't get sushi except for a sashimi platter and instead went heavy on the cooked meat. Some takeaways: the spicy edamame much better than plain edamame (wasn't too spicy, but very good flavour), the aubergine dish was quite nice, but the creamed spinach was missable. As for the seafood, the crispy fried squid was good but nothing spectacular, and same for prawn tempura, whilst the sashimi selection was very enjoyable and well presented.  And the meat was the highlight, especially the grilled pork skewer and the seared steak. The chicken wings were tasty but had very little meat, and a pain to eat because it's nearly impossible to eat with chopsticks. I also had a watermelon martini that they are famous for, and I highly recommend it. The service was mediocre, as we had to ask a number of times to get forks, initial drinks, and drink refills.

                "description": "Oh my word. \nSo, a little bit of context. We were in town for a few days and, being Japanese and having lived in the Middle East for far too long, I really wanted good Japanese food. We scoured Yelp reviews, TripAdvisor reviews, Time Out reviews for hours until I saw a couple of Asian reviews for Zuma and figured ok, let's give this one a shot (I'm sorry, white folks, I love you but you don't know sh*t about Japanese food). \nIn fact, we vetted Zuma for so long that we timed ourselves right out of a reservation! Our concierge mentioned that we might be able to get a seat at the sushi bar if we went at around 7 pm, so what did we do? We waltzed in at 9 pm on a Saturday night. Well, long story short, although they told us we could get a seat at 10:45 (at which point we had a brief and intense discussion about how badly we wanted this food; conclusion: pretty badly), we went for drinks, came back, and got seats promptly at 10. Not bad. \nWe had a hilarious waiter, who was not shy about telling us exactly what we should order. In most cases, we took his suggestion, and were not sorry that we did. In our normal ridiculous fashion, we ordered a ton of food:\nThinly sliced hamachi (like carpaccio) with green chili and garlic\nSeared tuna with chili daikon and ponzu\nSea bream, chu toro (semi-fatty tuna), salmon sashimi\nWagyu sushi (let me just take a moment to add that my boyfriend was talking to me as I put the first bite in my mouth, and had to stop for a full two minutes because I was definitely no longer paying attention--this is easily one of the best things I've ever had)\nUnagi nigiri\nLobster sashimi (oh lord, so good)\nGrilled jumbo tiger prawns (when this came to the table, it was so large I thought it was the lobster)\nRoast lobster (this was actually a mistake; the waiter heard roast and we meant raw, but we took it anyway. Very good but a tiny bit too heavily spiced)\nAnd then, when I thought I could take no more, they came with a plate of chicken yakitori on the house--I actually begged them not to give it to us because I was so full, but they put it in front of me and of course I ate it. After, the waiter blessedly came by with some green tea, winked at me, and said, \"Good for digestion.\" Good thing he did, because I might not have been able to walk out of there.\nNo, it's not Japan. The fish, while incredibly, unbelievably fresh, is still not as good as what you can get in Japan. But that's like saying that you don't like your Riedel wine glass because it's not the holy grail. \nNext time, I'd like to try the tempura, which looked slightly too heavy on the batter but otherwise good and some of the other grill dishes. We will definitely be going back. Oh, and one other thing: they have fresh wasabi. That's an automatic win in my book.",

The service is attentive and a little pushy to order from each of the three kitchens, but we had such a fabulous time. The food was delicious and really special. The tuna tataki was one of my favourite dishes! Also, the spicy (you can handle it) garlic edamame is so amazing. I'm craving it as I type this! It's a definite must when you visit london.

If you are looking for Japanese Cuisine and you are close to Hyde Park you have to come here.\nFirst you will be blown away by the Japanese decor which transports you to another world and many moons from busy London, so relaxing.\nI ordered the tori no tabasaki which is basically chicken wings but flavoured with lime - delicious. I followed this with wagyu no sumibiyaki (elegantly presented flavoured beef). I washed this down with my usual warm Saki, I always end up drinking too much of this stuff.\nI really fancied the banana cake but was full from my main.

                "description": "More photos and stuff here\nhungryinlondon.com/2011/…\n \n Zuma is a restaurant for special occasions. It is part of a small world wide chain with subsidiaries in Hong kong, Istanbul, Miami and Dubai. You might be able to get away with a semi-affordable bill when ordering carefully, but in the end you will want to splash out. Zuma invites to decadence and gluttony, and at this night, for my birthday, I was part of it.\n In London, Zuma is located in a very ugly building not far from Knightsbridge tube station and doesn't look like much from the outside. When you enter it however, you feel like you have stepped into a night club or into one of these bars I never go to because I refuse to pay 15 pounds for a cocktail and I usually don't confirm with the dress code.\n Surrounded by the young, rich and stylish I was glad I had dressed up for this special occasion feeling like a real Chelsea girl, wearing something rather short together with very high heels in the form of my almost virgin golden Sergio Rossi stilettos. Sipping my Saffron and Poppy Seed Martini (10.50) I was waiting to be spoiled.\n I really liked Zuma, in fact I liked it about 1 million times more than the only other posh Japanese restaurant I have been to in London, Nobu Berkley Square.\n LIKE\n 1. Lovely staff: Even though we didn't have a reservation the lovely people at the counter found us a place at the sushi bar within 10 minutes. Friendly and forthcoming they had nothing in common with the pretentious waiters at Nobu.\n2. The menu: I liked the fact that in addition to some astronomically priced dishes they do have a good selection of dishes costing less than 10 pounds.\n3. The wine: There are also quite some wines for under 20 pounds, which allows you to maybe order a couple of dishes more\n4. The food (see below) was sublime. I loved the fresh and exquisite ingredients, the exotic and well-balanced sauces and the inventive take on Japanese food without losing the traditional touch.\n DISLIKE\n 1. I really wanted some cold sake to go with my Japanese delicacies, but they were out of the two cheapest sakes! (19£ and 29£ respectively for 300 ml). We did not go with the next expensive one (40£) but had wine instead. Wanted sake though!\n 2. The Sushi Counter: the person who designed this should lose his/her licence really. The broad stone surface gives you plenty of space for all your plates but underneath  this is a completely different story. Even I with my 5.3 ft had no idea what to do with my legs. Not only was there absolutely no space, the inside surface of the counter was ragged, which not only destroys stockings but also hurts! This reminded me of the story that I once heard about McDonalds, where they intentionally use tilted chairs so that the customer does not feel to comfortable and doesn't want to linger. I wonder if similar incentives were in the mind also of the people behind the Zuma interior design?\n3. Why don't they put prices on their website? I really don't like this, people should know what they are in for. And while I'm at it, did I mention that I HATE websites with music?\n Anyway, the most important thing is the food, here we go:\n Suzuki no osashimi (12.60)  thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, salmon roe and truffle oil  one of my favourite dishes\n Tokodai wafu asperagasu (5.80)  beautiful fresh and with delicious wafu sauce and sesame on top.\n Shitaki Mushrooms (4.80)  tender and garlicky this was a rather generous portion for not quite 5 pounds.\n Chicken Yakitori (5.80)\n Yellow Tail sashimi (8.00)  boring compared to the other dishes.\n Unagi Nigri (8.80) however, was all the better.\n Aubergine (8.60) something\n Inaniwa Langustine Noodles (14.80)  this was one of the specials, the chilled noodles with the sweet langoustine and the ripe mango were very pleasant indeed.\n Wagyu Beef Sushi with Black Truffle (27.50)  loved the raw beef melting in my mouth together with the subtle truffle flavour. Expensive but worth it :)\n Banana and Green Tea Cake with Peanut Toffee Sauce and coconut ice cream (8.80)  weird combination but worked somehow. While I didn't pick up the green tea flavour, the soft and juice banana cake was all the better with the sweet and salty peanuts.",

With a presence in most major international cities its a go to when traveling and craving sushi in a upscale setting.

This location is very busy so make sure you make a booking in advance, we went on a tuesday night and were able to squeeze into a couple bar seats after ordering a few items and bottles of saki while standing. The service is great as expected from a restaurant of this caliber. 4.5 for the food and 5 stars for the scene. Many celebrities frequent this place so you never know who you will run into. Great fresh sushi, the lobster was also fantastic and the saki list was impressive. If they have butterfish available that is a must try!  Zuma deserts are also always a must!",

You walk and and you just want to hate the place - it looks too trendy for it's own good and you'd often find yourself tripping over a Ferrari or two parked out in front.

Add Zuma to that list.  \nFinally made it to Zuma after living in London for year.  Don't have any \"pull\" so had to book a few weeks in advance.  8pm on a Wednesday and was very busy, with not even a place around to bar to stand.  Wasn't seated til around 8:20 which didn't bother me but it's something to note.  \nI'll start with the meal: I was craving sushi rolls so ordered a dynamite spider roll and a spicy tuna roll. Both were exactly what I wanted and were far above average for sushi rolls.  Next we ordered sweet potato with teriyaki but wouldn't order it again.  Next up was beef tenderloin with sesame and it was excellent. Can't remember the rest of my order but I was very happy with the food and would go back for it.\nNow I'll get to the clientele of this restaurant.  It was a mix of businessmen, and old men with young women.  Basically, don't go to this restaurant with anyone ultra-conservative (although I wouldn't really expect them to want to go anyway). The ambience was quite nice though, dimly lit and not too too loud to chat (although I suspect the noise level would increase on the weekend)\nSo all in all, I wouldn't say that Zuma stands out as any better than the other high end sushi places.  But if you've gotta pay a certain price for good sushi, you might as well as this to the list.",

The barmaids are attentive and make excellent cocktails. Plus, there is a good selection of wines by the glass. \nA few notes:\n- You generally need a reservation here, so make one!\n- The bar closes pretty early (before midnight if I remember correctly) so get there early and head out afterwards\n- Get a private room if you are 6 people or more - totally worth it!!",

Waiter/waitress are very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and will offer their opinion.  I like that ^_-.  Beats going to some restaurant where  when asked what's good here will say \"everything\"? or \" I don't know\" and they always have this stupid look on their face when doing so.  Sake was good.  I especially liked the Edamame.  Edamame was seasoned with this special sauce that just was so good!\nI give this place 5 Stars! and I would definitely go back again.  In fact i'm planning on returning sometime later this week. but this time with reservations!  you should make reservations in advance or you might have to wait for at least half an hour and will be seated at the grill area.   Which can be a bit hotter.  If you prefer to be in a  warmer environment then fine but if your body temperature is normally hot maybe booking reservations in advance is the way to go or you will get seated at the grill area-Just a heads up**",

We all had some cocktails, which were delicious, then ordered a lot of food to share. The sushi was to die for, some of the best I've ever had in London or New York. I also enjoyed the variety of interesting dishes on the menu. The popped corn was not to be missed - it's basically corn kernels tempuraed and served with salt. \nThe service was wonderful, as to be expected in a restaurant of this calibre. \nLots of ladies who lunch and well dressed international business types. Quite pricey, as to be expected. Lunch (with a few drinks each) set each of us back about £100.\nI'm a fan.",

Definitely a see and be seen scene.  Great decor, music.  More on this later.\nBut first we had a private dining room, which was very nice.  Great service.  Our waiter made some great recommendations and generally helped us out.  We got the sake sommelier to hook us up with some nice sake.\nWe started with some sushi, fresh and very nice.\nWe had a number of the grilled items for sharing: seabass, squid, several beef dishes, chicken, tofu, vegetables, etc.  All were spectacular.  I especially liked the chicken - very tasty, although done a little rare as is common with Japanese places.\nWe split the chocolate desert and the banana cake.  Both were outstanding.\nSo after dinner we met some friends in the bar/lounge area and just hung for awhile.  Lots of fun, nice place.  Too bad they close up a little early.\nAll in all I add Zuma as a must go to place in London.  I love Japanese food and this place has a great take on modern Japanese in a fun atmosphere.",

But, the only setback was how incredibly rude the hostess/ \"person that sits at the front desk\" was!\nSo it was raining VERY hard the night that I came here. Our hotel was just a block away so we thought we could make it without getting too wet. We were wrong. So we came in with wet jackets and slightly wet hair. We didn't look gross, though. (God forbid we wreck their scene of \"hot' people) We just looked like we got caught in the rain.\nSo as soon as we got in, the beautiful, blonde, hostess sneered at us sarcastically saying, \"May I help you?\". We had reservations, of course, so we told her our information and she reluctantly searched for our reservations. After about 3 minutes she found our reservations, looking annoyed that she even found them. She then said, \"You guys should get rid of those wet jackets...\" and paused. After 5 seconds of awkward silence she sighed and said, annoyed, \"I can take them...\".\nAt that point I wanted to shout dramatically, \"Do you know who we are?!?\". I didn't, of course. I guess I came in with a sour attitude to start with because of the crazy weather, but still!\nOther than that small incident, our waiter was amazingly friendly  and the owner of the restaurant even stopped by our table to see if we were enjoying our sake.\nTo make a long story short, I would definitely come here again, despite the bi*chy host. :)",

                "description": "After a bit of a random disorganised day, two friends and I hung our heads as Harrod's closed in front of us, withdrawing all hopes of a hot chocolate on a cold winter afternoon. Stocking up on some emergency supplies (caramelised popcorn for one, sausage roll for another) which we devoured, I brought up none other than the qype app on my iPhone (possibly one of the best things about the iToy!), to look for some emergency sustenance and prepare the foundations of plan B, since plan A (hot chocolate at Harrod's) had failed miserably. In the nearby listings, something crept up to the top. It had 5 stars. Out of 5. This was the average from 35 reviews. I figured Hey, this has got to be good! And proposed it to the boys. A few seconds of umms and errs quickly morphed to us all walking over round the small lancelot street to get to raphael street where Zuma hides. As we turned the corner, it looked like we might have gotten lost in an alley. Then we got to the doorway. Golden light streaked out, warming the stone that lined the walls. We walked into the warmth, spotting the beautiful hostesses who were welcoming despite our lack of reservation. We could be seated at 20:00, she said. It was 18:30. I turned to my friends and explained (in french) we'd have to wait for an hour and a half. We all shrugged. And raised eyebrows when the hostess continued our conversation in fluent French. A nice touch. We spent a very happy hour and a half at the rather crowded bar, where we watched lovely waiters handle bottles in ways you didn't think bottles could be handled, pouring double or triple beers one-handed, and generally shaking and stirring things up like nobody's business. I had a kiwi bellini. I think. Not that it matters. It was delicious, layered in flavours, and generally to be had again, and again, and again. Well, maybe one again short of that, given the £12 price tag At 20:00 sharp (I was very impressed with the timeliness) we were seated. Mesmerised by the sushi masters, it took us a while before we opened the menus and drooled over the contents. Ordering was quick and painless, the food arriving incredibly quickly. We shared all dishes, being mediterranean. And frankly it's the style of the place. Every single one of them was SO delicious! A complete symphony. The sweet, the tangy, the spicy, the crunchy, the smooth melt-in-your-mouth salmon teriyaki, crunchy spicy fresh and perfect calamari. So perfect, in fact, we ordered another later on and when the kitchen somehow lost track and made a third, our waiter brought it to us, laughing, saying he was sure we'd appreciate it more than anyone else. We did. We SO did! At the end, you had to roll us out from the food we ate. And we had wine. Given our bill came in at under £100 for each of us, with the wine, and we were quite stuffed with the most delicious food we had every had (well, the best seafood, that's for sure), we thought it was an absolute bargain! We'd all go again at the drop of a hat, should anyone find a good enough excuse. Or a poor one. Any excuse, really.

                "description": "This place was a disaster!  I was looking forward to a posh sushi fusion lunch with friends celebrating a birthday.  The first server was aloof--it only took 20 minutes to get my drink ordered.  And from then on it was like trying to hail down a black cab at rush hour in the City on a rainy day--waving them down to take our food order because we only had the table for a limited time, hailing them to refill empty wine and water glasses--it was exhausting.  When the food did come out they plopped it down wherever they pleased and people had ordered specific dishes so we were passing plates to and fro.  Not to mention when they did bother to place a soup with the right person that they basically reached in front of someone to set it down.  \nBut it wasn't just a problem with the service--it was a problem with the kitchen too.  I ordered a salad with asparagus.  Well, it came without the asparagus--so again had to hail them down and with my chopsticks toss my salad to show them there was no asparagus!  \nMy friend who had been there many times complained to the front of the house and we had a free dessert.  \nThe food was good--the aubergine was quite memorable, but the experience was so bad it left a sour taste in our mouths.  \nOh, and not to mention they put an extra pound on the bill to give to the charity of their choosing.  WTF?\nIt was also weird how many young kids were there on a Sunday, which also was a mega buzz kill.",

I've been a total of four times and never been disappointed. \nI could go on all day about what to eat, but I've never really had anything bad there. A few winners, however, are the Black Cod, which is absolutely incredible as well as the Wagyu Beef, which is also perfectly seasoned and so juicy. \nThe massive tropical fruit dish at the end is also a winner for dessert and is a perfect way to cleanse the pallet. The decor is awesome and the waiters and chefs have always been fantastic to me when I've been there. \nI've heard getting a table here is a bit hard. I've been lucky enough to always go with footballers, which means instant service and great treatment. If it means anything and shows how much they care, Cesc Fabregas, Philippe Senderos, and I all went in one day for an unplanned lunch and, despite the restaurant being completely full, managed to put a table together for us.

We tried a range of things on the menu and everything was amazing (even the mysterious looking fresh tofu), but the showstopper of the night was the marinated black cod.  Also, all of the beef dishes were incredible.  Too bad the service was poor and the hostess a little rude (this was partially our fault, as we were late for our reservation - even so, the scolding we received was a poor start to the evening).

You can also come across attitude from the door reception which is shocking considering the sushi bar has a no reservations policy.\nVery expensive to take the gamble especially considering the higher standard of  london restaurants for the same price (and indeed much cheaper).\nA see and be seen restaurant rather than a culinary revelation.",

Usually old and fat, or young rich and socially inept.\n Possibly the most amusing place for pre-dinner drinks anywhere in London.\n Dinner is best at the grill bar- often a little too hot for comfort, but way better atmosphere, and cosier, than the dining tables. The salmon and tuna tartares are divine, as is miso black cod. Actually pretty much everything i have ever had here is lovely...

Zuma offers traditional Japanese dishes with a modern take on them like various sushi, sashimi and tempura, as well as some exclusive specialties such as black cod, wagye beef and foie gras, all prepared to an exceptional standard.\n Judging by the food, it's certainly one of the best Japanese restaurants in London. The only drawback is that it's very noisy. There are lots of people crowded around the bar in the evening and, needless to say, the lounge and the dining hall are always full. Overall, this place has a club-like atmosphere. There were six of us at the table and I could barely hear the person next to me, not to mention those on the other side.\n It's probably a great place to start a big night out, but if you're looking for something calmer, Miyama or Shogun, or even Nobu and Matsuri, are perhaps better choices.",

But here's the catch, there's sushi bar/counter seating! \nIt was Thursday night, fairly packed (with the pretty people), but getting late for a London restaurant, probably around 9pm. We gave our names for the sushi bar and they said it could be up to a half hour wait. We decided to give it a shot and hung out at the bar. We immediately noticed three or four empty counter seats, but didn't say anything. Sure enough, within ten minutes, we were sat. Weird, right? I'm still not sure what the hell went on there. \nThe counter was beautiful and had a great view of the grill. Our waiter was super friendly but I think partly because he was gay, and within minutes figured out my friend was as well and proceeded to flirt with him. The service still wasn't amazing. It became too personal and forgetting my drink isn't okay just because you're too busy batting your eyelashes at my bestie. \nThe food was small and overpriced, but delicious. We only ordered apps/small plates. What stood out was the hamachi sashimi, pork skewers, soft shell crab and the giant grilled prawn. The sauces which come with the grilled pork and soft shell crab were amazing. The grilled prawn was just good, but cool because it was so big! For dessert we had a delicious green tea and banana cake. Very yummy! \nNext time I'm in London, i'd love to go back and try more!",

I think this place is awful - but I don't want to score them lower than 3 stars as there's no reason why someone like me (not a professional food critic) should affect their overall rating. And after all, not all the other people can be wrong about Zuma, I perhaps just had a one-off, awful experience....\n So, in my opinion: Where Roka is fun, buzzy and serves incredible food and good portions, Zuma is a too-packed, too-noisy, too-huge hanger of a restaurant serving tiny portions of (imho) sometimes quite poor food.\n The sommelier is one of the most patronising I've met, who clearly thought 2 women were incapable of choosing their own wine. Don't get me wrong, I like to be helped and guided, but I don't like to be told 'Sauvignon blanc is awful, I'll give you something you'll like' as he snatched the menu away from us and flew off to patronise the 300 other diners packed like sardines alongside us.\n And as for the loos....not sure how to write about those, but anyone else got any comments on the 'clientele' and goings-on in the loos?!\n I really wanted to love Zuma, but I didn't. But I've been back to Roka twice now, so this moany old bag will shut up about Zuma and spend my pennies at Roka instead.",

I don't know if I would give a place like this two Michelin stars (I was told it had two) because while the dishes were interesting & the presentation very well done, no dishes really stood out to me besides the black cod.  Honestly, my old neighborhood sushi place in SF had more choices of fish (and amazing quality as well).  Maybe one Michelin :D ? I guess it also matters that the sommelier was quite awesome.  5 stars for the sommelier and the service!",

Can't remember the name, but the eggplant dish on the first page of the menu (I think it's a feature item) is absolutely amazing. Awesome spicy tuna rolls too, and fantastic drinks - we tried the watermelon martini and the lychee one. For such a busy place, we were amazed at how fast all our food came. Knowledgeable and friendly wait staff. Great experience - food wise, Ozumo in SF could learn a thing or too from this place!",

They bill themselves as contemporary Japanese, which made me a bit worried that everything would be a little too fancy-pants.  But the dishes were creative and simple and very tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try a few more things.  This is a great place to go with freinds, family, and co workers.",

I walked in and expected to not get seated because the front bar area was packed; however, a very nice hostess checked the sushi bar for me and I was seated immediately. \nIt was mesmerizing to watch the sushi chefs and I was fortunate to be seated right in front of the head sushi chef.  There was also a woman working behind the sushi bar, and that was really cool to see. It was fun to watch this chef, because he had such a precise rhythm to his work and you could tell that he was really into it.  \nIt's so hard to say - which was better - the food, or the service?  The waitress that worked the sushi bar was so great!  She was extremely kind and very knowledgable about all of the items on the menu.  She helped me with my choices and told me that I made excellent decisions - one of which was the Wagyu Beef Tataki. It came somewhat covered/sprinkled with scallions, which I hate, but I simply pushed them aside. I was informed by another server that they made the cooks re-do the dish because it wasn't done properly the first time.\nI got a 6-piece chef's choice sushi. The head chef prepared it and I must say, it was delicious.  This was the first time I noticed a distinct \"flavour\" to the sushi, where usually you just know that there is raw fish and seasoned rice. But this was different - the fish *tasted* really good and the rice was done really well, which is very important, in my book.\nI think you will just have to go there yourself to experience it - it's quite hard to explain!\nI highly recommend this place. For all of the right reasons - the food is superb and worth every penny.  The service was wonderful, warm and genuine. I can't wait to go back again another night!",

I highly recommend making a reservation as quickly as possible for the luxurious and elegantly beautiful. The service was perfect, the choices for each of the courses were magnificent.

It does have quite a nightclub atmosphere (this may be different during the day) with heaps of people clustered around the bar, but the food was all brilliantly executed and the cocktails were fabulous which scores them big points in my books. If I went again I would try and get a seat in front of the Robata Grill as it was fascinating to watch all the chefs at work.",

He eats here nearly every night of the week when he is in town so he ordered for us. The stuffed king prawn was absolutely mental, I still have dreams about it now and the wagyu steak is a MUST have - cant believe food can taste this good! We also had the pleasure of trying the sole and some other dishes I cant remember now but it was all amazing. Of course this place is really mega expensive and we didnt pay (our meal for 3 with wine was £400) but if you want to treat yourself you will not be disppointed and you will enjoy the ambiance the service and of course the incredible food.",

Maybe the area is a bit more separate when the place isn't quite so busy. It's not really a problem though and you may get a table right at the other side. The food was gorgeous, though my favourite Japanese dish - black cod - was no where to be seen back when I visited. (They do have it on the menu now though.) The salads are gorgeous - a real taste explosion in the mouth. You can also have more of an informal meal and sit round the grill. Service was good.",

Ayako, my wife loves it for the truly excellent modern Japanese food (generously overlooking the fact that the chef is German) while our daughter loves it for its high-class buzz and celebrity pulling-power (Russell Crowe et al). Service is exemplary; the waiters are brilliant at explaining the frankly rather complicated menu and recommending dishes - so that you end up with a smooth and seemingly endless feast that has to include: asparagus tempura, crispy fried squid with green chilli, mouthwatering wagyu beef, black cod with miso, superb sushi and sashimi (very unusual in London) and anything with wasabi mayonnaise. Everything should be shared and is, except, unfortunately, the bill. The wine list is long on spicy or smoky wines that go well with Japanese food, like the Franz Haas Traminer from Alto Adige. The sofa seating behind the bar is a good place to chose to eat and watch the parade of London's fashionable young things",
