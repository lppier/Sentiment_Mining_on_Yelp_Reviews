The restaurant is huge and always packed! \nThe bar tender recommended the food for me to pick and they were all great minus the fried okra. The romali roti and paneer masala is delicious and a good combination. The waiter also recommended one of their house cocktails which was really good and refreshing. It was a gin cocktail with a variety of spices and lemon juice or something. It was amazing. Go to this place if you're in London!",

Saying that, the restaurant in Kings Cross was heaving on a Monday evening at 7pm, indicating how popular the food is.\nService was good, bar service is also good and the atmosphere is buzzy and noisy in a good way.\nMy advice is to get a bunch of friends together, book a table and go as a group.",

And now that my flat is right around the corner, I think I'll be coming here pretty often \nBreakfast was a pleasant surprise. I'm a big fan of the Keema per eedu, which is basically chicken liver under two fried eggs. The naan roll is the most popular menu item and and sure does look delicious. Lassi is good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.\nFor lunch I ordered the Ruby Chicken and gunpowder potatoes. The Ruby Chicken is best enjoyed with some rice. The potatoes are the real deal! So much flavor with all the herbs and spices. \nCheck back with me in 2 months and I think I'll have the whole menu sampled by then ;)",

                "description": "When in London, do what the desis do, right?! Cannot rave enough about this place! In the 4 days we spent in London, we made it here 3 times. Sadly never for the bottomless chai brunch, but mostly late night dinners. The Kings cross location is way bigger than the downtown location (which we went to, but didn't eat at given the insane wait). This location has several different nooks and crannies, differnt seating styles - very reminiscent of  1980's Kolkatta in my opinion. The place is a warehouse turned into a restaurant and there is a cool little story on their menu. I loved everything about the decor - the office style chairs, the loungers, quirky hand wash sink, family pictures up on the walls - very very cool.\nNow for the food. Both Anurag and I had our favorites. For me, it was the vada pao, which I ate every time I made it here. The bread to filling ratio was just perfect, the sauce on the side was delicious. Any one who knows me, knows I cannot handle spice - but I kid you not, I poured ALL the ghati masala (super spicy) on my vada pao, along with the spicy sauce and devoured it all. I had tears in my eyes along the way and my tongue was numb, but it was just amazingly delicious, washed down with a generous swig of king fisher. Anurag tried the keema pao and deemed it delicious too. His all time favorite though - the butter chicken (murgh malai) - succulent pieces of chicken, velvety smooth gravy, sopped up with traditional roomali roti. He was so in love with the dish, you could see his eyes light up every time he took a bite, haha!\nThe chicken biryani was another delicious dish - it made for an excellent jet lagged yet hung over meal for my husband :) We also tried the bhel - it was okay, but not at the same level as the dishes above. The paneer kathi roll was also delish -  made for a great back \"open the boot and chill\" kinda snack as we drove down to Dorset the next day. Perfect balance of spices - excellent road side snack :)|\nDefinitely recommend coming here - there is a bit of something for everyone!",

                "description": "Walked in on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated immediately! Although, we were told we got the last table so I would definitely recommend calling ahead to check for wait times. This place only takes reservations for parties of 6 or more.\nIt was our first time at Dishoom and we were quite overwhelmed with their extensive menu. The menu was explained to us twice, and they were really patient with our confused selves lol. After explaining that each person should order 2-3 dishes, we opted for the bhel and prawn kaliwada for starters. For the main dishes, we got the murgh malai (chicken thighs) and lamb kebab to share with their signature black daal. We also ordered the garlic naan and I got the kala khatta sharbat drink. This may seem like a lot of food but the portion sizes are pretty small.\nThe drink had hints of chili but was still incredibly refreshing and sweet! We didn't realize the garlic naan was only 2 half pieces, so we ordered a bowl of basmati rice to share. Next time, I'd rather skip the naan and order just rice. There isn't enough naan to last the meal and the amount you're getting isn't worth the price. One bowl of rice was plenty to share for 2 people.\nThe prawn kaliwada was good - it came with a sweet dipping sauce which I wasn't a fan of. The shrimp itself was flavorful and spicy. The bhel was so complex in flavor and texture. And the colors were pretty too! Definitely my favorite appetizer - it was light, refreshing and delicious!\nThe grilled dishes each came with about 6-7 pieces of meat about the size of ping pong balls. They were dressed with cilantro and a side cup of onions, cucumbers and more cilantro! The lamb kebab was very good and extremely flavorful - it was my boyfriend's favorite but it was a little too dry for me. The murgh malai was THE BOMB. Extremely tender and flavorful, and the green cilantro dipping sauce made it even better! The black daal was delicious, I understand why it's a house favorite. \nEverything here seems very affordable but keep in mind, the dishes are small. Each person is meant to order multiple dishes for sharing, which can add up.\nDefinitely will be coming back to try the rest of their menu!\nNote: super cool ambience! The restaurant used to be an old rail yard for shipping and packing goods. The restaurant has a unique variety of furniture and there are incense everywhere! They also sell their own vinyl...",

The restaurant is huge inside with 4 floors of service! No joke!!! And every nook & cranny is lovingly decorated and designed to stay true to the fusion of elevated vintage \"travel/goods exchange station\" and India (like an authentic washing station, photos, coloring, etc.) with written signage in both English and Hindi. I've been lucky enough to have visited India and this felt so familiar and comforting. The service was impeccable and our server Falhid (spelling?) was so accommodating and informative. We were dressed super casual and obviously not locals but were treated like royalty. \nThe food was insanely authentic and delicious with quality infused into each dish and bite. \nWe arrived just after breakfast service but they brought us a serving of Bun Maska upon seeing our disappointment and we were so grateful. The bread was so fresh and the chai warmed the soul. We also had some colorful Indian snacks brought complimentary, and we ordered Muttar Paneer (wife's favorite!), Chicken Tikka Roll (like kathi roll), and bowl of greens with plain biryani. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. Lucky and unsurprisingly they have 5 more locations!!!!\nPS: check out the bar downstairs and the restrooms! Even they are an experience. So special!",

                "description": "Dishoom was a fantastic choice for us on our one night layover in London.\nWhile it's definitely not as cheap as the likes of Brick Lane, Dishoom offers up a more upscale dining experience with great ambience and delicious Indian. You're definitely paying for quality here.\nOn a Monday night, the restaurant was extremely packed so we had to wait about 45 minutes for our table. As we were waiting to get inside, the hosts graciously offered some chai that really warmed us up. LOVED THIS! It's the small things that really make the experience even when we hadn't sat down to eat yet.\nBefore being seated, we hung out at their bar downstairs and ordered drinks while waiting. My Kalamansi Smash was a fantastic fusion of lime and vodka with this Filipino fruit. Once we were ready to be seated, our servers took us to our table and explained how ordering would work. They recommended that we each order a curry of some sort, some naan, and perhaps some chicken and lamb for the table. \nWe did just that and my goodness, everything that we tasted was delicious! The curries were definitely hearty enough to fill one person and the lamb kebabs were fire. I wish that we received more naan for the price but it was still good for what it's worth.\nOverall, we had a great time dining at Dishoom and would come back here in a heartbeat. Note that they add an \"optional\" 12.5% service charge which is awkward to refuse, but completely up to you if you choose to opt out. Be sure to make it clear at the beginning.",

                "description": "Really nice looking 3-story restaurant that would look like a good place to take a date. I visited for breakfast so there wasn't much of a crowd like the lines I saw at the more touristy Covent Garden location. The bar area had a lounge where you can enjoy a coffee or a stiff drink along with your breakfast. I just sat at the bar which had a lot of hustle and bustle with the  busy staff. My server was really nice.\nThe vibe and menu reminded me of Pondicheri's in Houston and NYC. Prices were not too high given the upscale nature of the place. I ordered the Kejriwal which were two eggs over chile cheese toast. It was good and the colours were striking with the orange egg yolks but the bread was stiff and hard to cut with a butter knife. I was also surprised to find not a hint of spice given the chile in the toast. My breakfast lassi was also surprisingly less sweet than I expected with the dominant taste of oats and cardamom in the drink. Overall, the flavours of the food and drink were more subtle than something I can get at Pondicheri and may reflect British palates. \nI would come here again to explore the lunch/dinner menu though.",

It's rare that a restaurant impresses everyone in my family of four equally, but this place definitely did.\nThey accept reservations before 5:00, so we booked a table at 2:00 (or 14:00 for the rest of the world) to have a late lunch. It was busy, but we were seating immediately upon arrival.  \nWe ordered several plates, but the two standouts for us were the cheese naan and the pau bhaji. \nThe service was great. Our waiter even tracked us down after the meal to give us the bags we'd accidentally left under the table. We were all in food comas and not thinking clearly.\nI usually skip the mid-day beer, but we were on vacation and they had an IPA that was brewed specially for Dishoom.

But it was a 5 star meal nonetheless.  \nDespite its size (Dishoom has three levels), everyone was very welcoming and the atmosphere made it feel like cozy.  And then there was the breakfast food itself.  I'd never consider an Indian restaurant for breakfast, it's just not something that ever crossed my mind.  Dishoom's breakfast menu offered several delicious options though that proved to me that not only is it possible but also fabulous as well.  I ordered the bacon and egg naan sandwich and their house made chai.  The chai was out of this world and included free refills.  And the flavor combination with that sandwich was unbeatable.  Service was attentive.\nWhat I had might be considered a simple breakfast, but that sandwich and tea were one of the highlights of my trip to London hands down.  It might sound crazy considering all the options for breakfast, but I would go out of my way to go back there.",

Probably my favorite dish\n - The mattar paneer was fantastic.  The combined flavors of the paneer, curry, and peas was something I won't soon forget\n- The chicken tikka was below average.  Chicken tikka shouldn't taste like boiled chicken.  Very disappointed\n- The black daal was rich and had a very nice smoke flavor\n- The pau bhaji was above average.

                "description": "I freakin love Indian food in London. There's no place like it other than possibly India itself. It just tastes substantially better, with bursts of flavor. \nDishoom is no different. It is a very popular restaurant in London with multiple locations. There is always a queue and the best possible way to get in without waiting is to make a reservation.\nI made a res at the King's Cross location. The space is bustling, with an amazing bar downstairs and seating both floor level and upstairs. Upon arrival, there was already a queue and I had made res for a lunch hour (although I did hear that their breakfast is pretty darn good). The menu is a little extensive, but innovative than the typical Indian food you would get in LA. The table was just big enough to accommodate all the food we had ordered, so we were lucky. \n \nOKRA FRIES (Â£4.20). Fine Lady's Fingers for the Fingers. I wasn't the biggest fan of these. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I'm just not a fan of okra. Though the slimey layer was almost non-transparent, I could still taste it. But, if you like okra, you'll love this.  \nVEGETABLE SAMOSAS (Â£3.50). Fine Filo Pastry, Pea and Potato Filling Warmly Spiced with Cinnamon and Cloves. These were delicious. It was light and airy and wasn't heavy. I'm always a fan of samosas and they're one of my favorite appetizers. If you want something on the lighter end that isn't too heavy, get these!  \nHOUSE BLACK DAAL (Â£5.90). A Dishoom Signature Dish-Dark, Rich, Deeply Flavoured. It is Cooked Over 24 hours for Extra Harmony. This was absolutely delicious. I didn't know what to expect. We ordered a medium spice level which was perfect. It went so well with the biryani. I definitely recommend getting this dish.  \n \nJACKFRUIT BIRYANI (Â£8.90). Delicious, Savoury Jackfruit and Delicately Saffron'd Rice, Patted and Cooked with Mint, Coriander, and Sultanas. I loved this dish. It's different than the usual biryani you get at other restaurants. There was so much flavor and surprisingly, the jackfruit tasted like there was meat in it. It's a great dish for the vegetarian and awesome with curry.  \nGUNPOWDER POTATOES (Â£6.50). The seduction is in the Tumble. Potatoes with Brown Skins, Smoky-Grilled, Broken Apart, Tossed with Butter, Crushed Aromatic Seeds and Green Herbs. This is one of the most popular dishes at Dishoom. I thought it was good but not amazing. I mean, they're potatoes and I'd actually rather eat something that consists of curry. If you love potatoes though, you would enjoy these.  \nMY FAVORITE DISH. CHICKEN RUBY (Â£9.50). A Good and Proper Curry Redolent with Spice and Flavour, Tender Chicken in a rich silky 'makhani'sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. I love freakin curry and this is by far, one of the best ones. It's similar to a tikka masala but better than what you would get anywhere in the States. It's rich and creamy and if you love tikka masala, you definitely should get this.  \nSPICY LAMB CHOPS (Â£11.90). They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice and jiggery, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. Blackened by the Grill, but Juicy inside. I thought these were good but I've had better at Tayyabs. The chops had a lot of flavor, and it was grilled nicely, but it wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. Regardless though, I would still order it.  \nHOUSE CHAI (Â£2.50). All things nice: warming comfort and satisfying spice. Made in the proper way. All who have tried it are swearing by it. This was delicious. It was creamy, smooth and had all the right spices. If you're a chai drinker, you'd love this warm drink.  \nOverall, I loved Dishoom. For Indian food with a twist, this is the place to go. It's not super traditional, but they do have traditional dishes. The space is amazing and the service was pretty good. The waiter was insisting I visit again the next morning, but I couldn't. I wish I did since their breakfast menu looked amazing and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes and it's a great place for a get together. If you're ever in London, hit up this spot. for other reviews, check out thefoodseeker dot com",

The service was friendly, attentive, and thoughtful. I liked my gin gimlet. This is accessible Indian food at fair prices in a comfortable, contemporary setting. (12 May 18)\nTIP: Ground floor seating was very good to fair because a change to the bar seating was underway. The seating on -1, the lower level, appeared cozy and desirable, especially the high tops near the bar. The lower level bar had no seating of its own.",

I think maybe my expectation was wrong, but the place where I thought this restaurant did best was the more modern interpretation of Indian food which at times bordered more on fusion.  Definitely worth a visit (prepare to stand in line!!!) but check out the menu first to set your expectations around what you're getting.\nAll that being said I enjoyed our meal here.

                "description": "Whether you're a local or a tourist, there's no way you wouldn't have heard of Dishoom - because it's one of the best places to have Indian food in London. Dishoom is widely known for the thoughtfully curated modern Indian cuisine and the interior design of its restaurants.\nUnfortunately they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 people and the wait can be long but not to fret, all locations have a bar area inside for those who are waiting for a table to grab some drinks first. Try the Calaba Colada, it's like a pina colada with a Bombay twist and trust me, the 45 minute wait won't feel long at all.\nShortly after being seated, you'll get a pretty extensive menu printed on a double sided A3 paper. I'll make this easy for you - for a classic curry, what you should try is the Chicken Ruby. This is rich and flavorful, and the chicken is incredibly tender. You'll get a ton of curry sauce so help yourself to some slow cooked and aromatic biryani. I recommend either the Awadhi Lamb Biryani or the Jackfruit Biryani. I'm a huge fan of both and it's great for sharing. For sides, I like the Gunpowder Potatoes - they're smokey and aromatic with a slight kick to your taste buds. For those who can't pass on paneer at an Indian restaurant, the Mattar Paneer is the way to go. It's rich and flavorful, you can't go wrong with this. And if you find that you have a ton of extra sauce left, a garlic naan or the handkerchief-thin roti is great for this.  \nOn their menu, you'll also find the specials which are seasonal and usually great for big groups. I got to try the pulled lamb shank on the bone once and it was super tender, spicey and delicious! \nI highly recommend checking out Dishoom, it definitely lives up to the hype. And don't forget to ask for some of their complimentary chutney!",

We waited about 15 minutes outside, but they give you complimentary house chai for you to sip on. Very delicious and I wish I had taken more than 1 cup of the chai. Once inside, we were handed a buzzer/pager ushered downstairs to the bar where we waited another 30-40 minutes for a table. There the GF and I shared a beer. After waiting we were again ushered upstairs to a table where we ate. We ordered 5 things for Â£41, and the thing I liked the most was the Dishoom Calamari and the Black House Daal.\nThis is by far one of the better spots in London. People in NYC recommend it. While not the MOST AUTHENTIC, it the food does live up to the hype.",

And they also have their own IPA, brewed by Mondo Brewing. It's served bottled though. For starters, the vada pau was great. Even for a soft bun item, it had great texture because of the fried pea sprinkles and I slathered it with the cilantro chutney. More buns came via pau bhaji, which didn't seem to be much at first but it was dense, creamy, savory. Excellent savory app. As for some main dishes, I loved the awani lamb biryani, especially with the spices in it. The chicken ruby, another excellent dish. Creamy, buttery, melt in the mouth chicken. the garlic naan went perfectly with the whole meal.\nAs for breakfast, we had chai and coffee and the big bombay breakfast, which had masala baked beans, half roasted tomato & mushrooms - both tangy. There was bacon and sausages. There was akuri, a type of scrambled egg. More buns came with this. The breakfast naan rolls were filling too. We had a sausage & egg one. Much saucier than I anticipated.",

We had the set menu, which included an assortment of nibbles and mains and sides, all of which were served in turn and in generous portions. Unfortunately, they ran out of one of the desserts, so we had only the three flavours of Indian style popsicle to choose from. Nonetheless, all was good and I quite enjoyed my mango popsicle. \nService was excellent. They brought everything out promptly and went out of their way to assist us in various things, ranging extra drinks for select ones of us to helping charge my mobile in their office. The staff were friendly through to the end. A great different nice staff can make, especially for a part of c20 people. \nAmbience was also fab. Typical Dishoom style interior, but I appreciated how they paid attention to the details of maintaining the \"old\" and the history, amidst the modern infrastructure.",

I can't think of a single thing wrong with Dishoom. The service is grand, this particular location is stunning, and the flavors are everything that I crave.\nBe warned: the queue can be quite long. Two times I was in, we came right before the rush but alas, the third time, the line seemed to go on forever and didn't make it in. (They serve drinks outside for you, as a little teaser to the excellence inside.)\nDuring dinner, we sat at the bar on the main level and felt right where I needed to be. This place is beautiful and though I haven't been to Mumbai, I'd like to think that this is how it must look. Sigh. \nI started with their take on an Old Fashioned. Don't know why I'm drinking these, they're a little sweet for my taste, but the presentation here is sure delightful: served in a small apothecary-like bottle with the ice on the side, it wasn't very strong but that was fine by me.\nThe dinner menu looked incredible but we didn't want to overdo it. We had the Murgh Malai, chicken marinated overnight in garlic and other tastiness. Yum! The roti is thin and made a great spoon to sup the House Black Daal (black lentils) and wooosh it was delicious! \nTo keep things light, we also had the Paneer and Mango salad. The crispy shallot crumbs elevated the salad. \nBreakfast at Dishoom. Oh dear. I didn't want to leave. \nThis time we sat on the top floor. It was early so it was slower than usual. My guy ordered the chai while I opted for the fresh-squeezed Pineapple, lime, and black pepper juice. It was so very good and not as acidic as it sounds. \nWe also enjoyed the Bun Maska, which was like a toasted sweet roll with a thick layer of BUTTER inside. Its sole purpose in life is to be dunked into the side of Chai tea that came with it. Ooooooh \nThe Bombay Omelet was beautiful, but was a little underwhelmed by the flavor. I ended up using the ketchup served on the side. \nSo while you can pass on the omelet, do not miss the Kejriwal. Two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. Eggs in London are gorgeous, bright orange, and everywhere I eat, they're cooked to flowing yolk perfection. Theirs is no exception. For this dish, I laughed the ketchup right off the plate. \nUgh. I want to go back. We don't have anything remotely like this at home. For a great atmosphere, service, food, and overall vibe, make Dishoom your next stop.",

You also eat in a magnificent order where the appetizers, main course/meat, and sides are built to complement each other in a stunning way.  \nI had the samosas, potatoes, fried okra, and garlic naan and they were good. The samosas were flavorful but I would have preferred a bit more spice (they were heavy on cinnamon and nutmeg). The okra was amazing and I typically hate okra. The garlic naan left a lot to be desired. It would have been better paired with a more flavorful rita. \nThe service was the best part. Our server went out of her way to be accommodating and sweet. We went later in the evening after he dinner rush and she never made us feel like we had to hurry and she still had People sing happy birthday to me at the end of our meal. \nMy recommendation is to call and determine how long the wait is before going. You'll wait for hours if you aren't prepared.",

Don't be intimidated by the long line outside - they are extremely efficient at moving people into tables and serving drinks (even complimentary tea) while you wait. If you're desperate not to wait, you'll have to come early (before 6pm).\nThe cocktails are a real treat - take a look through the book. As far as food goes, here are my (veg) highlights:\nOkra fries\nBlack daal\nChole bhatura (amazing)\nThe price point is great, and they're very accommodating about food allergies - I brought a gluten free person here and the staff was very helpful. In general the service is excellent.",

I've gone! I would like to say a few things:\n1/ The food was very good. Like high quality stuff.\n2/ If you gave to me in a blindfold, tbh I'm not sure how to tell the difference between good and pretty good indian food and so I'm developing a palette which is why we're not at 5 stars yet.\n3/ There's always a massive line, but i think* you can make a reservation so I'm not sure why anyone waits in the line?\n4/ Favorite dish was the lentil dal on top of a bit of rice.\n5/ They also have really cute drinks like the chai punch. Comes in a cute 'peg' (glass bottle) which you pour out onto some solid ice cubes which gives it a look of whiskey (which is part of it).",

We really liked the way\nthe place is all laid out. Outdoor seating options are also available, but was\ntoo cold for our March visit to try. Note that this place can really get busy,\nso it's better if you have a reservation.\nAs for our lunch visit here's what we tried:\n-- Far Far for starters. A crunchy, salty type of cracklings...really good!\n-- Dishoom Chicken Tikka...this is pure awesomeness\n-- Adwahi Lamb (Biryani)...flavorful and very tender\n-- Garlic Naan...soft and tasty\n-- Gadbad Mitha...its like mixed bowl of sugar goodness\nThis place is a MUST visit if ever in the area.

They do not take dinner reservations under a certain amount of people (I think 6 people). When we were finally seated, the menu was a bit overwhelming because everything sounded so good! We opted for the lamb samosa, chicken tikka masala, veggie biryani, braised lamb that came with naan, and a side of roti. Oh my goodness, we ordered way too much food for 2 people! The tikka masala was juicy! The braised lamb was AMAZING, and by far my favorite dish. The meat fell off the bone. The sauce was so flavorful. All I wanted to do is soak my naan in the sauce!! \nOverall, if we had to wait an hour, it was definitely worth it. Just plan ahead and make reservations if you can't wait. I'm not sure if the lamb was a special dish for the night or not, but if it's on the menu, order it! You won't regret it. \"",

The spices, the flavor, the cook of everything was fantastic. My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after having to wait over an hour at another location and couldn't pass up this opportunity. They send you inside to wait at the bar, which is nice. \nWhen we were ordering, they explained the menu. It was suggested that we get 3-4 dishes per person since it's quite small. We got 1 order of garlic naan, 1 order of rice, chicken ruby, mahi tikka, house black daal, dishoom calamari, roomali roti. (I don't/can't eat spicy foods so none of these dishes are spicy!) We didn't order a single thing that we disliked. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The only thing I wish they could do it tailor things to people's spice levels, but there were plenty of delicious dishes I had anyway! I highly suggest coming and waiting because it's worth the wait!!!\nPS: get the house black daal, it'll change your life :)",

I find myself obligated to mention the kindness of the staff and there willingness to help. The smile didn't depart their faces.\nThere are two bars offering wide range of alcoholic drinks. Kingfisher beer is a very popular choice here. My friends liked the wine.\nThe food is good but not excellent as some reviewers commented.

Everything is significantly overpriced and made to suit westerners. You don't see any actual Indians eating here, of course they are the smart ones and the Brits that do eat here are either gullible or patsys.

I opted for the garlic naan and it was great!\nBlack house daal (4/5): now although this is the \"house special\" I didn't think it was particularly good.

Having a lot of Indian friends has pushed me to try Indian food a lot and this was by far one of my favorite meals. \nWe ordered the vegetable samosas to start, the house special daal, the dishoom chicken tikka masala, the naan and garlic naan, and the murgh malai. The murgh malai and the daal were probably my favorite dishes but I honestly enjoyed everything I ordered. The samosas were hot and flavorful, the daal was perfect, and the naan tasted almost like homemade naan. Be warned that they charge Â£3.50 for water so you might as well order their chai tea. \nDefinitely give this a try if you're in the area! Not only was the food good but the ambience was perfect as well.",

I've heard Indian food is great in London, so I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed.\nWe went at around 6:30 on a Thursday and waited for an hour for a table. We didn't mind because they have a great bar downstairs that they bring everyone who is waiting to be seated. The atmosphere is very cool at the bar and in the restaurant in general. Waiting for an hour didn't seem too bad because of the great cocktail list they have.\nWe had heard that a lot of people usually split plates, but since we all had different preferences, we got our own. I had the lamb with the bowl of greens and garlic naan. All of it was fantastic. Others at the table got the cheesy naan and they said that was also great.\nIt wouldn't be a place that I was a regular at since it's always so busy, but it's a really fun place to go with a group, and the food is very good.",

The food is out of this world. I wish I had two stomachs so I could've tried more things. \nWe started with the lamb samosas which were amazing: crispy, not greasy, and spiced to perfection. There were three sauces that went from mild, medium to spicy and I preferred the slightly sweet mild sauce. Next was the house chai. This is the best chai I've ever had so far. It was so good I forgot to take a picture until it was just a few drops at the bottom of the glass. \nFor our mains we had mattar paneer and mahi tikka with garlic naan. The vegetarian curry was the perfect level of spiciness for me (mild) and I inhaled it quite quickly. The garlic naan was perfect to mop it up with. The mahi was so good. It was clearly very fresh and done perfectly.\nI also tried the mango and fennel lassi and the pistachio kulfi. A kulfi is pretty much a lassi in popsicle form. It was a lovely way to cool things down and satisfy my sweet tooth.\nI dare say we had a perfect dinner.",

You can grab a meal or get afternoon drinks or even work away on your laptop (lots of outlets and free wifi too!). A real communal place.\nI came for their Indian style breakfasts. Hubby and I split The Big Bombay - an Indian take on the classic English breakfast - and on a whim I ordered the bacon naan roll to boot.\n* The Big Bombay (scrambled eggs, 4 slices streaky bacon, 2 sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushrooms, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns Â£11.50) - sounded terrific but wasn't quite as good in person. The bacon and sausage were good though I liked the bacon more than the sausage. The scrambled eggs, baked beans and pau buns were okay. The grilled field mushrooms were really good. It didn't really add up to anything memorable though. Just bits and pieces of good and okay food. 3.5 stars\n* bacon naan roll (4 pieces of naan bread wrapped about slices of streaky bacon smeared with tomato chili jam Â£5.50) - simply the BEST naan I've ever had. Reminded me a lot of the pizza crusts that come out of those fancy brick ovens. The bread was chewy and charred deliciousness. I would come back simply to get an order of those to gnaw on. The bacon and tomato chili jam were a great addition. 5 stars\nHubby and I both agreed the bacon naan roll was the star of the show. It's so good that if I ever came back I'd probably just order it again and ignore the rest of the menu.",

However, the Star was totally the nali nihari. Spicy, rich sauce with a tender lamb.The roti was so soft and thin... it was perfect to sop up the sauce to he nihari.  Only bad point was the service; slow and aloof.  Can't wait to go back to London for our next visit to dishoom",

Everything we ordered lived up to my dreams of having a great Indian meal while in London. The service is great, drinks also good, and the whole experience felt like a party.

I cannot understand how they can make food taste like this. Everything was so good. We had the chicken ruby, sheekh kebab (lamb), paneer tikka (charred cheese) and of course naan. Way too much for two people but they're so good.\nThe wait gets a bit insane unless you come here at odd hours.",

Sure we had to queue for an hour to get in but they served us mint tea and sherry while we waited out in the cold October air. I just couldn't get myself to hate such a nice deed..  after all it was our decision to stay!\nGetting in we were told that we had to wait a bit longer until the electronic buzzer on the caller went off and someone came and collected us. So we waited and helped ourselves to the exotically named cocktails. Mine was a \"Bombay\" Colada.. whis is an Indian spiced pina Colada. I did ask for a Mai tai first but learned that the whole idea of Dhishooms was about Bombay and the food and drinks from there.\nWhen we were taken to the seats we were told that its best to order food to share so we did:\nLamb chops: these were exquisitely grilled with a coating of spice but the gamey taste of the lamb was somewhat retained. I am not a big fan of the lamb being gamey but this was acceptable. The pieces were thicker than I expected and biting into it I tasted the fat which was delicious. I was thinking initially that I have tasted better but in reality I had tasted different as this was unique and as equally as good as I have tasted on commercial road. \nBlack Dhal: wow! Tasted amazing and a great accompaniment to my butter narn. The Dhal reminded me of a black bean but the sauce was thick and rich like a vindaloo without the heat. \nPaneer: sadly disappointing as I felt it was under done but maybe it's the way they do it in Bombay. \nChicken: sadly it was so average I forget what it exactly was called. \nVegetables: again some spiced boiled vegetables. Nothing to shout about.\nThe place by the way is huge and is styled like an indian resthouse with everything relating to a Mumbai from the 1950s. A sheer joy to be in and with lots of atmosphere. My only question  is if they have a Hindi menu which might be more special.",

Exciting stuff, where will it all end?!\nI've been to a couple of the other branches of Dishoom across London and really like the concept which, according to the blurb, is based on the old Iranian coffee shops around Bombay.  This translates into a great selection of interesting drinks and nibbles to be enjoyed throughout the day.\nI came here for a casual business meeting and we found a quiet lower table in the corner.  Free chai-fi :-)\nOnly snacks on this occasion.  Ordering a chicken tikka sandwich sounds like a bit of a cop-out but the filling was truly delicious and very different from the generic flavouring prevalent in shop bought versions.  The chicken wasn't died red and beautifully spiced.  It came in a chappati which didn't really work that well for a wrap, especially as I tried to combat it with cutlery (this was a business meeting after all) - too tough and tha chappati won in that I didn't eat most of it.  The okkra fries are amazing and I know I'll find an excuse to order them with everything on future visits.\nStaff were very friendly but overly keen to clear empties.  I suppose Dishoom strives on a quick turnover and we may have overstayed our welcome a bit?",

Food is not your average High St Indian, it's subtle but very tasty, portions smallish but it's not expensive so easy to order a variety.  A bit noisy but that's part of the general buzzy atmosphere. But the main attraction is authentic spicy Indian food unlike almost anything else you'll find, and well worth the wait/queue Unless it's raining - this is London, after all, so take an umbrella, though I was pleased to be offered one by the restaurant as I waited in the rain!",

As always, the atmosphere that dishoom provides is unparalleled. You truly feel like you have stepped into another time and place. The music that they play can actually be purchased too, great for all those dishoom hardcore fans.\nI ordered seasonal fruits with yoghurt, along with an egg naan 'sandwich' of sorts. The yoghurt was both creamy and flavoursome, with hints of vanilla coming through. The naan was good, but not the amazing I have come to expect at a restaurant like this. The naan was a little on the hard side, and the chutney along with the egg did not offer tastes that were new or unique. Maybe dishoom is just too good for their own sake. I would vote this place as a top 10 London dining experience. Though if you can, go at a later time. Dinner time.",

They don't take reservations for the evening but by chance we found that it was possible to make a lunchtime booking. \nOne of our friends was visiting from the States and it seemed like the ideal opportunity to check out Dishoom. The venue was a large open space spread over many levels and the smell of Indian food hits you as you walk through the door more than whetting the appetite. Our server was good at explaining the menu and gave good suggestions on what to order. It seemed like Indian tapas so we ordered a wide range of dishes which we all shared. The highlights were the vegetable samosas, gunpowder potatoes, the Black House Daal and the chicken ruby. There was also a good fish curry which I can't remember the name of. Everything we ordered was eaten.\nIt lives up to the hype, definitely worth the wait although I would book a lunch slot if I ever went again!",

                "description": "I was pretty disappointed with my visit to Dishoom King's Cross. I have been to the Soho location and had a great experience so I was looking forward to my friday night Dishoom plans with eager anticipation. \nWe arrived at around 6:15 and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we headed down to the bar. I ordered a mango lassi at the bar and was underwhelmed by the drink. It was too sour and weak on the mango taste. \nWe were seated in the basement space which is quite dark but the booths are quite charming and comfortable. I ordered the Bhel to start which was soggy and missing the \"chatpatta\" flavour of a good Bhel. The pommegranet seeds were a great addition though. For my main I got the mattar paneer and Naan. The curry was great - no complaints. However my naan was not warm when it arrived. This sucks because we all know that a good naan is best consumed hot!\nMy dining partners were surprised that the Ruby Chicken was packed with a spicy punch while the Lamb Biryani wasn't too spicy though it was marked as such on the menu. It's frustrating because you should be able to trust the spice levels on the menu. They were very happy with their roomali roti which was great! \nMy theory is that since we were seated in the basement the food was sitting in the kitchens for a bit before it got brought down. This sucks because it lessens the food experience. \nNow overall upto this point I would have given this experience a 4 star review. However - when the check came the waiter had added an \"optional 12.5% tip\" onto our bill. When I asked him about it he said it was \"optional\" and there as a recommendation but it had been added into our total which made no sense. So either the waiter was backtracking after being caught in a lie or Dishoom writes their bills where they give the big bold total with an optional tip added in. \nRegardless of which it is - I really disliked the lack of honesty with the process. I'm from Canada so tipping is actually a very normal thing. However, it shouldn't be added to the bill without being told! \nWill probably be back for the food and will definitely be checking the bill!",

They are putting a modern spin on Indian cuisine, like putting spices and flavors into things that you wouldn't normally associate with Indian. Their cocktail game is pretty tight also, same concept. \nIt's modern, hip, and decorated in English-influenced colonial Indian style, so it's pretty interesting inside. And, it's only about a 10 minute walk to the train station, so if you have some extra time... pop over for at least a cocktail.",

This was the only 5 star (in my opinion) restaurant that I ate at in London and I have to say that this place is actually incredible. If you want any indicator that this place is great, almost every day there are scores of people lined up outside waiting to get in and get a taste of this delicious meal. \nWe got there at around 5pm and didn't have to wait (we had to head to a show afterwards) so that was fortunate for us! I personally ordered the calamari, Dishoom chicken tikka, garlic naan, and one of their mango ice cream desserts. The calamari was one of my top five calamaris that I've ever had because the flavors and spices gave it a little kick that made the dish perfect. It also had a nice crispiness to it which I loved. The garlic naan paired nicely with the chicken tikka because it balanced out the spiciness of the chicken (which, in all fairness, was not that spicy). Finally, the dessert was fantastic as well. The prices were also pretty decent for a place this good so you should either come early and eat delicious food or wait in line and then eat delicious food. Either way, you have to eat at this place.",

This dish is my new FAVE and will be my first stop the second I step off the Eurostar. \nMy partner had the big Bombay breakfast which for him, needed slightly more on the plate to be a real big breakfast, but hey. \nThe chocolate chai tea latte wasn't balanced so you couldn't taste the chai at all, unfortunate. \nThe decor and mood is amazing, and (surprisingly!) they take breakfast reservations, although arriving at 9 and leaving at 10.30, there was definitely no need for them. \nService overall was efficient and friendly enough, not enough to warrant me giving them a 4Â£ tip though. \nA definite keeper and I look forward to returning.",

                "description": "I love Dishoom more than life itself. More than my two younger siblings and the woman that gave birth to me (and they really are the best). More than watching a Keith Moon, Slash, Bowie, Bruce Foxton, Mick Gallagher supergroup gig (oooh that was tough!). More than how my lil heart keeps me alive (I'd swap an egg naan roll for a portion of heart any day of the week). More than....well everything. Honest. Ok, so the service isn't always the quickest but strangely that only seems to be the case when the restaurant is quiet, during peak times it works like clockwork. And yep sometimes it can be quicker to run the London marathon, twice, rather than queue and wait for a table but whats an hour or two in a queue right in return for a Dishoom chip butty!? ('Vada Pau' if you were wondering). \nThe food, in particular the breakfast menu, is amazing. Great quality, and tasty. Don't expect your usual local curry house menu. The portions for dinner aren't overly huge so you may want to order a side or two to go with them. I've eaten here for breakfast about 15 or so times now and it's definitely a favourite if not THE place to find me of a morning (oh hello there stalkerface). There's lots of choice for the lunch/dinner menu too. This particular Dishoom is a really airy building spread out on different floors, go and take a wander if you have time. I love all of the pictures of India on the walls. Its great for big groups here too. There's an awesome bar 'The Permit Room' on the lower floor where the toilets are that I haven't tried yet but looks great.\nMy favourite dishes are: the infamous breakfast naan rolls (egg please), the breakfast Akuri (spicey scrambled eggs), the chai is good and unlimited (although I think that's only at breakfast time, anyone know?) The wraps are great for lunch too and pretty much any of the curries and naan breads for dinner are winners as well. Oh what the hell, just stay for the whole day with a good book and eat your way through all the menus. Ask for a breakfast loyalty card if you're not offered one, 5 breakfast visits and a stamp each time earns you a little thank you and a naan roll and some chai on your next visit. \nI was there last Tuesday, oh and Friday and will most probably be there on Monday. My face, coming to a Dishoom near you soon.",

I booked lunch reservations over a month ago, I really wanted to eat here for dinner but everything had been booked weeks in advance! We came all the way from the U.S (for sightseeing obviously) but I researched quite a bit about Indian restaurants and dishoom outbid the rest by bloggers and reviews. We were blown away by the ambiance, the vibe, the smells and sights of small gestures every where that will remind you of Bombay or India in general. The food is outstanding! You can't go wrong with ordering, we enjoyed the lamb samosas and chili cheese toasts for apps, my husband and I shared the paneer tikka, and we got a side order for cheese naan and basmati rice. Honestly everything was just perfect. Everything everyone else ordered looked perfect. The only downside is I wish we had saved room for dessert but were too stuffed to go any further. We will recommend this restaurant to all our family and friends who come to visit London. High five to the brains of this restaurant and compliments to the chef!",

The downstairs area had a cool, lively atmosphere. There is no cell service, but they have free wifi to counter that problem. \nWe ordered a Bombay Colada and an Edwina's Affair, the former being sweet and tangy, the latter being quite minty and refreshing. It wasn't even 30 min and we were already called for our table. We were seated on the main floor towards the back. \nWith such a big menu - we got the Murg Malai and the Mahi Tikka (both Grill dishes). These were both very delicious and though the portions seemed small, they were very filling. We also got the Black House Daal signature, which wasn't that flavorful to our surprise. Overall, very price friendly and delicious flavors. We got 1 rice & 1 naan, but the naan was only 1 full piece so we had to order another. \nIt was such a great meal, we came back a few days later. The second time coming, there was no wait as we came during a weekday for lunch around 11am. We got the Chicken Tikka (grill dish) and the Mattar Paneer (a curry). We loved both. We also ordered the masala chai, which comes with 5 refills. It was a drink packed with a strong, spicy flavour. It was delicious. \nThe service was very good the first time we came - we were impressed since it was very busy but they did well in coming by frequently to check on us and the hosts at the door were great. \nFor some reason during our second visit, they sat us at the very back with no other tables, even though there was a handful of tables available towards the front upstairs where everyone else was. We asked to be moved, which they did so kindly. They were not as attentive to getting us water refills and checking on us, though we still enjoyed our time.\nWe didn't have the chance to come here for breakfast but would love to in the future. Highly recommended for anyone who wants some great Indian cuisine in a modern setting.",

                "description": "A look at the queue in front of Dishoom just gives you an idea of the buzz that surrounds this indian concept...it's crazy, and so was my excitement yesterday night for my first try. This type of buzz is certainly something I've never seen where I'm from (Bruxelles). \nFood is definitely 5-stars-worthy: I've rarely eaten such tender and tasteful pieces of chicken (Murgh Malai), their Dal is a classic, and I totally got why, same story goes for their special : a lamb stew slowly cooked for months, well maybe not but surely tasted like it. So YES, Food = delicious. But...\nWhat I'm not sure is if this very good indian food is worth the 1h30min wait (30min outside, 1 hour in their Permit Room). To be honest, I've heard such good things about London Indian's restaurants even before Dishoom existed...in a few words, I'm pretty sure I can find about the same quality in a more well, \"normal\" indian place I guess...not sure if their strategy will pay off in the long run.\nAnyway, the place looks like a Museum, team is lovely, and they even offer chai tea while you're waiting in the cold. Nice right ? \nPS : Trying their breakfast/brunch might be the best tip if you'd kill to go there, without the waiting the waiting part.",

I had looked up Dishoom before I got to London and saw great reviews. I gotta agree with everyone that it was really good! \nLet me start with the chai - order once and get free top ups! But it was soo good! You could really taste the spices!! The way it should be!\nNow to the food!! Simply a really good twist to fusing Indian and western brekky. Think of it as instead of a sausage mcmuffin, you get a sausage naan!! Same with a bacon and egg naan!!\nAny ways, all in all great experience. The restaurant itself is really nice as well!",

                "description": "Cool.\nDishoom is one of those really hot restaurants (with multiple locations) in London currently that I didn't think I'd end up going to, but actually ended up going to. \nService was mostly disingenuously friendly at first, especially after some initial confusion of whether or not it was permissible to order food at the bar. (The hostess had suggested it wasn't.) The bartender seemed cheerfully annoyed when we were not ready to order within 5 seconds of sitting down, as if he expected us to fire away our order despite lack of introduction to anything on the menu, which took some time to sift through. Not even halfway through our meal, where the dude had spent most of his energy avoiding eye-contact and chatting with other servers, he decided it was finally acceptable to desert us all-together, which was most fortunate because a better server took over. Enough about service, let's cut to the food --\nThere were some good things at Dishoom. The standout was the \"ruby chicken,\" with a silky red sauce that you just want to leave nothing behind of by burying a piece of naan into, again and again. And then there were some forgettable things, like how a lassi is still just a lassi, which leaves no surprises. \nOverall, I thought the fare at Dishoom had some nice spices and flavoring going on. It was also fun to have the chance to taste many different, interesting sauces. Harsher criticism includes a mild irritation against servers who seem to have gotten caught up in their own personal aesthetics, putting on glassy smiles that match the shiny restaurant interior, which lest we forget, is still an imitation of the real thing at best. \nAw look, I can be a douchebag for fun too.",

                "description": "Had heard a lot about Dishoom which tries to replicate quintessential Mumbai Cafe's and was surprised when we found one Tucked away behind Granary Square, Kings Cross. We decided to try it out and it was indeed a new one which had just opened.\nThe Decor - from the moment you enter has a Indian touch, or rather a Mumbai (Bombay) feel to it with Hindi Scripts and Indian artefacts and humour. The music is retro Bollywood and the menu is local Mumbai. I found the dishes reasonably priced. I ordered a Dishum Chicken Tikka(Â£7.50) and a portion of Cheense Nan (Â£2.50). My fried decided to go light and ordered from the light bites - he ordered a Bhel (Street food made with Puffed Rice), Vada Pav (Check out my review of Sree Krishna Vada Pav) and a glass of Sugarcane Juice. We decided to share a portion of Gunpowder Potato(Â£5.20) (Roasted Potatoes with hot chilli and spices).\n \nThe food quickly arrived and literally blew me away! It had the heat and spiciness, the kind we get in an Indian restaurant in India! It was refreshing and there was no attempt made to tailor it to local palate. I looked around me and saw the majority of clientele were non-Indians and were obviously enjoying the food, a big change from the standard curry joints.\nThe menu has only two curry dishes and all other stuff are authentic Indian stuff. The waiters are extremely friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.\nIt was a bombardment of senses - I closed my eyes for an instant and The Decor, food, the smells of incense sticks and the old Bollywood songs transported me to my favourite Mumbai cafe.\n \nHighly recommended.\nPS :  Dishum are giving away Â£10 vouchers to every visitor which can be redeemed between Jan and Mar at their Kings Cross Branch, minimum spend of Â£40 required to claim.",

                "description": "So far I have loved every single Dishoom that has opened and if I may dare say it, it might be my favourite chain restaurant.\nLike their sisters the venue is massive consisting of three floors, up stairs for the formal restaurant, ground floor for the lounge and downstairs for the bar area. All children friendly though as I saw families with children  in every section. \nAs we made a reservation and I highly recommend it if you want to be seated immediately, we were seated upstairs.\nWith views over to the ground floor the place felt big and airy maximised by its high ceilings. Although I was quite confused to why the ceiling fans were still turned in the middle of Winter wasting electricity and not helping the place keep warm. \nThe wooden decor was lovely though, dark mahogany with its spiral staircase and simple dangling lamp shades. Noise levels drown out and the seating layout allow you to wind down happily with your companions.\nAs this was a breakfast date was my partner we went crazy and ordered the following:\nSausage and egg naan roll. \nThe dough had a lovely bite to it being stretchy and warm. The flavour almost creamy with a nice smokiness to it from the browning. It was filled with sausages that could have been cooked slightly less to have kept its lovely juices and bounce being quite dense. But the flavours and spices redeem itself and paired with the two delicious runny sunny side up and a good kick from the chilli jam I still enjoyed it very much.\nChilli cheese toast with two fried egg. \nI found the cheese toast slightly on the overcooked side. But that's because I prefer my cheese more stretchy but the flavours were rich, well spiced and plentiful of herbs creating an extreme mix of flavours in one bite. Delicious. The runny yolk help add that beautiful moisture and earthiness that added to the tasty experience.\nBombay omelette \nSo much flavour! The minced meat was so beautifully spiced my tongue was trying to keep up with all the taste. I noticed a pattern here is that they like their things well done. The egg itself was slightly overcooked for me I found it lost its silkiness and became crisp. But once given all can be forgiven by the flavours and together eaten with the soft buttered toast, washed down with my chai tea it was totally awesome. \nKeema per eedu. \nA very rich spicy dish of minced chicken and liver pieces topped with potato chips and a runny egg. The only dish where I'm not complaining that something is overcooked. The tender pieces of chicken went really well against the softer smoother kidney pieces. Together with the crunches from the potato chips and soft runny egg the sensation in my mouth was amazing. The spices used was also incredibly fragrant and not just there for the kick. It was also served with soft fluffy buttered toasted buns which were helpful in reducing the heat. Delicious and very filling and wholesome.\nAlthough this is a brunch review I have also been for dinner and it was just as mind blowing and expressive. Whether it's for a date, casual dining or special celebration I'm sure Dishoom caters for everything. It's in such a location too, near Granary Square right beside the lovely canal. Service has been friendly every time I visit. \nDid I mention that if you order Chai Tea it comes unlimited? So awesome.",

BRUNCH. \nOpen at 9am weekends, Dishoom's expansive space is the holy grail of brunch in Kings Cross.  \nOur group of 3 tried almost all offerings on the menu, I can heartily vouch for: \nKEEMA PER EEDU: A Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicate\nmorsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs and\nsali crisp-chips. Served with pau. Â£7.90. (SO RICH and delicious)\nHOUSE GRANOLA: A Dishoom recipe, handmade with oats, seeds, cashews, almonds, pistachios and cinnamon, toasted in butter and honey. Served with fresh fruits,\nKerala-vanilla yoghurt and Buckinghamshire honey. Â£5.20 (Your friends will say they'll share but they won't, everyone get their own granola -- you'll thank me!) \nThe service was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. Flawless. It was an exceptional brunch, so much so that I've convinced my friends to go back next weekend. \nPro tip: if you think you've had real chai...wait til you've tasted the glory of Dishoom's offering. It is comfort in a glass. I order a single espresso with it for a little kick, but they keep the chai coming (free of charge!) after you finished a glass. Pair with the Musaka bun (buttered bun) for dipping, and holy wow you've got yourself a winning breakfast treat.",

We also got tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, the lamb dish (similar to lamb jalfrezi) veggie korma, chicken biriyani, and samosas. Of all of them, I would recommend any, though the veg korma was not as mindblowing.\nAlso they make great cocktails. Luckily (or semi-unluckily) the line (queue) was so long you'll have a chance to try a few before your meal. The first part of the line takes place outside. In the late fall chill, this kind of sucks but they do ply you with free sherry, mint tea and chai. The second part of the line is in the downstairs bar where you'll be temporarily seated and can order drinks and two snack options. Of the two, get the banana chips. The various chutneys are excellent.\nOnce you're actually seated the good comes out quick too. It almost seems like a wonder the line is so long, given how fast they actually work, and the size of the place, but that just speaks to it's well earned popularity.",

                "description": "We have been hearing phenomenal reviews about Dishoom from friends, and locals while visiting London, and decided to give it a go on Wednesday night.  Since we are staying near St. Pancras Station, we opted for the location in Kings Cross.  No reservations could be made for small parties so we just ventured out around 8 hoping to avoid any huge lines.  Unfortunately, this was not the case and we were promptly greeted with a line with a queue time of  1 hour.  This did not phase us or persuade us to leave due to the fact that these people were gathered here for a reason and we were ready to find out what that was.  As we waited in line, we were offered a water, hot mint tea or a sherry.  Since it was a little chilly, I opted for the hot mint tea.  After our complimentary drink in line, we had the option presented to us to sit at the bar and eat which we gladly accepted.  \nThe atmosphere is a cozy, dim lit, Mombay-style setting.  Our bartender/waitress (Adele) was more than helpful when deciding on items to choose from very friendly during our visit. \nWe ordered the Calamari and some vegetable samosas to start off with and they were instantly devoured.  Some of the best Calamari I have had while visiting London.  For the main course, we ordered the following: Mattar Paneer, Gunpowder Potatoes, Cheese Naan, Dishoom Slaw, and a side of rice.  EVERYTHING was superb.  It was hard not to keep ordering but this much food between 2 people was more than enough.  The food comes out quickly after placing the order so if I were to switch it up next time, I would stagger my orders a few more minutes in between dishes.  \nI can't wait to try the breakfast menu on my next visit.  It looks just as good and the Bloody Mary's look insane.",

                "description": "Dishoom is special...like...really special. Sorry for the novel of a review but it's worth every word. \nDishoom is so special that I came here twice in the last week that I lived in London...it's so special that eating a very early lunch here was the very last thing I did before getting on the tube to Heathrow. I'm gonna attempt to break down what makes this place so spectacular. \nFirst of all, the vibe of this space is very special. It's large and light with high ceilings and comfortable seating on the entry level. Both times I have visited we stayed on the ground level, but I poked my head upstairs and it's beautiful. Downstairs they have a little lounge-ey bar. The owners have done a masterful job, updating this building while still hanging on to the old school industrial feel to it. \nThe service on my first visit was flawless. The waitress broke down the menu for us and helped us to figure out exactly what to order to suit out preferences. She was very thorough in asking about food allergies and preferred spice levels. Also, she was clearly passionate and informed about the food. It didn't feel like she was trying to up sell us, but instead to make sure we were getting the right items that would be ideal for sharing. On my second visit, the staff was less amazing but I chalked that up to our early visit and the fact that we were in a bit of a hurry and didn't ask for a menu walk through. Again, I found out waiter to be helpful, though somewhat less attentive. \nThe food here is show stopping. Easily the best Indian food I've had in my life and possibly the best meals I've eaten in London. I adored every bite of every item we ordered. You must try the black daal. It's spectacular. Rich and savory and outstanding. The calamari was definitely a stand out (in a sweet and sour fruity sauce). The lamb kebab and chicken tikka were juicy and delicious and perfectly spiced. The lamb samosas were crispy and well flavored (though I wish there were more than 2 in an order). The gunpowder potatoes are tasty and savory and a cheap side dish to go with all of the other more flavorsome dishes. The house special lamb stew was outstanding. Like my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. Oh my god. Also the naan (we tried all four kinds) are all fabulous. \nThe cocktails and even the nonalcoholic drinks all looked incredibly tempting. My friend and I split a pitcher of Bombay pimms and it was fabulous and refreshing.\nThe one caveat of this place is its crazy business. Make sure you book a table if you can or be prepared to wait. But really. It's like so worth it. I am heartbroken to have moved so far away from this magical restaurant. Please go there for me. Show me the pictures. I will cry from jealousy but it will be worth it. Go. Now. Right now.",

                "description": "Amazing !!!! The best Indian food I've ever had and the place is so cool. I guess it's a converted factory and that plays really well in this location . The service was a bit slow but acceptable . It's is a large space and that makes it harder for the staff to get around . Love the look and feel of the main floor . Downstairs is more lounge like and the upstairs is open and perfect for a lunch break .\nThe food is the star here and I can't wait to go back on my next trip to London . I wish they had one here in NYC as well.",

                "description": "I've always cycled past their Covent Garden branch and marvelled at the long queue outside, wondering if it was really worth it. \nTurning up to their Kings Cross branch and seeing a line of fewer than 5 people, we decided to wait in line. We got the customary \"It might take 30min, but we doubt it\" and fewer than 10 minutes later we were seated. \nThe decor is amazing; if I could buy a home like it, I would. It does however feel quite colonial. But has a great charm to it (if you get a chance, check out the toilets!) \nThe food was also awesome, and kudos to them for having both a gluten free, and a dairy free version of their menu. \nWill definitely be back.",

The drinks were wonderful as were the chips, albeit a small bowl of the chips.  The food was average.... no better than any other good Indian restaurant.  Portions were slightly smaller but the cost was reasonable.  We had 5 dishes we shared and all were ok. Nothing spectacular.  The service was good and fast.  The restaurant decor and ambiance was also very nice. I would go back but I would not wait to get a seat.  It's not worth that especially in a city known for amazing Indian food.",

                "description": "When I visited London last Fall, we tried to get into three different Dishoom locations, only to find unbearably long queues, so it's been at the top of my suggestion list since I got back to London in June. \nFinally, today was the day I got to experience the bacon and egg naan that I'd been hearing about, but first, let me say how beautiful this location is. Unassuming from the outside, inside you're transported back in time to British colonial Bombay. The interior is fantastically done and feels rich and opulent, yet cozy and warm. \nWe were seated upstairs and ordered two cappuccinos. They arrived in what looked like small  milkshake glasses, topped with a bit of chocolate. To be fair, they tasted good, but needed to be much hotter. I prefer my coffee in mugs that tend to keep them warmer, but that's just me. \nMy girlfriend ordered the bacon & egg naan (noms!) and I ordered the Kejriwal -- two gloriously orange-yolked fried eggs atop chilli cheese toast with spring onions/scallions/green onions/whatever you call them here and coriander. They aren't afraid of flavor and it showed. It. Was. Perfect. Perfect size (though I could've eaten way more), perfectly cooked, perfect price at only Â£4.90. Seriously, i can't get breakfast at the crappy takeaway down the street for Â£4.90! \nThe service was super fast, friendly and attentive, which pushes it to five stars for me. Price, flavor, speed, ambience. Two thumbs up. I want to go back for dinner!",

                "description": "SO GOOD. SO WORTH IT. Service could be a little better hence the 4 stars.\nWe had heard a couple great things about this restaurant before we took our trip to England and decided to pop in for dinner on our last night in London. Since I had read Yelp reviews about the long waits during peak hours, we came in around 9pm on a Wednesday evening and were sat within minutes. Dishoom is in a beautiful old building (it's a huge place) and the decor is simply stunning. \nI had already perused the menu (thanks Yelp you always got my back) so I had somewhat of an idea of what we were going to order but were happy to hear our waiter's recommendations before we made our final decisions. We definitely ordered more food than we needed but have nooo regrets. Our dinner at Dishoom was definitely the best meal we had during our 4 day stay in London.\nDrinks: I ordered the Bombay Colada (NOM) and my partner had the Viceroy's Old Fashioned (also NOM). My partner has had many an Old Fashioned and thought Dishoom's version was absolutely fantastic so that's sayin' somethin'. \nAppetizer: Dishoom Calamari which was uniquely spiced, just the right about of oily, and perfectly cooked!\nEntrees: Chicken Ruby, Black House Daal, Vegetable Biryani, Lamb Boti Kebab, and Garlic Naan. All of it was absolutely delicious. That's all you need to know.\nDessert: House Chai (wonderfully spiced and delicious) and the Pineapple & Black Pepper Crumble which was subtly sweet, a good size, and the perfect ending to a great meal.\nMy only complaint would be the service. While good overall, it could be improved considering how great everything else is. The biggest issue for us was that one of the servers spilled a bowl of their Raita right behind us which splattered all over my partner's jacket and shoes as well as my shoes. While they quickly cleaned everything up and gave my partner a cloth to clean himself off, nothing was done after that and our server never mentioned it. Considering how pricey Dishoom is, I would have at least expected an apology or an offer for a free dessert. We were just at Mowgli in Manchester days before and our server told us that she took our naan off the bill for us because it came a little late. In terms of our server, he never refilled our water and it took him about 20 minutes to bring our check to us after we had finished our meal. We noticed other tables around us who were served by him waiting a while for their checks as well.\nOverall, I LOVE Dishoom and will definitely be back when I'm back in London.",

The restaurant is styled after an old Social or Gentlemen's club in colonial India. The decor and furniture is incredibly detailed and makes you feel as though you have travelled back in time. The menus include a wide variety of food and include charming history and anecdotes for certain dishes. \nWe tried the naan bacon breakfast sandwich as well as the porridge. The breakfast sandwich was amazing the bacon was cured and cooked in a unique sweet chili sauce which was ask so served with the plate. To say the bacon was delicious is a vast understatement. The whole sandwich worked well together. \nThe porridge was tasty and I mostly ordered it because I had never eaten porridge before. It was simple with bananas and dried dates and very satisfying. That porridge is all you can eat. \nWe also ordered the red grape and lemon juice which was a bit expensive at Â£5 a glass but a thrilling combination. The drink was sour and sweet, and a nice new experience. \nDishoom blew away my expectations and my wife and I still talk about how happy we were with the whole experience. We can't speak for the dinner menu and have heard there is quite a line but will definitely make this a London MUST.",

It is situated in a ancient English railway warehouse. The place was abuzzing on our arrival.\nThe Bombay Big Breakfast at an expensive Â£11.50 was very disappointing, compared to  Big Breakfast size meals in other London cafes and restaurants (which charged at even half the price). \nThere was bugger-all ingredients on the plate, hardly any grilled streaky bacon or grilled mushrooms to  be seen , and the fried tomato was quite small in size. Only the two sausages were of normal size. The massala flavour baked beans tasted kinda odd too. \nTheir Chai tea at an expensive Â£2.50 per small glass although tasty was served only luke warm. I hate luke warm tea!!\nAlso their old wooden styled chairs weren't very comfortable, and the whole place felt very old and cramped. However our waitress was friendly enough. \nA restaurant is only as good as its last meal. And for that reason alone, I would not return here again in a hurry. It's expensive and the food is nothing really special. \nThough for many I guess, the Dishoom is good for its authentic old Indian styled restaurant novelty value.. \nBut sorry......... thats not good enough for me!!",

The atmosphere with the dimmed lights is exceptional. In the lower level you will find the \"Permit Room\" bar which creates unbelievable drinks - most of them with an Indian touch to it.\nThe food itself is very tasty - from the naans over the paneer tikka to the daal and the various curries. You can't go wrong with anything. It's a good place to come with friends and share a variety of food. The only problem with this place is the door personnel that often tries to scare you away with an extremely unfriendly attitude and exaggerated waiting times (that actually are never true)",

                "description": "My no. 1 dining experience in London! \nDishoom serves modern Indian food out of a renovated railway shed built baaaaack in the day. The place is huge, cavernous in fact, and the decor incredible.  It's like being transported back in time to a first class cabins in the 19 century... lots of dark wood, patterned tiled floors, marble countertops and metal finishings. \nAnyway, enough about the dÃ©cor.  The food... well, it's darn delicious. Every dish we tried was packed full of flavour w beautifully balanced spice and lots of fresh herbs. We got a smorgasboard of dishes and all were to die for but the surprise standout dish for me was their daal, which they simmer for over 24hours so it's absorbed all the delicious liquid.  Unfortunately this time we didn't have room for dessert but next time I am back in London this week be my first stop.\nOh and  make sure that you go downstairs to the Permit Bar for a drink either before or after dinner. It's got a bit of a speakeasy vibe and the service and drinks are impeccable.  Try one of their signature cocktails or tipples, as they call them. I'm a negroni fan so couldn't go past Sonia's take on the classic - Hayman's Dry gin, Campari & Dishoom vermouth served with hand carved ice.\nOne last thing... Dishoom doesn't take bookings so I'd recommend getting there early, putting your name on the list and then heading downstairs for a tipple (or two).  We got there around 6pm and were seated well before 7pm, but apparently the wait can be up to 3 hours during peak times.",

It has become our number one choice for business lunches and our guests always leave very happy.\nIf I had to choose a few favorites, they would be: okra fries, awadhi lamb, chicken ruby, and roomali roti. I always have a tough time choosing between the sugarcane juice and the house chai though. Both are SO delicious.\nAs far as the restaurant itself, there is such a nice vibe at Dishoom. It's big, well decorated, and the staff is very attentive. I just love the interior! It really is a perfect place to have a meal.",

I've heard praises from here to Timbuktu about their bacon naan roll, and finally woke up early enough to try it.  \nDecor: Feels much more vibey and well put-together than its costs (95% of the dishes are under Â£10).  Way ahead of the game when it comes to affordable franchises having a certain \"oomph\" to its ambiance.  Would make for a great date spot.\nFood: After a complimentary (and delicious!) hot chai tea, they brought me two folded bacon naan rolls.  I never had a naan serving on its own, but Dishoom's version is quite different, fusing the British bap concept with Indian influences.  So how was it? Chewy, spicy, sweet, smoky, tangy, savory...absolutely delicious. \nGo, go, go!",

We wanted an early dinner in the area, and read the reviews about the long waits, so made a booking for 5:45pm thinking it would be empty, because who really eats at that hour? We probably could have walked in at that point, but it was pretty full, and there was a wait by 6:30. \nWe arrived and were seated by a friendly host, but then didn't see a server for more than 15 minutes. People walked past with water jugs, but didn't offer us any, and I had to catch someone's eye to make our order, which seemed pretty silly. There were tons of staff around, so no idea why we had to wait so long to order. \nOrdered a number of dishes to share based on other reviews, and there were a couple dishes that I would be happy to eat again. The black dal was delicious, and felt like it was reasonably priced. The bhel starter was very good, although inconsistently spiced (it felt like it wasn't stirred together properly), but I would recommend it. \nI don't get the love for the okra fries, which are a spicy version of something you can get at any BBQ place or TGI-Fridays style place in the US. Nothing special. The roti was obviously not cooked to order as it claimed, since the top was hard and stale. The grilled greens were OK but nothing amazing. The gunpowder potatoes were actually inedible. The spicing was decent, but the potatoes themselves were undercooked, which is never a good thing in a potato. \nWhen I asked for the bill, the server noticed we'd only eaten a bite of the potato and asked what was wrong. I said they were undercooked and not good, and he apologised. But of course, he didn't take it off the bill, so I kind of felt like he shouldn't have bothered asking if he wasn't going to do anything about it. \nThe physical space is beautiful, I have to admit. I love the area, and enjoyed walking around the warehouses behind King's Cross. \nOh, if I wasn't already disappointed, my visit to the bathrooms sealed the deal. Down in the basement, the whole bar is smoky with incense, which is odd in a restaurant. In the bathroom itself, the smoke from incense was insanely thick, and my clothes ended up smelling like a dirty hippy shop for the rest of the evening. I agree with whoever said that the toilets remind them of an outhouse, weirdly out of place. \nBasically, it was an interesting experience, and I had one good dish. But I won't be back-- service was slow and not especially professional, food was more expensive than I felt it was worth, and drinks were astronomically expensive. Next time I want Indian food, I'll head for Drummond St instead.",

The place was packed, but the lineup was better than expected, we got seated in less than half an hour. They offered us free cocktails while waiting.  \nWe had the fried octopus as appetiser and it was so good that we order a second round.

Consistently good food in an amazingly themed Bombay cafÃ©.

We got seated straight away when we showed up at 5.30pm on Sunday. \nI raved about the breakfast in my Shoreditch review but again: bacon and egg naan. That's all you need. \nDinner is just as amazing. Far far, chicken tikka, house dahl, calamari, freshly made naan and rotis plus okra fries which are simply incredible to name a few. \nExpect innovative takes on Iranian/Indian dishes with great flavours and surprisingly amazing prices - I love that the prices are modest despite the ongoing hype with this place.

I've weathered wind, rain and ice, for dates, get-togethers and family dinners. And though it's not perfect and you can get better Indian food (if you look REALLY hard) in London, it is the best place I can recommend in London overall. \n+ Breakfast: I thought I knew it all about Dishoom until after a year having dinners I went for breakfast; and I fell in love all over again. The Bacon Egg Naan Roll is delicious; wood smoked bacon with gooey organic egg, a layer of cream cheese and fresh chopped coriander, with the char from the tandoor on the naan. Paired with a sweet and very mildly spiced chilli jam to lighten the smoke and char- I was licking the plate. Which is a beautiful white and blue like your Nanniji might have. The Chicken Keema looked good but wasn't amazing, and I found it too oily. Fire Toast (2-3 pieces) was ok, came lukewarm and a touch dry, but the preserves were nice. The Big Bombay breakfast is awesome, and the Masala Beans yummy; if needing a slight chilli kick (my preference). \n+ Have a Dhoble cocktail to perk up your brunch, or a monsoon malabar coffee for those grim morning-afters. It must be said the coffee isn't great (i.e. barista level), but I like the chicory hit from it. Get a lassi, or ask can they do a sugar cane & lime juice otherwise.\n+ Lunch: you can't go wrong with with a Frankie roll and a Thumps-Up. Get it into you. Their wine selection is average, but their cocktails are why you are here. Summertime, hit the juleps. Wintertime go for a chota peg. Avoid the Indian Sula wine (overpriced) and Amrut whiskey (sub-par) if you are into those things. Sorry India :(\n+ Dinner: Aw yisss. I mean, I can write on every item, but no need. Their special, Lamb Nahil Nihari is a leg of lamb originating in Iran and infamous on the streets of Pakistan. The sauce is thick and unctuous and morish, scoopable with the garlic roti. The lamb itself is well cooked and tasty, but I doubt slow cooked (would be better) as it needed to be carved/pried off the bone on both occasions we ordered. A large portion, get to share at Â£17.50. Don't opt for the brainzzzz (my preference).\nHeadliners are the Chicken Ruby (perfect for those people who think Indian food must be a sauce, meat, and rice), Chicken Berry Britannia (recreation of CafÃ© Britannia in Mumbai), house daal mopped up with roomali (handkerchief) roti, vada pau with a dollop of fresh green coriander chutney, paneer tikka and more. \nDesserts- probably the only thing I'm not impressed with. The overly heavy Guju Shrikhand & Chocolate Mouse, and the Ghola Ice is divisive among friends. Best opt for a simple kulfi. Pudding wine isn't much to talk about, don't bother with it. Get chocolate chai or a 'Dirty chai' instead.\nCocktails/Drinks: all of them. While downstairs go for the juleps and pegs; at the dinner table I love the East India Gimlet.\nOverall- for its price, service and consistent quality every day all day, it's impossible not to say it's my favourite place to eat in London. Always coming back.",

I yelped the closest and best option from where I was, Kings Cross. I walked about 10-15min and when I got to the restaurant, I was shocked to see a long line outside on this late chilly night (8:30pm). I got on line seeing as it should be good since it's so popular. I overheard the wait would be 1hr+! The group ahead of me was about to turn away but the waitress convinced them to stay by accommodating them with outside seating with drinks from the bar before being seated for dinner. Then a waitress came out and passed out warm drinks to everyone waiting outside, it was pretty chilly out so it was very nice. I didn't realize what I was drinking but it was the best drink ever at the moment! \nI was seated only after 5min of waiting because I was alone and was able to sit at the bar. SCORE! The atmosphere was so chill. The bartenders were so trendy dressed in hipster suspenders. My bartender was super friendly and recommended a few options because I had no idea what to get. I got the cheesy naan and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and then a mango kulfi for dessert. EVERYTHING was sooo good! On top of that, I asked the bartender what drink they gave me outside and I was shocked when he told me it was CHAI! He was so nice that he gave me a free refill! \nI highly recommend this place when in London! I will definitely come back here on my next visit!",

We actually ordered a second calamari after finishing the first bowl!  Everything was flavored delectably and dishes complemented each other perfectly. \nOn top of that, the location is just cool.

From the bright, ginger-laced Pimms Cup to the impeccable naan, everything was spectacular. The prices are reasonable, but it's easy to run up quite a bill as each dish on the menu begs to be tasted. I would recommend everything except the tomato and onion salad; it's exactly that, and comes as a side dish with the delicious chicken tikka masala, so don't bother ordering it separately.

It's totally deserved.\nAfter finding it (this was no easy feat as we were going lo-tech and finding it sans smartphone), we were torn between three seating options: outside on the (limited, but sunny - vitamin D-enriched meal!) patio, inside at low rattan furniture with sun streaming through the windows, or upstairs in the more traditional of dining rooms.\nWe opted to sit in the dining room; not perhaps the best option for the tan, but good for a quiet tete-a-tete which was the social purpose of this mean.\nThe service was *on point*; always there to answer questions, always quick and responsive, but never overbearing.  Provided great recommendations and really helped make our meal spectacular.\nWe decided on some far far (basically a must for all children of the 80s; they're essentially neon-coloured crisps with a trio of dipping options) to munch on while we decided.  Ultimately we went for some grilled mixed greens (SOUNDS BLAND; GET 'EM), the much-touted okra fries, the warm (ish) chicken pomegranate salad and the murgh malai, which was one of the best uses of chicken thigh that has ever graced my lips.  THAT WAS A LOT OF TRUTH SAY.\nWe were both super-full (oh, did I mention; wine?), and got out with - including tip - 35GBP of damage.  Excellent work, Dishoom.\nYelp note: decor is lovely, as is the incense burning.  Truly my sole but (but/t?) is...the wooden toilet seats.  Reminds me of camping outhouses and...yeesh.  Clearly some childhood camping trauma I hadn't unpacked, but didn't welcome revisiting it mid-way through such a lovely dinner.",

If they are open, they are busy. There is a reason for this but later. Second, yes the line is long. Yes they will tell you an absurd amount of time until you are seated but fear not! There will be little drinks while you are in line, bigger drinks once you get into the downstairs bar and amazing food as your reward. Finally, it will not take as long as they have told you. Which is a neat psychological trick.\nThe atmosphere is probably the one thing I did not love. It is a sweaty, packed and really loud room. Pair this with eastern european waitresses whose high pitched voices do not carry across the gap and it can be difficult to even order. All of that being said, we got exactly what we ordered every time, even if it was difficult to flag someone down for additional beer.\nThe food. I need to say it again, The Food! Amazing, Delicious, Indescribably Good... this is why you wait 40 minutes, shout to be heard with a waitress and endure your neighbor's chair bumping you 15 times during dinner.\nGo to Dishoom, then go again and then keep going until you have eaten everything!",

I'm hardly a connoisseur but know what flavours I like.\nThe first time I came the queue outside was an hour long so I walked away, vowing to return earlier next time. I'm so pleased I  did because Dishoom has quickly become my go-to restaurant when I'm near Kings Cross. I've been twice since, once with a friend and then with my dad - who said this was \"the best Indian he'd ever had in London, probably the best Indian EVER!\"\nThe experience begins from the moment you join the inevitable queue outside. They offer you a drink (mint tea or a spirit I seem to remember) which I think is a very kind gesture. You hopefully go inside quite quickly to sit in the bar downstairs. The cocktail list seems to cater for all tastes - strong shorts or sweet and fruity options. My only criticism come from the trip with my dad when the menu had at least 3 drinks listed that they no longer offered.\nOnce the go upstairs to the dining room you'll realise how nice and helpful the staff really; offering recommendations of their favourite or most popular dishes. I have over ordered on both occasions but they generously boxed up the remaining food into individual pots so I could take it home. I rate the Prawn Koliwada, Lamb Biryani and Ruby Murray but still have lots of the menu to work my way through.",

                "description": "We went to Dishoom on Saturday morning for brunch. Having been to their Covent Garden branch for NYE dinner some time back, I had decent expectations.\nThe decor, the setting etc are supposed to take you back to Bombay. The hallmarks are high roofs with lights and fans hanging, wooden furniture that give you an impression of time having passed by and an atmosphere that whilst looking busy, lets you sit back and relax. Dishoom ticked all these boxes. \nNow, because we went at breakfast/brunch time, we got the breakfast menu.\nGoing to the food, we got two bacon rolls with naan, which to me, is the best of both worlds. Delicious bacon sandwich, pimped up to an Indian level with naan and some tasty chutney. We also got a fire toast, which was, toast with some spicy chutney. We also got a maska bun (bun with butter) to share. There was the option of bottomless house chai, which some of us went for. For me the biggest delight was South Indian coffee from the Coorg district of Karnataka! I go giddy for Coorg coffee, so yes, that was brilliant. The food tasted great, the coffee was exceptional and the house chai, with the bottomless option was also a winner. However, there were drawbacks, significant ones, which take the experience down to a 3 star.\nNow, the problem was that if you are a vegetarian, who does't even eat egg, you have no options. You can either opt for the fire toast or go for an egg roll (similar to the bacon roll) without the egg. This, by far was the biggest disappointment. The other big factor was the congestion. The tables were stacked too close to one another, which meant that if you lean back you make unnecessary contact with the person behind you, especially if you're both big blokes. In a traditional Bombay Irani cafe, the tables aren't that close that you lose a sense of privacy.\nBut having said all this, the staff were friendly and courteous, which is an asset to this industry.\nIf I did go back to Dishoom, it definitely will not be for their brunch/breakfast, but perhaps for a proper meal.",

The food experience you will get is definitely worth a little waiting and you'll leave with a full tummy and a smile on your face. \nI'd recommend the Bombay breakfast as it is personally my favourite, but there is a big variety of meals on the menu, so don't hesitate asking the friendly staff for suggestions.",

It plays on its location as a former railway depot and has made it Indian railway style...it's just such a great place to sit and eat with friends as there's so much cool stuff to look at while you eat\nThe food is outstanding : the house daal, pao bhaji, chicken biryani and lamb chops are world class\nHonestly if u want REAL Indian food go here!!

It is just very slick from the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave.\nThe first thing that struck me was the size of the restaurant. It's huge and despite being split over three levels it somehow manages to be intimate at in spite of the space. \nDishoom has received so many plaudits and accolades - and I can easily see why - but it's extremely modest to be described as a 'Bombay style cafe', as it's much more than that. \nEven the breakfast menu is full of Bombay flavours - one of the most unique breakfast menus in London. \nI went for the sausage and egg naan roll. It's unlike any sausage and egg roll you'll ever eat - in a very good way. Others in our party went for the acclaimed bacon naan roll and someone also chomped on the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli toast). \nAfter this experience, I'll definitely be coming back for dinner. And breakfast, again.",

                "description": "The stars are kind of a giveaway, so yes: this place is great. I would be remiss if I did not note that there were a few initial red flags, however.\nFirst: it's both huge and nicely decorated. This, perversely, worried me. Gilgamesh in Camden is huge; it's been years since I've been, but it was a hot mess of a restaurant, with orders mixed up, confusing portion sizes, swarms of confused staff, and cryptic pricing. The money had all gone on the decor and a very decent bar staff, but eating felt like you'd done very badly in an exam you expected to ace. \nSecond: when we were seated, the waiter asked if I'd been to Dishoom before, and then explained the 'concept' to me. This worried me too. In a culinary context I am rarely keen on concepts that require explanation. But in this instance the concept was that we were expected to share, that it was a small-plates kind of deal, and that things would arrive when they were ready and not as part of a traditional starter/main framework; so, fine. This isn't Gilgamesh, where the concept was that they did expensive food very averagely from a bewildering variety of Asian cultures, so that's fine. (I'm still bitter about it, yes.)\nThe worries melted away when the food came. Lamb samosas and some calamari - a signature dish, according to the waiter - came first. The samosas were pretty good; the calamari was excellent, with a light salty batter and a sweet, acidic sauce - tamarind? Pomegranate? Something like that. I would come back for the calamari alone. \nSeekh kebabs and mahi tikka were next, with some excellent cucumber raita and crispy, fresh naan bread.  Everything is really interestingly spiced; nothing's overpowering, or even very hot, but it's complex. The signature black dahl is brilliant, but there's equal attention to detail in the complimentary relishes (mint and coriander, red and green chilli, and something I missed because I'm a bit deaf.) I don't know what they put in the 'Gunpowder potatoes' - I assume it wasn't gunpowder - but they were delicious and fragrant.\nThis all felt like pretty good value for thirty quid a head (including an OK cocktail and a nice bottle of pale ale.) I've eaten at pricier Indian restaurants like Tamarind and the Cinnamon Club and not had nearly as nice a time. \nThe one drawback really is that it's very popular. When we arrived at lunchtime on a Saturday it was packed, and people (ourselves included) were queuing outside for quite some time. Inside it's noisy and occasionally hard to catch the waiters' eyes when they're running around making sure the food gets out to the tables hot off the stove (which they do brilliantly, but it's difficult to make sure this works in an it-comes-as-it's-ready environment. Or at least at Gilgamesh, anyway.) \nDefinitely go. Book in advance if you can. I'm interested to go for breakfast - served until 12 - which looks like it'd be great, going by the menu.",

                "description": "To get to dishoom, you walk though the fountains on granary square, along canals and through crowds of students from St martins. It's a beautiful location, which adds to the feeling that dishoom is out of the ordinary. A feeling that continues when you get inside and experience their drinks, service and food.\nThe door staff are polite and friendly, but be prepared for a long wait in the evening. Booking a table isn't available unless you are a group of 6+. We started out at dishoom at 3pm though on a Saturday and we got a table for cocktails in their bar below. There were eight of us and we decided to stay and eat upstairs later on. The table took an hour of so, but it's not really a problem when you are waiting in such nice surroundings. \nThe interior design of the place is exquisitely executed. Signs are in English and Nepali, antique pictures from Nepal and India hang from the Jade coloured walls. A colonial vintage feel runs through dishoom's three floors, yet it never feels antiquated and modern twists breath vitality into the place. \nAs you head downstairs to the 'the permit room' bar, their is a cosy atmosphere. The colonial feel continues, with teak furniture and Tiffany lamps. \nWe started with some sumptuous cocktails. I had the Tanchoix fix. This is a delicate blend of mandarin, peppers and aged gin. The cocktails are quite pricey though at Â£9 for a small one and Â£18 for a large. Unfortunately not something we could have sustained. We then found that there was a great punch whose recipe dates back to the 1600's. It uses tea, arak, limes and jaggery. It is served in a cute vintage punch bowl with copper cups for all. There were 8 of us and the punch served us with a glass and a half each per bowl. This was a bit of a bargain, as each bowl was Â£29 each. We went through six bowl and were quite merry!\nWe ate upstairs and chose to get a number of dishes and share. The food is like the decor and uses the traditional flavours of South Asia whilst adding modern twists and European flavours into the mix. Particularly exceptional was the black dhaal main course, the paneer roll (which comes with a divine mint sauce) and the paper thin roti. This is not your traditional British Nepali/Indian takeaway usual... You won't find a greasy rogan josh or a bland korma on here. Instead Chili cheese toast, lamb on the bone curry (with or without lamb brain) and the Bombay dish of pau bhaji set your tastebuds alight and help to soak up the punch. After 7 hour there (not a joke) we were throughly drunk, thoroughly full and thoroughly glad to have chosen dishoom. And those of us who didn't have an individual cocktail at the beginning the whole experience cost Â£35. You can't say fairer than that!",

By far the best Indian food I've ever had in my life. We had the okra fries (loved it - didn't even taste like okra), chicken ruby (a must have), Dishoom chicken tikka (a nice spicy kick to the flavorful and super tender chicken), and the black house daal (not sure what was in this dip but it was delicious). If you're in London, this is an absolute must go to place.",

                "description": "Oh Dishoom. You had a lot to live up to. Claims of 'The best indian I've *literally* ever tasted' were thrown around.\nI cannot fault your food. It was up there. I wouldn't say the best *literally* but that's a sliding scale. You were definitely a solid second.\nIf this review was on food alone, you would have got a five star.\nAlas.\nIt is not. Instead your review includes service. Service particularly from a lady called Natalie. This is where things go awry.\nI have one rule when I'm eating anywhere. In fact, make that two rules. First being 'Even if it does look like a hipster would have an orgasm when they walked in, don't let that mar your judgement'. I didn't allow that to sway me. Joss sticks and all. I held my resolve.\nJoss sticks. In a restaurant. Right by the open kitchen.\nSecond rule is, never allow a server to say 'you can't have that, other people on the table have ordered it'. Oh Natalie. Mistake number one. When I come to your restaurant in a group of eight. Not all of us are going to buy into your 'a dish is for the table, not for you' attitude. Oh no. If I order a lamb balti, that lamb balti is MINE. Not the table's. MINE.\nIn the words of his holyness Joey Tribbiani: 'Joey doesn't share food'. No Natalie. He doesn't, and neither do I.\nWhen a table of eight has ordered three bowls of Black House Daal, and try to order a fourth. We don't care that you would never normally allow a table of six to order two between them. We'll order what we want.\nYour judgemental comments and attitude did nothing to make us like you. It only served to put us off coming back again.\nOnce you'd seen that we had infact consumed all the Daal that we ordered. You comments of 'well, I assure you that has never happened before' also did nothing to warm us.\nThe final straw in your incompetence was when, after we had paid all of our bill, including a larger than due 15% tip you proceeded to tell us that we had not even paid the base amount without service charge.\nNow don't get me wrong. You made an honest mistake. Maths off the cuff can be hard. Anyone could have made the mistake. The tone of, and judgemental nature 'Eeeer, excuse me. You're 60p short of the minimum'. Only disappointed us further. Had you checked your maths, you would have found your mistake.\nWe left thoroughly disappointed, and will not be returning. \nThis place gets a two solely for the food. I'd have knocked off another star and given it a one because of you, Natalie, but I'm not that rude. I recommend you avoid.\nI haven't even covered the offers of waters and snacks whilst we chose our food - all of which were charged for with no discussion of price. The 'bottle of water for the table' became three bottles of water for the table as they emptied one, brought over another and charged us for them.",

                "description": "This review is mainly about the experience, rather than the food. \nIt was an insidiously windy hike up from Kings Cross station to Dishoom and we were horrified to be told on the door with a smile that waiting time for a table was an hour and 45 mins, ... but not as horrified as we were when we were then told that there was a waiting time for the bar that we had been directed to wait in !!! We were also told that we couldnt order drinks whilst wiating for room at the bar 'because by the time the drinks are made your table would be ready ...' Not sure what that said about the waiting time for either. \nSo we stood by the doors gazing upon the restaurant, a bar, people sitting eating and drinking ... for what felt like a thirsty 10 mins or more until we were able to go down to the bar that we would be waiting in. \nDuring that time we were able to appreciate 2 things : the visuals were awesome, the noise sucked. But the interior was lovely. i actually started to feel pangs of longing to be back in the asian subcontinent, such was the nostalgic attention to detail in every part of the sprawling comfortable 3 floor (? 4 floor ?) building.  And somehow , despite the dodgy soundtrack (a few guitar band indie-pub tunes) , all the vocal clamour and people noise added to the bustling-India ambience. In the event we 'only' had to wait for an hour and a quarter for a table, by which time I had kind of lost my appetite. \nCocktails were good, as they should have been; pre -made, which mate be contentious or perhaps marketed as a plus point. The Gimlet was awesome, other nice mixes. Served on a hand-cut shard of ice which was definitely the epitome of cool.\nFood :  I was looking forward to their signature Black House Daal, and when it came it was good, but i wasn't too bothered about paying too much attention to it because I fell in love with the Roomali roti, soft, delicate, big, warm. Likewise with the Gunpowder potatoes  and Biryani and Mutter Paneerm which my three friends loved.  I felt the tastes were comfortable and pleasant, not quite as complex as I would have liked, but I was brought up on a Sri Lankan palate and perhaps we are notoriously exacting when it come to food ....\nThe service was great, and the ambience in the restaurant was also awesome, i preferred it to the subterranean bar. The restaurant was a really great combination of relaxing, chilled, intimate, but feeling as though you are in the thick of things and able to gaze on some activity. Looking around, it felt like this would probably be the case from every table, and it was here that I felt that I could almost be in India. By that time the tunes had changed to seem more congruous. \nSo, my friend said that the website says no need to book : I would come back, but I would not wanna be faced with that wait again, I would love to check out their other locations, im hooked on the interiors and i would definitely bring friends. I wanna to try more of their dishes and spend more time at the restaurant table eating",

Next time we would skip the pricy cocktails for a beer. \nFriendly services, except a few hiccups here and there.. and nice environment. \nWe went for lunch and the wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad comparing to dinner hours. We asked our waiter about portion sizes and he suggested 5, 6 dishes for two of us. (Either we looked starving or I never knew people eat that much there). We ended up ordering only 3 dishes + garlic nan and we were stuffed. Every dish was delicious!\nAlthough they forgot our Okra Fries. The waiter apologized and brought it out later, said it was on the house but when the bill came, it was charged. \nWe didn't bother to correct him since we did order and finished it. \nThe okra fries were a bit salty and a few pieces were stringy.

At any rate, I've never had Indian food quite like this is my life, so flavorful and impeccably prepared. I had the Vegetable Samosa, Okra Fries, Chicken Ruby and Roomali Roti - they were each fantastically delicious. I had a hard time picking a favorite when the waitress inquired - I ultimately said the okra, but could have selected any of them. I also had the Baileys Chai for dessert, which was a lovely, silky yet lightly spiced drink. The service was great too - she was very kind and made excellent recommendations. Had I come here at the beginning of my trip as opposed to the end, I may never have eaten anywhere else! Bravo!",

Dishoom really encapsulates the current trend for quality without the fuss. Step through the door and you leave London behind for a few hours - a heady mix of spice, sandalwood and sloooow scratchy jazz tunes really set the mood. Both the food and cocktails were exceptional, I'm a real fan of street food and sharing dishes so my friends and I ordered lots of smaller dishes to share which was perfect. Service was quite slow but we weren't in a rush, it's the sort of place that makes you feel nostalgic (must have been the jazz...or one too many Bombay Coladas!) and you just never want to leave - but alas, we had a train to catch! We came early evening so didn't have to queue very long but at busier times you can be queueing for ages which I can't be done with - no matter how good the food!",

There is nothing Irani about this menu. The menu is surprisingly limited. There are only two veg curries and no dry veg or chicken dishes. Their signature Dal is too tomato-ee and does not bring out the flavours of the lentils at all. The service is in haste and sporadic. All our starters came together with drinks but were followed by the main course within 5 minutes and it was only 5:30PM. \nI've eaten much better Indian food in London. You can too.",

We waited outside for 20-30 min (but were given a hot cup of chai), then moved inside to a bench, but weren't allowed to order a drink there. Waited another 20-30 min, then sent downstairs to the bar. Were there for about an hour and a bit, ordered 2 cocktails and then were finally moved upstairs for dinner. I have a feeling this is the standard pattern of how things are done at this restaurant - so expect that you'll have to spend money on at least 2 cocktails in the bar before you can have dinner and you won't feel annoyed about it!\nWe had Keema pau, Chilli cheese toast to start (both were bordering on cold when they arrived). For mains we shared house daal, mattar paneer, murgh malai, kacchi lamb biryani, cheese naan.Can not fault any of the mains, arrived hot and well seasoned. Cheese nan was a bit too heavy perhaps (so much cheese!). Food prices are quite reasonable I think, but its the money you have to spend in the bar that really bumps up the bill. Not sure I like this system - not sure it happens at the Covent Garden branch.\nThe decor and design of the restaurant is very special though - nice to have a chance to see the whole place, but not sure I'll be back in a hurry (definitely not when I'm in a rush to eat).",

I have eaten in Brick Lane and yes there are great Indian restaurants there, but this place is beyond. The food, the service, the ambiance, everything is so on point that the experience is always amazing.\nI have been at the one in Covent Garden but decided to visit this one. New up and coming area and the restaurant has been open for about a month or two. \nMy wife, who does not like spicy food, yet loves Dishoom, and I decided to split the following;\n-Dishoom Calamari. Crispy and a touch if sweetness. And the sauces they come with, mix excellent. \n-The Special-Nalli Nihari with Bheja (Of Course). A hearty stew. Leaves up to its billing. Amazing balance of taste and spice.\n-Dishoom Chicken tikka. This classic and beautifully done. Delicious\n-Cheese naan. Amazing, not much to say there.\n-Rice. Soft, steamed basmati rice. perfect complement. \n-Kingfisher beer. If they don't have the Dishoom IPA (which is excellent) this is your second best option to pair with your food.\n-Mango-fennel lassi. Just delicious. I always get this.\n-Blow horn spiced cider. My wife got this. Very crisp and refreshing.\n-Raita. Not only is helpful if you need to tame down the heat but its also delicious.\nAnother amazing experience at Dishoom. Thanks also to our server Paul. He was awesome.",

I had the chicken tikka (super flavorful, but a tad on the salty side), black house daal (delish - perfectly balanced flavors... recommend this with jasmine rice), and a virgin bhang lassi (highly recommend this smoothie-like drink, especially if you're not too good with spice - this will cool you down).

The restaurant is based on the Irani cafes in Bombay, but not being familiar with those, I could only identify it as feeling colonial, for better or for worse.

                "description": "They like to stress the Persian/Irani heritage of this place, but it is 85% Indian influenced. I won't lie, it's got amazing atmosphere and ambiance. The decor is fabulous, the building is wonderful (love converted warehouses), and it is tres stylish. I sat at the bar because I was a single, though it was not very busy and would have appreciated a booth. I decided to go with the flow and trust them.\nI think dining has a lot to do with trust when you're not sure on a place or you've never tried it. Yelp reviews and other people's recommendations can only go so far - in the end, it's what your tastebuds want, what your mind thinks is a good value for time and money. I think that for me, I will not be back because of the following:\n1. When I was seated at the bar, I noticed how blaring loud the music was. Because of the open structure of the warehouse, the two levels in the restaurant allow for the music and chatter from the upstairs to melt in with the downstairs. So when the bartender tried to talk to me, I could not hear over his heavily accented murmurs.\n2. While gorgeous, the bartenders can't be heard, at least by me. And they returned the favor. So I had to point out my items on a menu so I could be understood.\n3. I decided on the spicy lamb rice dish with a side of raita. The raita is first rate but the rice dish... well, the meat bits were good, but the rice overall was bland. The side sauces worked temporarily (by the way, who doesn't have salt and pepper out if you're going with the logic of bland rice?) but I felt near the end overwhelmed by the spice, and not enough flavor. The raita was tastier than the entree. Bad sign.\n4. I didn't want to finish the entree or the raita at the end. I was getting full, but remember my review for Salvation In Noodles when I talked about wanting to have a bigger stomach so I could eat more? I didn't feel that way at all for this place, these dishes, or the service. I think the bartender was disappointed that I wasn't ordering a drink and was confused why I would sit at the bar if I was just going to eat. Look buddy, I was just being polite and following the host's recommendation.\n5. At the host bar, there's easily four or five employees just standing around talking to each other. Which kind of upset me just because no one bothered to walk over to the bar and at least set things up. The menu was set in front of me after I sat down, thirty seconds later. I know that's a picky thing to complain about and it normally wouldn't be a big deal, but personal touch is really missing from this place, which unlike SIN, doesn't have the food to make up for it.\nReasons to go? I dunno, I guess I can tell the bartenders put effort into their cocktails, they have a full bar, it may have been a dud dish I got, it may have been a bad seat, it also may have been the heat of the day that got me a little frustrated since Dishoom wasn't my first choice to eat at. I really wanted curry, and despite a lot of Indian inspired dishes, there was none. Crazy, right?\nSo take my review with a grain of salt. I only wish that they had some to share with me for the dish I got today.",

We were hungry. It was on the way. So we briefly glanced over the menu and decided to give it a go. \nAs soon as the doors opened, we stepped into a futuristic split-level, oddly decorated HUGE space, it felt like a set of Dark City, or The 13th Floor movies. That futuristic 50s, old with modern look. First impression - intriguing!\nWe were promptly ushered to our table. We ordered okra fries and calamari as a starter (both very morish and delicious), followed by gun powder potatoes (nom!), mahi tikka (delicious dry fish, but order a side of something), and a black house dhal (OH-EM-EF-GE, this flavour explosion is a must have).\nThe first time I visited, I was left LITERALLY speechless. The only thing that I was able to put together was profanity and swearing at just how incredibly unbelievable the food was. Honestly, it's witchcraft!\nDespite what the waiter will suggest, DO NOT share the black house dhal! This magical substance can divide friendships and start a war at the table! We were forced to rely on the trusted rock-paper-scissors to decide who was worthy of the last spoonful. I kid you not!\nOther deliciousness:\n- roomali roti - this thing is nearly the size of a beach towel. You could order it instead of rice!\n- chicken berry Britannia biryani - cooked in a dum pukht, where the pot is sealed with dough and content is cooked until it is tender and bursting with flavour\n- chicken ruby murray - award winning! And it got us leaving FAT TIPS!\nBut wait! You're not allowed to leave yet! The desserts! What you gotta do is order the pineapple - black pepper crumble, and combine it with the cinnamon ice cream, ARE YOU INSANE! Oh lawd have mercy!\nOther equally delicious ways to satisfy your sweet tooth are the kulfi ice cream. Have the pistachio one!\nAnd just before you leave, order yourself a chai tea. \nNow that you're ready to do the penguin waddle after consuming what could have fed a small family of 12, welcome to the world of never ever being satisfied with any curry ever again. \nAll in all, we think we are ruined! We have had to set ourselves strict limits and we are not allowing ourselves more than one visit a month. Enter at your own peril!\nOne suggestion - come early if you can. Sometimes you could end up queuing for 3 hours to get a table. Booking is only accepted for groups of 6+",

But they execute well here.  Good somosas, dal to die for, great grilled potatoes and lots of other consistently well-executed food.  \nThe space is enormous so will be interesting to see if as word gets out whether this place will get packed.  Lots of different rooms and options for seating so it makes a big restaurant seem small.\nI do like the background music--was busy Shazaming songs although many of them weren't recognized.",

A friend who travels to India a lot recommended this place.\nWe lucked out and got the last two seats at the upstairs bar, and thank goodness we did because the queue piled up fast. (as a note to those not afraid to wait- we did notice waitresses going out with complimentary shots of sherry). The building itself is beautiful. \nI have an aversion to cumin, and hence the aversion to indian. So I asked which meals didn't include it. not only was i given an answer, but an outlined menu on which meals could be made without so i desired. The food was incredible. I even ordered one dish out of my comfort zone and i think i will crave it when i return to boston. \nMore importantly were the servers though, and the drinks. oh the drinks. They are craftsman behind the bar. such unique spins on common bar drinks. Bay leaf and green tea infused old fashion, with an accompanying history lesson as the backstory to the inspiration of the drink. Everyone we spoke to was so happy, so personable, so knowledgeable and just lovely to be around. \nthis will become a staple place every time i visit London, without question. \nThank you for such a wonderful evening that wont be forgotten.",

When we showed up before 7 there was a lineup all across the front of the restaurant. Although we waited quite a long time, I have never had such a good waiting experience. From drinks provided in the queue, to being moved to the bar as a secondary waiting area, 2 hours actually seemed to go by quickly. The place was well staffed and my friends and I became quite convinced that a girl's sole job was to go around making sure incense was always burning everywhere. Atmosphere was great. The building is massive, it's crazy to think how long we had to wait considering all the tables actually in the restaurant. \nFood and drinks were stunning. We were 6 all sharing so I can't actually confirm everything I tried, but it was all amazing. Will definitely go back.",

I had the mango lassi to drink which was very refreshing and not too sweet. The waiter recommended 3/4 plates per person which was more than enough food and we had enough to take leftovers home. The best dishes were the calamari, the matar paneer and the black daal lentils. Everything was quite spicy so be careful if you don't like spicy food. I was very impressed with the price for the quality of food, nothing we ordered was more than about 8 pounds. Overall great experience and a beautifully designed restaurant.",

They  do make you feel very comfortable while waiting in the drinks area, but probably not worth waiting quite this long.\nThe average age is probably late twenties and there are few people in the mid 40s and above, this is a trendy cool place and is quite noisy as goes with places for such a young crowd. \nThe service levels are high, they really know how to talk about what a serving and whoever runs this place is bang.  However the waiters do have that slight cold edge of being on sales commission.\nIt is not cheap, but not overly expensive.\nAn authentic a big recommendation, that you will enjoy and so will the people you take.",

A replica of a Bombay Cafe, Dishoom represents a Persian influenced restaurant located in Bombay. The inside of Dishoom is certainly elaborate and transports you to another world. Their lamb and chicken is succulent, their prawns are sweet and their salad is fresh. My only criticisms of their food are that they have not allowed the Naan and Roti bread to rise much but instead enabled them to become a little dry with less flavour and whenever they have grilled the food the exteriors have been somewhat burnt and blackened. Both the drinks and desserts hold pleasant surprises and tasteful combinations. The waiter said I was brave to try the Kala Khatta Sharbat which contains kokum fruit juice, chilli, citrus and black salt but actually far from being a decision I would live to regret, as with most of their ventures, they succeed in achieving the combination of interesting yet pleasant. Unfortunately the toilets are buried far away and underground so try not to eat so much that it's hard to move, or drink so much that you would urgently need to relieve yourself. It is remarkable however how uniquely designed even the toilets are to suit the whole image of the restaurant. I am not a fan of smelling incense at every turn but all-round wonderful to behold, Dishoom is top-notch for originality.",

We queued for 1hr 20mins in the pouring rain. But thank you for Dishroom providing us entertainments to keep us amuse in the queue.\nThere are a range of drinks (alcoholic and non-alcholic) to order and all look interesting.  I started off with one of the rose lassis and was hoping to finish the evening with the Bailey Chai which was unfortunately sold out.\nThe food was good but could had been warmer as most of our cooked dishes were luke warm. I enjoyed the okra fries and the Bhel which we started as an appertiser.\nI love the chicken ruby over the chef special (nalli nihari). But both was nice with roti or naan bread. Instead of steamed rice we had the chicken berry britannia which reminded me of another version of fried rice.\nThere are a range of grills and we orderd a few to try. My favourite has to be the Murgh Malai which used chicken thigh that give it that smooth succulent chicken texture.\nDessert we tried the pisatchio kulfi and the pineapple and black pepper crumble. I could not remember tasting or seeing any black pepper. It was like apple crumble but pineapple instead. \nThe service was really slow but it has improved since the soft launch. We struggled to get service and getting a menu or making an order took ages.\nOverall good place and will return!",

We just had a drink (the drink menu was really fun to read!) and got our table sooner than expected. The service continued to be great, with our waiter taking several trips to the kitchen to make sure our meal was free from coriander. And, of course, the food was amazing too. The chicken ruby, black daal and lamb chops were all so flavorful and delicious. We also had roti and some rice, and samosas to start. If I were to repeat this meal I would order these exact same items, maybe with the okra fries which were out.",

My only two even slightly negative comments are: this was not an easy place to find without GPS (the map on their website is NOT clear!), and we waited longer to get the check than we did between ordering and getting our food which is just plain annoying.\nThe FOOD however was divine, absolutely wonderful and inventive. We had fried okra, which my 16 year old daughter discovered was a lot spicier three minutes after the first bite than she reckoned on. I adored it! The okra is not fried whole as I've had it before, but rather in thick slivers and the coating has lime and chili in it. I also really enjoyed the garlic naan, which was offered with or without butter- I went for with of course. Murgh malai (chicken with garlic, ginger, coriander stems and cream) was not spicy but flavorful and enjoyed by my daughter, I had the mango paneer salad, vegetable samosas and bowl of greens. This last was quite yum but had a LOT of sauce...if we had had rice it might have soaked it up but we went with roti and naan so it didn't add much. I was truly looking forward to the dessert called \"kala khatta gola ice\"... but sadly they were out. So they offered us complementary chai and when we said \"no thanks\" ( as we wanted tea and scones at the V&A later) the server surprised us with complementary ice creams! The cinnamon was intensely flavored, not necessarily a bad thing...but the chili ice cream (yup, a slightly orange concoction) was downright sneaky! The first taste was smooth, creamy, slightly sweet and then POW! your tastebuds come under assault from the spicy chili. I managed four bites before putting down my spoon.\nWe went Saturday afternoon around 2:15 and waited less than five minutes to be seated, less than ten before we ordered, less than ten to get our food...but almost twenty to get our bill. I didn't add to the included 12.5% service charge, but I didn't subtract anything either...\nTry this place if you have a varied palate, especially if you like your food spicy!",

First off, their drinks and food are amazing, the Bombay colada is awesome and the brilliant bartenders are excellent at improvising with drinks. Our server, Mat was sassy and fun and recommended delicious food. We order the raita (cucumber yogurt), which perfectly complimented our order of murg malai (grilled chicken with some lovely spices). We also had the best curry ever: chicken ruby! Spicy, but full of flavor that left you wanting more. Also, we had the number one bartenders on the planet. It was me and my two best friends in our party, and bartenders Jan and Pavel took GREAT care of us. I've never had service from a bartender, let alone TWO bartenders, that was this amazing. They made us delicious drinks on the spot. These two gentlemen are definitely the reason I will be back incredibly soon! Thank you Jan and Pavel!! Dishoom was the best dinner my friends and I had in London. The food and service was out of this world. Did I mention they gave us some delicious chai drink while we waited in line? Yeah. This place is awesome. If you go anywhere else, don't expect you'll get as good of service as this place will get you. Especially at the bar!!",

Decent value as well. The desserts - we tried four of them - were just as amazing!",
