The five of us each got our own starter, which we ended up sharing, and then did family style for our main courses.  My favorite was probably the duck vindaloo, though all the curries were fantastic.  Others loved their veg platter.\nCocktails and wine we're also reasonable.  Highly recommend.",

My husband and I continue to rave about this restaurant and both agree that it was easily our favorite meal during our trip.\nThe restaurant is located upstairs in a building with a view of Regent Street. You'll check in with the hostess and take the elevator upstairs, where another host will show you to your table. My husband and I opted for the 3 course menu (appetizer, main course, and dessert). We started off with the mulligatawny soup to start, lamb kashmiri and chicken makhani as our entrees, and galub jamun for dessert. Every single item was OFF. THE. CHAIN. All of our dishes were bursting with flavor and there was a smooth balance of spice and savoriness. The meats and the veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly.\nThe service was very friendly from start to finish. The manager checked up on us, and our server checked up on us frequently, but we never felt like it was overbearing. The hosts were also very friendly to us.\nAs they are well deserving of their Michelin star, I would highly recommend reservations which can be easily made through OpenTable.",

Perched above the bustling Regent Street shopping area, it is one restaurant you should be sure to make a reservation well in advance. \nWe had two amazing starters, two mains, and several sides.  All of it was exceptional.  Some of the best choices were the Chicken Makhani, Pista Ka Salan, broccoli Bezule, Raj kachori, and Murgh Hazrat.\nAll staff, including the manager, were helpful and pleasant.

My mouth may never be the same. \nOk, 1st thing - your entrance into the place is strange. The restaurant is on the second floor, but the hostess stand is on the ground level. You check in, and they send you to an elevator, up to the restaurant. The whole thing gives this Hong Kong Fuey kinda vibe.\nPampered by the red carpet service of 5-Star Indian cuisine in an elegant room overlooking a streetwide parade protesting fox-hunting... well, that's how it was the day we went!!!\nI ordered the \"tasting menu\" or whatever they called it, and each bite was better than the previous. An amazing chicken app and the most astounding prawn ever preceded my main course: a flight of curries.\nAAAAHHHHHHHH!!! (Light shines down from above and I begin weeping).\nSeriously, this food will ruin Indian food for me for years, cuz there's NO WAY it's going to be this good any time soon.

Basically they get very high marks for service, you are served by at least 5 different people, all wanting you to have a great experience.  The manager came over more than once to check in as well.\nI ordered the Raj Kachori, one of their signature appetizers.  It was delightful but quite large and filling.  It featured a crispy phyllo-like bowl with pomegranate and other fruit and nuts.  The dressings had an overpoweringly sweet note to them and almost drowned out the rest of the flavors, but overall the dish was quite good.  There was enough spice in the green dressing to make the dish interesting.  I had never had anything like it before.\nThen on to the spicy chicken thighs which were not very spicy at all, so I was disappointed about that, but the flavors were very good and very classic.  The sauce was quite rich and thick.  I had a side of tempura-fried vegetables which were as spicy as the main dish!  Lots of cumin and coriander. I was stuffed.  All in all a great experience.",

                "description": "A colleague of.mine had recommended this place and so I decided to pay a visit. Reservations are essential here as I discovered that this restaurant had 1 Michelin star to it's name. I had dined at Quillon on a previous London trip so it was nice to have the chance to compare 2 London based Michelin started Indian restaurants.\nIt was fortunate that I had a reservation as the restaurant seats about 40 and there were only a few tables for 1-2. The restaurant was about 30% full when I arrived at 6.30 but it slowly filled up. I was seated promptly after I exited from the elevator on the first floor. The decor of the restaurant is traditional Indian with some modern touches. Definitely more traditional than Quillon.\nI decided to order 2 dishes that were on the original 1926 menu: mulligatawny soup and the lamb briyani. These are quintessential Indian dishes as well. Unlike previous reviews, both dishes did not lack flavor in the least. Certainly the lamb briyani was as spicy as anything I have ever tasted in India, Singapore or Malaysia. The mulligatawny soup had a nice flavor, with good balance and interesting texture from the rice and onions in the soup. The lamb briyani was of a good portion size - enough for 2 to share. The lamb was tender and flavorful and the basmati rice was soft, fluffy and just sufficiently moist without clumping. \nAt the end of the meal, I was too full to have dessert so I had to skip that but there were a number of good options available, both Indian and non-Indian. The restaurant also had a very good wine list and drink list.\nThe service, I must say, was very attentive and warm, in keeping with the Michelin starred restaurants I have been to. I was attended by the main and assistant waiter and the supervisor also checked in twice to see how the food was. \nComparing to Quillon, I would say come to Veerasamy for more traditional Indian style food and surroundings. I would say Quillon is a more contemporary Indian restaurant with a more modern interpretation of Indian cuisine. It's probably more accessible to Western or British palates as well. Both restaurants shined where it came to their drink and wine list and service. Price wise - they're similar though Quillon had smaller portion sizes. If you have the chance and the funds, I would say try both!",

There are in fact so many that it made deciding where to eat a challenge, but after scouring reviews and asking local friends for their opinions, we landed on Veeraswamy.\nYou enter on the ground floor and take an elevator up to the restaurant which features authentic Indian decor. With so many amazing dishes to choose from we asked our friendly, attentive and helpful waiter for advice.\nWe started with the Raj Kachori which was artfully presented as its a large wheat puri filled with goodies. It was delicious. We also had the Angara Chicken Tikka which came with spicy boneless chicken thigh pieces smoked with garam masala and mace; and lastly, we shared the Tandoori green paws which were light and flavorful served in a coriander, mint, chili sauce.\nFor our main dishes we had the Kerala prawn curry. The prawns were served in a coconut curry that was slightly spicy. We also has the Hyderabadi Nimboo Dopiaza which featured a large portion of chicken breasts served in a spicy sauce with lim, chili and cumin; and lastly, we had the Hyderabadi Lamb Biryani which has subtly spiced and has apparently been on the menu since 1926.\nAll of the dishes were delicious and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would change is to order less chicken dishes and one less appetizer.  The restaurant met my high expectations and I would definitely go back.",

And the restaurant is beautiful and well-ventilated so we didn't come out smelling like curry.  \nAfter some hemming and hawing on our part, I decided on the pear and cinnamon martini and my friend got the guava and passion fruit martini.  Neither of us particularly enjoyed our drinks.\nI started with the raj kochuri, which V describes as a \"large wheat puri filled with goodies, splashed with chutneys.\"  I had never had anything quite like it before and thought it was pretty good.  I had a taste of the sholay chicken and it was very flavorful.\nMy entree was the lamb shank and it came out looking delicious and smelling wonderful.  But I took my first bite and realized that it lacked seasoning -- such a shame.  My friend actually asked the server to bring salt, and that is a first at an Indian restaurant.\nI had the caramelized banana kulfir dessert and it was pretty good.  But I'm not spending 40+ pounds on lunch for \"pretty good.\"",

It was more spacious than we expected and they also looked to have a private room upstairs.\nThe chicken lollipops were juicy and wonderful served on chicken bones. The chicken / lamb kebaps were just okay. We loved the chicken tikka and  the spicy prawn curry too! Great flavors and giant fresh prawns!!",

                "description": "They are definitely feelin' themselves. Don't be a fool and buy the hype. Your money is better spent at Roti Chai (downstairs dining area). It took them 30 min, at least, to serve us water. When we asked the waitress about it, she blamed it on the bus boy. The food was decent, but not worth the 200 bucks we spent there. I ordered the homemade organic paneer, layered with green herbs and green mango, and finished off with nutmeg and cardamom. Very good. My cocktail was decent, but still pretty sweet (although the waitress smirked when I asked for it not to be too sweet, and said, \"Oh no, it's not sweet at all\"). Wrong. I had the veggie crescent platter, and the only standout was the paneer tikka masala. Even then, it wasn't nearly as good as the veggie dishes we had the previous night at Roti Chai.\nOne last thing, we asked for naan to accompany our takeaway (we figured we should take our leftovers for a late night snack, since we'd forked over $200 for them). The waitress seriously went into a 5 minute explanation about how it would taste chewy if we reheated it later and she didn't recommend it. Lame. Give us what we ordered, we are paying for it.\nShe then brought the naan out 10 minutes later, on a plate, as if we were going to eat it there. She explained, \"I brought it out like this because the chef gets upset if people order takeaway, but I can pack it now bc it's been served\". WTF. Who says that? Doesn't the client always come first?\nShe never came back to give us our check. We had to ask the bus boy for it, so that we could GTFO.\nSuck it, Veeraswamy.",

                "description": "What an incredible disappointment.\nThis was possibly the most pompous and underwhelming restaurant to which I've ever been.  \nThe problems started with our cocktails, which even after requesting they not be made sweet, came out as if they were made with tablespoons of sugar.  Gross.  The waitress' condescension began here, by the way, with her arrogant proclamation (when we ordered) that the drinks were not made anyway but perfectly.  Yeah, whatever. They tasted like drinks teenagers would drink.  Amateurish.\nOur appetizers were a mixed affair.  The herb paneer was excellent; the softest cheese scented with nutmeg and cardamom.  The crab cake however was dry and flavorless, it tasted like chewing seafood sandpaper.  How do you screw up a crab cake?\nAt this point, 20 mins later, still no water as requested when we ordered our drinks.\nOur entrees arrive.  Again, a mixed affair.  The chicken tikka was good, not great; a solid blend of sweet and smoky spices.  The saag however was dismal, it tasted like spinach run through a blender and slopped on a plate without any seasoning. It was inedible.  My wife's veggie platter was so-so, a couple dishes were good, the aubergine was poor.   \nBut at least our water now had arrived! Small victory.  But at the end of our meal pretty much, accompanied by an apology from our waitress who blamed the bar. For the 30 min delay -for water.  Nice.\nLast, and this would fall under the insult to injury category, we asked for the remaining food to be packed to go except for the spinach and aubergine, and requested the addition of a naan. I then had to hear a lecture on how naan is not meant to be taken away and how would it rot in daylight or to another's touch outside the restaurant and (this part is no exaggeration) the chef gets very mad if patrons do takeaway. \nAre you fucking kidding me? I couldn't believe how arrogant and pompous this waitress was.  Who cares what the fucking chef thinks, it's a piece of naan! \nPlease pass this on to the chef and to the owner: if the food was as made carefully and service as half as polished as you manicure your inflated sense of ego, you'd be getting more than 1 star.  And put a Kevlar vest around the chef's delicate heart and tell them the spinach and crab cake sucked ass. \nSo many other places we've been to like Roti Chai and Dishoom outclass this place in terms of food quality and service, skip this place and spend your money elsewhere.  What a waste of time, money, and patience.",

                "description": "I was on a business trip in London this past May and had a friend come visit me during the second week I was there. The one thing we really wanted to eat was good Indian food. I had gotten recommendations from a few coworkers, both of which recommended Amaya, a sister restaurant to Veeraswamy, which was actually recommended to my friend by someone else.\nWe arrived at Veeraswamy at approximately 7:30 PM on Wednesday night, sans reservation. To our surprise, there were no tables available and the earliest reservation we could make was for 9:30. We decided to put our name down and and go grab some drinks at a nearby pub. The restaurant is in a nice area of the city, near lots of shops (which were unfortunately closed by that time of the evening) and restaurants, so we didn't have to go far to find another place to hang out. After having a couple of drinks, we decided to go back to the restaurant at around 8:45. We were able to wait in their upstairs lounge, which was actually just a few small tables near a bench, until our table was ready. We each ordered a glass of wine which was brought to us promptly. Luckily for us, coming back early was a good choice because we were seated about 5 minutes later! \nThe restaurant was beautifully decorated and had a vibrant color scheme that reminded me a lot of India (I'm part Indian). We studied the menu after being seated and finally decided what we wanted. Our waiter took our order and we anxiously awaited for our dishes to arrive. The service was great throughout the night, even though the restaurant was filled to capacity when we sat down to eat. We started our meal with the green herb paneer tikka, which was made up of homemade paneer with various herbs and spices. The paneer was the right consistency and went perfectly with the herbs. For our main course, we ordered the Kerala prawn curry and the tandoori raan. The prawn curry was full of flavor and had the right amount of spice. I had never had a Kerala style curry before, but it's made with coconut milk and therefore reminded me of a Thai red curry more than a traditional Indian curry. The tandoori raan was probably our favorite dish, which was a slow cooked lamb shank in a garam masala infused cashew sauce. The meat was tender and fell apart easily. The sauce was incredible - I would have drunk it if that was socially acceptable. Instead, I resorted to pouring it over my rice. We also ordered naan and some saag (an Indian creamed spinach of sorts) to accompany our meal, both which were also very good. I think we forced ourselves to finish all the food we ordered, despite being full, because it was that amazing. We couldn't not have dessert, so we order the gulab jamun, which is a traditional Indian milk-based dessert. The dessert came with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. It was very good, but I think I prefer the more traditional version of the dessert served in most Indian restaurants. \nIf I am ever back in London, I would not hesitate to visit Veeraswamy again (or maybe try one of its sister restaurants). This really was a dinner to remember!",

Chicken tikka was very tender and well spiced without going overboard. Duck was also well marinated and sliced in more gentle manner however the meat want too tender as of it was a bit over cooked. Halibut was very good. The spice was not too curried but more fragrant. The lamb chop was good but I was more amazed by the squash underneath. Very tender and flavorful. Kudos to the chef and the good service by the staff. Still it's a bit over priced for me, although considering the location and history it might make sense.",

It pays to talk to your neighbors at the bar.  I have eaten here twice and both experiences were great. Their cocktails are amazing-the combination of flavors and aromatics cannot be duplicated. I seem to always order lobster when I dine at Indian places in London.  They just know how to cook lobster like no other group!  It's located close to many theaters. Reservations are a must here.",

Where the service itself is ok, but the food quality, that is got, does not really match the price given. I don't understand why you order Indian food and have to order the rise or nan bread in addition. At least a portion of rise should come with the food.\nSo after all you feel a little cheated, though the quality is ok.\nThe overall feeling in the restaurant is very good.",

                "description": "We did quite a bit of research and wanted to go to an Indian restaurant with some history in London. This certainly fit the bill. It also recently received a Michelin star. Coming from a place in the US that is chock full of good Indian options (SE Michigan), I had high hopes for the city that my British friends claim is the \"best place for Indian in the world\". The place is very classy, with a nice address in Piccadilly Circus. The interior decor is rich with hints of Indian accents. We ordered a number of items from the menu including the mango avocado salad, the crab ginger soup, the vegetarian platter, and the shrimp curry. I asked if they had paratha, which they did not. Fine, we'll have the roti. The roti featured exactly one piece for 5 pounds. I thought we'd have at least two pieces for that price! Our appetizers were good, but the crab was non-existant in the crab ginger soup. It was mostly just ginger soup with a few tiny scraps of crab meat. The veggie appetizer came in bowls that yielded a spoonful or two of food. The spinach ball dish in the platter with almond dressing was most interesting, but gone in two bites. The shrimp curry was fine, but nothing memorable. At the end, with no alcohol, our tab for two was 125 pounds. I could eat for a week of Indian food for that. Had it been great, I would have been able to justify the price. But the miserly portions, unremarkable dishes, combined with the long wait between the appetizer and mains, makes this s a first and last visit for us.",

The service was impeccable, and the tasting menu had items from various Indian culinary backgrounds, with paired wines.  Overall...unbelievable!\nOf the tasting menu, the two standouts were the pineapple curry -- chunks of pineapple in warm yogurt gravy with bits of chili, fried mustard seed, and fried curry leaves.  OMG -- amazing.  Single best moment of my meal.  In fact, I told the people serving me that I was upset that I left that dish for the last!  The second dish -- the coconut creme brulee.  Again, OMG.  Creme brulee crust was perfect, and the custard itself had a good balance of sweet goodness with the savory coconut.\nEvery aspect of the operation, from the person greeting you at the door, to the person taking you to your seat, to the servers taking care of you, all the way to the food prepared and presented is unified under a banner of high standards and quality.  That's why Veeraswamy gets five stars in my book.  Thank you for setting the bar high for standards and quality, and meeting them Veeraswamy!  \nWill I be back?  But of course.  Next time, I'm getting a larger order of that pineapple curry.  Thank you for the experience, Veeraswamy!",

It is definitely a special night out, as the prices are not cheap, but that will not stop me from going back again.\nWe started with a cocktail (prosecco for me and a martini for my husband) and then split a bottle of wine for dinner.\nFor an appetizer, we split the Raj Kachori that was described as \"street food filled with goodies\" -and wow, it was filled with deliciousness - it was a hard shell with some yogurt, curry and garnished with pomegranate seeds - I am not doing this plate justice - just get it!\nWe each got an entrÃ©e - my husband chose the duck and I went with the Lamb shank.  Both we delicious and we had the Pineapple Curry as a side - which really cooled down my mouth after the duck which was a little spicy.  The lamb shank was perfectly braised and fell off the bone just as the menu said.\nWe finished the meal by splitting a dessert -it was the first one listed on the menu and didn't have a great description - but when we asked the waitress what it was -  she said it was a warm donut filled with sugar - so we immediately chose that and did not regret it.\nService was fantastic with multiple wait staff helping you and the atmosphere was relaxed yet a little fancy.  (We wore jeans, nice shoes and sweaters for a Monday night - if I went during the weekend, I probably would get dressed up a little more. ) \nAll in all - the above meal was $270 (USD) but I think totally worth it - -",

I had a gorgeously presented Coconut Chicken dish for my main, prepared with a spicy korma-esque sauce and garnished with a spicy chilli on top. With a generous bread basket on the side, I found that even absent sides, I was more than stuffed by the end and even passed on dessert. For vegetarians, the Crescent Platter offers a plethora of choices, though the Daal dish stood out compared to the others. In the opinion of my wife (who is a veggie), these were some of the very best lentils in London.\nThe quality and location come with a price tag, and while not shocked by the total of our meal - it was relatively punchy: 10-15 GBP for starters, 20-35 GBP for mains, with sides also running closer to 10 GBP than to 5. Throw in a few drinks, and the bill can start to add up pretty quickly...",

It's owned by the same people as my favorite Indian restaurant, Chutney Mary.\nWhereas Chutney Mary strikes you with its creativity, Veeraswamy is more traditional, but it has the same high quality ingredients, flawless consistency and tasty flavors as its sister restaurants.\n1) Start with the tandoor.  I typically have one of 3 starters - the Tandoori Red Snapper, the tandoori shrimp (which has a green spice but I don't know what it's called), and the lamb seekh kebab.  All of them are superb.  The tandoori Red Snapper is my favorite.  Its done just right.   Crispy at the edges, very soft on the inside, and the black pepper spices are spicy enough to be tasty but you can still taste the freshness of the snapper.\n2) There are so many great curries here.  You can't go wrong.   My fvaorites are the Kashmiri Rogan Josh, the Lobster Malabar, and the Chicken Tikka masala.\n3) You can order vegetarian dishes by the half portion here - which is great because you can have a good variety of sides at the table.  I like the paneer saag, the eggplants, and the dal.\n4) The best desert is the black gulab jamun served in rose sauce with ice-cream.  I love that dish.  The chocolate kulfi is great in concept but no great in reality.\n5) Really nice space.  Classy upscale decor.  View of Regent's street which is nice in December.  Excellent service.",

The scents were amazing and we were ready for a fantastic meal and experience. We were disappointed with both. Our server was cold and not attentive. She was on the sarcastic side and treated us like the tourists we were. Tourists who love London! She was neither British nor Indian and seemed to be miserable. That is unfortunate for her customers who spend high $$$ at Veeraswamy for food we could get in Central Square in Cambridge, MA or at a food truck in Portland, OR. Overpriced. Limited menu. Big disappointment.",

                "description": "The second pillar in the Holy Trinity of Indian food in London (see my Amaya review).\nVeeraswamy would be my go-to choice of the three higher end Masala Zone restaurants (Amaya and Chutney Mary being the other two to choose from).  It is slightly less expensive than Amaya, making it a bit more attainable for an evening out.\nThe general decor and ambiance of Veeraswamy is gorgeous.  Outstanding wait staff service.  Fantastic food.  \nIt is really difficult to find a quality restaurant like this in its location near Picadilly Circus.  Veeraswamy is a great option for a classy dinner before heading out to the theater or just going out in that area.\nI've had multiple fish dishes, octopus, shrimp curry, multiple biriyanis, and more and they've all been phenomenal.  They have a great wine menu as well, which pairs excellently with any of their entrees.  Their custom cocktails are also quite delicious (there was some sort of spicy martini I tried last time that was wonderful).\nThe waiters are always incredibly helpful in determining the appropriate meal size and selection.  They are also very knowledgable about their wine and cocktail list to suggest pairings.  They managed to make each of my three dining experiences there equally unique and enjoyable.\nI could not recommend Veeraswamy any more strongly!  Great for a date night out, group or business dinner, or any nice occassion, really.\n**same note as my Amaya review - check out the Masala Zone website for discounts, promotions or specials before you go!",

Very little Indian food aroma that lingers in your hair long after the foods gone.\n2. Fresh ingredients , no BS recipes or silly names for everyday dishes, good selection representing various Indian cuisines\n3. Interesting artwork and pictures on wall, informal atmosphere\n4. Helpful ,polite well trained staff.\n5. Its not cheap, but so worth it.\nThanks Veeraswamy for a memorable London evening..:):)",

But I'd say the food lets it down somewhat. It's not the most expensive but it's pricey enough to expect something a little bit better than what I got.\nI was in a big group and it was a Tue evening. We ordered a lot of finger food starters, chicken wings and the like. All overdone and no care taken over them at all. The accompanying sauces weren't in the slightest bit vibrant or surprising. When I eat Indian I want something vibrant and surprising.\nMy duck masala main course was again perfectly edible but carelessly done. Very overdone and with a ubiquitous masala sauce. I tried two of my guests' food. The lobster curry was a little more delicate without being amazing in any way.\nI would expect this sort of food in a decent high street curry house. But the prices are far greater than that so you're paying for the area and the room inside which is a shame when there's so much great indian food around at the moment. I'm lucky enough to live near Indian Zing in Hammersmith and the food there knocks the food here into a cocked hat at a much much fairer price.",

                "description": "Solid Indian restaurant in London but probably not worth the \"1st Indian Restaurant in London\" premium you have to fork over. After all, first isn't necessarily the best.\n I went to Veeraswamy for a business dinner not knowing the history of it. The waitstaff was extremely attentive and the decor was what you would have expected of a high-end Indian place.\nFor appetizers, we split the Raj Puri (which was spot on delicious - perfectly crispy on the outside with the right amounts of creme and sauces inside - I could eat 3 of these just for my main course)  and the Sagg Panner (2 triangle chunks of paneer with a thin layer of sagg (spinach) inside. Quite uninspiring and I wouldn't get it again.\nFor my main course, I had the vegetarian sampler - which included dal (lentils), kofta (ball of ground chickpeas), two other dishes that I don't remember and I didn't really care for. The dal and the kofta were delicious! I didn't care for the other two. We also had a side of sagg, which normal sagg with tons of garlic but nothing unique.  Rice and naan were ordered separately on the side, which is annoying.\nMy dessert was a banana kulfi (think banana ice cream). It was the way Kulfi was supposed to be - mildly sweet and fragrant with all the Indian spices. If only they could have had Saffron Kulfi, I would have been in paradise. We also tried a Black Jaman. That was presented rather peculiarly but definitely satisfies any sweet tooth you may have.\nI had Cobra beer (just one), and the wait-staff continually tried to push more on me. Quite annoying.  The beer selection was limited, with only Cobra and no Kingfisher..\nOverall, Veeraswamy was nice to try out and enjoyable since I wasn't paying, but if I did pay, I'd pick something more affordable for the same quality of food. Total bill, including gratuity, was about Â£200 for a group of 3.",

There are only a few points that have detracted it from being a five star recommendation. \nOur table decided to go for the taster menu. All in all, I think when you're in a large group of people it's a great idea. We had two rounds of starters that where ok but not impressive followed by a strong entourage of curries of both pork and lamb and a very light dessert. The curries where very much traditional and tasty. Highly recommended. \nA large part of the reason why they don't have the fifth star was the bad service. We waited quite a bit of time between starters and drinks and desserts took a while to arrive as well. Additionally there was quite a bit of perceived hostility between our waiters which detracted from the experience. That coupled with the weak starters and the cotton candy flavored lychee ice tea make this a good restaurant to go to, just slightly overpriced for it's quality.",

I am only giving it 3 stars because of its prices (I would like to give a 3.5 star rating if that was possible). \nThe ambiance is wonderful and the food is quite good. \nBut the food isn't in the creative/fusion category, and the restaurant prides itself as traditional. As a traditional fare, it just isn't that interesting or traditional. It tries to be chic and refined, but yet the food just isn't that special or exceptional to warrant the price.  You are paying for the ambiance.  The appetisers are more refined though, which I would recommend. I almost would argue having a full meal based on the appetisers as they have more subtleties and complexities that I would pay for. \nFor the traditional curry and grill items, you can do better at many other places for half the prices and bigger portion. Punjab (Covent Garden) and Tiger Spices (Soho) are both cheaper and have more flavorful food with big curry kicks. \nFor a glass of wine, a starter, two curries (portions are small and don't have much sauces) and a dessert, you are looking at about 45-50 quids.",

All regions of India are covered here, including some that are rarely prepared outside of the country itself. The Nizami Murgh that was recommended to me (chicken breast and koftas with pine nut, lemon and rose petal) was heavenly and there are coastal dishes such as Mussels Moilee which are firm favourites. \nIf you want to eat in an opulent setting (gilded ceilings and chandeliers), and to experience real Indian cuisine it may cost you around Â£50 all in all but is an experience you won't soon forget.",

It feels traditional, yet modern at the same time.  The designer that did the lighting was very creative as the mood set by the lights was great.\nThe waitress that takes care of drinks was very attentive!  She recommended good drinks and even steered us away from the ones she didn't like.  She had a quick smile and made you feel welcome.\nThe waiter, the one who took our food order, wasn't so great.  No hello, or anything, just a, you ready to order?  He seemed to be in a hurry, but you know what?  With these prices, calm the f down.  At least a \"hello, welcome\" type of thing.\nLook, the food was ridiculous.  I wish I remember what we had as an appetizer, but it ranks up there as one of the best things either of us have ever had.  The flavor explodes in your mouth.  It's like your tongue discovered all of its taste buds at the same time.  Spicy, but never too spicy.  It was some kind of a chicken kebab that we ordered as an appetizer, but I'll get it as the main dish next time.  The waiter, his only saving grace, quickly and nervously recommended this.  I personally think that he just did this because it was first on the list.  I kind of wanted to punch him.\nTry the mixed drinks.  They were excellent.  Made in a way that you can't taste the alcohol, but if you drink enough, you'll know that it's in there.\nDessert was nothing to write about.  I'll pass next time.\nThe waiter never came around to see how we were doing or anything like that.  Just when it was time to pay.  \nWhen we were walking out we discovered that our Indian hostess was actually Brazilian.  First of all, Brazilians are everywhere in London and now they even work in Indian restaurants passing themselves off as Indian!!!  I love it.\nThere is a Russian guy dressed like an Indian guard of some kind outside.  He said that they have their own cabs.  I got into the cab and the driver started to put our address in his GPS.  Um, no.  When I got out, they tried to talk me into taking one of their cars until I discovered they charge 20 pounds flat fee.  This is a robbery and I personally think that this is something that the Russian guy has going on the side.  \nWe will 100% be back.  Great decor, amazing food and drinks, but shitty waiter.

Where does a  business get off arguing with the customer? Horrible. Will never go back and would recommend not to waste your money on this. There are too many other good indian restaurants in London to pay for this overpriced pompous food.\nAlso, may want to make sure your dishes are clean. What a waste of money.",

But I have to say that this place is AMAZING. The food was cheap enough considering all that we got.  I had the lamp binary? Is that how its spelled? It was amazing. There were lots of vegetarian options for my friend.\nThe server was a bit awkward about everything. It was fine though. He didnt speak great english, but he was nice. If I was a resident in London, I would certainly go back this week. But since I was just visiting from San Diego, it probably be a while before i go back :/",

It is not really a place for kids but they did make some recommendations that were not too spicy for her as well as a yummy drink recommendation too. That drink was a rose water lemonade drink that she and I both LOVED!\nThe decor is absolutely beautiful with colorful lamps and comfortable seating. \nWe had a chicken wing appetizer which was one of the most flavorful dishes I've ever had. We also had a tandoori chicken which was so tender and smoky. My husband ate a fantastic chicken vindaloo which he loved, although I believe he would have liked it spicier. I thought it was perfect.\nThe service was good but they mixed up our teas - they said the jasmine tea was the black tea and the black tea was the jasmine tea. We thought that was extremely odd for them not to know the teas and that we had to tell them the difference. But not a big deal.\nOverall, we loved it.",

                "description": "This is not your run of the mill Brick Lane curry house.  Consider this the jewel in the crown of Indian restaurants in London!\nI made it a point to seek out Veeraswamy on my most recent vacation to London.  According to their website, they are the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in the UK.  All those years of being in business has added up to pure perfection!\nThe first thing that grabbed my attention when I arrived is the amazing decor...purple accents everywhere, beautiful jewel tone lanterns hanging all about, soothing dim lighting, the wall of candles in the back of the room.  I immediately felt at home here.  We were seated right by a window, which not only afforded us a great view of Regent street below, but a great view of the beautiful dining room we were in.\nThe service is impeccable!  The staff is extremely welcoming, polished and professional.  The timing of the service for each course of our meal was perfect.  \nThe food is absolutely the best Indian food I've ever had anywhere (my husband and I both love Indian food and eat it at least once a week, so we've been to many Indian restaurants around the world).  I would compare the quality of the food to what you would get at Tabla in NYC, just that here at Veeraswamy, you are getting more traditional Indian fare, compared to the Indian fusion you get at Tabla.  Every course was delicious, spicy and flavorful.  The portions are just right as well - nothing huge and overwhelming.  \nVeeraswamy offers a great selection of wines (as well as beers and cocktails) to pair with your meal.  \nThis place is by no means reasonable - but I can assure you, it's worth the splurge.  I'm already dreaming of my next meal here, just as soon as I can get back to London!",

                "description": "Welcome to the most expensive curry house on the whole planet. I first tried it in the seventies when the restaurant was owned by an Englishman by the name of Edwin Palmer. He grew up in Hyderabad in India. He also marketed a selection of jarred curry products under the name of E.P. Veeraswamy. \nWhat took me aback, like a dumb slapstick comedy, was being greeted at the elevator by a man dressed as a Hunzar, including a foot high cloth fin coming out of his hat, who saluted my date and I like we were four star generals. To this very day, it gives me a good laugh. The food was boringly mild and tasteless. The price was through the stratosphere.\nNew owners ditched the fake Hunzar in the elevator and greatly improved the quality of their menu. The food is excellent but incredibly London England style. As long as you are not looking for authentic and you want to stay close to the theatre district, Piccadilly Circus, or the West End you cannot go wrong on quality. Just bring a wheel barrow load full of money. \nI give it four stars for the food but two stars for the price, making a three. It is only a short ride on the tube to Queensway where you will find more authentic food with prices where you will only need a fistful of money and can leave the wheel barrow in your hotel safe. A better than five star Indo-Pakistani restaurant is Shezan in Knightsbridge for those with six figure incomes. The food is authentic Punjabi and Northwest Frontier.\nA multi course lunch at Veeraswamy for two will cost about 80 to 100 pounds and dinner about 120 to 150 pounds; more if you include a bottle of Champagne which I believe is the perfect wine match for Indian style food. Red wines clash, an Australian Shiraz the least, and the food overpowers most white wines except for a Gewurztraminer which can cost more that a magnum of bubbly. A glass of cold lager is even better and so much easier on the pocketbook.\nIf you want authentic Amritsar Punjabi style, take the train to Southall from Paddington Station. It is a 30 minute ride and you will enjoy fabulous Masalas, Seekh Kebabs, naan, tikkas etc. for a fraction of the price and oh so much better. Dress casual for Southall and fancy for Veeraswamy.",

The food was beautifully presented and flavorful without being overpowering. We did the tasting menu. It was a great way to get to sample the most popular dishes. If you want an upscale Indian dining experience, this is the place!

                "description": "My boyfriend is an indian food fanatic. If he could, I think he would eat Indian food 3 times a day, seven days a week, and still never get bored.\n Over the past three years of our relationship, we have been everywhere from traditional restaurants in Cambridge, York and Brick Lane, \"modern\" indians like Bombay Bicycle Club, Masala Zone and Imli, and \"upmarket\" joints like Amaya.\n So, when I decided that an Indian tasting menu would be the perfect birthday present for him, I knew I needed somewhere special.\n And that place was Veeraswamy.\n As previous reviewers have mentioned, Veeraswamy is the oldest running Indian restaurant in London, which gives the place a sense of history. This is evident from the turbans hanging on the walls: gifts from visiting Maharajahs.\n I booked the table weeks in advance and had 1 very annoying request: I wanted the tasting menu for both of us, but I don't eat red meat - would it be possible to do one veggie?\n Now, any foodie worth their salt will know that the rule is always the same: the tasting menu has to be ordered by the whole table.\n Not so at Veeraswamy. The restaurant was delightfully accomodating, not only over the phone, but in person too.\n I can honestly say that the restaurant has the nicest, most welcoming staff I have ever come across. The gentleman who led us to the table reassured me that the chef is well aware of my request, but then reappeared a few minutes later to say, \"The chef is worried that you're only having vegetables in your meal - he would like to know if you'd like some prawns with your main course?\" Could they get any nicer?\n I am still salivating over my starter: Raj kachori (a large crisp puri filled with lentils, tamarind chutney and yoghurt). This was beautifully presented with little pomegranate jewels, and the taste was extraordinary. And boy, am I glad I ordered the prawns: the giant green prawn was a dry dish with an intense flavour which followed perfectly on from my light starter. Alongside a keralan chicken curry (which I also tried) and a lamb curry (which I didn't), my boyfriend was in heaven.\n The mango sorbet was the perfect end to the meal, but this was topped (if possible) when they brought out another tart, dark chocolate sorbet with a candle in it - completely out of the restaurant's own impetus - which made my night.\n Yes, it's not exactly street food prices, but then it's not exactly your average Indian. It's special, and you pay for what you get - wonderful staff, delicious food and a colourful, romantic atmosphere right in the heart of London.",

                "description": "At the time I ate here, I hadn't been to India yet and understandably, the food I had in Delhi was better than the food I had here. However, up until I ate here, I had never really liked Indian food. I hadn't written it off and for that reason, I was down for eating here when it was suggested.\nI heard the stories of how this is the oldest Indian restaurant in the UK and how tons of famous folks eat here. That doesn't necessary make it good by default, but with the many choices of decent Indian food in London, I think it does mean something that the restaurant has been in business for so long. Places go out of business regularly, especially in these times.\nNow onto the food. We had quite a spread because a) I didn't know what I wanted and b) I was eating with two people (my father (travels to India at least 10 times a year) and an Indian) who couldn't settle on one thing to get. I have to say that I loved the tandoori chicken--it melted in my mouth and is to die for. Everything we had was good, down to the Indian ice cream. The service was good too. They were patient as we figured out what we wanted and were always nearby if we needed anything. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the decor; it's gorgeous. Glass chandeliers, modern furniture, peaceful ambiance. You'd never guess that the restaurant was so old based solely on the decoration. \nI go to London fairly regularly and though this place is pricey, I will definitely go back!",

I didn't see butter chicken or masala on the menu and was worried but the waiter helped choose our dishes.  I'm not a huge fan of fish but the fish wrapped in banana leaves was divine.  There was a sweet pomegranate dip in a crispy bread bowl that was to die for.  Nothing at home can compare to this place and I live in an area that is highly populated with Indians.  Indian restaurants are around every corner.  The only place that is almost at the same level is Rasika in DC, which doesn't fill in the empty longing for London cuisine.",

                "description": "It seems to me that the staff at Veeraswamy believe that they can rest easy on the reputation of being the \"oldest Indian restaurant\" in London, as well a star in the constellation of London's most popular (and expensive) Indian restaurants. However, our waitress was lackadaisical, slow, snobbish, and flippantly rude. And when I say \"slow\", I mean excruciatingly slow with suggestions like \"I'm sure you want to wait until the next course.\" Well, actually, no. I don't want to wait 15-25 minutes between each course.  It cast a pall over the lovely dishes - which were, indeed, fine - but certainly not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination. The lamb knuckles were delicious and tender. The chicken in the chicken curry, however, was tough. Great naan. Mediocre rice. The best thing was their interpretation of \"street food\" chaat - which was fantastic. We had the tasting menu - 75 pounds with wine per person. After cocktails and the chaat (which we ordered separately) it's a pretty hefty price to pay (about 200 pounds - $320 or so) for the \"thanks\" that she tossed off with a shrug of her shoulders. She seemed offended that we didn't want coffee or tea. How barbaric of us. I don't recommend this restaurant - you're much better off at a smaller, family-run place - where the quality of food will be very similar and with a staff who is glad to serve you.",

Although we had a reservation at 5:30 on Saturday 4th Jan we decided to not dine there solely based on the level of service provided. We reached Veeraswamy at 5:20 and were told by the maÃ®tre d' to wait outside on the street till the restaurant opened. When asked whether we could wait at the long seating area where a couple was already waiting, we were told that the area would get crowded although the sofa at the waiting area could seat at least 5 more. We went down and immediately after another couple walked up. We waited to see whether they would be told the same. But to our surprise they were not asked to wait on the streets as they never walked back out. When we went back to ask about that the maÃ®tre d' acted as if he was not sure what we were talking about. We decided at that point not to dine there and went somewhere else. To me this is a first and quite discriminating and in most parts of the world would be considered racist as we were the only people of Indian origin who were waiting at that point of time. I was also surprised that an establishment of such stature have such disappointing service. To be fair we were contacted after half an hour but by that point it honestly felt because they had an empty table left. The food may be fantastic but if the service is this bad I honestly can't recommend it to anyone.",

Purely because V iis the oldest restaurant meant I had to add it to my list along with the spurious Top 10s etc.\n I knew it was expensive so had waited for my 50th birthday to justify dragging the family 120 miles south for a curry.\n Every restaurant will have mixed reviews, why? The decor is impressive but I have seen better. Whether the the food is poor, good or excellent is your opinion, I think this is often down to people not really knowing what they've actually ordered. Indian, Pakistani and the more common Bangladeshi restaurants have their own characteristics. \nMy tip for a good meal is take your time, talk to the waiter and question the menu and (if in doubt) make sure you know exactly what your getting, it's your money. One man's bhuna is another man's mulligatawny.\n My experience was overall very good but it I thought it wasn't worth the money although my wife & kids did.

Indeed, National Geographic reckons Veeraswamy is among the ten best destination and special restaurants in the world. If you've got the cash, love Indian cuisine and fancy a superb view over Regent Street, I highly recommend a visit.\n Menu highlights include a starter course of irresistibly crisp green leaf and okra bhajias (whole okra and leaves of fenugreek, ruby chard and mint coated in a light rice flour batter, Â£9) with a particularly creamy coriander and mint sauce and a tangy tamarind chutney with pomegranate seeds. For the main course, consider the Sholay chicken tikka smoked with garam masala (Â£9 as a starter, Â£18 as a main). Charred right bits of especially tender chicken with a bit of kick, I'd definitely choose that dish again. Another item I'd certainly be keen to enjoy again is the side dish of fresh pineapple curry (pineapple, curry, mustard and green chilli, Â£9). Unusually savoury, I'd go back for it alone. Veeraswamy's flaky on the outside/fluffy on the inside layered naan (Â£3.35) are delectable, while kaala jaam (large black gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream, Â£6.75) for puds ends any Indian feast on a moreish note.\n Right off Regent Street (the restaurants' first floor dining room hovers above it), with an ethnic without being kitsch atmosphere, incredibly attentive service, fascinating history and an exceptionally tasty menu: Veerswamy is an elegant restaurant serving delectable Indian cuisine.",

I was here in London for the first time and put this on my list of things to do.  \nThe food is delicious, the service is impeccable, and most of all, the ambiance and decor is absolutely awesome.   \nAs others have said, come here ready to spend some dough but rest assured you won't be disappointed.",

The service was attentive without being intrusive. The food was very good, although portions were small considering the prices, but that's Regent Street for you I suppose. \nWe enjoyed our meal, but were starving first the next morning. I am disappointed to say that it didn't quite meet my expectations having dined there regulary 'some' years ago.",

Trying to find this place is a bit confusing, since the entry is small and in an alley and the actual restaurant is upstairs.  They food was great! Definitely modernization has updated their dinning room and created a chic ambiance.  All together this was a great stop on our European vacation.",
