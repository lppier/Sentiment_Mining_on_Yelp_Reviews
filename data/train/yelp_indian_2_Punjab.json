We weren't sure what we wanted to order so they helped us each make decisions based on what we have liked in the past. I loved the butter chicken, two in our group got vegetarian dishes and loved them as well. The portions were also the perfect size, not too much and not too little.\nAs a side note, you should read the fine print on the menu, it had us cracking up. Start with reading the details under Garlic Naan.",

The place is very small and cramped, and the service was pretty poor. Even in the tiny place, the server didn't make eye contact and we had to flag him down several times. When the server did make his way to us, he was very bent on overselling dishes to us and had us over order, honestly. \nThe food was very average. Other than the kaddu poori, which made me think about home (which was something we grew up eating), everything else was sub par. The naan/ roti was too hard and the Kadhai chicken was not great The daal was also very bland.\nI don't know if we came at an off time, but our experience was sub par and I won't recommend it/ come back again.",

We were there pretty early (maybe 6ish?) on a random Tuesday, and had no issues getting a table for two as walk-ins, but they were steadily busy so your mileage may vary. \nService was proper; friendly enough and efficient, and both our beverages and our food came out remarkably quickly. Additionally, we had no issues getting the check when we were ready to depart, which is a change of pace from most of continental Europe.\nMy colleague's Butter Chicken was excellent; flavorful and a touch spicy (or perhaps I've been eating bland German food for too long). Definitely a solid choice. However, we both agreed that the Pudina Ghosht (a mint lamb curry) was the real winner of the meal. I don't think I've ever had a mint curry before, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. Spicy and packed with herbal flavors, but without the sometimes overpowering richness that comes from some of the more common curries (at least those that are common in the US). Absolutely fantastic!\nOne tip: the meals don't generally come with rice or naan, so make sure to order a side of them if you want them!",

The cauliflower and potatoes were cooked and flavored very well. My only gripe is that I asked for my food to be cooked extra spicy and I felt like my entree was not spicy at all--huge let down. They brought some little peppers over so that I could eat them with my dish but I prefer spice to be cooked into my meal. I recommend they spice dishes they way their customers ask going forward.",

Came here since it seemed to be authentic and at a good price.\nThe service was great. Very prompt and accommodating. We started with samosas with a great dipping sauce.\nWe followed with the chicken tikka masala, mixed grill and garlic naan. I asked for the chicken tikka masala a touch under \"Indian spicy\" which is how I normally order it in the US (a 10 Indian spicy usually knocks me out haha!) Not sure if they assumed we couldn't handle their spice level because we are not Indian and from the US, but it was not spicy AT ALL. My boyfriends mixed grill was good, but he also requested a side of spicy tikka masala sauce and it was again not spicy at all. They quickly gave him a spicier sauce, madras, which was better, but still not nearly the spice we are used too.\nTo be clear, the food at its core is good!! However, we have found at many different types of restaurants in London that the spice level is just not what we are used to in the US. If you are an American craving spice, would just recommend asking for a much higher spice level here and really most places in London.",

I recently stop by their location in Covent Garden while on a trip in London and Oh my Gosh! \nIt is a bit in the upper price but well worth for the quality of the ingredients, efficient service and definitely the location. \nWe had the Lam Biryani £14.50 ($19), Saag Paneer £7.95 ($11), Chicken Tikka Masala £11.75 ($15.50), and Tandoori Lamb Seek Kebab £12 ($16) and obviously a serious overload of Naan bread £2.50 ($4)! \nEvery dish was excellent, perfect mild spice to it. Creamy Saag Paneer and Tikka Masala. \nAll these dishes just went perfectly with each other. \nAnd what would Indian food be without Raita?? It was so creamy, and fresh! \nHopefully it is not too far away my next trip to UK so I can definitely touch heaven again!! \nCheers!",

Chicken quite tender and moist, so delicious. \nKing Prawn Bhuna - Jumbo prawns curry was excellent and just made us fell in love with curry.....\nOverall, decent service and very reasonable price.

To the managers credit he saw the face I made after that first bit and asked me if anything was wrong. I told him it was very very spicy.

                "description": "Located in beautiful Covent Garden (aka the theatre district of London), Punjab remains true to its authenticity. Open since 1945, It's apparently the oldest North Indian restaurant in London. The decor inside is traditional with purple as it's predominant color. The seating is a bit cramped in here, as tables are quite close to each other. The food here is great. My family and I got the mango lassi, saag paneer, naan, tandoori chicken, lamb madras, and chicken madras. \nThe mango lassi was creamy and fragrant. But, I still think it doesn't even compare to the mango lassi in Singapore, which was mind blowing. The saag paneer was less creamy compared to one I usually eat in Houston at Naseeb. But, I did appreciate the spinach flavor that's more predominant at Punjab. The tandoori chicken had a nice grilled flavor and was moist. It went well with their naan bread. Now, the best dish on their menu by far was their lamb or chicken madras. Strong curry flavor and spicy as hell! Thank goodness we had enough rice to calm the spice. I would definitely recommend eating this. \nI can't wait to come back to this restaurant whenever I visit London again. It would be a wonderful dinner choice before a theatre show close by. I'm sad I missed the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play that was currently playing nearby when we were there.",

                "description": "I came here because of a recommendation from a friend in Los Angeles and thought my tastebuds were in for Nirvana.  The line out the door was a good sign, but sadly my hopes of finding Nirvana at Punjab was not so. I came here a couple times during my last trip to London hoping things would get better.  I did meet some nice people who shared a few of their dishes with me so I was able to taste more than I would have by myself - that's always nice!  There are some good things, but mostly I left with a poor taste in my mouth and bitterness in my heart. \nThe service was consistently fair to middlen. Anytime someone comes to take your full order without suggesting appetizers or beverages it makes me feel like they want you in and out as fast as possible. Is this a fast-food joint?  No?  Then let me try to enjoy the experience you have to offer. \nI asked the server for suggestions since every chef has their specialty, but I didn't get any. \"Whatever you feel like\" doesn't sit well with me.\nOn my second and third visits I ordered different appetizers.  Each were very hot, tasty, fresh and perfectly seasoned with dipping sauce that add the right amount of \"kick-ass\" to your tastebuds.  The stuffed eggplant didn't seem to be stuffed with much of anything (it was cut down the middle and roasted), but I could eat roasted eggplant any day of the week and be perfectly content. \nThe chicken Korma was like puréed baby food without any of the flavor or spices you might expect. No cashews, raisins, or any other seasonings you'd normally latch onto to please your palate.  Such a disappointing dish. They wouldn't let me order it \"spicy.\"  I was also told that people have nut allergies, so I guess I can't have nuts at Punjab either!  I realize there are different styles of cooking, especially when it comes to south Asian cuisine, but I didn't enjoy the bland nature of this dish which I generally love and call \"my favorite\" at other restaurants. \nHere is what upset me the most and left bitterness in my heart:  I had already experienced different dishes throughout my stay in London at Punjab with a variety of meats, but on my last night I ordered a different chicken dish (my cardiologist would like this).  When I tasted the dish my tastebuds said \"baa baa baa\" and not \"cluck cluck cluck.\"  It was lamb, again. I love lamb so I ate it anyhow and didn't complain, but as I was leaving the restaurant one of the owners said, \"I saw that you ordered chicken, but I switched it to lamb because lamb is better.\"  I don't mind a prefix menu if that's what I'm ordering, but intentionally changing my order and NOT telling me is WRONG. If you want me to try something different, then give me a taste and don't force your opinions on me.  I was consistently asking the servers for suggestions and they wouldn't give me any!  I already had plenty of lamb at Punjab and wasn't in the mood for more, but I ate it, again. \nHow would you feel if you ordered a cucumber sandwich and the chef said, \"I saw you ordered a cucumber sandwich, but what you really wanted was a BLT so I changed it...oh, and you're still paying me for it.\"  \nI'm generous with two stars.",

When we stopped at Trafalgar Square which is 10 minuets walk to the restaurant, it's time to try this one. The lamb biryani was very good, chicken tikka masala was good too, less tasteful than I expected, curry lamb was tender and tasty. Decent quality and portion. The service was fast and courteous, environment was casual.",

                "description": "Some might erroneously call me unadventurous for never straying from my order of chicken tikka masala at an Indian restaurant. Others might correctly recognize that I simply wanted to honor \"a true British national dish\" (shout out to you, former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook) in one of the world's most multicultural cities.\nDishoom is definitely the more popular Indian restaurant in London, but I didn't want to risk having to wait for a table. Punjab fit the bill perfectly. We were promptly seated and ordered chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, garlic naan, and rice. The garlic naan was so good that it has now ruined all other kinds of naan for me. Both of our curry dishes included succulent, juicy chicken. While the butter chicken was extremely flavorful, I wish we would've gotten a vegetable dish instead because it started tasting a little repetitive. \nIf you're torn between Punjab and the Dishoom in Covent Garden a few blocks from Leicester Square (even if you're already in line for Dishoom), don't hesitate to give Punjab a try. The decor here looks a bit traditional and outdated compared to Dishoom's trendy atmosphere, but you can't go wrong with the curry at Punjab.",

Authentic old era building feeling and beautiful neighborhood. In SOHO close to oxford st, and many other London attractions\nNo long wait times even on Saturday. Welcoming staff and interior with history. Nice clean and good presentation. Good music and not loud.\nProbably not good for kids as space is little congested.\nOrdered Chana masala, dal makhani, tandoori roti and gazar halwa\nRatings\nChana Masala 4.5 I hope it was slightly less tangy. Good balance of spices\nDal Makhani 4 Spices delicately balanced but I felt some Masala was missing maybe because couldn't taste ginger and garlic.\nTandoor Roti 4 was not crispy\nGazar Halwa 5 SUPER DELICIOUS\nService 5\nOverall 4\nThey accept AmEX (not a big deal but important for business travelers)",

It filled up shortly after we arrived. We selected Punjab because it was highly rated on Yelp and once again Yelp was right!!\nI don't eat a lot of Indian food, but this is the best I can remember. Our amazing appetizer was Kandu Puru, the pumpkin bread. Our courses were Acharri Murgha (chicken curry) and Methi Gosht (lamb curry). Both were exceptionally prepared, tender meats and truly delicious sauces. We accompanied it with cheers naan which was also delicious. My favorite of the dishes was the chicken curry. The menu states \"has to be experienced once in a lifetime\" and I'm glad I experienced it!\nService was fast and extremely friendly and attentive. Highly recommend!!",

The service was generally very friendly, especially the hosts. \nThe food was a bit of a hit/miss. Excellent butter chicken and Chole, and pretty good tandoori chicken. Very mediocre lamb biryani.

The service was very good and the wait was not too long on a Saturday evening- maybe 15 minutes. \nSamosas were alright (I feel bitchy saying meh), and the prawn puri and king prawn bunha were also ok. They were slightly disappointing from flavour and temperature. Keep in mind that I've become snobbish when it comes to Indian food in London at this point. I did, however, love the cheesy naan. It's a very subtle light cheese inside the naan and adds a beautiful creamy and fluffiness. It's a nice Indian restaurant in a very good location but you can find much better (and much worse) elsewhere.",

Very easy location and excellent staff who were very attentive but laid back to let you eat as well. Kid friendly too!\nThe pakora were crispy and wonderful. My husband had a chicken dish that came in a sizzling fajita like platter that was pretty awesome and I had the chole which was just enough spice and super flavourful. It wasn't spicy to cover up blandness but just enhanced all the ingredients. \nWe overheard another couple talking about gluten-free options and they were being more than accommodating which is great to hear. Reasonably priced too, we defintely will consider visiting again next time we are in London.",

We asked for time to review the menu, made our selections and anxiously anticipated our food to come. Out first, they bring you a gratuitous aperitif - a thin and crispy flatbread with four salsas/salads - mango puree, onion/tomato/cucumber diced salad, this delish apple/mint chutney mix and some type of spicy pickles I think (forgot to try that though). \nWe ordered an app of ground lamb and lentils formed into patties and OMG - this is patty heaven!

                "description": "We came to this restaurant after reading Yelp reviews. Arrived at about 6:30pm, one party ahead of us. Despite seeing several open tables we were told to wait, and took about 20 minutes to seat the 3 of us. The ambience was good, and the food aroma was inviting. We ordered buttered chicken which consisted of two medium sized pieces of chicken that was covered with the yellow spiced curry, but dry on the inside. We also ordered the goat tandoori which came in 4 kebabs, well seasoned but very salty. Also ordered buttered naan and sweet naan, both just okay. The service was definitely a low light, had to ask for water 3 times, and they never came by to refill. The bill came quickly though, and surprised to find they already added tip. Overall not impressed with the food, bad service, definitely not recommended and would not come back.",

Punjab had the highest stars with the most reviews, most places had under 50. We arrived around 7:30-8p on a Monday night and the restaurant was fairly crowded. We put our names in and waited about 10 minutes before being seated. Our waiter was friendly and personable, he made suggestions that we gladly took. \nWe ordered:  Tikka Masala, butter chicken, saag paneer, gobi aloo, and acharri gosht lamb, cheese naan and rice. We definitely ordered too much food. My friend also ordered samosas as an appetizer for herself. \nSamosas: my friend loved them, they were hearty and the pastry they were cooked in had just the right amount of flaky texture to it. She wasn't a fan of the mint chutney she ordered with them and I tasted it and was also underwhelmed. \nTikka masala: delicious. The chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I wish it had a little bit more spice \nButter chicken: the sauce was AMAZING. I couldn't stop dipping the naan in it. It was the right amount of spice and so flavorful. The chicken also was cooked wonderfully and fell off the bone. \nLamb dish: delicious. Flavorful and juicy. I only had a small amount of this but my friend was in love. \nSaag paneer: was good, not great. Would probably pass on this dish if I came again. \nGobi aloo: my boyfriend loved it. I didn't try any. He said it was the best he's had. \nCheese naan: cheese and bread are the perfect pairing. This didn't disappoint. \nThe flavors of the food and the service definitely makes me want to visit this restaurant again if I'm ever in London. It's the oldest Indian food restaurant in the city!",

If my mouth hadn't been on fire the whole time I was eating I surely would have enjoyed the chole, the bhindi, and the aloo gobi much more. The rice and naan were good (no spice obviously).\nPrices are quite reasonable.\nOverall I just wish the food wasn't so spicy! If we could somehow get mild food we'd definitely return.",

We ordered the pumpkin on bread, butter chicken (savory as it should be , not sweet), methi gosht (might not be spelling this correctly!), bullet naan (garlic and chilis! Heaven!!), aloo paratha, and butter naan. This was enough for dinner and some leftovers for tomorrow :) Besides that, the owner and staff are wonderful -- friendly and good-natured. \nDefinitely recommend this place!",

I told me what the name of the plate was but I'll be honest, it flew past my head, all I know is that the plate came with naan, some rice, and the lamb in some orange curry sauce.\nI loved it, the food was really good, the service quick and the cost wasn't too bad, for dessert I had some mango kulfi which was also delicious.",

On my one week trip to London this past week we looked for Indian food since we heard that it's your best bet at good food in London (otherwise notorious for having shitty food).\nThe restaurant itself was packed on a Friday night around 8pm, but luckily there was barely any wait (10 min or so). I ordered the Lamb Madras since it was the only item under lamb labeled \"hot/spicy\". It was SUCH tender lamb - I was actually surprised but it may be the most tender lamb I've had at any Indian restaurant. The sauce was spicy enough, 7/10 on my spicy level scale (I love spicy food for reference). The curry flavor was really yummy, packed with just enough spices for that kick. My friend ordered one of their tandoori chicken dishes and I was equally surprised by how juicy the chicken pieces were (they didn't come with bone, so that's even more surprising). They poured a shot of (alcohol) on her chicken tandoori sizzling plate and lit it up with a match - the fire was HUGE so be wary of your hair! The mango lassi drink was perfect and not too sweet. The only letdown was the appetizer - we ordered the prawn puri and it came with SUCH tiny shrimp (def not prawn....). Skip that appetizer!\nOverall - food was delicious, portions a bit small for the price (approx 20 pounds per person) as we had no leftovers. I'm usually almost always left with leftovers at Indian restaurants in the States...\nIf I'm back in London I'll be sure to visit Punjab again :)",

However, our main waiter was rude and made us feel like he might spit in our food. The samosas were greasy and lacking flavor, the paneer pakora had been sitting in it's old greese and then reheated. Then the main course arrived and the rice was soggy, which is a sure sign of a bad Indian restaurant.  The kitchen should never have allowed it to come out. We had a Dahl and chickpea curry.  The chickpea curry was good but the dahl was barley editable. Had this been a 20 pound meal we still would have been disappointed but at 60 pounds it was offensive.",

I do not normally seek out Indian food on my trips, but the reviews were fantastic and again it did not disappoint. I wish I could tell you what me and my guest ordered, but we ordered a lamb curry dish and a chicken curry dish based on the suggestion of the waiter or manager. We had naan bread, and white rice, and the local beers Again, I wish I could say more about the dishes other than the spices were perfect, medium was just right, and the atmosphere was fantastic. It felt very much like a local, cozy place to eat for locals. I would highly recommend to anyone..",

They even saw a homeless woman outside wearing a brown shawl and went out to offer her some food! I mean come on! Talk about paying it forward! Not only does your establishment deserve an award in customer service and quality and taste of your food, but throw in a humanitarian award in there as well for helping out someone in need!

I have to admit, I was beyond confused when the first place he wanted to take us was an Indian restaurant.  I did not realize that England's Indian food was so highly regarded! He insisted that Punjab was the best place for us to go.  \nI was definitely overwhelmed by the menu.  It is quite extensive!  I had tried Indian food a few times before, but I am certainly no expert.  My friend and I decided to split an order of the Butter Chicken (it sounded simple for us beginners) with sides of Cheese Naan and white rice.  Our friend recommended the Chicken Tika Masala, but we decided to play it safe.\nIt actually turns out that we should have listened to my friend.  Although the Butter Chicken was good, it was actually much richer and spicier than the Chicken Tika Masala that we tried!  The Chicken Tika Marsala was mild, unique and delicious.  I will definitely be ordering it during my next meal at an Indian restaurant.\nOur Butter Chicken WAS enjoyable.  It was very tender and went perfectly over our side of white rice.  However, my favorite part of the meal was the Cheese Naan.  I could have eaten a stack of it!  Naan is an oven-baked flatbread served with Indian food (I did not know this).  The Cheese Naan has a white cheese baked inside the flatbread.  It was AMAZING and I loved it.  I'm actually craving an order as I write about it.\nThe restaurant was casual, but nice.  I loved the Indian decorations and bold colors.  The service was also wonderful.  The next time I am in London, I will be sure to stop at Punjab for some Chicken Tika Masala and endless orders of Cheese Naan.",

We also arrived at the same moment as a drunken group of 8 who the same host basically told to hit the bricks as they couldn't be accommodated.  \nAs we were walking away I heard him calling for the table of 2 so we scurried back and they seated us a few minutes later. \nThe upstairs dining room was much quieter than the downstairs. At first it was eerily quiet but eventually they turned on some Indian music that improved the the atmosphere a bit. \nWhoever wrote the menu has a good sense of humor. I appreciated that when reading some of the descriptions. \nAfter 2 entrees, 2 naan breads, 2 drinks, and the service charge, the total came to £44. Great food, unmemorable service, pricier than your typical takeout. Overall a good choice if you only have limited time in London and you can get in the door.",

The servers were nice and attentive.  The food gets delivered via dumbwaiter up and down the stairs for the most part.\nI order butter chicken, garlic naan and some rice.  It was the perfect amount of food but man was it expensive.  It was basically one airline breast of chicken and one piece of naan with a plate of rice and it was over 40 GBP.  Was it good food?  YES.  It was really good.

We had Cobra Beer to drink and Paneer Pakora to start (the sauce with the paneer was great!) For our mains we had Chicken Tikka Masala and Pudina Gosht (lamb). The mildness of the Tikka Masala with the spicy Pudina Gosht was great complements to one another. The meat in both dishes was tender and the seasonings were spot on. To go with our mains we had Pilau Rice and Garlic Naan. Both were excellent. If we weren't so full we would have ordered more!\nThe only thing I can say is the service is a bit brusk on cheeriness but fast response times and there wasn't much of a wait between ordering and receiving food.\nWe came in around 2pm on a Thursday and one side was full. By the time we started eating our side had every table occupied as well. The decor of the restaurant is also great with old photographs decorating the walls.\nCan't wait to return on my next visit to London!",

My salad was sort of sad, I was expecting larger chunks of vegetables, but it did its purpose in cleanses my palate after eating some curry and naan. Overall, Punjab is definitely a place I recommend and would come back to!",

                "description": "After a lengthy visit at the British Museum, we hungered for some hardy Indian food. Punjab definitely fulfilled this desire. Here is my take on the service, atmosphere, and most importantly, the food.\nAppetizers:\nWe ordered samosas, a favorite of ours, to start the meal.\nRating: 3/5\nThe samosas were decent, but lacked the complexity(in terms of spices) that is necessary for a good samosa.\nEntrees:\nI ordered the chicken tikka special; boneless chicken pieces with  Tandoori \nSeasoning and onions flambéed in Brandy at the table side. Quite delicious pairing with mint yogurt sauce that comes on the side. My only complaint is that the chicken was mildly dry and some of the onions were burnt to blackness. The sauce helped overcome the dryness.\nRating 4/5\nMy son ordered the Methi Murga; pieces of chicken submerged in mildly spicy tomato sauce with onions. He said that the chicken was very good but the sauce was a bit soupy and needed more onions. \nRating 4.5/5\nDesert:\nI ordered Gulab jamun; it had a pleasing doughy texture although I felt the liquid it was bathing in was overly sweet and overwhelmed the more subtle flavors.\nRating 3/5\nMy son ordered mango lassi; mangoes submerged in a sweet syrup. He said it tasted wonderful, with the syrup covering the tartness of the mango but not overwhelming the flavor.\nRating 5/5\nRecommendation: If you are in the area Punjab is a great place to dine.",

                "description": "I have to disappointingly give 3 stars the Punjab. I specifically dragged my friend here for dinner because I wanted to go to the oldest Punjabi restaurant in the U.K.  The food here is pretty good. We both loved the apps we got (lamb shish and the pumpkin app). My paneer makhani was fine, but I wish it was spicy. Her chicken tikka speciality was a bit smaller than expected. Sugar and mango lassi's were also good. I was not too thrilled that you have to also buy rice. We ended up buying one naan and one basmati. And if we had wanted water we would have paid. \nBut here's where the bigger problem comes. We had no problems with the waiter who seated us and gave us our check. But the waiter who took our orders and brought our food out was a big problem. He's a young guy, probably the youngest there, but that's no excuse for being OFFENSIVE. Let me preface this by saying both my friend and I are American and speak English perfectly without accents (which btw our rude waiter had an accent when he spoke in English) AND YET despite this, he chose to continually say \"arigato\" and \"xie xie\" to my friend, thinking he was cute or funny? I don't know but it's completely unacceptable. It made both of us extremely uncomfortable and he never stopped doing it. Not to mention when he brought my rice out he referred to it as \"arroz\" instead of rice. And he did all of this clearly KNOWING we speak English (better than him for that matter). For these reasons, I'm disappointed that Punjab isn't a place I can recommend to anyone who isn't white or south Asian since our abilities to speak English were questioned while here.",

The waiter suggested some Papadam with a selection of chutney and other sauces. \nWe really liked everything served.  And it was served promptly with heated plates.  Some of the items that came with the Papadam were foreign but tasty.  The Curry was spicy but the heat only lasts a few minutes and was the perfect level for us.

Punjab also had a queue but that one was significantly shorter. \nWe came here as a group of 5 people but were soon seated in a cushy corner table. The food was amazing, though some were spicy and the staff were super friendly, evoking images of a close knitted family and even posing for pictures with us and at one point, patiently explaining some of Punjab's background with us as they found us standing by a large map on the wall. \nWe were advised to order a variety of dishes and share (which worked out fab for me as I love trying out new foods!!) The menu was expansive but the waiter was patiently and enthusiastically guiding us through it and in the end, we opted for the bold text dishes (which were chef recommendations). Our food arrived promptly and we tucked in. I did admit that I wanted to order more, mainly because it was so good, everyone was fighting for every last morsel! \nI would definitely be coming back to this long standing establishment, with its genuinely friendly service. It honestly felt like I was in their family home, being treated to home cooked food!! If you want genuine North Indian food then go here! It is also the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant!",

The atmosphere was fine, but nothing special, and the food was a bit overpriced for the quality. All in all, this was a rather lackluster experience with food that was average, at best.

The first spot, which I won't name, was more of an fusion restaurant with a limited menu. I knew it wasn't what I wanted because it didn't even smell like an Indian restaurant. Where was the aroma from the spices??? Fortunately, was able to convince my coworkers to look for another restaurant when we came across Punjab. I knew we were in the right spot the moment we walked in the door. We didn't order anything out the ordinary. We shared some chicken masala, Korma chicken, the chickpea dish (I don't believe it was called chana masala here), aloo gobi, rice and garlic naan. Everything was delicious and flavorful!!! One of my coworkers had dietary restrictions so we requested to speak to the manager. He was very attentive and accommodating in fulfilling his needs.  We ordered a bottle of Indian red wine called India Grover's LA Reserve.  It was excellent!! My coworkers told me they were glad I suggested finding another restaurant. I'd definitely go back and highly recommend the Punjab restaurant if you're looking for great  Indian food.",

The chicken tikka masala however was excellent so either or I'm sure both are good. \nI'll be honest - I found this spot after getting an hour and 45 minute wait at Dishoom - no thanks, nothing is worth almost a 2 hour wait. I found Punjab which is just a few streets down and I'm glad I did. No wait at all and seemingly more authentic. \nOf course I had to get the chicken tikka masala - the chicken was some of the best I've had at an Indian restaurant - super moist and tender - excellent. The curry base was great as well - it was a little on the lighter side - was hoping for more spices and robust flavor. \nIt wasn't on the menu but I got mixed vegetables in a tomato based curry which was also very good. The dishes don't come with rice or naan so I ordered a white rice and garlic naan - the rice was just plain rice, should have ordered the one with the seeds. \nThe garlic naan was good but not as good as the bullet naan which I added later on because of the pictures. It's not as spicy as you would think (bullet naan). The samosa was delicious - crunchy outside and soft pillowy potato mash inside. \n I also got a masala chai tea - very good and spicy. One of the better meals I've had in London - great Punjab food! Portions are good, prices are on par for the city - total came out to about £43 for 2 ppl - appetizers, main courses, drinks.",

He served naan and garlic naan, both deliciously buttery and soft. We almost wished we saved the naan to eat with our meal instead but gobbled it up quickly. I loved my chicken Tikka special- the spices marinated in the meat perfecto with an abundance amount of sauce to mix with the rice. My husbands butter chicken was a little bit dry but he said the flavor was bold and spicy, just the way he expected it. \nWe didn't have room for dessert unfortunately but a mango lassi was quite enough for me to leave happily and satisfied.",

The food was delicious, staff was friendly and helpful. We had ordered butter chicken, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka. No food was left! \nI would recommend making a reservation, we were lucky at 6 to get a table.

Love the methi gosht. Acharri and karahi dishes are also really good here.\nI get the feeling this place tones down the spiciness, so if you're a regular Indian eater and like spicy, make sure to ask staff to bump it up a bit. For example, the biryani dishes are not nearly spicy enough in their \"standard\" forms. Same with the jalfrezi - the basic flavor is very good, but could definitely use a bump up on the spiciness. That said, once you request spicy, it really does get spicy!\nAlso, one of the better gajar halwa I've had. If you're a fan, make sure you save room. Even if you're not (and you don't hate carrots as a dessert), give it a try.\nGo at lunch to avoid the queues.",

The decor isn't anything to shout out about but it's simple and comfortable which I liked.\nThe waiter was slightly abrupt but in a comical way. He provided us with the wifi password via the menu (butterchicken) and helped with the food recommendations - I'm glad he did! \nWe started with popadoms, pretty standard, but the chutneys which accompanied them were unisual particularly the greeny grain looking one (not sure if the name - sorry) which was tangy yet delightful.\nWe then shard the Samosa's - crispy not soggy pastry (which does happen) on the outside, and the inside was almost creamy, stuffed with meat and potatoes with fantastic flavours running through.\nNow to the dish I was prompted to try, the Archarri Margha, I truly enjoyed this! You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and that they take pride in their special dishes and you could really taste tang!\nIt was first Punjabi food experience, it won't be my last!\nTo note: the prices are really decent especially for a restaurant in Covent Garden.",

Between the moments I stepped in the restaurant to the moment I stepped out, each interaction with the staff felt very impersonal and unfriendly. If I say \"Thank you\" to a waiter, he would just stare at me and walk away. When it was time for me to pay, the person who inserted my credit card didn't even say a word. He just took the card, printed out a receipt, let me sign it, and walked away. Not a single eye contact. Wow. On top of all that, I'm required to give a \"10 percent optional service\" fee.\nPRICE:\nMy total amounted to 14.25 GBP for Butter Chicken with rice. That's about $23.63 USD for those living in the states. People say that this place is cheap but I think it's expensive. I have been to other Indian restaurants where my total is about 11 GBP for the same or more portion of food. \nFOOD:\nI ordered the Butter Chicken and rice. The Butter Chicken included two pieces of chicken still on the bone. The gravy was good and had a slight spiciness to it. It goes well with rice or naan (not included in the price). \nIf the customer service was better, I would have given this place a 3 out of 5 stars.",

We moved around as people came and went (it was raining outside, duh, so couldn't wait there), after the time passed we were seated at a table upstairs.

We started off with vegetable samosas. \nFor main course, we ordered the butter chicken and baigan as gravies, with rice and naan. It was one of the best Indian food I have had outside India. The butter chicken reminded me of food in local dhabas in Punjab :') we absolutely loved our dinner here!",

We were fortunate to get a table for four.\nAmbiance: bare minimum, no great wall decorations. It is a series of small rooms.\nService was good but they tried very hard to rush us through dinner. We fought them off. Manager was nice to take pics of the foursome outside.\nFood: was good, northern Indian. Our vegan friend ordered sweet and spicy pumpkin and a lentel dish, tarka dall. We also tried the prawn puri, spicy shrimp on a crispy puri. Very tasty. We also ordered 2 butter chicken entrees, a Punjab specialty. Delicious, tasty and very enjoyable.\nOverall, a nice experience.",

                "description": "London is known as a mecca for delicious Indian food. You're more likely to find a place selling tikka masala than the traditional English fish and chips while visiting. Because of this, I knew I had to try some good Indian food when I went to London. I knew it would be the best Indian food I can get without actually being in India. While doing research about where to eat, my sister and I stumbled upon Punjab. Punjab is known as one of the best Indian restaurants London has to offer. On any given night, you will have to wait up to an hour to get seated. \nMy sister and I arrived at a good time. A bit before 7pm, and with hardly any line. Since we were only a party of 2, we were seated in about 25 minutes. The restaurant is much larger than it looks on the outside. When you first walk in you think there is only one room for dining, but then you see that there is another room, and even more seating upstairs. My sister and I were directed to the upstairs seating. The ambiance of the restaurant is very homey. Punjab isn't trying to be fashionable, and it isn't trying to be the best in London. This is just some good Indian food without all the hoopla. \nWhen we sat down, we knew we wanted to get something to drink. After looking at the drinks menu we decided to get the India Grover's Sauvignon Blanc. We thought it would be interesting to try some Indian wine. The wine was wonderful and refreshing. When I came time to order appetizers, I knew I had to get samosas. I can't have an Indian meal without trying the samosas. The samosas offered at Punjab were some of the best I've had. We also split some garlic naan. I garlic naan was just as good as the samosas. For my meal I got the chicken tikka masala. Chicken tikka masala is my go to Indian dish, and it was renowned in London. I just had to get it. The chicken tikka masala was outstanding. I loved the tomato based sauce that the chicken comes in. My sister got the karahi paneer and thought it was great. There were no complaints from her about any of the dishes. The entire meal was absolutely perfection.\nThe service was also really great. All the waiters and employees were very nice, and courteous. I also appreciate that we were only waiting outside for 25 minutes when it was very cold outside. My only issue with Punjab is that I don't live in London and I can't visit as often as I wish I could. Punjab is a restaurant I would recommend to people visiting London.",

When we asked the hostess at Dishoom about other good Indian restaurants in the area, she directed us to Punjab. \nWe had some papadams and samosas for appetizer. My wife had the chicken tikka masala, and I had the lamb roganjosh. All simply fantastic. \nThe following day, we trekked out to the famed Brick Lane for some more Indian food, but honestly, Punjab blows away the Indian food on Brick Lane. We will definitely make a return trip to this restaurant on our next trip to London.",

I wanted to find a good one for our first night in London. I looked at reviews online and I found Punjab. Upon entering it looked pretty busy for a Wednesday night they have it set up with almost a fine dining appeal. We were seated right away, which is always a plus in my book. I ordered the Strongbow cider to drink, which I was told was London's signature cider but I had never tried it before. To eat I ordered the garlic naan, the dahl, and the chicken tikka masala. Everything came out pretty quickly and it was all very good and I devoured it down but the stand out for me was the garlic naan I think it was the best I ever had. The service was friendly and attentive. I'd recommend this place to every fellow Indian food lover to try out.",

Then we had butter chicken,  lamb madrus, and acharri gosht. They all taste good but similar. All dishes tend to be a bit salty. Lamb madrus is the best as the meat is most tender and the dish is most spicy. The garlic naan is perfect. The cheese naan tastes good but a bit oily. The service is pretty good in general.",

                "description": "Visiting London for a couple of weeks and I found this place on Yelp. I love, love, love Indian food, so I put it on my list early on to stop at. When I got there the line was pretty big and I wasn't too sure how quickly it was going to move. I easily put in a takeaway order and my food was ready in 10 minutes. The owner of the establishment was incredibly nice and even threw a couple of jokes my way even though it seemed like a mad house inside. I wouldn't normally think of this, but this place really splurges on the takeaway packaging. The containers were sealed really well and the bag was sturdy and leakproof, in case the containers didn't work. The only reason why I mention this is because this made it really easy to go through the Underground on a Saturday night without getting curry all over the place.\nI ordered the Kadu Sabji-their signature pumpkin curry (because I'm American and Americans love all things pumpkin this time of year), plain rice, and garlic naan. The food was PERFECTION. The curry was nicely spiced and had whole chunks of pumpkin in it that were perfectly tender. The garlic naan was also something to write home about. Very soft and chewy. Though, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone expecting to get a kiss afterwards; I suppose unless you both eat it then it cancels out. The meal is definitely enough for 2, which means I have some left over to enjoy tomorrow!\nGo here, seriously.",

We randomly ran into Punjabi while walking around, remembered it for the program, and decided to eat there. \nThe food at Punjabi was really good and surprisingly cheap.

This was blunt but to the point and I'd rather them say that then tell us no.  The service was great--within moments of asking, we had everything we needed.  \nWe had the Daal, Malai Kofta, and one of the signature dishes (all from the vegetarian menu).  They were all solid.  Everything was on the spicy side (rather than creamy and sweet) and it was good.  Prices were reasonable.",

My friend and I came in sans reservation on Sunday around 7:30 PM, and it was totally fine. There were other diners in the restaurant, but it wasn't too full.\nWe ordered the garlic chicken, butter chicken, garlic naan, and mango lassis, and everything was AMAZING. I did prefer the garlic chicken over the butter chicken, but both were great, and the naan was perfect for sopping up all the delicious sauce. Mango lassis were nothing inventive but still delicious and refreshing. \nPunjab's staff was also super helpful--giving us recommendations on things to do before we returned to our apartment later that evening and even chasing us out the restaurant to make sure we were headed in the right direction.\nIf you're looking for authentic and delicious Indian food, don't miss it! :)",

                "description": "You absolutely have to make room on your busy itinerary for some Punjab! Honestly, prior to my trip to London, I never preferred to eat Indian food. However, Punjab has changed it all! In particular, their Chicken Tikka Masala! You cannot leave London without trying their Chicken Tikka Masala. The sauce is absolutely delicious with its creamy and flavorful texture. It isn't too spicy either if you regularly cannot handle heat.  To go with this, I actually preferred the spiced rice over the naan. I believe it's seasoned with cumin and maybe some turmeric. I am more of a rice than a bread person though. \nThe only downside of this place is the service. They know they are the best so service isn't all too friendly and attentive. They also slap on an \"Optional\" service fee. We didn't bother asking them to remove it, considering how long it took to place our order and to get our bill. Nonetheless, this place is still worth check out!",

As far as the food goes nothing special the condiments tasted like pre package jar sauces, their chicken masala just another indian dish nothing that a place that claims to be the first indian restaurant in London should taste like. If you want indian food you can probally find another place that has just as good food if not better i suggest for the price of punjab you go eat at dishoom way better service, better food but make a reservation.

We were on the hunt for Indian food, saw a line out the door and figured it would be an hour wait. Don't be deterred by the line outside, it moves very quickly and we were seated within 15 minutes. However the first thing we were told before we sat down was that we had to be out by 8 o'clock, which was about an hour-and-a-half away. That was fine, but a little strange we were being rushed before we had even ordered. The atmosphere was also very basic inside, it's definitely more on the casual side. \nWe decided to order  a good variety of starters and main plates because we quite enjoy Indian cuisine. We ordered Samosas and papadom with mango chutney to start. The chutney was delicious. We then followed that with chicken tikka masala, vegetable curry, chicken korma and peshwari naan bread. The portions were decently sized, not overwhelmingly big. The food was all good and the naan bread was fantastic. \nMy only issue with Punjab was that we felt rushed the whole time we were there. It felt like they were just waiting to take our plates away and hurry us along so they could seat the next group of people. I noticed they did that with all of the tables in the restaurant, which took away from the experience as a whole. Overall this was a good restaurant.",

We ordered the Punjabi Samosa, Acharri Murgha, Tarka Daal, and Methi Gosht to name a few and the meal was delicious. We ordered a mixture of chicken, vegetarian, and lamb dishes. All the dishes had their own unique flavor, spice, and aroma. The staff were all attentive and saw to our every need. \nWe all agreed that we would recommend this restaurant to anyone who was looking to have a great Indian meal while in London.",

Just about everything here has been consistently good, and everyone I've eaten here with has loved it. Despite a minor mix up today with my food being delivered to the adjacent table, service is good if a tiny bit unhurried, and food quality is excellent. A few highlights:\nOnion pakora - little fritters of gram flour (believe it's chickpea flour) mixed with onions and spice and fried to a delicious crunch\nHariyali chicken - mentioned by at least one other reviewer, it's a bit showy when it comes sizzling to your table, and it tastes great. Skewered chicken coated in yogurt, coriander, mint, garlic, ginger and chile and cooked in the tandoor. This is my favorite! No sauce, FYI, but some grilled onions underneath are great\nBullet naan - naan with garlic and green chiles - not overpoweringly flavored, but really nice alongside the other dishes - I liked the little bit of extra spice this added to my meal\nOne I won't order again- the mixed vegetable curry - I should've inquired more about this one, as it just wasn't \"green\" enough for me, having lots of potatoes, carrots, and peas in it. Oh well, I'll stick with my okra or saag dishes next time\nDo check this little place out. They take Amex, too, for those who care.",

I love Indian cuisine .... but you can walk down any suburban UK high street and get better than this. Having visited India several times, with a name like Punjab, I had especially high expectations of the tandoori dishes...again a huge disappointment as the meats had none of the smoky charcoal flavor one expects from genuine tandoor cooking. Moreover the \"curry\" dishes had no depth of flavor and all seemed to have been microwave reheated as they were delivered to our table within less than 2 mins of ordering. This place is trading off a long past reputation.",

                "description": "We were originally going to try Dishoom but the line was so long, so we opted to grab takeaway from Punjab.  One of the best Indian meals I've had!  Note that if you grab for takeaway, you get a discount (as with most places in London).  While we were waiting for our food, I ordered a mango lassi which was perfect and not overly sweet.\nThe garlic naan was buttery and had excellent flavor and giant pieces of garlic (which is a plus to me).  The chicken tikka masala had so much flavor, and the lamb korma was very creamy.  I think this place had the hands-down best tikka masala I had.  The prices are going to be a little steeper than what I'm used to in America, but we had leftovers that were still great the next day.  Service was excellent for us while we were waiting for our food, and they made sure to provide us with all the utensils that we needed.",

After just a 15 minute wait, we were shown to a table upstairs where our drink orders were taken shortly after being seated. I had the house red wine, Borsao Garnacha 2014, which lived up to the fruity, full flavor as described on the menu!  Yum!\nThe vegetable samosas were great as an appetizer with a slightly different sauce than what I've had before, not too sweet, not hot, but flavorful - almost like a barbecue sauce. \nI had the chicken tikka masala and my husband had the Achari Murgha. My dish was tender and flavorful, definitely stood out among the many tikka masalas I've had!  The Achari Murgha was spicy and full of flavor, a completely different set of flavor than either of us had tried before. Both dishes were excellent and were well complemented by the garlic naan. \nWe were impressed by the setting, the great food but especially by the service and care taken by the staff. We were greeted by the owner and he took time to speak with us on our way out, too, showing real interest and pleasure in our experience at his restaurant.",

We checked out the map of the area and found Punjab was a quick walk from where we were and, since we were in the mood for Indian, it seemed a good choice. Let me say, I know nothing about Indian food and I have only ever had it twice in my life prior to this, but if I lived in London this would be a go-to, hands down. The food was absolutely delicious and largely sized, the staff actually provided a carafe of water for our table, the drinks were well priced and large, and the staff was friendly, too! I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and I wish I could find something this delicious close to home. My husband ordered one of their spicy dishes and it was definitely spicy (he tried denying this, but the color of his lips told the real story). We also had a flavored naan and the plain rice, both of which were delicious and helped stuff us. We also had no clue that this place was included in a Guy Fieri show, but luckily it wasn't super crowded when we went. Overall, go here. It's delicious, it's filling, it's just what you need if you're looking for Indian food in the Covent Garden neighborhood.",

It's a bit of a tourist trap, but almost everything in central London is to some extent, so I can't fault it for that- plus I'm no local either.\nAfter years living in Singapore within a 10-minute walk to Little India for my weekly Indian fix, this was my first taste of classic British style Indian food. I had to try a chicken tikka... and it was ok. I've now been there, done that. Meh. The black dal (Grandad's dal) was ok. And so was the lamb korma. All around average. \nSo far in London I preferred Dishoom more, however it is a much more modern restaurant. I opted to take the in-laws here, to Punjab, as I knew it was more traditional restaurant (quiet, good service). Not a bad place at all, but with all the Indian places in London, I'll try somewhere new next time for something more authentic, unusual or innovative.",

Anyway, we were seated pretty quickly, which was nice. One thing to note is the seating arrangement felt pretty cramped - separate tables were really close to each other, which made things a bit more uncomfortable.\nSince I'm not an expert on Indian food, I let my friends pick our dishes since we were going family style. I think we went with a Chicken Tikka Masala (apparently a classic), Acharri Murgha, Karahi Paneer, and another paneer dish that I've forgotten. For sides, we ordered 3 garlic naans and 3 butter naans. The food took a while to come out, but when it did it all came out at once. Maybe for that reason the dishes weren't as hot as I would've liked them to be, but it was still warm enough.\nI'm not the biggest fan of cheese, so the paneer dishes weren't my favorite. I did, however, enjoy the Chicken Tikka Masala! And the other chicken dish was alright, too. The garlic naan was pretty tasty, but it was a bit too oily for my liking. Overall, I thought the meal and experience were just ok - nothing special, but then again maybe that's just because I'm not a huge fan of Indian food to begin with.",

All dishes are pretty solid, from Lamb Korma, to Acharri Murgha, to Chicken Tikka Masala (just to name a few that I've tried). The Mango Lassi was good. But the mango juice was a bit watered down? I think I'm just used to a more nectar like consistency for mango juices. \nSpecial shoutout for the Chicken Madras though. The waiter warned me that it's very spicy and I didn't think too much of it. But seriously, never have I ever tasted such a spicy curry, let alone food. I was literally sweating buckets from this. My friends sampled my dish and felt the burn immediately. I think I felt it 1/3 of the way in. I wouldn't say it's a numbing kind of spicy, but more like a slow burn. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. But the strange thing is, I ordered the Lamb Madras a few months later and it wasn't half as spicy as the Chicken Madras? I already ensured my waiter that I can handle my spices... But I guess you really have to emphasize that you want it SPICY SPICY. \nI also like how the waiters throw in freebies every once in a while. My Panjabi friend asked for a Panjab specific bread called bhature, but was told that it's not on the menu. Around 15 minutes later our waiter brought out a basket of bhature specially made for her, free of charge! There was another occasion where I got a plate of papadam accompanied with various chutneys and pickled vegetables, free of charge once again! How awesome is that?! \nOverall great food, fantastic service, and reasonable price. I don't think my expectations for curry will be the same after eating at Punjab. Highly recommend this place!",

The servers stand nearby and are waiting to serve you with a smile. The wait was short and the wine was delicious!  I wish California restaurants had the same service.  Bravo!!! One more thing, the manager Agnelo, surprised us with a sparkling desert. What a great guy.  Cheers Agnelo!",

The main dishes were chicken tikka special (when it comes out they light it on fire on the table!), chicken tandoori and butter chicken. Sides were malai kofta, saag paneer, rice, garlic naan and cheese naan. Everything we had was delicious. \nWe also celebrated my parents 30th anniversary. The waiters all signed a card and brought out a nice ice cream dessert with a candle in it. The owner came by at the end to wish them well and see how we enjoyed dinner. We'll be back again :)",

Wether the food is good or bad is irrelevant, you can't enjoy it when waiters are staring you down for you to leave! As soon as you put your fork down, they are at your table to clean up. We refused to tell them that we were done, 5 times in less than 7 minutes, just to let our food go down to your stomach,\nWe were seated in the back room, which has 4 long tables, canteen style. There is a thick carpet in the room and dust accumulates on the black side boards on the walls .. disgusting. \nThis place has a lot of potential, but when managed as it is, is just plain sad.\nSave your money and go eat somewhere else, there are better places in London.",

All these years in London wasted!\nUnbelievably good. \nFriendly staff with a great sense of humour.\nSuper fast service and no reservations. You won't have to wait long to be seated.\nTrust me, you don't need to reserve here, just walk in anytime.\nYou might not realise how big this place is until you actually get in and explore it yourself. There are multiple floors and no matter where you sit, you'll have someone around to serve you. \nThey serve traditional Punjabi food and some non Punjabi dishes too. \nUnfortunately I was so hungry and seduced by the look of the dishes served in front of me that I forgot to take pictures of them, which I usually do to post to Yelp. And when I started having them, I was in trance, so wasn't aware of much going on. \nOne thing I noticed is that this place is filled with tourists and foreigners. Well that explains it. This restaurant is more famous than many others, search the web for \"Oldest Punjabi restaurant in London\" and you'll know. \nI will be eating here many more times. \nThey have a wide variety of things on the menu, Punjabi Chicken/Mutton dishes are fabulous, but so are the vegetarian ones, so I hope to try out everything on their menu in the coming few years. \nI so regret the time I spent in London, not knowing this place existed. \nDon't repeat my mistake.",

It's just the staff Is the reason I downgraded this review from a 4 to a 2. To begin with, in 5 mins , the same waiter asked 3 times : are u ready to order . ( as if I am in his way if I don't ) And when I asked for recommendation and asking what the indian dishes were ( I was searching on my phone earlier ) , and then he fucking took my phone and then did some tapping ( hard!) and then satisfied himself with what he found as a \" bangai\" food pic and then threw my iPhone 6s on the table ! Basically he has used my phone without my permission and Hey ! Throwing it back ! That was raging !! And then when we ordered , me and my friend said one only even after he said it s too small for both of us, and we said no, and when he confirmed the order , he just was like : 2 naan yeh ? I was like ONE !!!!! And then he asked what we want to drink and we don't feel like ordering any beverages but just tap water . He shot this look of \" order so little !\" At us ( at this point , it is pretty subjective ) . Anyways . Got through the end ... And then once they quickly cleared the table , there stood the dessert menu and when we said no , next thing on table was the bill, even we didn't ask for it. We didn't touch the bill for like 2 mins cuz me and my mate were chatting . This staff interrupted and was like : everything alright ? There are people waiting outside . We were very upset by the service . Probably won't go again .  This kind of fast food restaurant is not what we look for and customer service still trumps commercialized food ! Even fast food allows u to sit for awhile. And besides , had better Indian food around the area .",

It is not my favorite by a long shot (try Indian Express in West Kensington), but I would go there again if I was in the area. Service was sufficient, but not as refined as some of the Indian restaurants I've been to recently.\nThe portions were generous, and the Acharri Ghost (lamb) had delicious flavor without being too hot, although the lamb itself was just a bit tough. The Chicken Tikka Masala was good as well. I really liked the Grandad's Kali Dall, and I ladled it over my Pilau Rice to form a great concoction. I have no idea if this is the proper way to eat it, but it worked nicely and nobody kicked me out.\nLong story short, this place can leave you walking away happy, but I can't guarantee that you'll fall in love.",

Their no reservation system works because their service is so efficient, so even though it was Friday and they were rammed, we didn't wait too long. Food was very tasty, chicken succulent, sauces just right without relying on over spicing and naan supper fresh. A great curry house in the centre of theatre district - but given that it's been going since 1946 you probably don't need me to tell you that.",

Great depth of flavor in every dish we tried - butter chicken, tikka masala, black lentil dal, samosas, mango lassis, even the cheese naan. A bit too spicy for my kids after growing accustomed to our favorite Indian in blandly spiced Germany. Easy to get to from Tube station nearby.",

I know there's many types of curries from different regions but I guess Punjab is not my favorite. It's a little too tomatoe-y for my taste.\nI've never been to an Indian restaurant where I had to pay extra for white rice. The rice usually comes with the curry. And not only that but when we got the bill, the rice was 3 pounds so that's about $5 USD for just white rice. We ordered two. If we had known, I would have gotten more naan instead. Some of the naan were cheaper than white rice.\nThe service was ok. Nothing great.\nThe place seemed pretty touristy. No one at the nearby tables were English. They were either Japanese, American or Swedish (?).",

They seated us immediately and made sure we were always looked after. \nThe meal was relatively costly for what I expected, about £35 for the two of us.",

I had Grandad's Kali Daal, and even though I'm not normally a vegetarian, I was blown away by this meal. It was rich, not overly creamy (most likely yogurt-based), and perfectly cooked. The lentils were firm to the bite but thoroughly stewed. The naan was the right balance of pliable, but crunchy. Even the plain basmati rice I ordered was perfectly cooked.\nThe service was punctual, but as others have noted, it could have been friendlier. The waitstaff wasn't rude, just cold and non-interactive. I would have given Punjab 5-stars had the service been better. But everyone there was so aloof, I docked them a star just on that one aspect.\nThe interior is intimate and cozy. Nothing mind-blowing but very relaxing.\nAll-in-all, Punjab restaurant is well worth the visit if you're seeking a well-priced, authentic, delicious stop on your culinary tour of London.",

                "description": "3.5 stars.\nSo Saturday around 7:45 pm for a table of 2 there was only about a 10 minute wait. My recommendation is to book in advance for sure no matter what party size you are because why not? The line can get quite long and it isn't entirely predictable, so might as well be safe.\nShortly after we got in the line, it became quite long quite quickly. A group of about 10 behind us was told it would be a 1.5 - 2 hour wait.\nNow the people here are mostly fun and jovial. There are a couple of servers who were a bit cold and impatient, but generally speaking people are smiley and friendly. The expediter at the front who passes the dishes to the servers is super friendly. \nThe food here is really interesting - you'll see things here that they don't have elsewhere and vice versa. I would recommend actually going with a Punjabi dish here instead of something you can get anywhere (like a generic tikka masala or korma). \nWe went with the acharri murgha and chicken malai tikka.\nAcharri Murgha - an classic Punajbi pickle-style chicken, medium spiced, and a bit tangy. Now let me say a word about the \"pickle-style\" - the sauce is flavoured with pickles in the cooking process, but there are no actual pickles in it. The pickle taste is also certainly not overwhelming, which I was really afraid of. This was a delicious, unique, flavorful dish and I would highly recommend it. I haven't tasted much like it before and I would absolutely get it again.\nChicken Malai Tikka - chicken breast marinated with cream, cheese, and yoghurt, cooked in the tandoori and served sizzling with onions on a skillet. This dish was just ok, but nothing special. I expected much more from the dish. The chicken was super soft, tender, and creamy, but there wasn't a lot of flavour and it wasn't interesting.\nThe hariyali chicken tikka really caught my eye, but I was too afraid to try it because it's apparently a very very strong coriander taste (with some mint as well) and some of the servers seemed to think it could be overwhelming.\nWe also got steamed rice and naan, which I wouldn't say was one of the better ones I've had.\nOverall though, I was very happy with the meal, the staff, and the acharri. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try.",

The English food had thus far proved to be a mediocre affair, but I had heard great things about the Indian food.  While strooling through Covenant Gardens I noticed many street signs attempting to lure tourist into other Indian restaurants; Punjab did not engage in this practice but I was lured to it all the same.\nPunjab is a fourth generation family owned restaurant and bears the title of being the oldest Punjabi restaurant in England, which I think is very cool.  The menu is quite extensive with over 100 different options to try and each choice complete with is own colorful description about how succulent the dish is.  And, the food was amazing.  I ordered the Acharri Murgha because it was quoted as a once in a lifetime experience, and I have nothing to say against it.  Also, props go the management who provided my mother with an off the menu version of chicken tikka that was free of spice sicne she cannot tolerate any.\nThe pricing is expensive and all naan and rice is done a la carte which add to the price.  The beer, however, is reasonable.  I had a Cobra, it complemented the dishes.",

We looked for good Indian restaurants on Yelp! and this was a well reviewed one.  We had a 20 minute walk from the hotel to this place and decided to stop for a fruit juice on the way (my wife was starving and it was hot).  As soon as we got into the restaurant, one of the server rudely said \"No outside drinks allowed\".  And then continued to tell us that we can go drink it outside and come back.  When I say rudely, I mean he was kind of ordering us and making us feel uncomfortable as if we just sneaked a drink in at the Movie Theater.  So that was a bad first impression.  \nThe Menu looked good though.  Much more choices than usual.  I ordered Kadai Chicken with Garlic Naan and my wife ordered some Yellow Daal with Chappati.  The Daal, Chappati, and the Garlic Naan were good.  The Kadai Chicken, on the other hand, was really bad.  I could barely bite into the chicken it was so hard.  \nAfter our first bad impression, the service was not bad.  I think it is important to treat your customers with respect and \"ask\" them to \"please\" refrain from bringing outside drinks instead of ordering them and making them feel uncomfortable in front of other customers.\nThe food that was good was average.  The food that was bad really takes the rating down another star.  And the outside drink incidence takes down another star.",

                "description": "We really enjoyed this restaurant! \nThis was our first meal in London and we had heard that London has some great Indian food. We wanted to go to Dishoom, but couldn't get in. In retrospect, we are glad we landed on this place. \nWe were able to get in without a reservation. The bartender that greets customers as they walk in was very friendly. The service was excellent. We had 3 waiters/servers for our table of two. \nThe food came out speedy fast. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and my girlfriend ordered Chicken Tandoori. We were both very pleased. It was very tasty. We also had an order of the garlic naan which was standard. \nThe prices were reasonable (just under £30 for two). I would definitely recommend Punjab to anyone that is in the London area and in the mood for Indian food.",

There are variations on the naan and the basmati rice is overpriced, but you can't argue with the well cooked curry. My acharri gosht was perfectly cooked and the lamb was tender. While my brain was telling me that cottage cheese did not belong in gravy, butter, and cream, the paneer makhani was delicious and tasted more like tofu. The prices were a bit high for what you get, but at least the food tasted good.",

We had chicken Madras,  chicken Korma  and a couple of veggie dishes-saag aloo and mushroom masala.  I  asked for the Madras to be extra hot. Usually this can result in a psychotic chef's revenge by emptying the entire tub of chili powder in the dish,  or alternatively  it remains resolutely pretty mild.  This Madras was bang on.   The food was very well put together.  It does what it says on the tin.  Prices are a little high though.  Service is harassed though reasonably friendly.  You can do a lot worse than the Punjab,  though if you're looking for more cutting edge Indian food then look elsewhere.",

When I got back to the hotel, I had a bad feeling about the bill and checked the prices of what I ordered online.  Sure enough, I was overcharged,  It could have been a mistake, but I truly do not believe that it was.  Unfortunately, I paid cash, otherwise, I would go back to the restaurant to get my money back.

We came here based off the reviews from more knowledge food folk, and the quality of service, food and the general restaurant environment was all top notch. Our server was helpful, and our choices were all satisfactorily spicy/not spicy. They were also happy to keep our box of leftovers in their kitchen while we went off to the theater. \nThe other option would have been Dishoom, but I'm glad we didn't go there - the atmosphere at this place is really nice, and Dishoom just seems like it's trying too hard. plus their no reservations policy is a little objectionable.\nPunjab gets a well deserved 5 stars.",

The spinach both tasted disgusting and was completely unappetizing to look at. You have to pay for rice.

The one on your right when you enter. I think the draft between the bathroom and the front door opening delivers the smell. At least you know that the bathrooms are clean :)",

I would stop in again on my trip if I didn't still have leftovers - and if it wasn't for the 15 pound/person minimum they list in small text on the bottom of the menu. For a meal there is no worry about teaching the minimum between an entrée, rice (or bread) and a drink. It's worth it, too. \nI waited until a waiter brought me a box for my leftovers to ask for a masala chai and that order was lost. Another waiter brought me the bill and I did not check it for the chai - which occasioned many minutes afterward of curious stares as the staff wondered why I wasn't leaving and I wondered how long it took to make a chai. After a bit I asked a server, who got pretty flustered, checked my bill, and in the end have me a free glass of chai so no complaints.",

Came here by myself for dinner based on the generally positive yelp reviews here and not sure if I feel like this place delivers.  Started out with an appetizer of the amritsari fish, then had the main dish of acharri murgha with some plain naan, with a mango lassi to wash it all down.  Yes, food was generally tasty but definitely did not live up to the hype of the amazing quality of British Indian food.  As an example, the fish tasted like it was just thawed frozen fish fried with some spices.  Nothing was bad at all, and I had a generally good dinner, but nothing at all was special.  I've had much better Indian food in a number of restaurants in NYC.  Also, just as a slight aside, I think almost every customer in the restaurant was a tourist, which while not always indicative of anything, in the context of my lackluster meal, does not bode well for the quality of the food. \nThat being said, I had no issues with the service of the wait staff.  Everyone was polite and attentive and I did not feel rushed out at any point.",

Their claim to authenticity is in their lack of customer service for anybody non-white. Food was mostly horrible, and I do not use the word \"horrible\" lightly. Only the uninitiated will find this close to Indian cooking. Unfortunately, we are spoiled by Delhi's Gulatis, Karims and any number of choices in SFO bay area.\nOur meal started with Dry Kebabs that were dry and reheated. Excess of food coloring in CTM and shrimp was rubbery. Their Daal and recommended veggies(we had eggplant) were particularly bland and undercooked. Naan was ok..All in all looked like it was cook's first day at work. Servers were more interested in upping the check and getting us to leave even though we over ordered for six. Do not waste your time and money here, London can do better.",

                "description": "Having been in London for a few months now upon writing this review, I must start off by saying that I've really fallen in love with the Indian cuisine offered in the city, however, as a result, I'm beginning to grow a bit more critical when reviewing Indian as I learn to understand it better.\nTo start off, Punjab provides customers with a great atmosphere for dining.  Located right at the end of Neal Street in Covent Garden, Punjab is a great place to go after a bit of shopping or after work.  Additionally, the service is absolutely fantastic, with quick and funny waiters who are more then willing to help should you find yourself in a bind as to what dish to have (and you will!)\nAs for the food, however, Punjab falls just a tad bit short when taking into consideration that you'll likely pay around 12 pounds if you get a dish with rice and naan.  The serving sizes are a tad bit small (certainly too small to split) for what you pay, and having sampled a bit from the dishes of those around me, I found that the seasoning was pretty much the same even with dishes that were drastically different from one another.  \nIf you're in it for the atmosphere, Punjab is a great choice, but if you're really trying to get the best bang for your buck I might consider looking elsewhere.",

                "description": "Let me start by pointing out that I have an increasingly large Italian friendship base, and one thing that Italian's (in my experience) can't really handle is the classic, mouth melting curry. It took me roughly 11 months to convince my partner that this really was a good place to go, and she's glad I did. The only problem I now have is that I have to argue extensively so that I don't have curry every Friday night.\nThe Punjab is pretty close to a tourist heavy area - not necessarily a bad thing, but the obvious fears of quality/authenticity are apparent. Within 30 seconds of sitting down though, the fears are instantly dispelled. The staff are beyond friendly, the recommendations really strong and most importantly REALLY descriptive. It made it very easy for my partner to pick what type of curry would be best for her (surprisingly not the Korma) and which starters would enable her to be a little more adventurous (she had the pokora, which were the \"right type of spicy\").\nBeyond the food, the wine selection is, if anything, slightly luxurious for a curry house (I staunchly stuck to my cobra) and received no complaints from my partner, a minor miracle in itself. The best thing about the Punjab for me though is the atmosphere and the place itself. It's a proper curry house - it doesn't set out to be a really pretentious and ultra-modern environment, where you're served minimal portions in a stylish fashion, and it doesn't pander to touristy gimmicks - it's basically like a freshly decorated version of your local curry house - clean, warm and friendly. \nYou will need to book for Friday and weekend slots, and it's always worth trying to get yourself a table on the left side of the restaurant where the atmosphere is a little bit more cosy (and the seating against the walls is a bit comfier than the normal seats). To the right is the primary room, which is great if you have a large group or if you are there on the busier nights, but on an early weekday or early in the day, you can get a little bit lost in the space and feel a little isolated. Beyond that, get the vegetable samosas every time, because the dark red/brown sauce that it comes with is the best thing on the menu.",

The only downside was a wait of about 20 minutes as I failed to book a table ahead of time.\nSince my dining companion is spice averse, we ordered fairly benign dishes.  On this night, we had the butter chicken, samosas, cholay and garlic naan.  The butter chicken might have been the best I've had.  There was a wonderful smoky component to the chicken that came through despite the rich, luxurious sauce.  That sauce, well, I could have drunk that from a cup it was so good.  As it was, I tried to soak up every last drop with the freshly baked naan.\nService was extremely attentive, with the manager coming around a few times to check up on us.\nPunjab was been around for about 60 years, and it's easy to see why.

                "description": "After attempting to make a trip to Little India, we made a quick decision to get back on the tube after our mission had failed (the area didn't look safe for women to walk around at night), so we re-routed and decided to go to Punjab which was our 2nd choice after reading reviews on Yelp. I'm glad that we did! We really enjoyed this quaint restaurant. Our friends raved about the Indian food in London, so eating at an Indian restaurant in London was a must on our to-eat list.\n{ORDER}\n* Chicken Tandoori - the best chicken tandoori! The meat literally melted in your mouth, it was oh-so-soft!\n* Butter Naan - after trying the regular naan, we decided to get the butter naan after seeing the table next to us ordering multiple baskets. We loved it! The butter made a huge difference and made the naan very moist.\n{DON'T ORDER}\n* Acharri Murgha Chicken Curry - we weren't impressed with the flavors and the pickled, tangy flavored was unexpected and ruined it for me.\n* Garlic Naan - too dry\n* None of their desserts - the wanna-be carrot cake came out super hot and did not resemble anything like American carrot cake. It felt like eating mushy carrots. The other dessert, not sure what it was called but it was in a white liquid form was a huge disaster. \n{ENVIRONMENT}\n* Great service\n* Quaint, clean restaurant\n* Located in Convent Garden (safe area, lots of retails)\nPunjab is UK's oldest Indian restaurant. That tells you something. They're doing something right!",

                "description": "I recently spent several days in London and wanted to eat some great Indian Food.  Looking at Yelp, Punjab seemed to be among the best so we decided to give it a try.  I won't say it's the worst Indian food I've ever eaten.  No, it's truly mediocre.  Dry, flavorless naan, poor quality rice, bland dal... everything you'd expect from a mediocre Indian restaurant.  I hope those who thought this was the \"Best freaking Indian food\" get a chance to eat at better places.  They can start a few blocks away, at Dishoon (it's not the best Indian food I've had, but definitely better).\nWhat makes Punjab one star, though, is the painfully strong odor of industrial strength soap that permeated ever nook and cranny of the place.  And after sitting in that horrid stench for an hour, it also permeated every nook and cranny of my skin and clothes.  The crazy thing is that this soapy smell seems to be the result of some towels that they give you at the end of the dinner, so you can clean your hands.  Or maybe, so you can get a chemical peel.  Either way, it was ridiculous and it totally ruined any chance we might have had to enjoy our meal.\nThere are many more Indian restaurants in London.  Give some of them a try instead of this place.",

Honesty some of the best Indian food I've yet to enjoy and in such an awesome location. \nFirst, we got lost and looped around from the Covent Garden station to Neal Street. Not really sure how that happened, but we loved walking around, it's such a funky and fun area. Finally we found it and were greeted by such a nice gentleman who kept joking around with my boyfriend and I. From the instant the door opened you could smell a variety of divine spices and we knew that this place was going to be great.\nWe ordered chicken tikka massala, mixed chicken tandoori, a lamb curry I can't remember the name, plain naan, garlic naan, and white wine. SO GOOD! Will definitely be going back again. Great charm with good service and amazing food. Can't really get much better than that. It was a little pricier than expected but definitely worth it. Get there sooner than later or you'll be waiting outside because this place is so popular! \nI found the reviews here on yelp to be very helpful so thank you to you all who have enjoyed it and GO FOR IT for those of you who haven't!",

The seehk kebab was as dried as the chilly used in it, the Boti kebab was chewy as an old dried leather belt and the Tandoori chicken bland. Chicken tikka on the tandoori menu was the only piece of meat that was somewhat up to the standard. In general the tandoori menu felt not tender nor marinated long enough. \nButter chicken or Acharri gosht are the items to go for, but then again they are no better than much less exclusive and less up-scaled Indian restaurants in London. \nThe portions, and we are not Americans, were too small for the price asked. Basmati rice and nan are good but nowhere as good as the prices indicate  nor are they any better than other Indian restaurants. \nThe service is okay but deceiving, they do love to accommodate but they also love to sell and perhaps the worst I seen in London happened here when spring water bottle could not be opened at the table because it was \"slippery\" but conveniently  was replaced in the bar with another bottle which had already been opened. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book and at these prices and with this reputation  it shouldn't take place here. \nFor a party of four and only 2 bottle of beers being the only alcoholic beverages served the sum of 114£ is much more well spend somewhere ells than Punjab.",

I live in South Florida and don't have many options but I may just have to fly to London to Punjab to eat.  Florida restaurants need a lesson in service as well as cooking.

Every bite was savory; the restaurant did well with combining an interesting mix of flavors.  The naan was delicious, the butter chicken was succulent,  and the chicken madras was my favorite (although it wasn't as spicy as I had expected).\nWe loved Punjab and will return in the future if the opportunity presents itself!",

My girlfriend and I generally don't eat lamb, but we ordered the methi gosht based on the waiter's recommendation. It was excellent, and my favorite dish, with the pumpkin curry a close second.  My girlfriends liked the chicken best. The mushroom masala was good, but not fabulous like the other dishes.\nThis was my second visit to Punjab and I'm looking forward to going back on my next visit to London.",

I'm admittedly not a connoisseur of Indian cuisine, or much of an adventurer in regards to food, but I did enjoy my classic chicken tikka masala and mango lassi. My BFF was equally satisfied by the food and ambiance. A bit of a splurge, in comparison to other places about London, but it /is/ near Covent Garden, and you do get value for your money. We went on a weeknight and didn't need reservations, but I'd suggest getting them if on the weekend. I don't doubt this place fills up.",

The sauce was delicious, though. \nDon't get me wrong, the food here is good - Punjab is touted as the oldest Indian restaurant in London in continuance operation, and for good reason. \nThe pumpkin curry was probably the best thing on the menu - spectacular.  All the food was fresh and tasty.  We ordered a variety of dishes, rice dishes, nan, chicken tikka masala, etc.  The wait staff was very attentive and there when you needed them.  The Sikh patrolling the rooms, making sure everything was done just right, transported you back to the time of the British Raj - the good times, not the bad.\nAnyway, that said, food was good, prices a bit high, and typical of London you gotta eat ethnic foods or die trying.",

What a shame. The chicken was well cooked, but my tikka massala sauce was just disgusting. It was way too salty and just not good. Didn't taste of tomato at all. I have made tikka massala myself and I know what goes in there. No idea what they put but it was not good. \nMy boyfriend ordered Lamb Korma.

We pretty much went with the dishes that were marked as specialties on the menu.  \nStarting with my favorite, we had:\nKARAHI GOSHT: lamb curry with tomato and green pepper sauce\nKADU SABJI: a pumpkin curry\nACHARRI MURGHA: a chicken curry and punjabi specialty that the menu cited as a must try at least once in a life time\nEverything was really tasty and flavorful.  The lamb was very tender, the pumpkin had great flavor and the sauce for the chicken was interesting (in a good way).\nI would definitely return if I were in the mood for Indian food!",

Arrived around 8 pm and were seated immediately in the back of the restaurant - very cozy.  \nService was quick, kind and efficient.  The server had family in the SF bay area too!  Small world. \nWe ordered the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and roti as well has basmati rice.  Both chicken dishes were AMAZING.  the spice level was perfect and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  \nI was so excited after the meal and told my husband that I could eat this food daily if it tasted THIS good.  \nLooking for a good place in California to try.  Too bad we haven't found one yet.  I guess it's true that London has the best indian food.  We will definitely be back.",

I wanted something that was classic and not to stuck up or fancy and just simply good. Punjab delivered. I had the lamb korma with plain rice and naan- the flavors blended together perfectly and were not overpowering. I tried some of the tikki masala as well and it was excellent! The place is small but comfortable and we were comfortably set with a party of 5.  I loved the windows in the front of the restaurant and if I came back I would ask to sit near the front simply to people watch. I've considered moving from Houston, Texas to London simply so I could eat here at least twice a week. It seems rash but I'm still thinking about it. Overall best Indian food EVER!",

Throw in a few more curries, rice, and naan and we were filled to the brim. \nMy personal favorite was the Pumpkin curry...it wasn't spicy...more of a sweet yet savory dish that left me licking my plate.

As we were ushered to the back room we were hit with the stench of industrial cleaner that permeates the restaurant.  What odor(s) are they trying to hide?  The stench was ever-present, and we didn't get used to it as the dinner progressed.\nThey tried to seat us in the back room in between two busy, loud tables even though every single other table in that room was open.  We asked to be reseated to a table in a different row, and after they checked with the host at the front, they obliged our request, but appeared to be unnerved that we had disrupted their normal seating pattern.\nThe food?  In a word, subpar.  I started with a mango lassi, which normally should be cool, thick, and creamy.  Punjab's mango lassi was tepid, watery, and bland.  I strongly believe that it was pre-mixed or came straight from a carton before being watered down substantially to cut on costs.  I didn't finish it.  We ordered a few of the dishes that had received rave reviews on yelp -- the chicken tikka masala, grandpa's daal, a saag dish, and garlic naan.  I wanted to like these dishes -- even just one -- but all were unflavorful and disappointing.\nIf this restaurant were located outside the touristy Covent Garden area, I highly doubt it would survive or would earn the same *shockingly* high yelp ratings.  I would rate Punjab among the bottom tier of Indian restaurants I've eaten at in my life.\nDon't go.",

The chicken was succulent and the sauces/spices flavorful without being heavy. Good selection of wine+beers and prices quite fair for London. \nWhere Punjab truly separates itself is in its service - Amrit and his staff go to extraordinary lengths to take care of their customers. My friend lost a family heirloom in the restaurant and Amrit and a few of his staff personally helped us search for an hour-plus after close to find the ring, and sure enough it turned up!

After getting lost a few times with the damn directions on the Yelp iPhone app, we finally found it.  It's near Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus, but we kept getting turned around.  \nPunjab is a very nice, classy restaurant. The wait staff were friendly and quick.  There were a lot of people eating there too.  Good mixed crowd and even some customers of Indian decent were eating there, so it looked promising.  Nothing on the menu really jumped out at us, so we ordered spinach paneer, rice, and garlic naan.  The food was not bad, but nothing to knock my socks off.  It was pricey too.  Sorry, but I've had better Indian food in Artesia and at more affordable prices.  Maybe next time I have to try an Indian restaurant in London that is a off the beaten path and not near the touristy part of town.  I would've thought they had a Little India section in London too, but either it doesn't exist or I couldn't find it.",

Service is exceptional. \nThe average curry dish is about 8-9 quids, which is a fine range for restaurants in the Covent Garden area and reasonable for the quality of the food. \nThe curries are flavorful, though it is not the very saucy kind, in case you are someone who enjoys the curry sauce more than the meats in the curry. \nThe tandoori dishes are fantastic; very juicy. Generally, Punjab does exceptional meats, whether grilled or in curry--very tender and juicy. Try the mixed grill for sure! \nFor folks who want cheaper curry and the super saucy kind in a smaller place, you might consider Tiger Spice.",

It was almost impossible to use the naan for dipping in sauce or using to eat the food on my plate.\nI don't know if I will go back or recommend to others for the price.\n16+ GBP for the above items.  I ate all the food but didn't get full, so beware if you have a big appetite you may need to order a 2nd dish or several naan.\nThe staff however was very nice, helpful and attentive.  One waiter saw that I was about finished with my rice and naan and politely asked me if I would like more.  But at 3.50p an order I declined.",

They have a near magical knack of seating groups of people even when the restaurant looks entirely full, and make really great Indian food.\n As a veggie, my favourite dishes here are the 'pumpkinettes' (on the menu it assures diners that 'Punjabis go crazy for these miniatures pumpkins'), the special kali daal and the aubergine dishes. The bread is also superb - much lighter and crispier than naan at your average curry house.\n A great place where I'm sure I'll be coming back for many years!",

The restaurant itself is a delight, comfortable and welcoming with loads of character and the service was impeccable. However the food, which was the main reason I was there, was good, but not great.\nBest of the dishes was the Pudina Gossht, Lamb marinated in fresh mint cooked with herbs and spices and green peppers. The lamb was succulent and the spicing delicate it was good but not historic. However, the Methi Murgha, chicken with cooked fresh fenugreek, was bland, the pillau had a dirty flavor to it that matched its grayish colour and the bhindi masala was unremarkable.\nGreat atmosphere, whether you're dating or doing business, but there is much better Punjabi food to be had. Maybe dinner is better than lunch for some reason but I won't be going back to find out.",

I'm a huge fan of good Indian food but this was only alright, average really. \nMaybe I was a little annoyed because we all ordered nan but only half of us actually got any. But there was an over-abundance of rice. I got a half a piece of plain nan and believe me, that is not enough. My veggie korma was only really korma inspired and lacked a depth of flavour. \nThe service was far from spectacular  especially since our bill came to over £20 more than it should have been and we all paid a good bit extra to make up for it. Sorry Punjab, this was a fail for me.",

When the food is absolutely tasty, the atmosphere is nice and I get excellent service, I am sold.  \nThe place is very large so they seem to always have a table.

We also had a lovely stuffed aubergine which I had never seen offered elsewhere.  I also appreciated that the food wasn't overly greasy (my proof is always when I bring home the leftovers and take them out of the fridge the next day and you can see the fat congeal).

There were lots of us at the restaurant and I felt like they were quite accommodating and patient with our table.\nOn Lizzie's recommendation I went for the fall off the bone butter chicken which was yummy- tangy and spicy and extremely dippable- in fact we ended up using uneaten bits of naan off other people's plate to mop our sauce.  The perswari naan was sweet but not too sweet, though I like mine with fruit in it, so slightly disappointed it was only sweeterned nuts.\nThe only thing is they gave us bottled water instead of tap (as we requested) and that the poor server's arm was too short to reach over the other side of the table.  \nI think Tayyabs is still much better, despite the lack of service and infinitely cheaper too.  So there you go.  Punjab, I will probably be back if looking for curry in town, but I'd rather make the trip and go east.",

I won't spoil it but if you read the descriptions you'll find it hard not to crack a smile or five.\nAnd the food, what most restaurants are famous for... I had the kadu-puri for starters (after the obligatory poppadoms of course!) and it was soooooo good. A light and slightly crispy pastry/batter filled with curried pumpkin yumminess.\nAfter that I had a try of three vegetable curries which were all cooked very well and had an abundance of flavour without being so hot that I couldn't enjoy them.\nThe one thing that stood out as a negative, however, was that as a vegetarian, whilst there were a lot of options, I felt that a lot of them are what in a lot of other places you'd find as side dishes. I kind of felt like something was missing, like I'd missed the main course and gone straight for the extras. That's not to say it didn't taste great or that I left still feeling hungry, but when I go back I'll see if there's not something I can order with a bit more substance.\nPrices? We all had poppadoms, mains, rice, naan and alcohol and paid a little over £20 per head. In other words, not cheap, but not bad, and certainly worth it.",

My lone complaint is that they pushed our table in a bit cramped in order to keep a main aisle open, but really that's a trivial thing.

We asked to sit by a window but we were told that that table was for 4 and we were 3 so we should sit at a table for 3. They did concede after the blast of air conditioning was raised as an issue - kind of spoiled the feeling of a treat out. Courteous interactions were sparse throughout the rest of the meal but I remember the food being good. The loos was unisex - good for some, but  in a relatively small space.",
