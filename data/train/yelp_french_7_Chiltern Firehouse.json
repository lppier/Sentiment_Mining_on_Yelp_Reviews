For starters, the Caesar salad is a must and the Beef Tartar unique (do I detect liver? Foie Gras?). The night we went, the oyster selection was Irish and both kinds were just sooooo good; I could eat dozens of these, but tonight was not an oyster night.\nFor mains we had the Staffordshire beef fillet, Iberian pork and Tandoori Monkfish. See picture - each perfectly cooked.\nHad such a fun waiter, and all the staff were spunky and gracious. Just had a very good time; getting a resy here isn't the easiest, but worth it!",

Chiltern Firehouse is one of a kind due to hands-on management.\n***Continue for personal highlights.***\nDizzy from jet lag and unpacking in my cute room on the 3rd floor the enthusiastic & elegant staff accommodated my late lunch holding a corner table alas, unsuitable for people watching. They prepared a new table for me and their suave staff's baroque politeness was beautifully theatrical as I absorbed the London vibe, fantastic.\nFirst meal was fish, some veggies a salad? Was jet lagged as hell & siped champagne for restorative purposes (hee hee) when I spied the super duper famous  ____, cheers.  I'd say more about that but what happens at the Chiltren Firehouse stays there. \nBeing a girl who lives near Twitter's headquarters I appreciate their no selfies standard, bravo. You're not in American there, hooray.\nDuring my stay at the hotel, a London native pal and I ate at the bar &  shared a bottle of bubbly, fries, those delectable crab donuts the fried chicken thingies their bar food is an American dream:  Euro-size portions at posh-American prices, wink, cool, I kept my figure didn't gain any weight on vacation. Seriously.\n I ordered room service several times and it was better than most San Francisco restaurants. Worth every considerable penny paid. Their green juice and French press coffee is amazing.\nMy well-appointed room with the automatic authentic fireplace and an old-school rotary phone was very quiet one of the best I've stayed in.\nChiltern Firehouse is a Benetton ad come to life with pretty smiling happy elegant as hell employees, do they breed them? Am I rambling? Yes, as I flew 10,000 miles round trip to stay & eat there especially as a warm up to see the Tina Turner musical (swoon) and meet Ruby Wax  (humblebrag but damn, Tina Turner and an Andre Balazs joint?).\n5 Stars. Money very well spent for this American chick!",

I recommend the trout ceviche, steak salad and raspberry pavlova, these were my favorites out of all the other dishes.",

                "description": "When dining at Chiltern Firehouse, make reservations in advance and tell them you'd like to sit by the chef's counter. It's quite the experience - watching the cooks prepare the food together like a well-oiled machine. From here, you get to witness everything from the meat grilling to the meticulous plating. I must also say that service here is on point. Anyone who has dined with me knows that I drink water like a race horse. Flagging down waiters for refills are thus usually a problem, but not at Chiltern.\n// Crab Stuffed Donuts (£7) - 4 stars\nOne of Nuno Mendes' signature creations, this unique snack is what the restaurant is best known for. These slider-sized donuts are filled with crab and topped with coral dusting. A great balance of sweet and savory to start the meal off.\n// Firehouse Caesar (£12) - 3 stars\nWhat separates this dish out from all the other Caesar salads is the crispy chicken skin they include. Flavor-wise, I didn't think it was anything special though.\n// Spiced Cornish Crab & Lobster Omelette (£26) - 4 stars\nThis is not your typical scrambled omelette. As seen in the picture, the ingredients actually sit on top of the eggs rather than being mixed in. The coral mayo helped pull all the components together, with the shiso leaves adding in a nice touch.\n// Frozen Apple Panna Cotta (£9) - 5 stars\nI debated for the longest time whether or not to order this dessert, but I'm sure glad I went for it. Such a beautifully plated finale. I especially enjoyed the herb granite, which was spectacular both visually and in taste.",

Even when we were on time, we were told to wait at the bar for the table. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was really good. I haven't had such a tasty Blood Mary in ages. Almost more than 30 minutes, when we asked whether the table was ready, we were told that it was ready but the waitress couldn't find us. Weird! \nWe ordered few starters and oysters. The starters came on time and then we were served the mains. The Cornish crab omelette is a must try! When my friend enquired about the Oyesters, the waitress said that she had totally forgotten to serve it. So she will bring it after the mains. Again weird!\nThe chef himself brought the Oyesters to the table and explained us about the Oyesters, which was very kind of him. They were pretty good.\nOverall a good experience with food. The service is not efficient.",

Way too much mayonnaise.  Do not order these.\nTempura Aubergine was tasteless served cold, and sauce was \"supposed\" to be miso.  Did not taste a drop of miso.  Very bland sauce.\nChargrilled Padron Peppers, were NOT chargrilled, hot, tasty.  No salt, a whispering of ricotta salata did not give any additional flavor.  They needed Maldon salt, but cold and watery they were.  Very disappointed in food.\nBurger quality was poor, overcooked tough meat. Fries were warm, but tasted perhaps frozen from restaurant supply??? \nJust mediocre foods  at best.\nThen to make matters worse a bearded bartender was extremely rude to me when i was taking a photo of bar, which was empty!! He said \"you can not take photos!  Such a stern rude voice, and i did not understand, so he repeated quite rudely again.  So he then says hotel policy, i relied i understand.  But why was i treated like this.  How was i to know?  No signs, no clue... so perhaps the next time he interacts with guests like this perhaps a softer voice, a nicer approach and not such a horrible glare.  I almost left.   In a way i should of considering the food and rude bartender.  Waitress was adorable sweet, soft and kind mannerism.",

It is a pretty fancy place to dine and there is a dress code - No trainers or flip flops! Casual smart is fine. People who show up there can be quite dressy. If you are lucky,  you might run into a celebrity :) Unfortunately I've never had the chance to bump into any local movie stars during my visits. Bummer!!\nI had dinner on my first visit and it was on weekday with a group of 3pax. It was hard to get a booking, and you might want to do this in advance especially if it's near a festive season. We tried to increase our group size to 4pax at the very last minute over the phone but were politely rejected. So don't just show up with a +1 at the door, you might not even get your table. \nUpon arrival they ushered me to the table and took my coats and jackets. Immediately sat me down and made me comfy. Then proceeded to recommend me a cocktail which would pair well with our food. I enjoyed my first experience so much that I decided to make a second comeback with my partner for a Christmas brunch over the weekend. It took me about a good month in advance to book a slot, dinner slots were completely wiped out till 2017. \nI must say I was a little disappointed with their service the second time around. I did not receive the same hospitality as I did for dinner. The staff seem a little flustered that day, nothing was really offered nor recommended to us. It felt like that they were a little short handed. What a shame though, I was hoping to give my partner the same level of experience I had the first time but it wasn't up to that level. Nevertheless the food and drinks were still amazing. However it would be great if they maintain consistency with their services.",

The venue is also a hotel, so there are many hallways to walk down. The restaurant is bright and open and has a distinctive smoky smell. \nI was extremely excited to try their pancakes. THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!!! The pancakes are thick and fluffy and taste like thick American pancakes. The blueberries, blueberry compote, syrup, and yogurt topping all come on the side so you can add what you would like to. I highly recommend getting the pancakes. \nThe pastries are also lovely. My mother got the croissants and loved them, but they are very large so next time, it might be better to get the selection of miniature pastries instead. \nThe orders of toast are rather small so one order is only enough for one person, but it is sourdough toast and is amazing!\nThey also have several delicious juices. The fresh pressed apple juice was amazing.  Additionally, they have drip coffee that is pretty good.",

I love counter seating, so this worked out perfectly.\nThe decor was impeccably chic as expected, based on other Andre Balazs joints (Chateau Marmont, The Mercer). The food and service, however, were world class as well. The ever-changing menu really focused on seasonal ingredients, so we took advantage of that.\nWe started with the asparagus, which was appropriately light despite the mountain of egg yolk shavings that adorned it. For a main, I went with the gnocchi, which was accompanied by a flawless presentation of taleggio, raisins, spring peas, and rounds of fennel. It was spring on a plate, and I am still thinking about it 2 weeks later.",

Food was great, service was spot on and atmosphere was really fun. Met some cool people sitting next to us and decided to get the check and go to the bar in the hotel attached,also apart of chiltern firehouse. This is where the whole night took a wild turn. \nAfter we got in ,the hostess, Amy Cuff, came up and notified us we would only be allowed one drink and would need to leave immediately after because the bar was \"private\" and since the hotel was packed they \"needed the room\" for hotel guests. Which we were with. \nJust FYI. The bar was empty....\nWe tried to order another dink from the EMPTY bar and the bartender said very apologetically the hostess notified him we were allowed one drink and then require to leave. \nBirthday ruined. Never coming back. Ladder Shed London. You failed.",

Had to have second each despite generous pour. Then shared spiced watermelon, steak tartare & Iberian bbq pork. Could have order seconds on all but instead tried four desserts, all fab.

I don't know but if I am not good enough to have a drink at the bar I am not going to buy fine wine and posh chow in the restaurant\nAll the best for the future",

I was dining alone on vacation and informed them to offer me a spot at the bar or whatever they had a available.  I was able to sit at the chefs counter and get a full on show of them cooking everyones food.  I have to say the place inside and out was gorgeous and the service was great.  Yes, it's a bit pricey and that's why I have given 4 stars because I'm not sure if the food equals out to the hefty tag.  The food looks delicious and is prepared in detail but my salmon was a little too firm, as was the roe on it and the crab donuts were good but not spectacular.  I also had a chocolate cake which was delicious.  Overall great experience to check off the London bucket list but not sure I would immediately rush back next time I'm in town.",

                "description": "This place has a reputation for being the place to see and be seen, but while the environment was \"active\", it seemed overall fine and not overly pretentious.  Really nice European classic environment with a fun bar, great multi-level seating and some unique spaces.  Really nice.  Also seemed to have a front patio that would be a great place to eat (weird that nobody was out there after about 7PM).\nWe had a private party (in a nice, if snug, dining room at the front of the restaurant) and the food and the service were really amazing.\nWhile we didn't order, per se, we were delighted with an assortment of courses from across the menu...\nBacon Cornbread:  Um, delicious.\nCauliflower Florets:  Seriously savory.  Really great.\nCrab-stuffed Donuts:  Not the best...  seemed to struggle to go together.\nFried Chicken:  Seriously amazing.  Really, the best bite we had all night.\nWe thought we were near done at this point, but way more to come:\nFirehouse Caesar:  Yay anchovies!!\nSteak Tartare: Mix it up first, then eat.  Great flavors.  So rich.  Wow.\nMullet or Cod Crudo (can't remember which):  Light and flavorful\nGnocchi:  \n...and the mains:\nMonkfish:  We were getting late in the meal and had a lot of this.  Really amazing.\nLamb (I think it was the lamb...):  Decent, but not amazing.  Obviously forgetful.\nI have a huge pet peeve about restaurants serving a very limited set menu for larger parties, so great that these guys gave us a really comprehensive and varied tour around their menu.  Much appreciated.\nOne critique is that the whole thing could have been salted a bit more.  Other than that, really a perfect meal.  Kudos to this place for not letting food quality slip given the reputation.",

The interior is beautiful, with an heir of classic French brasserie but with a contemporary London twist. Reservations are a must considering the hefty crowd during peak hours. The service was top notch from start to finish, and our server was very knowledgable on the menu and helped us on deciding what to order. We had the cornbread appetizer as well as a salad to start, both delicious. The short rib entree was wonderful and beautifully cooked. My favorite thing on the menu however was the black truffle polenta, very unique and sinful. Dessert consisted of some sort of cake with an ice cream that was also very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the Firehouse; everything from the food, to the service, to the ambience was just fabulous. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to London.",

Wine list was terrific! \nThe reason for only 4 stars? We had to wait for 15 mins for our table at the bar, but there aren't enough bar tables & the area was small.

My last trip through the UK and it's my first meal in town after a long ass flight. My hotel isnt ready so i get on the tube and lo and behold the station i need is closed. Ive got a large backpack and jacket and as i exit the next station to circle back and then walk a few K its getting hot. Of all the times in London for this to happen..\nI walk to the streets and finally get there. Im shown to a space that is looking right at the pass. Perfect. Ive been up for 20 hours and can finally settle. It turns out my server is an ex Dinex guy and worked for Daniel and his mix of restos in NYC. Good start. Im watching as they furiously plate and cook, and expedite. This is a furiously busy kitchen. I then meet Sebastian one of the sous chefs and he's talking about his time traveling, cooking and finally ending up at Chiltern. He makes some suggestions and im on my way. For some reason there's a mix up and someone  approaches with a Bloody Mary. Ive been up way too long but im sure i didnt order it. But What the hell i said id take it anyways if it didnt belong to another ticket. I dont generally like them but realized after how excellent the first sip was that ive been drinking sub par ones for who knows how long. Score.\nMy food starts coming out and a couple of older dodded up ladies sit near me then start complaining about how they want a booth and were disappointed in that thats what they shouldve had. My server takes it graciously and says he'll talk to the reservationists. They are moved soon after. Thank goodness. Dont think i could have dealt with that. I have a chat with my server and he says the place has become somewhat of a hot spot and that people come to be seen and watch. As someone who's here for a Michelin starred chefs cooking, the best seats are at the pass! Soon a gentleman is sat next to me and we agree on the same topic. Turns out he's just as obsessive with food as i am and is a regular here. I recommend the carrot dessert which is unusual, complex and ultimately delicious. We are now food allies.\nAside from the carrot dessert, the beef and veggie hash and the dry aged burger and fries are fantastic, comforting and have their own delicious twist. Service was excellent and as someone who is not famous and was treated very well. I think having a rapport with the kitchen also helped greatly but when it's about the food, that's how you focus. I guess if youre a scene person, just dont act like those ladies...",

The decor inside is lovely but finding the actual restaurant once you've entered the premise is a bit of a maze. It could do with some signposting or a person guiding patrons through. Though we had a reservation at 2:00- we were told to wait for 25 mins.  When we were sat I promptly ordered the peach mint champagne spritzer. It didn't end up arriving until after the food which was crazy- also served in a highball glass which I felt the presentation could have been better. The food was flavoursome but portions are small for the price. I ordered the eggs florentine and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict. The eggs florentine was flavoursome but I can't attest to saying it was anything out of the ordinary. My friend and I shared a stack of the pancakes which we both enjoyed and we were glad we ordered as did not feel full from our egg dishes. Service was consistent and decor inside is lovely however I wouldn't rush to come back here- expensive and nothing out of the ordinary.",

                "description": "Booking: Either the mass panic bookings of 2014 have passed, or I was one of the lucky ones that didn't seem to have a problem getting a table for Dinner at Chiltern Firehouse. Was offered a place at the Chef's Counter on the phone, which I took (and recommend you ask for!). \nArrival: Staff were friendly and courteous, and we grabbed some champagne at the bar while our table was being readied. Apart from quite a few Russian oligarchs, the bar was wells stocked with 12, 18 and 25year Japanese whiskeys, and some decent champagne options.\nSearing: We were originally sat at a normal table, but pushed correctly to be placed as booked at Chef Counter. CC is a little less formal, and requires sitting on a high stool with less leg room; so if you have a long leggy date (in a dress or otherwise) you may want to save it for next time. That said, it's the best table at the Firehouse; watching the speed and precision of the appetiser area, with the giant meat grill & smoking each behind, was a great conversation piece. The chef's ears perked up while we were chatting about what he was doing, and gave us a taste while explaining everything. The man was insanely busy, so that small gesture was truly special.\nFood: \n+ Crab Donuts have a well earned reputation as a 'must have'. Only three of them but delicious.\n+ Streak Tartare: a late summer sun sat on the tartare, that you beat into each other to give a very rich dish. The Firehouse hot sauce, a smoked spicy apple flavour, was insanely delicious. I would literally buy bottles of it alone. \n+ Calamari: now off the summer menu, it was still delicious, fresh and not even remotely rubbery.\n+ Main: credit to the waiter, he recommended we share the day's special of 300g Wagu beef with a wasabi-yogurt sauce and rocket salad (possibly as it was also £78). We paired it up with the Maple-Bourbon Sweet Potatoes (which is a mash, not fries). All I can say is the beef was succulent and tender, perfectly medium-rare; but the sweet potatoes mash- my god. Nearly too sweet, but I was licking (secretly) the copper bowl it arrived it (which is straight from the hot plate, so watch out). More. I wanted more. \n+/- Dessert: Key lime pie was lovely. The hint of bitterness was exactly what was needed after the rich meal. My companion had re fudge cake; a classic, but didn't blow me away. Tastes differ I guess! \n+ Wine: Glass of Pecorino, my choice and the waiter's favourite (being Italian). \n+ Service: solid and attentive. Waiter recognised me from somewhere else and told me at then end of the night, which was nice, and didn't mind having a conversation that didn't make you feel he was being nice for the sake of tips. \n- Other: exit later in the evening is out the side entrance by the hotel, though a franky dull corridor near the hotel area, into the side street. Just... Why? Makes you feel you are being turfed out into the gutter. \nSecret suggestion: find the smoking area past the toilets with the lipstick all over it. Meet some celebs. There are other bits, but unless you are a master class blagger or engine celeb, g'luck :)",

I was happy to get the reservation that I wanted, and pulling up to the restaurant in our taxi, it definitely felt like I had arrived at someplace special.  \nThe building is awesome, and the decor of the restaurant is fabulous.  We were shown to a great table, and everyone at the host stand seemed nice but a bit aloof -- to be expected, I guess.  However, our wait staff was amazing -- friendly, knowledgeable, and fun!  The food was terrific, though nothing I probably couldn't have had elsewhere, including San Francisco where I live.  The reason to come here is a combo of the food, the service, and the vibe and energy of the restaurant.  Make it a destination on your next London visit!",

Alas it was not to be and I left sans Kylie as a new bff (her loss obvs).\nFirstly, the staff they hire are all gorgeous and friendly.  Our waiter had the most beautifully perfect set of teeth combined with a great French accent that we all couldn't help but gaze into his lovely smile.  And our Sommelier was just charming.  The wine she helped us choose was a perfect match to our food.\nThe food was a little disappointing.  I ordered the crab donuts, steak tartare, and Grilled Iberico Pork for mains.  Crab donuts were okay but surprisingly not very much crab.  Steak tartare was definitely the highlight as this was served with a deliciously spicy smoked sauce that made the raw beef sing.  Iberico pork was very disappointing.  While the pork itself was perfectly tender and tasty, the accompaniments were a green, sour, slushy mess and did nothing to enhance or compliment the pork.\nFor the price we paid, I wouldn't rush back in a hurry.",

                "description": "Made a reservation about a month in advance with no problem.  Was looking forward to a great meal with family.  The decor is definitely interesting as it still houses the vestiges of its prior firehouse incarnation.  There was a young and hip vibe with the clientele and we looked forward to a relaxing dinner.   The waitstaff was attractive and efficient, but certainly not warm or inviting.  The food came quickly and looked beautiful, but it lacked deep flavor, and the fish was overcooked and dry.  We seemed to be in a high traffic area (somewhat near the bar) and while many waitstaff ran past our table, our waiter was quite scarce.  Water glasses were left unfilled, and wine was not poured as needed.  \nOverall,  that Chiltern is quite consistent.  From the moment that you arrive you will enjoy the look of the venue, the beauty of the staff, and the presentation of the food.  At the same time, the venue, staff and food lack any real depth and all seem to be going through the motions.  There are too many good food choices in London to pay top dollar at Chiltern Firehouse, only to leave feeling like something important was missing.",

We were on vacation visiting my brother who works in London and he recommended we go to Chiltern Firehouse for our Thanksgiving dinner.\nWe were extremely lucky to get a reservation through a friend and it was definitely worth the ask! That night they had a Thanksgiving themed menu with the best sweet potato mash I've ever had. But the crown jewel of the night was our sommelier who went above and beyond bringing us different wines to taste, and obviously we obliged and ordered the bottles because his recommendations were impeccable.\nIf you get a chance to dine here I promise you won't be disappointed! The service and ambience was very refreshing, especially since it's such a hyped scene.",

The key lime pie was out of this world and so innovative, it was a shell with a creamy filling and ton of flavor. \nI love the ambiance of this place and some of London's finest agree too.

                "description": "My friend managed to snag this booking months in advance- don't ask me how it's done! London's hottest restaurant is frequented by celebrities who hail from near and far. Unfortunately on a Monday night, none of them were in sight, but the paparazzi were camped outside the entrance nonetheless. Upon arrival, I was greeted by no less than 5 members of staff before I even reached the hostess, and I was shown to my table immediately to await my friends. \nThey have a lovely cute drinks/snack menu for those who are waiting, and the starters on there are different than the proper starters you can later order with dinner. And the one thing that struck me is that Chiltern is surprisingly affordable- you can get a glass of wine for £5, a bottle of wine for under £25, starters for £15ish, desserts for under £10, and mains are in the £25-30 range generally. We ordered the crab-filled doughnuts as a snack and got the Grenache blanc for wine... I don't think you can go wrong with the wine list, it's just a matter of price, and the doughnuts came highly recommended and the innovation did not disappoint.  \nAs a starter, I ordered the grilled octopus (served with aubergine, daikon, and mushrooms) with a lovely miso sauce. One of my friends ordered the sea trout crudo, which was basically sashimi served with some sort of fish roe (I am not into that, but if that is your sort of thing, you'd probably like it). For my main, I got the spring lamb, served with black garlic, goat's curd, and grilled lettuce. The goat's curd was interesting... it was like a sour cream kind of taste and texture. Unfortunately one of my friends ordered the roasted turbot and she got food poisoning later in the night, and we think that is the reason why. And for the dessert, there is a frozen panna cotta that was positively divine... you definitely have to try it! I also had the tokaji dessert wine which was the perfect finish. \nOverall, it was a great experience, but I just had to mention the food poisoning but I hope the restaurant makes amends! Other than that, the venue is surprisingly normal and there is no need for normal people to be intimidated :)",

We'd barely been sat down two minutes before they had rushed over to take our order, and the food was as quickly set onto the table in front of us.   \nHonestly, I can't fault the food - it was well presented, well cooked and tasted lovely, however I wouldn't say it was any better than some other cheaper restaurants in London. When you're paying such a high price tag, you would expect something a little more mind blowing than what we were served. The champagne cocktails were probably the highlight of the meal, while the coffee was weak and a little tasteless.   \nWould I recommend this place? Sure, if only for the experience of saying you've been and done a little celeb spotting while you were at it - but sadly I feel that's probably the best feature of the place.",

The Venison Sausage Rolls was flavoursome and tasty. The Crab doughnuts. Now these were raved upon by many upon research and they are OK.\n- They have some lovely house wine (so much so we continued to drink another bottle after)\n- We sat at a table but the area where the chefs cook you can sit at.\n- The Garden as you enter. Sat outside after eating and enjoying over hearing conversations amongst the rich.\n- It's situated in a lovely area of Marylebone. Right opposite one of my fav places to unwind (Monocle Cafe).\nCONS:\n- The tables all feel a bit too tightly compact to one another.\n- It all feel a bit stiff. Maybe it feels like the place to be seen rather than a place to go eat well. And I really couldn't wait to dine at somewhere Nuno Mendes was head chef.\n- The eggs Benedict. Biscuit instead of muffin. I really would prefer a posh English muffin than an American dry biscuit. Disappointed to say the least.\n- The Lobster Scrambled Eggs. Was horrible in all honesty. One way of ruining an expensive ingredient with one of the most simple. Avoid.\nThe problem with places like this is that the 'buzz', 'hype' and 'reputation' sometimes proceeds itself. And for those prices and mark up it is not worth it in terms of value. Unless of course you saw David Beckham or some world star perhaps... ;)",

We already had reservations elsewhere and just wanted to pop in for a drink.  My date had noticed the cool lighting outside in the courtyard, and like moths, we were drawn in.  We managed to visit one of the coolest bars and have some of the best drinks we've had in London.  I didn't say this was the cheapest place, but you definitely get what you pay for.",

If you dont get in at least you can have a glass of prosecco, people watch and check out the beautiful space.",

We had the most amazing meal, each plate was better than the last, and they even gave us dessert, on the house, because we were celebrating our honeymoon. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. The sommelier paired the perfect wine with our meal and the bar tenders make a mean dirty martini (hard to come by in London, if you can believe it). The ambience was warm, inviting and very romantic! We will definitely be returning on our next trip to London.",

This new space is warm and sexy and has a sense of place -- similar to Viajante. Now that it's less of a trek to get to, it seems to be a magnet for famous people. But you should go here because it is great and lovely. The ceiling looks like it is covered with the burlap strap woven bottoms of the seats of antique chairs. \nSit at the \"chef's table\" (the bar) and watch the action at a 10+ foot long stove, custom made by some company in America. Getting that shipped out must have been quite an undertaking.\nThe cocktail list is incredible. I was waiting for my dining companion and enjoyed what I believe was called \"love in a cold place\" -- all of my favorite things in a glass. \nI'd had the Iberico pork steak at one of the Portuguese nights at Viajante, and it was great here, too. \nSadly no frozen olive oil candies, but they do give you some chocolates to finish the meal.\nGluten-free notes: Many (half or more) of the dishes on the menu are gluten-free. They know what gluten is and can help you out. Unfortunately no freshly baked cumin rolls like Viajante had.",

                "description": "Everything about this restaurant exceeded expectations.  I was afraid it would be a tad over hyped and it wasn't.  We ate at the chef's counter because we were not able to get a reservation for a regular table and I am glad we had this experience which allowed us to watch the chefs in action.  The atmosphere is great and the service is impeccable, friendly, and unpretentious.  The food was outstanding as well.  The zucchini starter, the crab donuts, the caesar salad, the pumpkin gnocchi, and the chicken were all delicious.  These are very talented chefs, serving quality food with very fresh ingredients in an unpretentious setting.  We even purchased the cookbook and attempted to make a reservation for the next evening (unfortunately they were booked solid, but I can see why)  This isn't one of those places that makes it difficult to get a reservation to appear desirable... the food is that good and the reservation dept will do their best to accommodate you.  Next time our travels take us to London I am making sure to make at least one reservation at this restaurant.  I live in New York City and I have never had service this welcoming and accommodating at any restaurant.  When we were leaving they called a cab for us and held an umbrella over my fiance as we walked out of the building.  These small gestures all helped make a great experience.",

                "description": "It was our second last night in London and we were looking for chic London cuisine-Both Foursquare and Yelp pointed us towards The Chilton Firehouse.  After zigzagging through the streets for quite a while we finally found it.  Speaking to the Maitre d' we were lucky enough to secure two seats at the chef's table. We were greeted very warmly by Rafal who would be our server for the evening.  We started out with a wonderful full bodied Italian red. The first course chosen was the crab stuffed donuts which proved to be light and delicious.  The second course chosen was the pumpkin porridge-truly fantastic with hazelnuts and chestnuts on top.  Perfect balance! Growing up eating wild game my father hunted I was thrilled to find venison on the menu which was enthusiastically encouraged by Rafal. It was such a pleasure to watch the hustle of the kitchen as everyone worked fluidly to create some exquisite looking plates-every dish was tended to like a work of art! The venison(ordered medium rare) did not disappoint! Smoky, juicy and balanced out with a pecan pesto and a teriyaki-glazed chard. Every bite was beyond delectable! After asking us a few questions, Rafal suggested the frozen apple pannacotta for dessert and it couldn't have been more perfect! Rafal's charm and wit made our experience incredibly enjoyable. As the meal came to a close Rafal brought a picture perfect cappuccino that tasted as perfect as it looked. Shifting to the bar for a nice after dinner drink-a special Zacapa rum was chosen. The bartenders were equally wonderful, charming and a joy to watch as they mixed endless cocktails with precision and ease. Our experience will be talked about for a very long time! THANK YOU!",

They told us we had to be finished in 2 1/2 hours which was a pity because we would have stayed on and had desert and more drinks. I'm not a fan of restaurants that move you out, especially if you're spending big as we were. Cocktails were very nice. Starters of crab donuts and octopus were excellent but main courses were just ok. Maple sweet potato mash was the consistency of baby food and far too sweet. Could only taste maple. Sadly, all the food was totally over salted. The whole table said so. Apart from the crab donuts (which were gorgeous), octopus and maple mash everything, without exception was salty and this is coming from people who love highly-seasoned food. Still, service and atmos was good enough that we'll be back. Also, it's a shame they save the pretty courtyard as a \"sacred space\" for hotel guests. It remained more or less completely empty whereas we could have been continuing our evening and spending money!",

Not sure why it has such a following and not sure why the paparazzi didn't photograph me, but oh well.\nThe place is very pretty and if you can get near the seats by the kitchen that looks to be fun.  The space is very pretty although lacks soul and the women all walk around in these monochrome brightly colored jumpsuits that look like they are from Star Trek.  Bizarre.\nFor those that had been to Viajante, expect something very different--whereas Viajante was very creative, experimental and playful--this is much more subtle, orchestrated and refined.  Crab donuts, octopus appetizer, the pork and fish dishes were all very good.  No complaints.  But I wasn't wowed over either.\nWith all the celeb buzz good luck getting in, but sit back and enjoy if you do.",

After we enjoyed champaign by the glass, our sommelier did a great job recommending a beautiful bottle of Burgundy Pinot Noir.  Dessert wine was also great.  Service was excellent.  Servers were amazingly attentive for such a packed restaurant.  I will be happy to go back.",

I ordered almost everything on the menu, loved the appetizers, entrees (main) was good; but I recommend just ordering a whole bunch of appetizers and maybe one main.

Great recommendations, very knowledgable about menu items. We started with cornbread made with bacon grease served with a chipotle butter. Also has two bottles of excellent New Zealand sauvegnon blanc. Our appetizers were grilled octopus, oysters and burrata cheese. Everything was amazing. The seasonings really come out in the flavor, unbelievable. For entrees, I had the monkfish, daughter had halibut and husband and other daughter had the pork. All dishes were works of art and simply incredible. Our desserts also were to die for. We shared a key lime pie, a chocolate fish and a mandarin sorbet. We got a tour of hotel and rooms after dinner which was lovely. Great bar and intimate feel, highly recommend this place!",

The disparity between the hype and the reality of the Chiltern firehouse was so extreme it needed calling out.\nThis is a beautiful location and it's buzzing, but once inside it felt like you were part of a machine designed to get you in and out, and onto the next guest.\nAbove all, it was the lack of consistency in terms of food and service that was astounding.\nToo fast to take orders & way too slow to deliver them. Food was brought to the table out of sequence. Insipid cocktails, staff with a lack of basic knowledge on the drinks / food offering. The signature dish, 'Pork Iberico', was tough & dry and, worst of all, the 'maple sweet potato' side dish was so sweet it was inedible.\nThe whole operation appeared almost random, apparently lacking an authoritative maitre d' to ensure it flowed professionally.\nThere were several highlights, including some of the food dishes (Carrot blunts, Short rib, Octopus), but way too few to warrant the price and the reputation, especially when London has so many other great restaurants.\nThe one saving grace was our main server, who was excellent -  she was the only redemption for a venue that has built a reputation for being coolest eatery in town, yet completely lacked the attention to detail to deserve that accolade.",

The main courses we ok, but nothing spectacular. No real complaints, just nothing to write home about. While the restaurant has an excellent wine list, it is grotesquely overpriced. It's aimed towards those who want to be seen spending money, not those interested in drinking a great wine.\nOur main waiter was very friendly. However, there seems to be overall poor communication between the staff. We would ask for a drink or bread and the message never seemed to be passed on - disappointing for a restaurant of this calibre. Having to re-ask for things multiple times is tiresome. The sommelier also left something to be desire as far as friendliness goes.\nThe atmosphere and décor are lovely and comfortable. Modern European with an open kitchen.\nIf you're prepared for the fact that it's over-hyped, you'll have a good dinner.",

The place is a scene to be seen and for those to see you. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by the outside bellman/bouncers? and looked up and down before you are delivered off to another chap who walks you thorough the maze to the hostess. \nPicture this, we went for breakfast on a Monday morning with four people and there was only a handful of tables occupied with about 25 staff people milling around trying to look busy. It was amazing the number of staff present for Monday morning breakfast.\nWe place our order for breakfast, with only one request, that one of the egg dishes be cooked well done. (no running yokes) Simple enough for any breakfast cook.\nWhen the dish arrived, the yoke was still runny and we asked if we could get the order done as requested. The look and attitude that we received from the waitress was \" I told them to cook it the way you wanted\". It went back to the kitchen and was recooked.\nThen I took a bite of my french toast, it was totally raw inside, with the milk and egg oozing out. I asked another waitress if the chef could finish cooking the french toast and she brought the dish back to the kitchen.\nAbout 5 minutes later our waitress delivered us the following message from the Chef. \" I will be happy to cook you another french toast, but it will come out the same way as before\" OMG Any five year old can cook french toast!  I was ready to get up and go in the kitchen and show the chef how to make the simplest of breakfast foods.\nIt just wasn't worth the effort. \nI guess the celebs like their food un cooked. This place is not worth the time nor the effort, especially when there is such a big disconnect between the kitchen, staff and guest.\nThey obviously did not recognize who we were......\nbut I hope for all you reading this, you don't support such an unwelcoming place that can't train its staff and kitchen about basic customer service, considering they have so many people on duty.",

On top of that, they said we could get to the main bar area, and after having us spend so much money on crappy food, they did not let us in to the main bar, claiming they were at \"full capacity\".  Then when trying to leave, they tried to be \"gracious\" by hailing us a taxi out of a strange back ally.  The taxi, we realized while already on the road, was cash only, and took us on a completely round about route, which cost twice as much as any taxi we had taken for the same distance.  When we confronted the taxi driver, threatening to report him,  he gave us a discount.  \n    All and all, we had a terrible and expensive experience being ripped off at the Chiltern Firehouse.
