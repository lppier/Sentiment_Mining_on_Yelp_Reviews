                "description": "Mercury may be the Roman God of poetry, but Le Mercury is poetry in motion and London's God of value. Off the beaten path, yet worth the hike, take the Victoria Line to Highbury and Islington, turn right out of the station and walk 10 minutes to TravelValue heaven ... HOOAH!\nArriving 30 minutes before our reservation, thanks to an extremely efficient Tube journey, we were greeted warmly and seated at a table in the dark, romantic room surrounded by tables with white linen tablecloths each with a large candle on top. We started with bottles of Ochagavia (Chile - £16.95), an oaky, scrumptious cabernet sauvignon, and Hildon sparkling water (750 ml - £2.50).\nThe service impeccable, all starters are just £4.45 ($6.15) and all main courses £10.95 ($15.15 - except the steak which was £12.95 - $18), a bargain for the quality and flavor. My wife ordered the Chèvre Chaud Grilled Goats' Cheese starter with a salad garnish and basil pesto sauce and I had the Moules Marinière (mussels) in a white wine and cream sauce with \"shallots, garlic, lemon and parsley\". The goat cheese tart was tastefully presented as well as being light, yet savory, and flavorful. My mussels were plentiful for the price, but there was little sauce and what was there was a tad bland with nary a hint of the shallots, garlic or parsley as noted in the description. Still, they were flavorful and a good value.\nFor our main courses, my better half had the Asperges et Cheddar Tart, small cheddar tarts topped with asparagus spears in a balsamic reduction and a sliced avocado garnish in between the two. She did not care for the dish, as I thought might be the case, because of the balsamic vinegar which she is not a great fan of to begin with. I gave her half of my Entrecôte ă l'échalotte (grilled rib eye steak - £12.95), served in a lovely shallot and red wine sauce, along with some of my chips (fries for you Yanks - £1.95) in return her second tart. I thought that the tart was quite delicious, but I am quite fond of balsamic and the avocado garnish was a nice, complimentary addition.\nI was stuffed, so no dessert for me, but my \"sweet\"-loving wife  (she is \"sweet\" and \"loving too) had to have her favorite, Crème Brûlée (£3.45), which was a bit on the small side, but scrummy nonetheless. \nAt £63.42 ($87.90), including a 10% service charge, we ate like kings and queens, appropriately enough. A comparable meal would have easily set us back $110-$125 in the States. The sole \"Bomb\" deduction is due to the not-so-flavorful sauce the mussels came in and the damp slice of bread that came in our first basket, which they apologized for and quickly replaced.\nCombatCritic Gives Le Mercury 9 Bombs Out Of 10 ... More Bombs Are Better!",

Le Mercury is a great stand-by when you want a decent meal for a decent price. \nThe food will not wow you. Everything is a little under-seasoned and underwhelming.  And it's a super busy restaurant so don't expect a quiet intimate meal. Although the waitstaff are attentive, there is a sense that they are trying to turn tables.",

                "description": "Thought I'd save my 400th review for one of my favourite date nights out recently. This place has a cosy warm vibe like it could be somebody's house with all the potted plants dotted around. We'd booked ahead (recommended!) so they'd saved us perhaps the best table in the far corner, meaning we got to enjoy our own little cocoon while looking out onto the street (and making eyes at each other ;), instead of facing inwards and looking at all the other tables.\nThe food was quite basic but well executed, and the service smiley and efficient. The main calling card though is the price tag, with a flat price for all starters (£4ish), another for all mains (£10ish) and another for all desserts (£3ish). I haven't seen that strategy anywhere else in London, and I think it probably makes people end up spending more!\nI had the starter of grilled goat's cheese and leafy salad which was a very generous size, and the sea-bass fillet main with crushed new potatoes and mint pesto which was simple and tasty. The dark choc tart dessert was a bit meh. Cocktails are limited but the wine selection a bit wider (we made use of both).\nSo Michelin-starred cooking it is most certainly not, but for the romance of French food while saving the pennies I would definitely recommend!",

Bread came with the lunches. To have French lunch in London with the modest pricing, you got to love it.\nToo bad they don't make French Onion soup, otherwise the lunch will be just perfect!\nEnjoy!!",

Located basically in heart of the hipster suburb is a plus with quite some street shops around.\nNot exactly easy to get to but it's just around corner from both Angel and Highbury Islington is always a plus!\nFirst of all, I must say this place is just great value! Where else can you get a proper 3 course French meal for £18-22?! No where! And they are generous portion, full of flavour as well!\nFood is just great here, been to both duxumie and this a number of times and never disappoint! Top notch quality, great variety!\nI do find their cocktail menu a little lacking but I'm not a big drinker so won't complain!\nCertainly recommend a try, whether it is a fine dine with the love one or a nice evening with some friends!",

My steak was not medium rare, and the shallot sauce was very questionable. \nI was fooled by good Yelp reviews and how busy the place was (and maybe also for candles on the table)... Wish I followed my intuition after I saw cheap paper table cloth, paper napkins and that crazy, badly designed cocktail menu on the table.

                "description": "\"A beautiful story\"...? \nIt has been quite a while since I visited this well known Islington French bistro. I read some reviews that made me uncomfortable but decided to go anyway. \nle Mecury is a well known Islington Upper Street establishment. I moved to the area in 2007 and have dined here with friends on many occasions. The restaurant was always busy so after a few years they opened another on Upper Street. \nThe novelty of Le Mercury was that all the starters, mains and dessert were for a set price for their category. In 2007 the price was £3.45 for a starter and the portion was on the lower side of generous. Now the price has gone up by £1 and the portions are smaller. However this is inflation for you. After all Islington property prices have skyrocketed in that time. \nThe food in general is good. My terrine was with spicy beetroot relish was nothing novel but tasted good. The salmon with new potatoes was well made. The salmon skin was fried perfectly and was crunchy while the fish was succulent. The creme brule was creamy with a hard sugar coating, as expected, and tasted excellent though maybe a bit smaller than I remembered. My wife also enjoyed her dishes of ravioli for starter, this apparently is the plural and should be raviolo as there was just one piece, and mushroom risotto. However the sticky toffee pudding was not very sticky, maybe best not to have English dishes at a French bistro :-)\nThe service by the waitress was excellent. Yale, originally from Paris, was attentive and was happy to hear my mumblings about living in the area... Hence the title to my review \"a beautiful story\" which is to quote her. Of course there was no question in Yale's comment but I found it amusing that she used that phrase to describe my uninteresting story. The manager could possibly learn a bit more about a friendly demeanour from her. \nIs Le Mecury special? It used to be a different place to go in upper Street that was very affordable. Now however it is competing with alot of newer and exotic establishments. The paint and food might be a bit too tired for the younger professionals moving to the area. However I see no reason to disparage this still quaint establishments which is well worth a visit.",

The Ravioli de la Mer was excellent although you only get one Ravioli so don't expect to fill up on it. The sauce on the Ravioli was to die for. We soaked it all up with the generous bread basket. Entrees were Sea Bass (allegedly) that looked nothing like any Sea Bass I have ever eaten. It honestly looked and tasted like trout. That is what kept me from giving a five star review. My companion had the duck which was exquisite! Cooked perfectly and tender and juicy with crispy skin. Just as you would expect from a high end restaurant. I would definitely come here again.",

Everything was outstanding. The atmosphere is also very nice--kinda like a nice cafe style vibe. On one hand, it's elegant with candle lit tables and on the other it's not too pretentious. \nMy only complaint is that the service felt a bit rushed. The restaurant wasn't too full and after some deliberating we decided it was because the service was poorly organized. Both waiters/waitresses were very attentive, but since they didnt seem to have control over one area and both worked the whole floor it meant that we got asked twice about everything and didnt get much breathing space. For example, we asked to have some more time to look at the menu, but someone was there asking for our orders two minutes later. This was my only complaint and the reason why they only received four stars.\nHowever, overall it was a very good experience at a great price and I wouldnt hesitate to come back!",

I came here last week to catch up with a friend and was very impressed. The candlelit atmosphere is dim and intimate with very cool decor. \nMy friend and I decided to split a starter, Ravioli de la Mer, which was a lovely crayfish and lobster ravioli. It's perfect for one person, but since we split it we basically got a bite each. I decided to order the Magret de Canard (duck breast), which was really good. I loved the garlic mash that came with it! My friend ordered the Selle d'Agneau au Romarin (lamb), which was also fantastic! For dessert, we each got our own. I went with the mascarpone cheesecake and he went with the creme brulee. They weren't amazing, but still good nonetheless. \nI'd say it's the perfect date spot without having the break the bank. Great atmosphere and most importantly, great food!",

                "description": "Cheap, French food? Is there such a thing?\nYes, there is.\nAfter going to around 7 or 8 SportDirect stores all over London (my brother really wants this particular track jacket), I was exhausted, but it seemed a bit too late for dinner -- 10 pm on a Tuesday. However, I was hungry, and after shopping for the entire day, I really did not have many pounds left. Le Mercury was highly rated on Yelp, and it was still open (I called), so I made my decision. Let me tell you: best decision of that day.\nFor one, they were able to accommodate me. Granted, I was coming in on central London, and I had called around 9 pm to see if there was any availability for one. Once I was there, I easily got a seat. The host and the hostess recognized my voice on the phone (damn my American accent) and were incredibly hospitable. I've eaten at Michelin starred restaurants, but the service I received was just the same -- at fraction of the menu prices.\nThey have a set menu that you can find on the website, so I knew I was going to have the duck, but they also had specials which were written on the chalkboard above the bar. Everything seemed delicious. I listened to their recommendations, which was the seafood ravioli, which I gobbled up in a matter of seconds (I told you I was hungry). I was blown away at the fast service, and I guess the waitress knew the look on my face as she said, \"we tend to be fast here\". Maybe it was the fact that it was 10 pm, and I missed the rush hour for dinner, but once again, service was top notch.\nBecause I ate every bite of both my meals, I was completely stuffed and could not order dessert. However, I will be back and perhaps give myself a little bit more room for more. Amazing restaurant for the quality of service and food at an incredible price. You can't go anywhere else.",

                "description": "Eating at Le Mercury was a bittersweet experience for me. The bitter part was the occasion - I attended a UYE here to say goodbye to one of my good London Yelp friends, Bea B who is moving abroad\nThe sweet part was dining here. Le Mercury is one of Bea's favourite London restaurants and with 65 reviews already, it must be one of London's most Yelped businesses at this time. These Yelpers, including some of my trusted Yelp friends with good palates, had graded it with a solid 4 stars, so I was looking forward to eating here\nA perusal of the menu revealed a bistro style line up of French classics. Arriving at the restaurant, I found a setting and ambiance to match that relaxed bistro menu though perhaps, this stepped on the wrong side of shabby in the men's toilets which were in need of some refurbishment\nWe didn't have snooty French waiting staff to complete the French atmosphere but our waiter was efficient if not exactly warm. Le Mercury has a nice pricing plan with all starters costing £3.95, main courses costing £8.45 and desserts costing £2.95. which are very decent prices for this part of London\nThe food arrived remarkably quicky but the speed didn't mean sacrificing elegant presentation or suffering inaccurately cooked food. My roast Barbary duck breast had perfectly rendered crispy skin and moist meat, well complemented by garlic mash and Savoy cabbage with red wine jus. Asking round the table, there were murmurs of approval for rib eye steak and salmon though one of the steaks was a little under cooked.\nFor desserts, I had a rich and decadent chocolate tart and the poached pear was so good that it was half demolished before I could get a photo of it.\nIf Le Mercury was in France, we'd be nodding our heads sagely and admiring how it was produce well-priced and flavoursome food. So, to summarise, I'm nodding my head sagely and saying,\"Bravo, Le Mercury!\"\nAnd lastly, we'll miss you, Bea!!",

Food decent, value superb. \nQuick mention they didn't have our reservations down, however on an early Sunday (largely empty) they had no problem seating us right away. \nMenu is full of reasonably priced options. We did have to think a bit. Ended up with beef carpaccio (ehh) and poached pear blue cheese and roasted walnut salad (delicious) for appetizers. For the main course we did duck breast (cooked to medium rare with nicely crisped skin, fairly tasty however could have been a little more tender) and chicken breast (was decent though a tad dry). We enjoyed this with the house Chardonnay (middle of the road). \nQuick note although the menu says they charge £1 for extra bread, they provided seconds free of charge. \nApple tart tartine with creme fraiche (perfect finish to a very solid dinner). I enjoyed a glass of cognac and left with a smile. \nWould go back again. The ravioli (lobster and crawfish) seemed popular and looked good from a distance). Might ask for a window table if available and plan ahead for fri/sat reservations.",

For two people we ordered: \n1. 1 glass of Pernod- the always enjoyable French terrace drink (that probably no French folks anywhere near my age drink)\n2. Mussels starter- white wine and garlic sauce that we dipped the bread in as well. This is one of the most flavorful mussels dishes we have eaten this year and at less than £6 the best value. \n3. Duck breast main- cooked a tad more medium than rare, however sauce was rich and good for winter. Potatoes soaked it up well. Also they switched out cabbage for grilled courgette which was nice. \n4. Salad and seafood ravioli as a main (normally a starter)- baby girl got this. Very rich with high quality seafood stuffed inside. \n5. Glass of dessert wine- Chilean. Went exceptionally well with the cheese platter. We are actively seeking out this sweet treat to have at home. \n6. Cheese platter- they graciously switched out blue for more of the others. The others were Brie and Gruyere, the Brie served with perfectly sweet biscuits and the Gruyere with grapes. \nBees was a little disappointing as it wasn't French baguette. Overall very happy wit this place. A cozy warm bistro atmosphere of friendly people who were very accommodating. Oh yea and a £35 bill for a lot of food and drinks for two people. C'est la vie.",

The sauce was tasty not too fishy but had a rich creamy taste and the contents of ravioli were cooked to perfection. My girlfriend chèvre chaud. Goats cheese on a bit of bread with a green salad dressing. Everything on that plate complimented each other and tasted sublime! \nFor main I had the entrecôte cooked medium rare. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had so rich and meaty but cooked to perfection. It was served with au jus and a side of french fries. It was a simple dish but tasted amazing. \n My girlfriend had the corn fed chicken everything on that was great from the gravy to the beans. \nDesert well you guessed it, that was amazing as well. I had the poached pear with vanilla ice cream. Just great. Flavoured with cinnamon and cloves the pear was glazed with a crispy sugar shell. It was a light way to end the meal. My lady had creme brûlée. It was pretty standard. We both agreed my desert was the best. \nThe wine was great I had the Shiraz and my girlfriend had the Pinot Grigio. Also the espresso Martini was a great way to finish the meal. If you've read this far the. Thanks! \nAll in all it was a great night. Very well priced for the food you were served and the atmosphere was typically french. A great french style meal in the heart of London that won't break the bank.",

They managed to find us a table, but it was perhaps the worst table in the restaurant.  We were upstairs in a corner where the windows were completely blocked by plants.  Not very conducive to a romantic evening...\nThe only plus side to Le Mercury is that it is very affordable.

All of it was only lukewarm by the time it arrived at our table.\nThe service was terrible and slow.

I had a duck dish with mashed potatoes and greens and a red wine reduction. I also had a glass of red wine on the recommendation of the waiter (though, he knew less about the wines than I did, which was less impressive). \nThe food was fantastic and very reasonably priced, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was lovely.

I love this place so much that I have been back twice in the past week... don't judge me... The service is excellent as well. \nFor starter I enjoyed the grilled goat cheese served on a pesto salad and it was perfectly done. Other people in my group seemed to really like their lobster ravioli starters. My husband chose the calamari but it was a little under done for my taste, not crispy at all so I would probably skip that one in the future. \nFor mains my favorite so far is the Salmon served over sauteed spinach with a lobster cream sauce. Delicious! Other popular menu items among my group were the duck, the grilled swordfish, and the pork belly. All in all this was a fantastic meal at a great price. Perfection!",

Its like the blueprint for a successful restaurant! \nWe went one Monday night with friends. We had a cocktail at John Salt beforehand (2 for 1 until 8pm!) and then headed to Le Mercury. We had an upstairs table and service was great-attentive, but not over the top. We all had three courses (huge treat on Monday) but portion size means you don't feel too full. \nBetween us we tried the moules, ravioli, carpaccio and calamari for starters. The calamari was a little disappointing, but all the other starters were excellent. They all cost £3.95, so pretty amazing value. All mains are £8.95. I had the duck which was served on a bed of garlic mash and with some cabbage. If I had one quibble it would be that the duck was slightly over-cooked, but I understand not everyone likes pink in the middle duck. The garlic mash was amazing- I would've been happy with a bowl of that and a spoon! Other people had the lamb, seabass and rib of beef all were well cooked, and the fries the boys ordered were yummy. \nFor desert I had creme brulee. Not bad for £2.95, but the topping could've been slightly thicker. Others had the cheese platter, the rich chocolate tart and the cheesecake. All plates were practically licked clean. \nWe shared two bottles of a decent cab sav and the bill came a few pounds over £100, pretty incredible value! The food here will never blow your socks off, but it's a dependable neighbourhood bistro and we'll continue to come here regularly. Until next time Le Mercury....",

                "description": "I was pleasantly surprised at Le Mercury. We decided to go someplace for dinner before a friend's birthday party and we just ended up here. It's advertised as a French restaurant, but there's a bit of other stuff as well. Unless you get a special, the starters are all £3.95, the mains £8.95 and desserts are £2.95. \nSo given the price, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. However, my lobster and crab ravioli was really nice (although the sauce could have had a bit more flavor), the duck was tasty (although it was more medium well than medium rare) and the cheese dessert (for £2.95) was three massive slices of brie, gruyere and blue. \nWhile the food wasn't perfect, it was cheap and it was tasty, so that's a bonus. They also had a fairly interesting wine list, and the wine we chose was really tasty and went great with the duck. Finish it off with a glass of port and it was one of the cheaper meals we've had in quite awhile.\nSo if you're on the lookout for cheap and tasty food, head here. We didn't have a reservation, and showed up at 6:15, and they told us they'd seat us if we could finish in an hour. Which we did. So they're willing to squeeze you in as well. (I imagine it's one reason they can keep prices so low, a huge turnover).",

                "description": "I was excited to try out Le Mercury after all the glowing reviews on Yelp.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day - rainy Saturday for lunch - but there was nothing particularly memorable or good about this place other than the reasonable prices (£5 starters, £10 mains, and a cheap wine list)\nThe service was really, really bad.  I think our server's vision was based on movement since the only way he ever dropped by our table was after desperate waving by one or more of us -- take our order, water, wine order #1, wine order #2, dessert order, check (twice).  We were exhausted by the end.\nThe food was unremarkable, and not particularly French (just because the menu says  \"croquette de poisson\" doesn't make fishcakes french.)  Two of us had the over-cooked swordfish over a bed of cold string beans.  A friend ordered a salad that we all agreed looked like the one you get in coach on a British Airlines flight.  The crayfish and lobster ravioli (also, ravioli... not french) starter was good but I suspect they bought them frozen from somewhere.  I had the chicken entree which was ok.\nThe most entertaining part was the STEEP decent down slippery metal stairs to the toilet.  As a bonus the water was running in the dirty sink and couldn't be turned off.\nOne star experience overall, but I'm giving them two stars because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for.",

I've had bites of my friends' Crayfish and Lobster Ravioli and Beef Carpaccio, and both were very good as well. \nFor the main course, the first time I went I had the pork belly, which I must admit was a little dry. But I won't hold it against them because the next two times I got the duck, which was delicious. I always get the french fries as a side and it is a good size to share for two. \nFor two starters, two mains, a side, a dessert, and a bottle of wine, you're looking at about £50 for two, which is a good deal for the area and a total dining experience.",

The menu isn't huge but everything that's on it is done very well and pretty cheap for saying how yummy it is. All starters and sides are around £3, mains are £8 and all desserts are £4. Recommend the duck, if you have the chance. \n Unfortunately they stopped doing the dark chocolate truffle cake with Baileys ice cream. The second best thing about Le Mercury is the general cosiness of the restaurant. It's quite plain but not austere, and though it's lovely in summer I've always preferred it on a cold evening. It's one of those few restaurants thats perfect for a date or meeting lots of friends.\nThe atmosphere is cosy-a bit dark though. Make sure to book in advance.\nBest French restaurant in Islington.",

Le Mercury is the total package: the price, the atmosphere, and of course the food. \nEating out in London is expensive, too expensive... so I really appreciate Le Mercury that much more. All starters: £3.95. All main courses: £8.45 + side salad or fries or veggies for only £1.95. \nI ordered: Selle d/Agneau au Romarin (Roast saddle of lamb with grilled courgettes & rosemary jus). Boneless lamb, no fat, medium rare and cooked to perfection. I have to say that I judge a restaurant by how well they cook their lamb because most of the times it's too dry or too gamy. Le Mercury's lamb was perfectly seasoned, no chewy rubber band like parts, just the right amount of meat to sauce balance, I was 100% satisfied. My friend ordered: Boulettes de pomme de terre (Sauteed potato dumplings with baby artichokes, parmesan foam and wild rocket salad). I only had one bite (because I was too busy eating my lamb) but it was really really good as well.\nSeriously, this place is amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone.",

We often have the bad luck of getting served meat that is overcooked and not very flavorful. Not the case with Le Mercury. My chicken was like butta baby. And the cream sauce on it was just enough, not too much or too little. \nThe prices are right but the food is even better. Make sure you book in advance. I've walked in hoping for a seat and have had to walk away disappointed more than once (should have learned the first time!).\nOh yeah! Be sure to try their deep-fried tiger prawns as a starter.

What a find on Upper Street. \nLe Mercury is a great date spot. The ambiance is cozy and romantic, dimly lit. The restaurant was PACKED, all three floors even, so be sure to book. I booked about 4 days ahead and they only had one reservation for the whole evening left. Wowie.\nPrices are so reasonable! We weren't modest at all, with drinks or food, and our tab only came out to 38 quid! For our starter we had the goats cheese which is absolutely TO DIE FOR. It's a must paired with the French merlot on the menu. Take a nice bite of the cheese with a swig of the wine and trust me, it's divine. For my main I had both the pear salad and the crab appetiser. The salad was lovely, the blue cheese and poached pair were the perfect combination. However, I was not a fan of the crab dish as it was made with mayonnaise, which I hate. I really wished they had clarified on the menu how it was made. BUT it worked out alright because I wanted to have room for desert anyway. My man enjoyed the duck entree, which he said was cooked perfectly and was \"out of this world.\" And yes, only for 6.95!\nThe reason why I didn't give Le Mercury 5 stars is because the service isn't good. But I do personally think sacrificing the level of service to keep the ridiculously cheap prices IS worth it. However, we did always have to flag our waiter down and we weren't greeted at our table until about 15 minutes after sitting. But lets face it, they were packed and this place was hoppin. I understand.\nLe Mercury is a go! Book for a hot date with your Mr./Ms. and you'll score points!",

To start, the prices of the food on the menu are considered affordable based on London pricing. The food is michellin star but tasty especially for its price. I had the goat cheese salad with pesto and honey glazed pork belly, while my husband had the calamari, ravioli and lamb. Looking back, I regretted skipping the delectable dessert. All these plus our beverage definitely made our belly and taste buds happy as well my wallet. In addition, the ambiance and the service in Le Mercury quite excellent to my liking. Definitely, enjoyed this dinner date with the Mister in hip Islington area courtesy of Le Mercury. See for yourself.",

I dislike the papery table cloths, but that seems like a lame complaint, doesn't it? The chicken is great. Steak is great. Veggie options are great. \nI hesitate to give it five stars, though. Maybe if it wasn't so hyped, I wouldn't have had such high expectations. It really was good. Really! But I don't feel right giving it five stars just because. The food has been solid every time I've been there, but it's not the best ever. When I take the first bite of a meal in Paris, I often have to close my eyes because it's so delicious and I want to melt. That magic was not recreated here, but it is still really solidly GOOD food. \nI feel guilty not giving it five stars because I really do like this place! A lot!

I'm giving it 3 stars because of its incredible value even though 3 courses for £15 in London shouldn't be something of a miracle, unfortunately it is and so thanks Le Mercury for that.

One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town. \nLet's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table. \nIt was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at £3.95\nWe ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.\nFor mains which were all price at £6.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with sautéed spinach and lobster sauce. \nWe all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value.

I had the crab and crayfish ravioli and the pork belly, and my wife had the crab and avocado starter and the beef stew special.  The crab in both appetisers was imitation crab meat, which was not mentioned on the menu and was particularly noticeable in the special.  The pork belly was dry and overcooked and the beef stew was virtually flavourless.  The two bright spots were the wine and the sticky toffee pudding (which in my opinion is good even when it's bad).\nGranted, the prices are extremely generous, but considering you can get 2 courses and a glass of wine for £17 at places like Public House, I wonder if Le Mercury is really that good a deal.  \nMaybe we just went on a bad night or maybe we ordered the wrong items, but will definitely not be returning any time soon, particularly with so many other great restaurants in the area.",

Amazing. \nCrispy skinned salmon was delicious, and I really like the calamari starter-- super light and crisp, not overly oily or breaded... perfectly simple French preparation. \nYou could probably name each ingredient in every dish (with probably under 5 ingredients in each dish), they are all things you can pronounce and identify, done simply and cleanly. Mark Bittman would approve of this place. In fact, Mark, next time you're in London, check this place out, ok?",

However, the atmosphere, wine, food, and wine all seem to make this a safe bet. \nI've tried the lobster ravioli, the duck (err... canard), the potato dumplings, the salmon, the sea bass, and a couple of the desserts. All were either very good or great. For some extra Frenchness, they refused my sister's simple meal modification request- no, the sauce could not be had on the side. Authentique!\nThe best part is that it is so inexpensive. Considering how good the food is, 8 quid for a main course is a steal. That means you will have some money left over to treat your special lady to a couple drinks at that most romantic of bars just down the street- Slim Jim's Liquor Store! No way will that date not end well, eh?",

My friend ordered two starters:  the ravioli and the calamari.  I believe the ravioli was the star here as it was served along a buttery seafood sauce that was balanced very well with the spinach in the dish.  \nTried my friend's calamari and to be candid, it wasn't the greatest (doesn't match the fantastic fried Calamari I exprienced at the Capital Grille in Philadelphia, absolutely tasty!!!).  Seasoned ok, a bit cold for my taste.\nOut came my steak and it was so flavorful and tasty!!  Downside here was that it could've been more tender (ordered it medium) and it felt like it was warm, but not hot.  Next time will tell them to bring everything out as its ready so it's nice and hot!!\nWe didn't have desert as we were too full.  Final verdict: nice decore, good food, can't beat the prices for a nice, sit down French meal in London.  With some fine tuning this place would be amazing and I would definitely return (to try the Seabass and desert!!).",

                "description": "Overall an excellent experience. I came here on a Friday night (with a reservation) with two other people. This restaurant has some sort of \"shift\" system, I think, where all the diners come in at once. I arrived a little before 9:15pm (for a 9:15 pm reservation) and the place was empty; by 9:20pm it was full and buzzing. I've never seen this system before but I suppose there could be some advantages.\nThe restaurant itself is lovely. We sat on the first floor, where large windows look onto the street. Nicely arranged tables and decor. I would say it seemed a bit noisy at times, but I am sometimes a bit sensitive to loudness. (I loathe most night clubs.) The bathrooms in the basement are a bit lackluster, so I didn't spend much time down there.\nThe servers were good and attentive. We ordered a very nice bottle of merlot and to start shared mussels and poached pear with walnuts and blue cheese; all were very good. I had the roast chicken as entree and it was great, very tender and moist. I sampled my companions' dishes as well - sea bass and duck - and both were succulent to say the least. The portions did not seem like much but the richness of the foods really filled me up. We also squeezed in some dessert - creme brulee and the dark chocolate tort. Delicious they both were.\nThe main draw of Le Mercury, though, has to be the prices. Wine: appx. £15 for a bottle, starters £3.95 each, entrees £7.95 each, desserts £2.95 each. For London these prices really are unheard of. \nI will recommend this place to everybody, and I hope to go back soon.",

It's amazing what they did here! The first floor, I could tell was more date-ish, but the second/third floor I was on was great because it was groups of friends (Some dates, not all) and it was just a great friendly atmosphere.\nService: Fantastic. Nothing to complain about!\nFood: \n- Appetizer: Mussels in a broccoli sort of soup? It was good! Good amount and the sauce/soup it was in was delicious. I've had moules frites (in Belgium!) and this was definitely good in comparison to it.\n- Pork with confit: I thought it was a bit dry. I ate all of it.. minus a bit of the pork. My friend go the lamb which she enjoyed and I thought had a good flavour to it.\n- Dessert: Pear- YUM. \nBottom Line: Decent prices, decent food.

I had pork belly on a bed of (not over cooked) cabbage covered in a berry sauce that my taste buds singing the opening of \"The Sound of Music\". Actually, I refer to this place as French-ish, because I'm not sure if it is supposed to be totally French (mainly because its such an unassuming and friendly place. Ooooh burn, France!)\nThe most magical thing about this restaurant are the prices.... you will do a double take when you get the bill. I heard somewhere that this place is like a training restaurant for chefs or something but I don't care.... I really don't.

For starters my partner and I ordered the lobster & crayfish ravioli and the fried calamari. The lobster and crayfish ravioli was a bit overpowered by the dill stuffed inside and wasn't amazing. The fried calamari is horrendous and I can make better at home but for not even 4 pounds a pop I guess I can't complain. I ordered the duck, and it was very overcooked, but the flavors were good. The garlic mash is delicious. My boyfriend had the lamb and also said it was good but overcooked. I would probably return and ask them to cook everything a bit less than they normally would.

Three floors, drippy candles in old wine bottles, simple, quality French food. Amazingly reasonable prices. They have always maintained a fixed price for starters (£3.95), mains(£8.95) and puds (£2.50) .It's maintained it's quirky, unique, old-school Islington vibe. I hope it never changes.",

So I was thrilled to find that Le Mercury stays open late!  Thank you!  \nI love authentic French bistros serving up foie gras, chevre chaud, duck breast, entrecote steaks, etc.  And I love it when it tastes delicious.  And I love it when the bill comes to £40 for two, we ate lots, and that tab included a very nice bottle of wine!    \nWe had a nice secluded table in the corner by a nice round window and had an extremely pleasant meal.\nIt reminds me a bit of Grumbles by Victoria Station--I guess I am just a fan of authentic French bistros at an affordable price.  \nCould this be my new fave in Angel?  I think so!",

For tourists, its a bit out there (~ 21 GBP from victoria by taxi), but def. worth a visit.\nI went with a few other friends from across the pond and we all loved the atmosphere (nice, but not pretentious), service, and food. None of us were French food snobs, but we all thorough enjoyed the lamb, salmon, gnocchi, and casserole (though the casserole was a bit bland and very heavy on the beans). \nThe apps were great, and paired very well with our French wine.\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised with what a nice dinner like this cost us. Check their website for details. Also, I would recommend setting reservations for parties larger than 2, even on a weeknight as many people have found this gem.",

Overall food was decadent, decor was elegant, staff were superb, and atmosphere relaxing allowing us to immerse ourselves in wonderful food and conversation. Would highly recommend Le Mercury.",

And with each course all dishes are the same price: starters £3.95, mains £8.95 and puddings £2.95, so it is perfect for a group of friends sharing or a date going dutch.\nAnd the restaurant had a good mix of groups, friends and dates, so it appears to be suitable for every occasion.\nPortions are not big, so those with big appetites might want to add some sides which are again very reasonable at £1.95.\nI had the duck, in fact most of my group did, and it was delicious. The meat was so tender, and it came with a creamy garlic mash and a rich jus. I would definitely recommend.\nAdditionally: One of our party was 40 minutes late, and although they did keep asking us how much longer they thought she would be, they were very good about it. They refilled our (complimentary) bread while we were waiting.",

It's no fine dining establishment, but if you are looking for cheap, tasty and typically French cuisine - this is your Ronseal. (Does exactly what is says on the tin).\n Its dark enough to be intimate, but romantically lit with candles enough to see your dinner (and guest). The waiters are very efficient... some may say a little too eager to get you in, served and out, but I'm quite partial to a bit of efficiency on a cold wintery night when I'm starving. A three course meal will set you back £17. And that's the entire menu - starters, mains and desserts are all the same price.\n Toilets are fairly interesting... but clean.\n We dined on Carpaccio of Beef, Fois Gras, Sea Bass, Belly Pork, Marscapone Cheesecake and Sticky Toffee pudding. Delicious. Can't comment on the booze as we were driving, but French wine isn't really my thing anyway. Oh - driving - easy peasy. You can park on Almeida Street and the streets behind the restaurant from 6.30pm Pay and Display. Biking? Bike bay just on Napier Street - it couldn't be more convenient!\n Go on - have an indulgent Monday night out - and keep your wallet happy at the same time.",

The meat of both the Rib Eye and the \"special\" of the day, not veal or pork but thick slab of beef Weinersnitchel, was inedible and akin to chewing gum.

All of their entrees are priced at £7.45, appetizers are a mere £3.95, and the wines and other drinks are more than reasonable (around £3-4 for a glass of wine).\nI opted for the crispy-skinned sea bass, which came with some really delicious potatoes and pesto.  It was all perfectly cooked and a perfect portion size for me.  My friend ordered the steak and he loved it...a rarity for him, since he's usually got something to complain about no matter where he goes!\nAlthough we came in quite late without a reservation we were still seated immediately with a quick warning that they were closing in 45 minutes or so...though that didn't end up mattering much at all, since the service was incredibly quick.\nThe atmosphere is a bit romantic-y, with candles and all of that, but it wasn't filled with the kind of gooey lovey couples who might make a night out with a platonic male friend a bit awkward.\nI just wish I'd tried something from the dessert menu...Oh well.

When I can't get a reservation at Ottolenghi across the street, I'm not disappointed by Le Mercury as a backup.  I have them saved in my phone. \nThe moules marinieres are perfect and not rubbery, the duck is always cooked to perfection, the salmon juicy, the lobster ravioli is a winner, and although I've never had it, the pork belly always seems to make my husband very satiated.  The deserts are nice, but their strengths are their starters and mains.  The wine list has a fair mix of options, most worth buying by the bottle and none too offensively priced. \nThe last two times I have been there I've been seated upstairs which is more private, but I prefer the seating downstairs for a cafe/french style atmosphere.",

These two restaurants serving French cuisine were suggested by friends I was catching up with and that I haven't heard of. One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town.\nLet's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table.\nIt was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at £3.95\nWe ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.\nFor mains which were all price at £6.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with sautéed spinach and lobster sauce.\nWe all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value. An unassuming place that might not reside in your memories for long but will be thought of fondly if this happens to be part of your local eaterie.",

                "description": "OK I know I'm going against the grain here but bear with me.  I went a couple of weeks ago for the first time with Lucy who raves about it so I had high expectations. A major bonus was the fact that due to volcanic activity (what else?), mutual friend's flight was seriously delayed so we arrived about 45mins after we had the table booked for.  There was no problem with this, despite the fact that it is nearly always fully-booked so that was great. Lucy noted that the prices had gone up since the last time she'd been, so while still cheap (7.45, specials of the day around 9 or 10 pounds), not as cheap as they used to be.  My starter was great, my steak was cooked to perfection but not of the highest quality as I was still chewing it over literally 10 minutes after Lucy and friend had finished. Not a good look! The sticky toffee pudding (a passion of mine) was a little dry and not as sticky as it should have been.\nI thought I'd give it another go for boyfriend's birthday meal as everyone else seems to think it's amazing so I wondered if I'd gone on an off-night. \nNot so, sadly.  The maitre d' sat us, a waiter brought over some wine (complementary wine! How thoughtful!) but it wasn't ours and turned out to be the first of many errors of the evening.  After some time, the maitre d' took our order without writing it down (why do people do this? I've been a waitress and could NEVER remember orders without writing them down - it turns out that this guy couldn't either) so when the starters came, I got the soup I'd ordered, boyfriend got something he didn't.  It was replaced quickly though and we had complementary bread and butter to keep us going which is a plus. \nMy soup was a disappointment though. French onion is another passion of mine but I make it far better than what I was given - watery, thin, with little flavour.  Boyfriend's poached pear with blue cheese was lovely though. \nSome 45 minutes after we had had our starter, I asked where our main courses were and they arrived soon after. I think 45 minutes is a very long time between courses and we were filling up on bread.\nAnyway, for main I had pork belly which I'd expected to be a slice of meat layered with fat and with a nice chunk of crackling on top. Again, not so. It was a huge lump of tasty pork, not a scrap of crackling to be seen and not enough jus to counteract the dryness of the meat.  I ended up drinking so much water with it (I can't leave meat, an animal has died for this so I'm not wasting any of it!) that by the end of the meal I was absolutely full to bursting. So much meat and you only get vegetables / chips etc if you order them (1.95 on top) which presented another problem. I ordered a side salad (mixed leaves, 4 slices of cucumber with only the slightest hint of dressing, 1.95 seems very steep for that) while boyfriend ordered chips and a vegetable selection which it seems the maitre d' forgot.  When we reminded him, we were shortly presented a plate of beans, new potatoes and the oddest carrots which looked like they had been boiled, then left in a low oven for many hours so that all the water had been removed from them. Wrinkled, dehydrated and burnt around the edges. Very strange and not nice to eat! \nBy the end of all that, I wasn't hungry for dessert which is just as well as it took another 20 minutes to get the bill.  \nNot bad in that the whole thing was 35.00 for 2 people with a glass of wine and a beer but I wonder if we're all mistaking good value for cheap?\nLet me know if I'm wrong, but I'm not charmed by Le Mercury.",

                "description": "Hello new favourite restaurant!\n Seriously, is there nothing this place doesn't offer? When someone suggests a French restaurant, you immediately think it's going to be pricey, but this couldn't be further from the truth. All of the mains are under £7, desserts under £3.\n So what did we have? Well we shared a starter of Crayfish and Lobster ravioli which was yummy. really nice. I think we were both a bit annoyed that we didn't order one each.\n But the mains were ace too - it's not a huge selection, but it's a good one. I had duck breast on garlic mash with cabbage. It had a great sauce, although I can't remember what was in it. The mash was really too garlicky for my taste, but the duck was perfect. Yummy yummy yummy. We didn't get a side of veg with our meals, but we did spie roasted potatoes and green beans on a nother table and were instantly jealous. My friend's mushroom rissotto was yummy too. Dessert was a mascarpone cheesecake. YUMMY!\n There was nothing bad about this place, it's a gorgeous little find. We booked ahead, and we might have been lucky but it's not a bad idea. The service isn't the best, but my friends and i were catching up so we didn't really mind that they didn't take our order for a while - in fact I think they were waiting for us to shut up! In the meantime we ate all of the bread that they gave us. Freshest bread eve. The place is open very late (1am on weekdays, 2am on weekends) so you could even pop in after going to the cinema. It's a little further up Upper Street than the main drag, but that's a good thing. If I was just looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat, I wouldn't have walked up this far. I'm so pleased I did!\n So one starter, one dessert and two very yummy mains, plus a couple of glasses of wine costs us £26. Very impressed indeed.\n Do come here! On a date, with friends, whatever. Just come here. We were in such a mood for all things French that we've booked the Eurostar to Paris next month! Doesn't get much better",

It is pretty much always busy, maybe I am being too harsh on the food quality rating but I have been to many french restaurants and have had better, because I've paid more.  The starter was the best out of the three dishes, it was the mussels in white wine (not as fresh, but they were only £3.95).  The salmon was tasty with the lobster sauce but I was let down by the food's temperature, as if it had been left on the side for a bit before serving it.  Other than that, decent candle lit place with many tables cramped in a small-ish area but you will be surprised when you realize it is actually a three storey building.",

Its no wonder that its always packed - but you don't have to wait long for a table. The steak was the best I've had in a while, soft and tender with a shallot sauce. At only 6.50 pounds, it was an absolute bargain! Starters are also very good, and around 4 pounds each. A bottle of wine is pretty reasonable at 10.50 as well. \nThe restaurant gives the atmosphere of an intimate high end eatery, and the dim lighting and soft candles save it from looking like a bistro. This is a perfect place to go for a pre-theater or cinema meal, as the fast service won't keep you waiting long for a great meal. The Creme Brulee is still a simple favorite that is on the menu.

It's not very fancy, but it has loads of atmosphere with the lighting provided by candles in wine bottles and street lights coming through the windows. Things can get packed in pretty tight, so it's best to make a booking (even on a Monday night at 8pm we wouldn't have been able to get a table if we hadn't already reserved one).\n The food is quite good, even if the menu isn't terribly extensive. My sea bass was fantastic, nice a crispy on the outside but really moist on the inside. Their desserts are really nice too, but don't expect anything on the lighter side. But the portions are perfect, just enough to leave you feeling satisfied without feeling stuffed. And things are relatively cheap with three courses costing only about £15 (excluding drinks).\n It's a really good late night spot as well; they're open til 2, and they won't rush you if you want to sit around and chat after your meal. It can get a bit noisy in there, but still a good place to bring friends.",

I'm not expecting food cooked to level of a good Parisian bistro, but for how much you have to pay, this place is amazing.  Gets super packed though, so make reservations at least a few days in advance.",

We had to wait a while, as the place was full and apparently, you are advised to make reservations. Considering the price level, my expecations were low, but I was positively overwhelmed. They keep a simple menu, reproduced in high volume, which is probably the recipe for success. Its not a top class French restaurant, but it is extremely good value for money.",

                "description": "I sit down and am promptly ignored until Meg comes in. The vibe is very French bistro and a bit like Lucien in NYC which used to be our favourite place for a mildly celebratory dinner so that's good. The restaurant is crowded but unlike a crowded NYC restaurant you aren't putting your elbows in your neighbour's soup.\n Tiny paper napkins and diner-standard flatware/glasses are all that's on the table. Meg arrives, we get the menus, and order drinks. We get glasses of tap water, which are never refilled, and a bottle of chenin blanc which turns out to be a 2008 from Long Beach winery in South Africa. This is a little sweet, but very nice - I like it a lot. The bread is pretty plain-jane white bread, but it has poppy seeds on the outside which make it better than expected.\n Meg has Tian au Crabe which is described on the menu as Tian of crab and avocado emulsion. What is a tian? We don't know which seems as good a reason as any to order it. It turns out to be something like crab salad. Meg seems to enjoy it.\n I have Chevre Chaud, grilled goat's cheese with fresh leaf salad and basil pesto. This is quite good although I think rather too heavy on the goat cheese and not heavy enough on the pesto as it's a little dry. The salad is nothing special and in fact I was hoping for more leaves. Weirdly, I guess, I'm asking for them to have more of the cheap ingredients in this dish.\n For mains, Meg gets Supreme de Poulet Roti - roast breast of chicken, garlic mash, green peppercorn. She seems to like it. I have Filet de Loup de Mer - sea bass with cauliflower puree, raisins, and chili lemon zest. Everything individually is good but they don't seem to go together that well.\n And that's it. We're tired, Meg seems to be coming down with something, so we skip out after just over an hour for under 40GBP. A great deal, convenient, decent food. We'll definitely be back.",

With empty grumbling bellys we made it to a really busy looking La Mercury and luckily were able to get a table upstairs. We couldn't believe how cheap the food was, we got a set meal and the food was stunning. We were all well impressed and would definately head back soon.",

And yes, all desserts are same low price as well. It's incredibly cheap, yet still tasty. Probably the best value for money you can find in the area. It does get quite crowded though, so call ahead and make a reservation. And also be prepared for it to be a tad noisy on the weekends, but certainly not overwhelming.",

The management has particularly laid back attitude towards customers and the food is inexpensive. Starters cost around 3.95 and main course around 6.45. A starter of gnocchi with butternut squash was light and delicious,the steak and chips was cooked just to right level and the banana shortcake with strawberries completed the meal nicely. It has pictures of Paris all over the walls and lit by candle light stuck in arty bottles.",
