Really hit the spot after a day of travel and jet lag from NYC.  \nFriendly waiters, but it took a long time to order and pay the bill. Slow service seems to be the norm in Europe. \nThe fried chicken wasn't like karaage, though it doesn't claim to be on the menu. We still enjoyed it with the sauce. The yuzu margarita paired great with the tonkotsu.",

                "description": "My wife and I were in London as part of our London/Paris anniversary trip. We were craving some good asian cuisine, and she found this neat little Ramen shop. The ambiance is great. Rock n' Roll music and communal tables. We got seated at a couple of bar seats looking out the window. The menu was easy to read and we both opted for two ramens, a chicken kaarage appetizer and I ordered an Asahi Beer.\nAbout 10-15 minutes later, other folks that arrived after us started getting food, and we had not even received our beer or water. So after telling the staff, we got our drinks 3-5 minutes later. Then the food arrived and I had specifically asked if there was bean sprouts. He wasn't sure, so I said, okay, if there is, please put it on the side. \nGuess what I got in my ramen when it arrived? That's right, bean sprouts.  The food itself wasn't bad. Decent broth, plenty of noodles and meat. A bit too oily for my own taste, but oil in broth is individual preference.\nThen we wanted our check. I asked for it, and that alone took another 10 minutes. We waited and waited. I finally started to lose my patience and asked again, this time I told the waitress that we've had a pretty poor experience here. The manager came back with a fair discount and apologized for the experience. Apparently the original waiter was a trainee, which begs the question why wasn't he \"mentored\" by an experienced server. Anyways, the manager's response and sincerity saved this review from being a 1 star. I don't believe this is typical service, so I'd still recommend folks to try them out. Cheers!",

I probably wouldn't have found it if I were just wandering around.\nMy coworker had ordered the Padron Peppers for appetizer, which she shared. The peppers aren't spicy, but were flavorful. I think I ate quite a few.\nI think I ordered the Garlic Tantamen ramen. There was so much meat in it! I thought it was a little too oily for my liking. The oily broth was a little too rich. Otherwise, the broth was good.\nThe server we had needed deodorant. That was the only other turn-off about this place.",

                "description": "Having lived in New York, I've been spoiled for unlimited delicious ramen options and my personal opinion is that Bone Daddies is overhyped.\nMy friend and I came on a weekday night and there was a long line outside the shop. They took in pairs faster than groups, so my friend and I were seated after ten minutes. The inside of the shop is dim and crowded. There are only stool seats and seating is pretty tight. \nMy friend and I got the Agedashi Tofu to start. This was pretty good! The portion was big and the tofu is silky with a light and crispy battered shell. The sauce was flavorful too. \nFor ramen, I got the Tonkotsu and my friend got the Mushroom Ramen. What I liked most from the Tonkotsu ramen were the egg and the black garlic oil. However, everything else was a bit overwhelming. The pork broth was advertised to be simmered for 20 hours but it wasn't all that flavorful and definitely too oily. The ramen noodles were very thin and way overcooked so it was quite mushy to eat. I also got to try some broth from my friend's mushroom ramen and it was pretty good. \nOverall, Bone Daddies was a little disappointing and I'll be continuing my search for the best ramen in London.",

                "description": "Arriving in London and being sick really made me crave some hot broth. Also because I was traveling throughout Europe I was really craving Ramen. I looked up some Ramen restaurants and saw that Bone Daddies were spread throughout Central London and I was close to one. \nAs I entered the restaurant it was packed with people and I thought this was a good sign of the food prepared inside. I went in solo and because of this I think I was sometimes forgotten as other tables were getting their food before mine. In the end... the result was that they actually forgot to put my order in the kitchen, however I was compensated with extra chashu meat in my ramen. \nThe ramen broth did the trick and was very warming while I slurped the broth and dipped my noodles in it. The charting on the meat was also perfect as it gave an unique taste to the meat. The eggs were also boiled to a perfect runny Golden State which is usually a pivotal point of the ramen for me. Another good item that looked amazing is the Korean style ribs. Although I didn't order any the people next to me got them and they smelled and looked absolutely amazing.",

Two smallish (based on previous ramen experiences) bowls of ramen: 32 pounds. Mine had a wafer thin slice of pork belly and a small piece of crab. The kale? One small shred. The extra bok choi (for an additional 1.5 pounds over the 14 pound base price)was 2 small limp leaves delivered late. Really? For 1.5 pounds?

                "description": "I'm guilty of not posting any review for Bone Daddies any sooner. I've been here many times and it's my go to Ramen place when I need a fix. I've been to this place since 2015. Bone Daddies has this really hip vibe, you'd think it's a cool bar but it's just really awesome how they made Ramen look cool. First of all, I've not been to a Ramen place that offers you bibs and hair ties (for ladies with long locks). That's really thoughtful. \nThe area is smaller than most restaurants. There's usually a queue outside, but the wait is about 15-20mins depending how crowded it is. Its a little noisy, so it's probably not great for intimate conversations. The place is cramp, so you'll find yourself squeezed between people. It's generally not a place to bring babies or kids. Absolutely great for couples and if you're lucky, you might get an entire table for larger groups. \nI usually order the T22 Ramen with Chicken scratchings. It's probably one of my favourite. If you're not into pork all that much, there's that option for you. There are a bunch of vegetarian options as well. So you'll be glad to find a variety. Today however we decided to try something else on the menu:\n1. Tonkotsu Ramen £11: Pork belly with Spring onions in 20 hours cooked pork broth\n- If you're looking for an easy entrance and introduction to classic Ramen, this would be a good choice. It comes with two flavoured eggs and Bamboo shoots. I usually put in extra garlic and sesame crushed seeds to bump up the flavour. \n2. Curry Ramen £12: Spicy curry broth with deep fried chicken and jalapeño\n- Anyone who likes chilli should try this bowl of fire. It tastes as spicy as it looks. Be prepared to have a cup of ice water ready. Also don't be surprise if you suffer the \"ring of fire\" the next day \nAs with all good restaurants in London, there is usually a wait. But it's shaded and there's a heater outside. They work very quickly to try serve everyone their food. I've never been disappointed with their services and would definitely continue to come here.",

                "description": "This ramen place used to be one of the best in London.  However, it has now been surpassed by Japanese branches especially Kanada-Ya.  I would say Ippudo is the second best.  Bone Daddies has a very hipster vibe in there where you can order sake and sit for a long time in there and no one would chase you away.  Whereas in a real ramen place, you are expected to eat and leave straight away.  The queue here used to be really long and I remembered queuing just to get in here.  \nThe noodle here is not up to my liking.  They are probably the thicker and they cooked it for too long so they are not springy enough.  The broth here is also diluted with no depth of flavour.  I won't be back unfortunately after I have found the other 2.",

How weird.\nIt's opposite the Supreme store, so you can watch people line up for hours to buy a shirt too, \nIt was busy and loud - I don't mind that for lunch and was dining alone anyway. Seated quickly, the place gives off a slight hipster vibe. Condiments all looked to be in the standard style, the hair bands were an odd addition, but back in the rock hair phase they may have been useful!\nI ordered:\nPork Bone ramen. Korean wings. Green tea and still water. \nThe wings showed up quickly. They were well spiced and as sticky as you like. Not too small, just right for an appetiser I reckon. Between two as a light one maybe.\nThe main event arrived shortly after. \nThe broth was great. Tasty and lightly spiced as expected. I added a little of the chilli and I was more than happy with its heat level. The pork was a little thicker than I would have expected, but that isn't a bad thing. Lots of top ramen content. \nMy green tea never arrived but my server was more than happy to either bring it to me or remove it from the bill.\nOverall I enjoyed it, I'll certainly be back. It's not Shoryu good, but it's really close.",

There is a good variety of ramen, from the spicy to more traditional, even curry and vegetarian options. It's also open late.\nOne thing I wasn't expecting was the amazing Brussel sprouts - yes Brussel sprouts! - side dish that was packed with fried green goodness, citrus and pomegranates. It's so much better than your generic edamame and sets them apart from many other ramen joints.\nGet ready for a burst of flavour as the broth is quite thick, and their tonkatsu comes with a black garlic sesame oil which can be quite overpowering if you are looking for something more subtle.

They advertise their tonkatsu as 20 hour pork bone broth that is \"A Bone Daddies Favorite: creamy white broth with Braised Tractor pork.\"\nThe first time I  ordered tonkatsu, I got a brown insta-broth, I thought it was a mistake. I ordered it again, and it was brown again, and didn't have the tonkatsu taste.  It was oily and tasted like they just threw a pack of soup into hot water and grease, almost like a bad roux. I called them to ask if their tonkatsu was brown, and they confirmed, saying \"That's how we make it.\" I've seen other reviews with the creamy white broth, so I don't know if they just send people who order delivery anything or what.\nIt's actually decent if you're craving ramen, but not the taste I was looking for. The minced pork is really good, and their chashu is delicious.  The noodles aren't my favorite. They seem to be soba noodles (buckwheat), but don't retain any of the flavors.",

If you were looking for a deep watermelon taste this might disappoint you. For me it was not amazing but pretty good.\nI had veggie and non veggie ramen in London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, San Diego, Toronto... and I have to say that the ramen I had here are not in my top ten. They were good but it already started with the presentation. I couldn't see any love there. Even a ramen for 5 bucks in Tokyo sometimes had a better presentation than the bowl I had in front of me. As for the taste I had to say it was a tad to bitter for me. But that is just my own preference. I think the quality was ok and the meat was very tender. The egg was amazing!!\nYou also can add fresh garlic and a chili paste to your ramen. Top!\nSERVICE\nI think the staff were nice and attentive. Only can say good things about them and all of them look pretty cool. \nATMOSPHERE\nWell it is different from a japanese style ramen restaurant. I would describe it as hip or alternative which is also reflected by the staff working there and I absolutely love it. Why shouldn't a ramen shop not be cool, hip or just different? \nRATING\nI think I would have given this restaurant a 4 if it had left a big impression on me since I already had ramen in other places in London.

Due to the number of great reviews this ramen joint has I decided to check it out for myself and I've only left in utter disappointment.  I tried the tonkotsu ramen during my first visit and the broth was pure NaCl.  It was so salty I couldn't finish my ramen which, trust me, has never happened before.  The soup here is honestly what I'd imagine the Dead Sea tastes like. Tonkotsu broth is often a creamy pale color but here it looks more like shoyu broth, perhaps they add a tub of soy sauce to it, rendering it completely inedible.  Besides the salt factor, it also doesn't have a nice pork flavor that is characteristic of quality tonkotsu ramen.  Lastly, I usually love nitamago which are seasoned soft boiled eggs but again here they're overly salty and not enjoyable.  They really need to tone it down a bit.\nI thought my first experience was a fluke so I came back again to give Bone Daddies a chance to prove me wrong. This time I tried their tan tan men which was yet another letdown.  The broth left a powdery aftertaste and the noodles were beyond soggy.  \nI hate to say this, but Bone Daddies is probably some of the worst ramen I've ever had.  Don't come here if you want anything remotely tasty or authentic.  Try Shoryu, Ippudo, or Kanada-ya instead if you're looking for something better in London.",

                "description": "Bone daddies one of the top ramen place in London?\nYes, I dare say. I still have a slight preference for Ippudo but Bone daddies is a close second plus it had more interesting choices in ramen combination.\nWe started with snacks: chicken wings which were simply yummy the right amount of sweet and spicy with a bit of a crunch.\nChashu pork and corn croquettes are abs fab a must order!!!! \nNow onto the ramen:\nMy friend went for the Prince of darkness. They warn you the it is f***ing spicy and it is. It s the kind of spice that creeps up on you (meaning its progressive) \nI went for the IP tonkotsu with an egg and it was just greatly balanced. The 20hours pork broth is just perfect but for me the noodles were a bit too large and too cooked but that s a personal choice. I like my ramen thin and al dente. Other than that the whole was just delish \nfor the drinks we had the asahi cream head and the watermelon crush. Beer is beer obs but the watermelon crush was just the right amount of sourness and freshness I loved it, it goes perfectly with my dish as it was a little bit spicy so they married well.\nOverall there is no doubt Bone daddies is one of the best places to get ramen in London!!!!",

When I first saw the pic I thought - ugh another delicious ramen picture from a traveller in Japan and was delighted that it was actually a spot in London. \nI got in around 6:30 and waited 5 minutes before we were seated. The service is quick and the food came out very quickly. My choice to order was easy as there is 1 vegetarian ramen on the menu. \nThe ramen noodles were chewy but the thin kind that tend to get soggy quickly so slurp quickly! The vegetarian mushroom broth was pretty average. The flavour was one-dimensional and it was just a strong umami taste. No spice or creaminess that I've had in other vegetarian ramens. The toppings are perfectly cooked and the eggs yolks were golden and runny which was perfect. \nThe overall experience was great and I understand why there was a long line-up of people waiting in the rain on a Monday night to get in. Didn't hit the spot on my ramen craving but I would recommend to non-vegetarians!",

Edgy.  \nTo be fair, I didn't have much ramen in london to compare this too, perhaps this is the best London has to offer?  Perhaps it isn't.  Either way, the tonkotsu broth and the T22 are the 2 most raved about in reviews, so that is what we went with.  The broth itself was very thick and heavy, but somehow lacking depth in flavor.  The ramens themselves picture perfect!  \nEverything was fresh and the staff was excellent.  The drinks were quite delicious as well.  \nThe stools aren't the most comfortable to sit on, but perhaps that is so people don't stay as long as the wait does get quite long.",

It raved about this place, saying it was the absolute best ramen joint around, so I was quite excited to try it. \nI asked for a recommendation and the waitress said their tonkatsu ramen was the most popular, so I decided to go with that. The service was speedy! I got my food in less than five minutes. However, I found the ramen to be very underwhelming. The broth had so little flavor - I felt like I was just drinking soupy oil. The ramen and meat were alright, but nothing to write home about. The egg was probably my favorite part of my meal. \nPerhaps because I've had really good ramen in Japan and Los Angeles before, Bone Daddies just wasn't up to par.",

However, he did warn us that Asian food in London does not compare to that of the Bay Area. That said, I can say that this place is hit-or-miss. Some dishes are amazing and some are just bland. For example, I ordered the kimchee ramen while the others ordered the tonkatsu ramen. My ramen was bursting with flavor and good, but the tonkatsu was the opposite. The people in my group complained that it was one of the worst that they had ever tried. There was no seasoning at all. They had to add soy sauce or black oil to spice it up a bit. Disappointing. With the appetizers, order the fried chicken and skip the pork and corn croquettes. Again, one was perfect while the other one needed more. \nThe restaurant is located close to Chinatown and I would have totally missed it if I walked by. The place is small so be prepared for a wait during meal times. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They had us come in from the rain and sit on stools until there was a table available. \nRemember that compared to almost every other currency in the world, the London pound is pretty expensive so don't expect this place to be cheap.",

                "description": "I had just eaten at Ippudo New York the week before, and Kanada-Ya in London a few days before eating here, so I feel like I had a pretty good base of comparison. I wanted to like this more, but I didn't care too much for the ramen here. I liked Ippudo and Kanada-Ya better.\nThis place didn't feel as authentically Japanese as Kanada-Ya did, and more of a fusion, cheeky-humor kind of place. I felt like I could be in a small ramen shop in Japan when I was at Kanada-Ya, but felt like I could be in SF or NY when I was inside Bone Daddies. This place is much more amenable for larger groups than Kanada-Ya. If you have more than 2 people, Kanada-Ya may not be a good fit, but I think Bone Daddies would be able to accommodate parties of 4-6, but not much larger. The wait is probably much shorter too.\nI ordered the Tantanmen which has sesame, chili, minced pork, chashu pork and bok choy. The broth was rich and flavorful, but I preferred the broth at Ippudo NY and Kanada-Ya better. The pork here was a bit on the dry side which was disappointing - it needed a bit more fat in it. Normally, I have no problem polishing off a bowl of ramen, but I didn't finish this one. Noodles were fine, but I preferred the chewier / more al-dente noodles at Katana-Ya.\nKorean Fried Chicken Wings - These were huge, and had almost too much sauce on them. I didn't find them really crispy on the outside, probably because there was too much sauce on them. I don't think I'd get these again.\nIf you're looking for ramen and want more options on flavors and more unique combinations / fusion, then this place is great. It's also good for slightly larger groups and/or if you want to have drinks with your meal. If you want a more authentic ramen experience, head over to Katana-Ya.",

This ramen has chashu pork, softshell crab, chilli, kale, beansprouts and black sesame. Alongside a Bone Daddies Cider. The ramen was good, very very good, it was hot and a nice refreshing change from the normal Tonkotsu that I'm always eating.

I'd recommend going to Shoryu a couple blocks away if you want a better ramen experience. The wait time is about the same for both places, about 15-20 minutes for you to get seated.

This place was packed and I could see why. The ramen was the bomb! Not salty, not oily, not bland, not cheap on ingredients. All was great about this dish and it was not expensive either. The waiter was friendly and the customers had so much energy. You won't feel lonely here if you are a solo traveler.",

                "description": "Decided to check out the ramen scene in London, this one in particular given that it was one of the higher rated places.\nArrived around 7pm on a Thursday, there was a short lineup but people come and go quickly and we were in after about 15-20 min of waiting. It's more of a ramen bar than a nice sit down place. Very loud and lively, the locals seem to love it.\nThe staff were not that friendly imo. It wasn't very clear that we were supposed to wait by the wall once entering. We thought we had a spot already because it looked like they were gesturing us to follow the group in front of us. That was awkward. While seated, the waitress ran into my bf while walking through the aisle and didn't even say sorry, just asked him to tuck in his chair when it wasn't even his fault. No smiles given. It's definitely a little crammed in there. \nAnyways, the food. We didn't get any apps or drinks, just the tonkotsu and T22 ramen. The food came reasonably quick, around 10-15min wait. Tonkotsu had very standard ramen broth, on par with Ippudo in NYC. I thought I'd try the T22 because I don't have chicken ramen very often. It was delicious - and there are cock scratchings which added crunch. The broth got a bit salty after awhile though. They use thin noodles which I loved. Overall, very filling and moderately priced.\n3/5 for service and 4.5/5 for the food.",

First impressions, I liked how they have garlic ready on the table with a garlic masher, BIBS if you're a messy eater (I am sure am!), hot sauce, and lots of utensils already ready. The garlic is in a jar, but I love garlic in my ramen so I was very happy. \nI ordered the T22 ramen and I was a little dissapointed. The broth was not as rich as I liked and it was spicy. I'm not a spicy food fan so that was an immediate no-no for me. The noddles were also incredibly hard and it tasted almost undercooked. The meat was also not very tender. The mushrooms were good tho. However, they do give you TWO halves of a soft-boiled egg unlike a lot of other ramen restuarants and they have a very impressive drink menu. I wouldn't say this would be a go-to ramen place for me, but it was enjoyable for such a cold winter day.",

                "description": "Bone Daddies was always going to be a hit with me. It has two things I absolutely love, ramen and rock. This Peter street outlet is where it all started...as a simple ramen bar. The interior has Japanese inspired graphics, and pictures of Japanese rockers plastered all over the walls. Diners are seated on stools at high tables. The rest of the Bone Daddies experience comes courtesy of an all-out onslaught on the senses, the noise, the smells, the tastes - fantastic.\nTo start, we ordered the Salmon Tartar, Wild Soft Shell Crab, and Edamame. I regret not ordering the Korean Fried Chicken Wings which, the couple sharing our high-table so thoroughly seemed to have enjoyed. Our salmon, which is served with a lime wasabi ponzu, was really good; the salmon so fresh I could swear it had a pulse. The soft-shelled crabs come with an out-of-this-world Thai green curry, chilli and ginger sauce - OMG!\nFor our mains, we ordered the oddly named T22, which is a soy ramen, a Kimchee Ramen and my favourite, Spicy Miso Ramen - all amazing; my spicy miso ramen as good as any I have had in Tokyo (and believe me I have had a lot). The noodles are not just genuine ramen noodles but they were cooked perfectly.\nService is good for London, and it's fast; they're just too busy to be friendly. Expect to stand in a queue, either in-doors or out, for up to 15-minutes. I'm not sure if they accept reservations. I think not. Irrespective, if you're looking for an authentic ramen in London, this is the place to come.\nWaste NOT. Want NOT.",

Waited for about 15-20 minutes before being seated. I don't think they take reservations at this location and from the looks of the que, seems like a local favorite. \nOf course I ordered the Miso Ramen. It was actually quite different from what i'm use too. The soup base almost reminded me of a tex-mex kind of fusion with the traditional miso ramen. It was different but delicious! Ramen noodles cooked perfectly, and pork was cooked just enough to keep a firm texture. Waiters were very friendly and understood people were waiting long for food so extra smiles and attention was given. Would definitely recommend this location for tasty Ramen. Tuna tartar was amazing as well! Freshly prepared and uniquely set for a fun and memorable experience.",

I can't quiet put my tongue to it, but it's got its own special kick! The noodles were decently chewy and in good amounts. The garnishes aren't that special.

                "description": "Bone Daddies is definitely a great ramen place to check out in London. Went with two other friends and we ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Kimchee Ramen, & Dipping Ramen to share among us three.\n1. Tonkotsu Ramen was on the saltier side. Definitely good, but nothing particularly outstanding in terms of how tonkotsu ramen broth. The noodles were a very good level of not too hard and not too soft. I definitely enjoyed the noodles, and was a bit let down with the broth. It was simply just salty and nothing particularly flavorful. Nevertheless, it was wonderful with a cup of water on the side.\n2. Kimchee Ramen was super spicy. You need a strong ability to handle spiciness to take on this broth. It came with a lot of seafood which was wonderful and very fresh. As someone who personally cannot handle anything too spicy, this was definitely something not in my zone of comfort. However, my friends who love anything super spicy were really happy with the flavor of the broth.\n3. Dipping Ramen was a very unique experience where all the ramen ingredients came on a platter next to a cup of sauce. The sauce appeared clear but was extremely flavorful. I personally really enjoyed this dish because it was not only a unique ramen experience, but also something well-flavored and worth the price!\nADVICE: Arrive at an early dinnertime! There will be a line! The line will most likely be outdoors so bring a nice coat to wear. There will be hooks on the wall inside of the restaurant, so you can hang up your coat when you're seated.",

But messy, soooo messy! \nWe both had the tonkatsu ramen with the now famous pork bone broth.

I was glad we had the room around our seats as it created a little privacy . The only downside to this was having to turn around to talk to the server, but that was no big deal. \nI liked so many things; the little jar of elastic hair bands, bibs, fresh ginger with press, the music and most of all, that there's no shame in slurping.\nWe had the fried chicken, which was served piping hot. It came with a lemon wedge, but we preferred a dipping sauce and found the soy sauce, which was good. I then had the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra egg, corn and chicken cock scratchings. Now I was unsure about the latter, but the waitress explained it's a nice crunchy garnish, which it certainly was. After my meal, I was nicely full and glad it wasn't raining as I totally needed to walk off the ramen.  I can't wait to go back to try the other dishes.",

You can't read the menu if you are seated in the corner. From a distance, I thought the place was closed.\nI ordered the IP Tonkatsu ramen. It came looking nice but I notice black spots on the ramen , as soon as I stirred, it turned the whole broth deep brown. This was not the color of ramen that I wanted nor is expected. It should be a creamy oily white broth.\nAfter a few bites, I couldn't eat anymore. It tasted overwhelmingly like soy sauce. There are soy flavor ramens but this was just too strong of soy sauce. \nI thought ok, let me order another ramen and maybe it was just a one off. I showed a picture of what I wanted and they said it was spicy miso.\nThe spicy miso appeared nothing like the photo I pointed to the waitress. All the ingredients were the same yes but again the color of the broth was wrong. It was a pale red dull color. The taste was better than the tonkatsu but still not what I wanted.\nI basically ordered two ramens, ate half of one and paid £30. Oh guess what, they also tack on service charge 12% and force you to donate £1 to charity in your bill.\nThe worst experience I've had in London so far. \nThe two stars is for the fact that the ingredients themselves were very good. The noodles were not typical ramen firmness or cut but were still very delectable. The corn is from a grilled cob and sliced off in small stacks. The egg is soft boiled but might have had too much soy flavor or that was due to my broth I'm not sure.\nThe service in general was nice but they should have known better or tried to accommodate me in some way when they knew I didn't like any ramen even after ordering two. I'm not asking for free food but it would have been nice if they at least asked if I enjoyed the food after I said I didn't enjoy the first ramen. I think that means they don't genuinely care and just want your money.\nWatch out.",

                "description": "I really wanted to give this place 4 stars instead of 5, because I despise crowded places, stools, small table space and queues, and this Bone Daddies has all of the above. \nThat said, as soon as I've put food in my mouth I went to ramen heaven and back, and as my friend pointed out, I didn't say a word for 20 minutes. \nI've ordered the Tonkatsu (Tonkotsu? Tonk...whatever) ramen, and added the cock scratching because in all the pictures I saw of ramen from Bone Daddies I could spot these crispy bits on top and really wanted to know what they were and try them. \nOH. MY. SWEET. BABY. DAY. IN. THE. LIFE. \nCan I just go back there RIGHT NOW?\nThe 20h pork broth was so rich and creamy, it would have been delicious on its own. Like, even without the perfectly sliced thin pork, the flavourful noodles, the hard-boiled eggs that kept a soft but not runny yolk, the soy sauce on the one side of the bowl, the spring onions, and all the other bits, including the scratching. Which were out of this world delicious. \nI would love to say something more about the place itself, the hairband and bib they provide for mess-free experience, the atmosphere, etc. But I have a parade of ramen soups dancing in front of my eyes and can't think of anything else but going back there asap. \nSo if you're anything like me (i.e. a fussy introverted mess) you'll want to run away when you see the crowd, PLEASE BE PATIENT BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT. I promise. \n(Ps. Thank you Charlotte K. for being to me that one friend to take me here, as someone else did with you years ago. Let's keep the tradition going eh?)",

The place gives off very hipster vibes.\nI actually really enjoyed their Salmon Tartar with the Lime Wasabi Ponzu and it came with Renkon Chips! The salmon was definitely fresh and the ponzu was amazing with the salmon, it's bright, citrusy, and a nice kick of wasabi! Actually one of the best things I've had! I really liked what they did with the sauce for the salmon. \nI had the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was okay. It definitely is one of the better ramen places that I've visited in London, but the ramen itself was still a little lackluster in general. The broth was fine, it's actually a little less salty than other places which I liked. The broth is also very creamy. The ramen egg was really nice, but the menma (bamboo shoots) were quite awful...lots of unchewable strands of bamboo shoots! There were hard and hay like strands in my bamboo shoots and toppings. The noodles were quite bad though, it was mushy for me. Perhaps it was just that night or my ramen had been sitting out for a while, because ramen noodles should never be mushy! Mine had no bounce whatsoever (it was also quite thin), very limp, and it was just overall unpleasant to eat in general. Not quite consistent with what I've heard about their ramen, but that was what I had. LIMP NOODLE!!!\nI had the Gini Hendrix cocktail as well and I highly recommend the drink! It's like a Gin and Tonic but much more refreshing and bright! Love the addition of cucumbers and yuzu liquor instead of tonic, so refreshing and much more complex. Oolong syrup didn't really add a tea taste to it, but it was a very sweet drink. Probably my favourite cocktail ever!\nIt's a great place to meet up with others and have a decent meal, but it is actually quite dark inside. Prices are also pretty steep for food.",

But we got lucky because I don't think anyone was seated long after that and there was a huge lineup outside. \nI got the curry ramen. I thought it was pretty good. The fried chicken managed to stay crispy and the broth had really good flavour so I didn't have to add anything to it. I also was sceptical about the noodles since some of the reviews weren't so great but I thought they were fine. They were ramen noodles! Didn't find them chewy, hard, soft or too big. The peppers were interesting and didn't do much for the dish in my opinion \nMy mom got the tantanmen ramen. The soup was a little peanuty and she thought she didn't get enough meat, but other than that it was good\nWe were sitting right at the window and since there was a line up people were constantly watching us eating which was a little weird for me but, can't really blame the restaurant though.\nThere were some other ramen that I wanted to try so I would go back \nI didn't take pictures as it was quite dimly lit and they wouldn't have turned out\nShoutout for the great service though! Even though it was crazy busy the servers made sure to come over to us every so often to check up on things and managed the line well",

                "description": "As far as London food goes, I can see why this place is hyped. It has enough uniqueness going for it, and Asian foods are trending pretty hard right now. But as far as Japanese food goes in particular, I'm a snob and very much an isolationist. I want my dishes simple and authentic. Not a huge fusion fan either. And I want my tastebuds to feel the sensation of being transported to the land of the rising sun. \nWith that disclaimer out there, if you want an original experience, sure, hit up Bone Daddies. But if you want an authentic experience, you won't get that here. This is big-time, hipster noodle fare.\n- The noodles are frozen. You can't customize the consistency and they cook them pretty soft here (firm should be the standard). They're also crimpy to the max. T_T\n- They don't serve rice. At all. No rice. Zero.\n- Tea is from a packet.\n- They don't have togarashi. Seriously? \n- No vinegar either.\n- The broths are not so much flavorful as they are intensely spicy. If spicy broth is your thing, then by all means, jet on over here for some indulgence. But I prefer rich and full broths.\nThe milky / creamy broth in the tantanmen was very interesting. I've never had it like this before. Or with peanuts. Or with chashu. But with very little ground meat in the first place. Hmmm. I ordered it without the extra chilies and it still had a crazy bite to it. The tantanmen 2 is even moreso, veryvery spicy.\nI'll end this on some positives. \n+ Their karaage is good as far as fried chicken goes, but no need to go crazy for it, guys. \n+ Kudos on offering black sesame and kinako flavours for dessert, but those dishes were too diluted for one to truly appreciate such unique tastes. Less subtle, more concentrated, please.\n+ Fresh garlic!\n+ Their bamboo had a good crunch and their eggs are cooked perfectly.\n+ Hilarious bibs on request, haha.",

Quite tasty; the broth is a bit too thick for my taste but some people may prefer it. Noodles were ok, a bit skimpy on the meat but satisfying overall. Chili sauce was more Chinese style than Japanese. It was fine but a bit of an ecclectic mix if you're expecting a Japanese ramen shop. Soft shell crab apps was very tasty & fresh; though the accompanying dipping sauce was quite odd & not a really good pairing. Agedashi tofu was quite disappointing. \nMay return but probably will try the chicken broth ramen instead and the chicken wings app (they look quite appetizing).",

I'm not sure if it was due to the rain outside or if it was always like this. Luckily, since I was by myself, I was seated immediately.\nAfter much debate, I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. The ramen is in a very rich chicken bone broth. The broth had a padron pepper floating in it, and complimented the pork neck chasu. I've had my fair share of ramen and I really loved this ramen. I found that although it was spicy (just the way I like it), the broth was just a teensy bit sweet. Not sure if that was due to the Miso? This did not bother me though. The pork and spiciness of the broth offset that sweetness and it was very well balanced. I'd love to try the tantanmen ramen the next time I am here though!",

I absolutely love ramen, and though I've spent a few months in Japan eating tons of it,  I'm no snob. I've slurped my fair share of 89cent pre-packaged block ramen and know that hey-- there's a spectrum. \nFrom what I'd read from others regarding ramen in London,  they don't really come close to the authentic fare,  but are still incredibly delicious. So when I saw that bone daddies was super hyped here and other places online,  I was actually really excited (despite the overwhelmingly hipster vibes). In the end,  I left disappointed. \nI had the tonkotsu ramen, hyped for a punch of that 20 hour deep, rich porky flavor, but instead I got an over salty (and trust me,  I loves me some salt) bowl of mediocrity. I can't speak for any of the other dishes,  but really... Even the crazy blaring music wasn't enough to distract me from how lacking in any depth of flavor this was. Like some basic stock and noodles. It was nothing special, so for the price, I didn't feel I'd gotten my money's worth. I've still yet to try some of the other recommended ramen places in London,  but as of now,  I definitely opulent rush back to bone daddies. \nTwo stars because the egg was perfectly cooked,  edamame delicious,  and asahi flowin'.",

I've been having a hard time finding dishes that are actually spicy in the UK, so I was beyond excited to find one that was. Aside from that, the flavor was amazing. Just thinking about it now I'm craving it. It was perfectly creamy and spicy, and there was just the right amount of chicken. I loved my dish, but it was huge and I couldn't finish it, and I was leaving on a plane so I couldn't take it go to. I wish there were smaller portions. Also, I do prefer to not eat meat when I can, but the only broth they had was mushroom, which I'm allergic to, so it would be nice if they could get more vegetable broths. The service was also really weak despite there being 5 people working. They stood around and talked a lot and seemed kind of irritated to be asked for water or for the check. However, the food itself was so good that the rating deserves to be high. Definitely recommend this place even with the service not being the best!",

Music is a little loud, and the high-stall seating doesn't make me feel so inclined to stay here all evening. Bone Daddies will always be a bit of an in and out affair for me. \nThe uname-rich vegetarian mushroom broth at Bone Daddies is a solid veggie alternative to the traditionally meaty tonkotsu. At around £10, the price is a little steep, but this is Soho. The mushrooms in this broth are delicious, though on my last visit I got only three pieces of tofu. Inconsistent but delicious.",

Very straightforward menu with great descriptions. I'm always a sucker for Tonkotsu based soups so of course I got that and it tasted dreamy. My friends got the Spicy Miso (lots of flavor, almost overwhelming but in a good way) and the T22 (a chicken broth based soup, he got it because it said \"cock shavings\" haha but my Tonkotsu still had more flavor than the T22). \nHopefully the hair ties don't get reused but that is hilarious touch. I also dig their bathrooms. \nThe ramen is solid, but could have been more generous with the noodles and broth (or maybe I'm just a piggy). I would like to try their chicken karrage next time as well. \nCONS - None really, I need to update this review once I try the neighboring competitor, Shoryu. ;)",

Let's start!\nPROS:\n- Ramen is really good, tasty and rich. I normally go for a TANTANMEN but also SOY RAMEN is lovely and the price is good (11£ or less),\n- food is coming quickly,you don't have to wait ages and there are also some nice thing on the table like elastic band for people with long hair or additional garlic, chilli and sesame.Nice!\nCONS\n- nice food = big queue. Don't think you go there on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday evening (after 7pm) and you will get a table in 5 mins. You will get a table in 15 mins (if you are lucky...)\n- This place is really loud!Loud music playing all the times. If you are going with friends, the conversation with them could be quite difficult.\n- small venue: I think they might have 10 tables in total and quite closer one to the other so if you want a bit of privacy or having a chat (hard with the loud music playing in the background), this could be a problem.\nIn the end, I give you a 4 star my dear Bone Daddies, but trust me, you'll need to get some areas improved :)",

I'd walked past this place a few times and read about it when searching for good ramen in Soho and I have to say I was pretty disappointed :( The place itself was cool, nice ambience, good decor, clean, good location.... Was quite promising when we came in, but.... The food was average... Bummer. As a general measure when I get ramen, I always try the tonkotsu... If the place can make a good flavoursome clean tonkotsu then it's gotta be a bangin' place... Sadly the only thing good about this tonkotsu were the thin yellow noodles.. The broth was way too fatty and 'creamy' in a not so nice way as the flavour lacked depth and seasoning. You have some egg in there and a couple of slices thin pork. For the price you pay and the lack of real tonkotsu flavoured broth you're better off going to a Shoryu chain or even Wagamamas and that's saying something 'cos they're average too. The food also came out super fast which was a little concerning. Service was inconsistent depending on staff. Hmm... I feel bad to give them a dull review but... Maybe I'll come back and try something different...",

                "description": "Oh, gosh. Three stars at best. Two stars at worst. Let's settle with three because the service was really something special.\nI think part of the problem I am going to have with all ramen shops in London is that none of them are going to match the ramen I ate in Tokyo a handful of months ago. It's just not going to happen. Plus, diners are waaaaaaayyyyyyy too politically correct with how they eat a bowl of Ramen in England. Please, people, just shove your head into the bowl and slurp those noodles up into your mouth. \nMy husband and I started off on a good foot. We popped in at prime dinner time and were seated straightaway at the bar in front of the windows. I liked the curtains hung on the entance, very Japanese. I ordered a Berry Berry Somethingorother which was made of gin and had a fresh raspberry in it but I wasn't wowed by it. I mean, it was OK but nothing special. I was more wowed by the fact that such a fancy cocktail was served to me in what is considered a fast food shop in Japan.\nOn the table was:\n-a bottle of fresh garlic cloves and a garlic press\n-chopsticks, napkins and bibs (happy I brought my own fork, BYOF)\n-a bottle of hair ties (yes, like to tie your hair back into a ponytail)\n-various sauces like soy and some chili-based looking sauce\nWe ordered the fried chicken, the T22 and a second kind of ramen which fails to come to memory at present. The fried chicken came in a little stainless steel bucket and looked a bit like popcorn chicken but larger pieces. Some of the pieces had been sitting underneath the heating lap for an extended period of time because they were cold and chewy. Other pieces were hot as though they just came out of the fryer. I remember commenting, \"I'd rather have wasted these calories at KFC).\" So, there's that.\nMy ramen, the T22, was not super great or even great. Now that I think about it, it wasn't even that good. I highly disliked the crackling. The noodles looked like they came out of a packet. The chicken was sparse. And, in general, it just was not my cuppa ramen. Also, as an added bonus, I started burping up the broth about 30 minutes after eating.\nPerhaps it my ramen selection that literally left a bitter taste in my mouth or perhaps Bone Daddies just doesn't have as great of ramen as claimed. Either way, there are too many other ramen shops in London to try before returning to Bone Daddies.",

The right amount of spring onion, bean sprout, crispy garlic slices, bamboo shoots, and a little picked ginger right in the middle. Perfect eggs, perfect slices of pork. Topped off by a little house chili oil sauce, and wow. I ate the whole bowl and would have licked it if I could have fit my face inside. \nJust noticed I used the word \"perfect\" three times! So it's just not getting that fifth star because I think £11 is a bit much, and a pint of Asahi for £4.5 is a bit steep too. A beer and a bowl of (admittedly totally delicious) ramen coming out to £16? I happily paid, but secretly wished was more like £12 (£9 for the ramen, £3 for the beer) - then it'd get 5 stars. Perhaps I trifle. \nAnyway, as I said, nom.",

We ordered soft shell crab and a pork/corn croquette. After 20 minutes I complained, I said where is my food? My lunch hour ends in 20 minutes! Waiter went away and then started serving other people.\nAt this point the starters got delivered. Flagged down another waitress and said I wanted to complain that the 3 different groups who arrived behind us got their STARTERS AND MAIN delivered before us. She explained our starters were fried so it takes longer.\nWhat? Frying food take longer than regular food?\nRamen came with the original waiter. He explained because there was a big group and because it was fried it took longer. I said well then you should have told me frying food takes longer and I would've just told you to bring me the ramen first! He said he didn't know we were in a rush. Mate, I came here before, I didn't need to explain I was in a rush, the food arrived at decent intervals!!!!\nI was speechless. It's lunch hour in the middle of Soho which is pretty much surrounded by working types yes? We are not in the suburbs here! I was too shocked to speak and my face must have given away a million words. He explained the croquettes were on the house. \nPAH.\nBecause of this farce the food tasted horrible and tasteless to me. I was in no mood to enjoy any of this. We had about 7 minutes to chow down the ramen and pay and leave. I was late back to work anyway.\nI'm not coming back. Don't do lunch hour if you can't handle it. \nI actually just remembered the same thing happened to me at Flesh n Buns during lunch. My colleague and I ordered 4 starters and 2 mains. After 20 minutes we chased and 2 starters came. After 20 more minutes the other 2 starters came. We had 10 minutes to make main course and run back to the office. They didn't have a takaway licence. We ended up paying for 4 starters and eating instant noodles at the office. The place was empty mind you, it's not like they had a full house to cook lunch for.\nDEFINITELY do not come here if you don't have more than an hour spare.",

Thanks ladies and gents!\nWhen one has a fussy baby only a cocktail can curb the angst. Too bad they were out of the watermelon juice.  That sounded amazing. Instead I had what tasted like a 'porn star' minus the champs. The passion fruit drink was still yummy. The dza had the 'mule' and liked it very much. \nWe tried and loved the fried chicken which so happened to be baby's first taste of chicken and she loved it too. \nThe yellowtail sashimi reminded us of our favorite dish back home so we were more than pleased to see some jalapano on the plate. \nThe soft shell crab was pretty bland and i'm actually n ot sure if it was cooked all the way through, but we still ate it. was ok, batter was like, and the dipping sauce was ok. Just an overall meh dish. \nBut I really really enjoyed the food that we did try and will most def go back for more.",

                "description": "I love this place, I really do and the only reason why I knock it is that it's a lot of money for what amounts to a bowl of ramen. I went for lunch with my mum and my sister (a quick lunch mind as it was a workday) and our total bill was over £50.\nThat said, it is damn good ramen, having tried Shoryu and Tonkotsu, it is, in my opinion, the winner in the area. Get there early, there aren't reservations and it's all communal seating. If you're a big party you might even lose your place in the queue as smaller groups are seated where they can fit.\nMy sister loved the fact that they had a) plastic bibs, and b) a little bottle of hairbands for tying back your hair so you didn't eat it while you slurped your noodles. And you want to slurp your noodles. Ramen arrived quickly along with a single order of croquettes and we went to town. If your noodles don't come with an egg, order the egg as an extra, it's worth it. 2 Tonkotsu and a Tantanmen were ordered on this day and the bowls went down a treat.\nGet there early, sit and enjoy your noodles and then make way for the next customer. A long drawn out meal this isn't!\nI'm going to um and ah about this one for a while but yes, for now, Bone Daddies your are a solid 4 out of 5. Who knows, I might upgrade it later.",

                "description": "Yay!! London seems to be getting better and better at ramen!! Finally!!\nI have been excited about Bone daddies for aaaages! I've been following them on twitter and drooling over the photos...so I had high expectations that this would be a decent ramen venue. It seems like other yelpers had the same idea as we had the biggest turn out ever for a ramen club! Thank you all for joining me!!\nOn to the noodles:\nOh my goodness the tonkotsu ramen made me happy! The soup was rich, creamy and you can tell those bones have been brewing for a looong time. I initially thought there was not quite enough broth for that number of noodles, but actually it was all so rich that I found it difficult to finish it all.\n- Soup = Gorgeous...now I want to try all the other flavours\n- Eggs = Cooked to perfection with squidgy middles and well-seasoned\n- Meat = Fatty, full of flavour and so tender that it falls apart on your chopsticks\n- Extras = It was good that you can add extra garlic...and I shared some of Rob's extra pipette of fat. Yum\n- Noodles = Perfect\nThe staff were complete sweeties and coped well with such a large group.\nThe only let-down for me was the karaage chicken...the taste was okay but it wasn't crunchy (maybe they made it in advance and reheated it???) \nThe drinks were also a bit pricey... over £8 for ume-shu!? wha!?\nHowever these weren't big enough gripes to detract a star, so I think I have found my new favourite ramen shop.",

Certainly judging by the queues and type of people you see in it.\nThe Tonkotsu Ramen is my personal fav, with its 20 hour pork bone broth. Corr blimey it's good. Seems to be a trend to outdo each other with how many hours you can make that broth within Ramen places but let me tell you it makes a difference.\nI also really like their fried chicken. And you can't go to a Japanese without getting the chicken. Though I prefer the proper term Karaage Chicken.\nNext time I will come purposely a little drunk and for their late night menu. 10.30pm-11.30pm they have a great deal for 2 courses and a whiskey cocktail for £15.

We're big Koya fans but Bone Daddies is equally as good, if not quite as zen (and of course the menus are very different).\nWe had some delicious sake to keep us warm in the queue and then were ushered to some of the best seats in the house (near hooks for hanging coats! joy!) where we were swiftly served with drinks and our fantastic starters - soft shell crab and tenderstem broccoli with their respective sauces were absolutely top drawer. We were surprised to discover the sauce with the broccoli is made with a Japanese citrus fruit - it's hard to describe its unique flavour but that's not what we would have guessed. The fiery green pepper/jalapeno based accompaniment with the soft shell was also unusual and a great match.\nRamen was outstanding. I followed Yee Gan's lead and had the tantanmen - it's fiery kick caught the back of my throat more than once, which was awesome! My bff also loved his tonkutsu ramen, he drained the bowl in about 10 minutes.\nService as I said was swift but also friendly and enthusiastic with the staff despite how busy it was taking time to explain the sauces to us and not rushing us out despite me taking forever to eat my ramen (it really is filling!).\nFinally, at £11 a bowl this is perfectly priced - for the quality of the food it's excellent value.\nExcited already for my next visit!",

Bone Daddies has arranged the perfect union between an hipster atmosphere and quite authentic ramens. \nI hate the food fusion but mixing atmosphere with (good) food is fine. To the ramen, Bone daddies has added this typical low-light, hipster-waiters with beard. The only Japanese elements I spotted in the interior was a photo of the Yoyogi park where Japanese dance disguised as Elvis - indicating which bathrooms were for women or for men (which did not seem obvious to everybody though).\nAnd as the food was indeed very good, let me add a few word on what matters the most in the end. For appetizers we had CHASHU PORK & CORN CROQUETTE which was a rather random choice but it was a very good pick and I highly recommend you to taste that: we were really surprised. For ramens, i had the \"T22\" (they were really inspired on this one or maybe I miss the reference) and the broth was really really tasty. Hipsters do know how to make ramens, they are evolving.",

I am a ramen newbie and this was my first time having authentic ramen (Wagamama's doesn't count!) and I wasn't sure what to expect. \nWe started with the salmon sashimi which was so pretty and delicious! It came with bubu arare (puffed rice balls, I've never had them before but I love them!) ponzu sauce, and coriander and was so so yummy! I am a big salmon sashimi fan and I think this was actually my favorite part of the meal:P\nI ordered the tantanmen 2 ramen with chicken broth, which was one of the only two options without pork on the menu. I found this a bit limiting, but I'm told that in the future they will have some beef broth options. My friend got the miso broth and enjoyed it a lot. We also admired the cute logo of the place and the interesting name (it fits so well! what a neat place!)\nWhen my tantanmen arrived I wasn't sure what to expect with my first real ramen, and my first impression was that it had quite a kick! The broth is spicy and much thicker and creamier than I expected. After a few sips I got used to the spice and enjoyed the intense flavour it gave the ramen noodles. I was skeptical about trying the eggs at first since I am not an egg person, but they looked so good sitting there with their melting yolks that I had to try it and am glad I did. They are as silky as everyone here is saying and the perfect ramen eggs. The noodles and chicken were good and the few random pieces of bamboo. I think for a first timer, I found the broth too rich and heavy to drink it all but I enjoyed the half of it I managed. \nThe service was friendly and very helpful. The place itself is probably hipster heaven with a long line of cold people waiting to get into a very busy and tiny place. I am still not a huge ramen person because the broth takes getting used to, but it is comforting in this weather and I look forward to coming back another freezing day and trying the fried chicken appetizer too!",

Could have done with a bit more chashu and some more varied ingredients. They also use thin, straight vermicelli  noodles, which is not necessarily bad, but it didn't satisfy my craving for springy wavy style egg noodles. Our waitress also disappeared completely after dropping our bowls which was a bit annoying. \nThat said, it wasn't the worst ramen I ever had. The chashu was good and overall if you're craving ramen you'll be ok here.

I got the tonkotsu and the husband got the tantanmen.  The Clarence Court egg was impressive.  The yolk was barely set and was a stunningly rich orange color.  The pork was tender and flavorful, although sliced too thin.  I wasn't a fan of the menma.  It was too sour, almost like eating bamboo shoots from a can, where they acquired this unique sour note that is absent in fresh or vacuum packed bamboo shoots.  \nMy main complaint was the broth.  There can be too much of a good thing and in this case the broth was too rich and too thick.  I love a rich broth like the one from Santouka, but here, it was hard to appreciate the complexity and the umami taste of the broth because it was too oily and viscous.  Husband liked the tantanmen, but I find the peanutty broth too sweet.",

It's not biggie, they've got heat-lamps and it moves fast if you're solo or a party of 2.  \nLove: efficient, tasty, well-priced, tasty, tasty.  Did I say: tasty?  \nYEAH.  \nSuper-appreciate that, despite being a busy spot, never ever felt rushed to finish up and open up my seat (I had some 2015 catching up to do with a pal!).\nGreat, attentive service - good tap water (yeah, yeah, it's a consideration!) served in great cups.\nOne watch-out: the tantanman ramen?  Hot as Hades.  Delish, but *hot as Hades*.  As my dining companion advised: \"they should have a flame icon next to that one!\".  Wurd.\nYelp note:  just flipping love the DIY counter in front of you - garlic and press and sesame and soy and hot chills.  Yes.",

We were seated on two stools in the back  corner--definitely a tight squeeze so if you're not a fan of bar seating or close quarters, this isn't the place for you. I opted for the late night  special--a signature drink, pork bun and curry ramen for £15. We also tried the soft shell crab appetizer and the pork ramen. The signature drink was tasty but unmemorable. In a joint where cocktails can run you £9, I wasn't complaining in the slightest. \nThe pork bun was delish! The bun was soft and fluffy and folded over pork, fresh cucumber and hot pepper. The ginger sauce that accompanied the soft shell crab was superb. \nAs for the ramen, both broths were delicious but the curry stole the show for me. It came with small pieces of fried chicken, roasted hot peppers and cabbage. The broth was very rich and flavorful. The pork in the pork ramen was sliced thin and flavorful and the broth was light and...well porky. It also came with an egg which always adds some welcome richness. \nA nice touch was that they provide both plastic bibs for slurping splash and hair ties to pull your hair back! I thought these were some thoughtful details. \nService was great despite being packed, food was delicious--this spot gets my vote!",

                "description": "As a ramen junkie from New York, I've been traveling around the world looking for great bowls of ramen. I've been happy with the recent boom of higher quality ramen in the cities across the world, and traveling through London, I've been very impressed so far.\nI have heard Bone Daddies being compared with Kanada-Ya as the best ramen in London, so I had to come by and try it out. I stopped in at around 1:30 PM on a Wednesday, and there was no queue to get seated.\nThe space is bigger than expected, and seating was comfortable. They have a decently sized cocktail menu, some Japanese beers on draft, and a fairly impressive shochu and sake selection. There are sesame seed grinders, chili oil jars, and fresh garlic (with garlic presses) at each table, which I really liked.\nI ordered a Cambridge G + T to start out, which is a tailored gin with Japanese botanicals served over ice with a bottle of Fever Tree tonic and a lime wedge. It was refreshing and great on this boiling hot summer afternoon.\nFor my starter I got the fried chicken, which is prepared in the Karaage style. It was decent, but just a little drier for my tastes, and some of the cuts looked weird - not uniform chunks, so perhaps the thicker pieces came out juicier if they cooked at the same time? It came with some lemon, but due to some of the pieces being drier than others, I would have preferred a sauce, perhaps a tonkatsu sauce or something? The seasoning was good though.\nFor my main, the star of the show, I ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu ramen, which is my personal favorite style. Born in Hakata, tonkotsu ramen, or \"pork bone\" broth ramen is usually very rich and served with straight and thin noodles, since the broth sticks very well to the strands. It was absolutely perfect here, thick, rich, and absolutely perfectly seasoned. The broth had a nice layer of mayu black garlic oil at the top, and was topped with a nicely cooked marinated soft-boiled Clarence Court egg, scallion, bamboo, garlic chips, ginger, and bean sprouts.\nThe noodles were cooked perfectly, and the broth was absolutely perfect. I pressed a clove of garlic and put some ground sesame into the broth and quickly finished the noodles. I was still hungry, so I ordered a kaedama (extra noodles) and more bamboo. It came out very quickly (within 90 seconds), which is a great sign of a ramen kitchen, and I finished every drop of the broth.\nThe bowls are fairly priced here and they don't nickel-and-dime you for each additional topping like some places do, and the service was on point. I highly recommend this ramen joint to anyone who likes ramen in London, and I'll definitely be back here whenever I'm in London!",

                "description": "Summary: \n+Great soya ramen \n+Lighter broth compared to tonkotsu (pork) based ramen\n+There's usually a queue. So watch out. \n+Quirky atmosphere \nOverall:\nI went to one of my go-to noodle places in central London. Bone Daddies is one of the specialist ramen restaurants that opened in 2012 in the midst of what surely will be remembered in history as the First Ramen Rush. (I made that up.) This was a truly glorious time for ramen aficionados in which three specialist ramen restaurants opened one after another in central London in a period of less than 10 months. It is generally agreed in our enlightened circle that significance of this series of events matches that of other events that took place that year such as London Olympics, the phone hacking scandal or the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. OK, that was an overstatement. But it was a good year. \nAnyway. I arrived at the restaurant five minutes before their opening to have an early dinner. After a few minutes of waiting, a friendly waiter showed me to a counter seat by the large window that oversees the street. Across the street, I could see people cleaning large glass windows of what looked like a new juice bar that was about to open. I tried to remember what kind of shop was there before but I couldn't. I guess it didn't matter after all. If they had food, I would have remembered something. \nBy the time I ordered, there was already a few more groups in the restaurant. The restaurant calls itself a \"ramen bar\". Appropriately, the counter tables and high stools decorate the hip dining space along with quirky Japanese posters from the 1960s. \nFood: \nI ordered their signature dish, soya ramen. \nThe soup is based on clear chicken broth and soya sauce mix. The result is incredible richness without the excessive grease of pork-based broth. The soya sauce and slightly burnt green onion adds a hint of bitterness and flavour to the broth. \nThe thin noodles are relatively easy to manoeuvre with chopsticks. They go very well with the delicate broth. I wonder if what people say about pasta (fat pastas for creamy sauces, thin pastas for light sauces) also applies here. \nThe mild peppery taste and the crunchy texture of fresh mizuna leaves are a lovely addition. I previously never understood the appeal of this understated green vegetable but I have now revised my opinion about it.",

                "description": "Just reviewing the tonkatsu ramen.\nYelp Japan score: 3/5\nYelp UK score: 5/5\nI've travelled to remote suburbs and small towns in Japan in search of specific ramen joints, so I like to think I know a bit about it by now. And this is a decent bowl. I don't know what some of these other reviewers were served, but mine was pretty good - and so far the best I've had in London (and will likely find until Ippudo opens).  \nNoodles: A bit overcooked... they should be firmer, but this is likely a local market compromise. Next time I'll ask for firm noodles.\nBroth: Very good. The black garlic oil is great too.\nEgg: Perfect. As good, better, than any I've had before. Order an extra one.\nCharsu: Decent. I prefer it thicker, but fatty and good. \nNeeds: Some ginger or something pickled (besides garlic) to cut through the richness of the broth. \nTip: Please don't wait for your 'soup' to cool off. Ramen is about the noodles - firm noodles being sucked up coated in hot fatty soup. Slurp them, it's ok, you're allowed to slurp ramen and it cools them a bit so you don't burn your mouth to much (a little burn is part of of the experience - don't worry, you will heal). As well, letting the noodles and soup cool off, this is like being served a burger and then waiting for the melted cheese to coagulate first. Wrong, wrong, wrong. (Sorry, watched this happen a few times here.)\nFYI: The price. I know it's London and ramen is still new and trendy, but £12.38 a bowl is steep. This works out to ¥2101 or $20.46! Ouch! Tokyo is supposed to be the most expensive city in the world, but this same bowl of noodles would cost you only about ¥800-900 or £5.40 even in the most expensive parts of Tokyo. (I know, supply chain and all that. But still... Cheaper in Tokyo!)",

The staff are fast, the food emerges pipping hot from the kitchen in minutes, and the casual environment makes it easy to jump in and out for a quick pre-theater bite--although it does get crowded with a long wait midday and at dinner, naturally. Price points are a bit high, but the quality of food makes up for it. The chicken karage is absolutely perfect. Marinated and just slightly battered, it makes for a great shared starter. The tender stem broccoli comes with a side of spicy orange sauce, which would make anyone adore green steamed yet cold-served veggies. The noodles are bit on the chewy/al dente side, but every ramen house has a different style, this is just Bone Daddies' I suppose. I'm also not a ramen fan per se, and usually stick to menu starters at ramen joints, so take my comment with a grain of salt.

                "description": "The short is that Bone Daddies is a great Ramen place and worth your time.\nSeating is a little close quarters due to the small space and need to pack as many high standing stools as close as possible. Service is prompt and pleasant. Due to the small space, your proximity to a staff member is always less than 2 meters in any direction.\nI ordered a Tantanmen Ramen. This is the spicy minced pork variety. When it arrived it looked amazing. But I was a little disappointed as it was thick with oil. Upon tasting the broth was quite bland to the point I actually asked for a plate to remove some of it as I'm not a fan of food served like this, even if it was chilli oil. That removed, suddenly the flavours of the broth came through and it was delish. A side of fried chicken rounded things off nicely. Fried to crisp perfection, in bite sized pieces and without bones. Mmm.\nOn drinks, I ordered the Red rocket, a fizzy bright red concotion of raspberry, Yuzu and Soda. Delish and refreshing, but perhaps a bit much with the Ramen broth but great as a drink in it's own right.\nSo in all, Bone Daddies isn't a place you'll want to linger long in. It isn't designed for comfort and service is prompt and quick for a reason. It wasn't particularly busy when arriving there around 12.30pm but by 1pm it was pretty packed so advice would be to get there early as I don't believe they take bookings.",

The eggs are perfect, with a creamy soft yolk. Adding chicken scratchings is a nice local touch, but I didn't feel they did much texture-wise.\nThe sides are hit and miss:\n- Deep fried soft-shell crab? Dericious.\n- Kara-age? Yes please.\n- Cabbage and miso? A little too literal. Pieces of raw cabbage served with miso paste to dip. Feels like something I would eat when the shops are closed and I'm rummaging through my fridge.\nI think Ippudo in NY generally does a better job, and rumor is that it's coming to London this year.

                "description": "Wonderful restaurant in Soho. The staff were all really hospitable and the ramen was really nice. Not lots of space in the restaurant but the space available was always filled with people. Clearly this place is worth it's rating. \nI had heard about this restaurant through a Yelp search, and decided that it sounded like a great place to get ramen in London. The restaurant is reasonably easy to find, we just needed to ask a local where it was when Google Maps said we were close by, but we had no clue where to look. \nThere wasn't much of a line when we got there around lunch time so we were seated right away. Because I had come with my family who didn't really know much of ramen other than the plastic packets you can get in stores, they didn't have much of a clue on what was what. The staff helped them on what the different ramen where made of and what they preferred.\nWe ended up ordering one tonkotsu, two tantanmen and one T22. The ramen came reasonably quickly and they were very aesthetically pleasingly presented.\nThe tonkotsu was very, very delicious. The dark sesame oil on top gave the already amazing broth a toasted flavour. The broth was a milky colour, as would be expected of a bone marrow, and the noodles were a bit thicker than somen noodles which was a bit surprising, given that I am more used to having thicker noodles, but they tasted just fine. The ramen was topped with chashu pork, soft boiled eggs and green onion. \nThe others were very pleased with their noodles too. The tantanmen was reasonably spicy and the bokchoy on the side was very refreshing. The T22 was equally as good. \nNeedless to say we were all very, very pleased with our food. The portions were perfectly filling, although there was space for a special dessert from their menu. We ordered a sesame ice-cream to share,  which ended up being a very interesting experience since none of us had ever tasted a sesame flavoured soft serve. It was a perfect end to the meal and all of us agreed that we'd be coming back in the future. \nI ended up coming back the next day for another serving since I'd been enchanted by the ramen. You simply can't find such good ramen in Norway so I had to take advantage of the restaurants' existence.",

The broth was rich with flavour (can definitely tell the broth was watched over for 20 hours) and had a good serving of noodles.  One of the things I hate is when ramen houses are stingy with their noodles. We also ordered the kimchi side dish which wasn't real kimchi (I know kimchi, I'm Korean).  Not sure if they make it in-house, but it's not traditional and was a bit of a weird neon orange color.\n \nDrinks: They have a pretty good drink menu for a ramen house which includes sake, shochu, wine, beer and cocktails. \n \nPrice: Reasonable.  For two Tonkotsu Ramen and one side order of Kimchi came out to 28.12 GBP.\n \nAmbiance: The restaurant was packed on a Sunday evening and very lively. All seating is communal.\n \nService: The host was friendly and we were able to get seated right away which was great since I've heard about the crazy queues.  Our server was very nice and our food came out pretty quickly.\nWould I go back?  Yes;.  This is the best ramen I've tried so far in London.",

My husband got the soy ramen and I got the tonkatsu ramen! The tonkatsu was salty and dark. I didn't even want to finish it.

Pork bone soup might scare off some, but that just means MORE SOOOP for you, Gentle Yelper (I swear I can spell, but those O's get across something I can't articulate in words).\nI've never seen such a broth. Milky white and as rich as it looks, I found myself basically scraping the bowl to get the final garlicky dribbles at the bottom before making an unhappy face that it was done.\nThe nitamago (ramen egg) is perfectly done, with a bright orange yolk that just oozes into the broth. The squiggle of dark soy sauce is indeed unnecessary for taste, but the colors, o the colors. The pork actually was the least interesting part, but I suggest paleo/atkins folks will be happier with the slices? The bamboo shoots are great for breaks between indulging in the creamy noodles, and be sure to throw in just a little chili oil to kick things up a notch. There's also a garlic press with whole pickled cloves, but even I as a garlic fiend didn't think this was necessary. \nThe ramen noodles were interesting and not quite what I've had before in other places, but they do a good job of soaking up just enough broth without wilting away.\nA bowl of tonkotsu will run you £11 + £1 something for service, but as a once-in-a-while treat, definitely worth it.\nBig fan of the decor at Bone Daddies, with walls plastered with photos of the too-cool-for-gakkou rockabillies in Yoyogi Park. \nI'll definitely come back to try out the tantanmen or the tsukemen.",

The decor is really beautiful, and the seating is mostly at communal tables. They have wall hooks around the store for you to hang your coat which was really convenient!\nAll of your utensils are in a big can in the middle of the table, so you can grab whatever you need. They are also supplied with hair ties and bibs so you can thoroughly enjoy your meal without making a big mess! They also had a jar of sesame seeds, garlic, and chili sauce.\nOur order was taken promptly, and we ordered the softshell crab, salmon and yellowtail tartare, spicy miso, and one more ramen - the name is escaping me. \nThe softshell crab and the tartare was delicious!! I will have nightmares about never getting to eat it again when I leave London. The sauce that was included with it was also to die for - super spicy too! The tartare came with some fried lotus chips, and the combination was like a new, japanese take on the holy grail of chips and salsa. \nA reason why I knocked Bone Daddies down a star is because it is too salty! I used to stay away from ramen places because I thought they were ALL too salty; later experiences taught me that really good ramen has salt, but it isn't distracting at all. If only Bone Daddies was a little less salty it would have been PERFECT.\nThe service was mediocre - there wasn't anything bad that happened but I have definitely had better service in many other places. It was a bit on the pricey side, but I also got the pricier appetizers to start. Overall, it was a solid ramen place, and I will most likely be back for more.",

However, the chicken stock combined with the seaseme oil and crushed peanuts gave this a strange aftertaste that lingered long after i had left the restaurant..\nThinking i had made the wrong menu choice, i went back today and had the only ramen with pork broth. The Tonkotsu Ramen is the benchmark upon which all good ramen should be judged!  Again the broth, although very thick and velvety, lacked any real complexity.

                "description": "When I think of ramen in London, I think of Bone Daddies. Yes, more than likely you will need to queue but that's only a sign for what's inside is worth it. \nThe food is tasty with quite a variety of ramen bowls, leaving you with a very satisfying fullness. Particular shout out to the soft shell crab! \nThe place itself, as others have mentioned, is hipster, with a casual feel. It can get pretty loud in there due to the size and music but you can have a conversation fine. What I like are the cute touches. On the table there are bibs for obvious reason, but also little jars of hair bands. As a female with long hair, this certainly helped me out.\nA frequent diner and would urge anyone else to try it out. Yes, a bit on the pricy side but we are in London after all. Definitely go and see for yourself.",

                "description": "Summary: 5 stars even against my list of 40+ noodle soup places globally.  Quality ingredients are why you pay the price of 11£.  Appetizers are nice.  Great service. Don't be such a snob, wear the bib.\nAtmosphere:  It's a little noisy, but the decor is so cute.  Would absolutely recommend going with friends.  Went for lunch.  Very few people at that time, though I'm told lines are quite long.  To get the full experience, you should wear the bib and tie hair. Not too many people were doing this. I think that's a mistake.  \nService:  Excellent.  Nice happy greeting when I walked in.  Very quick service.  Ideal for the short span I had for lunch.  \nFood: Full Stars!!\nSoft shell crab - 4 stars!  well tempura'd and cleaned.  As an appetizer, it's not bad. I wouldn't rave like the others on the list, but I can't rate it low either.  The mayonese mustard was ok.  Solid execution, but just not quite my thing.  This was not the basis of my rating.\nThe ramen - 5 stars!  On the suggestion of Yee Gan, I had the tonkutsu.  The broth is a delicious thick meaty hearty yum.  The noodles were reasonable, though I have had slightly better quality noodle.  This was not bad though.  The egg was wonderfully marinated in soy teriyaki, the pork retained it's own sweet flavor.  I really appreciated the toasted garlic.  Have not seen that one, or at least not so well executed. If you're a huge garlic fan, they also have a garlic press that allows you to add to your heart's content. Other condiments include hot chili, which I like versus the typical Japanese hot powder.\nSoft serve green tea ice cream -  5 stars! I find myself surprised that I have such high marks for ice cream.  This was particularly good.  Aside from having just the right green tea and sweetness (not too overpoweringly sweet), the soft serve texture was something special on an unseasonably warm sunny day.  Amazing and worth trying!",

I ordered their vegetarian dish, which is probably not their best dish but given the reputation of this place it should still be better than average. It was alright.\nWould have been 3 stars overall, but lost a star for service, they were a bit rude, an older woman was either the manager or owner was a bit pushy. We showed up just to order drinks, and they said they were only seating dinner, that's fine. We returned an hour and half later for ramen, but we got the impression they would rather not have our business. There were open seats.\nAnd there was a Stan's dad, whole foods thing.... I don't know if you have ever seen the South Park episode where Stan's dad Randy buys lunch at whole foods and Whole Foods auto opt in for donating to a feed the children charity. Same deal. Check comes and they've already adding the donation for the charity and hand me a brochure for the charity. They could have at least said by the way, \"Tonight will include a donation to such and such charity\". \nOverall, 3 stars.",

I love the garlic press at the table and you can even ask them for extra chilies to make your ramen spicier.

                "description": "Having now had the opportunity for multiple visits, I've eaten my way through all the ramens and most of the starters. My visits have produced a consistent level of food and service, which is nice\nWhat I love about the ramens is that they all taste different. Though I thought that my favourite would continue to be tonkotsu ramen, in fact my current favourite is tantanmen ramen which has the same depth of flavour in the soup but it comes with a great chilli kick - I love it but if you don't like heat, then I would recommend that you ask them to dial it down a bit\nI echo Tim L's advice to ask for cock scratchings (crispy chicken skin) which add a wonderful crunch and umami kick to the dish\nAs for starters, I prefer the salmon sahimi over the yellowtail. Crispy soft shell crab is great, especially with the spicy mayonnaise though the portion isn't the biggest. A great sharing dish with friends is the artichoke, where you can all dive in and pluck the leaves to dip them\nThe drink variety is big from no-quibble tapwater to sake (served in a traditional wooden box) all the way to cocktails\nThe only warning is that the most recent addition to the bottles of condiments on the table that you can add to the ramen is actually a bottle containing hairbands! Definitely inedible but as my dining companion today, Minnie M said, it was the perfect thing she needed to stop her hair getting into her bowl of soup. They really have thought of everything!\nPerhaps the greatest accolade for this place is that it's the sort of  place I'd be proud to bring friends. Still the best ramen in town",

And how 'bout that sesame grinder ... eh? eh?\nFried chicken: Bite sized pieces of crispy crunchy chicken - nothing new there EXCEPT, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice from slice provided and go ahead and grind some sesame seeds on top of that. Heaven\nEdamame: Standard, but served in a good sized portion for two or four to share.\nTonkotsu with roast pork: Exactly what I hoped it would be and more. Broth was buttery and creamy and rich. Egg was perfectly cooked, noodles too. Meat was roasted perfectioness. Presentation was great too - didn't have to go hunting for the meat slices or that egg. I added cock scratchings per another reviewer's advice but it didn't do much for me. In fact, it pushed the flavour over the brink of salty/rich-ness; will not do that again. Didn't get the pipette of fat either and have no regrets.\nI had a cocktail that did not bowl me over (despite the waiter's enthusiasm for it). Can't recall its name, the watermelon one. I'd stick to beer next time.\nTips\nDO NOT USE APPLE MAPS TO FIND THIS PLACE. Just ... don't.\nWith all the other reviews I was worried it would be obnoxiously loud but I had no problem with that. But I don't feel I was warned about the cramped space. I mean really. Expect to be bumping elbows and brushing asses at every moment. Wait time was about 5 minutes for two on Saturday at 7p. No dessert menu. Two apps and two ramens was a tad too much food for two people, and way too much salt (even for this savory food addict).",

This place is all hyped rock n' roll non-traditional but really does that matter as long as the ramen is good? Like I said the broth is silky smooth and super creamy - my favorite way to have ramen. The noodles are springy and the chase pork was tender. Everything was super tasty. I wish they would put out the free pickles like they do in Japan but that's a small quibble. The home made pickles are worth ordering as an appetizer and an antidote to the richness of the ramen broth. The ramen bowl was enough for me without any other snacks. I wasn't even able to finish the bowl but I've grown accustomed to ramen coming in man-sized portions.\nThey don't take reservations and they don't have a waitlist where you can leave and wander about, you'll have to wait in line and people don't rush in/out like they do in Japan so be prepared.",

SO.GOOD. \nRamen, was alright but I was too occupied by the soup and the eggs. \nApparently, Timeout said that dinner for two would be approx £60. (SERIOUSLY, kids don't know how to thrift.)

                "description": "FINALLY a tasty ramen shop in London! It's been over a year and a half since I moved here from LA and I've been so sad about the quality of Asian food here. Everything seems to fall flat, and I don't know why.\nI went with a friend and had their cabbage and miso (starter), artichoke (starter), and Tonkotsu Ramen. The starters were incredibly moreish. The cabbage reminds me of a very homey veg + dip my family eats in China and is a fab alternative to the typical edamame. The artichoke is paired with a delicious dip with just enough kick to keep you interested. We also tried a pineapple sake and Asahi beer. The beer is some special Asahi brew (I don't understand beer so don't quote me) but it stayed really cold and had a delicious rice-flavored aftertaste. The pineapple sake is dangerous -  reminds me of the fruity yogurt soju at korean bars - tastes like juice!\nBone Daddies do chashu pork really well. They do broth really well. They do their eggs so freaking well that I would push you, your mother, your grandmother, AND your little dog down the stairs to get more. Luckily for your family, you can order extra, and for a mere £1. Perfectly soft-boiled and so flavorful, the egg was the star for me. I have had fantastic broth at Ippudo in NYC and Daikokuya in LA but that egg is legend. And speaking with Chef Ross, it's only going to get better. I am dancing in anticipation.\nAlmost forgot to mention another star - their homemade chili oil. Don't be intimidated by the chili flakes in there. It adds a toasty, smokey, warm heat to the ramen without being overpoweringly spicy. I think it's a must, if only because it adds yet another dimension of flavor.\nIt's a brand new restaurant so they are constantly working on their menu, broth, and noodles. I personally thought it was all amazeballs, but I certainly welcome their ambition for better.\nIf you're one of those people who think Wagamama is an acceptable place for food, do yourself a favor and get schooled by Bone Daddies.",

I was quite excited to give it a try. We came here on a whim during one of the unusual snowy weekend in London. When we got there we got seated immediately by the uber friendly staff. The ambiance here is very casual, hip and on the loud side. The space can be a tad cramp but we were comfortable.\nFoodwise, I had the tonkatsu ramen while my husband had the soy ramen. My tonkatsu soup was pork bone base and as the menu stated took 20 hours to achieve its perfect rich flavor. The soy soup on the other hand is chicken base thus lighter but equally delicious (yep I had a slurp off of the mister's soup). Both soup had a descent amount of toppings (spring onions) while the noodles was just right (not too soft or hard). I cant tell if they were handmade but I found it really tasty. My only gripe here is the temperature of the soup. I thought that it could have been a bit more warmer than what I was served. Otherwise everything is good in this hood.",

I was worried about a massive queue but we were seated relatively quickly (albeit along a wall!)\nWe shared some fried chicken (tasty, not greasy although nothing too amazing). We both had ramen. My friend had the miso ramen which she loved - better than Koya!  I had the tantanmen ramen. I love spicy food but found that the heat overwhelmed the dish a bit but that said, I still loved it. In addition to the pork mince and one measly leaf of bok choy (um, couldn't they have upped the ruffage a bit??), there was also a soft boiled egg, peanuts and what I think was bamboo shoots. All very tasty!\nI'd definitely go back to try the rest of the menu.",

We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and tantanmen ramen, and they both came out in decent-sized bowls (I wouldn't call them large, though), but the ramen inside was just... not ramen. The noodles were some kind of flour noodles that you don't see in typical ramen, which made the entire texture of the dish very strange. On top of that, because they were flour noodles, they tended to clump together if you didn't separate them right when you got your bowl.\nOn the bright side, the soft-boiled egg was made perfectly, but sadly, that's the only highlight that I can say. The atmosphere of Bone Daddies is unique enough, but it's not a place I would frequent again or recommend to anyone for ramen.",

I'll recommend getting liquor up for this, unless you're a hippie or vegetarian, in which case you're fine.

I had the tonkotsu ramen and for a broth that was supposed to have been stewed for 20 hours, it really didn't taste like pork bone. Or anything for that matter. It was really thick and fragrant but it didn't actually taste like anything. Their chili oil also lacked any spice. The service was good though, the presentation of the food was nice and the place itself seems pretty hip (hence the two stars). But when it came down to the actual food itself, I am really disappointed and you shouldn't come here if you're looking for authentic ramen.

                "description": "This is now the second decent ish ramen place I've tried in London (after Shoryu) and I was extremely satisfied.\nFood:\nWe ordered fried chicken and pork ribs to start (though it was called pork bones or something different). The chicken was executed well and extremely tasty. The ribs were one up though. Tender, and in an awesome sauce.\nHad the Tonkotsu ramen for my main. \nBroth:\nThick and aromatic, I had high hopes. It semi delivered but just a tiny bit less flavourful than I expected. But initially at least, pretty damn good nonetheless, particularly after adding a bit of garlic.\nThe big caveat with the broth here is that there's quite a short optimum time to eat it in. Because of the thickness, as it cools down, it gets almost sedimentary and you can feel individual bits of it as it goes down your throat. At that point it gets notably less nice.\nNoodles:\nI like the texture of the noodles. Bit chewy but highly enjoyable. Their per bowl ratios are pretty off imo. Either they need more broth or less noodles in the bowl. It's really not an ideal ratio the way it's currently served.\nDrinks:\nI'm still pleasantly surprised when a place has mostly craft beers even though (fortunately) it is such a fast growing scene in this city. Had the kernel pale ale and really enjoyed it. Been meaning to head down to the Kernel brewpub (only open on Saturday for a few hours) and this has only increased said desire.\nOverall:\nWhen it comes to ramen chains no matter how many places I try I seem to have hardcore ippudo loyalty. This is the closest I've had to that in London, so I know I'll be back (and soon).",

                "description": "In the centre of Soho, Bone Daddies is a new ramen joint. It seems to be a mark of hipness not to have a  name or sign anymore on new places lest you might be guilty of not being cool enough to need a sign ...(hint it's next to Byron burger which does have a sign)... in fact I didn't see it at first because I thought it WAS Bryon burger. OK I clearly failed on that test of personal hipness.\nInside it has a utility interior - fairly compact and packed  already just a few days after opening with high counters and stools. Our group of Yelpers managed to straddle across the counter and the some of the window seats. The vibe is dim lighting,  loud music and competing conversations.\nStarted with the yellowtail sashimi which was really good. Presented on little wooden stakes it was very fresh and with a flavourful dressing plus coriander.\nI had to order the Tonkotsu ramen which is always tempting but also more challenging to deliver successfully, apparently. Our orders arrived quite quickly which was good. The Tonkotsu ramen was the best I have had so far on our Ramen outings.\nThe stock was perfect. Rich, flavourful, savoury, complex, fatty without appearing oily. Perhaps that's the magic of the claimed 20 hour cooking where the stock and bony goodness emulsifies together. This one delivered. The noodles were great too. Special note to the toppings and the super good egg, as others have noted. The pork was the best version I have had  in London and super tender and melt in the mouth fat and meat. \nQuantity wise it wasn't a huge portion but was rich and had plenty of noodles and I have to admit I was fully satisified afterwards. Perhaps a bit more stock would have been good.\nThe only slight negative was that it wasn't very hot so didn't need to do that loud slurpy thing since it was cool enough to eat direct. Would have preferred it a bit hotter.\nAccompanied by a nice Sake in a box.\nService was prompt and enthusiastic.\nThe only minor gripe for me was that the music was too loud, set at the volume level where you have to shout a bit, even to speak to the person sitting next to you. I don't know if others prefer it that way, maybe it's just me.\nPricing was relatively reasonable compared with other places and the quality was high and the meal was very enjoyable so a great combination overall.",

Whilst I'm too scared to go for the Tonkotsu Ramen (don't think I could take the potency of the Pork broth), I opted for the equally distinct flavour of their Tantanmen.\n....What a bad choice I made.\nWay too much Sesame paste used in the Ramen, could barely taste the Chicken Bone broth they claimed to have included in the bowl. The Sesame paste was soo intense I almost felt like heaving.\nSorry Bone Daddies but I don't think I'll be visiting you again, blame the heavy-handed chef you have...",

It is simply divine, and the portion sizes are guaranteed to leave you satisfied. \nI've tried a few of the ramen bowls they have here and love most of them. The T22 is probably my die hard favourite. As other people have said, you could probably get slightly more authentic ramen elsewhere; this is somewhat westernized ramen. That being said, it's still very delicious. Ingredients like the egg and cock scratchings are always done perfectly. Bone Daddies is also very allergen friendly. They're always happy to customize a dish for you.\nBesides for the ramen...\nThe fried chicken is one of my favourite starters. I couldn't possibly recommend it more. However, I don't love the pork/corn croquettes, and I think most of their sashimi is somewhat overpriced. \nI've had some sort of green tea sesame alcoholic smoothie there once that was on their specials board. It was divine and I keep hoping they'll bring it back sometime. Their other milkshakes, when they have them, are often equally good. \nAs a last tip, make sure you have a fair bit of time on your hands. I've always been served quickly, but have also always had to queue for at least 30 minutes (as they don't take reservations).",

It's the most expensive ramen I've ever had- I expected more from an £11 ramen. The venue is ok - quite small - not many tables and a lot of bar seating facing a wall. The service wasn't great either, took about 10 mins to get water. It seems like a popular place to hang out later in the evening as it got really crowded.",

                "description": "There is a lot to like about Bone Daddies but since I've become an obsessive fan of Tonkotsu ramen I have developed my own standards. With ramen I find it hard to judge because the broth can varied each day especially when you make it in large quantities at once unlike other dishes where you mostly cook it one at a time. So if I have a 'bad' ramen it could just be a 'bad' day but of course consistency would be great to have, just harder to get. I do usually go at least twice we confirm my judgement but this review is purely based on one lunch visit.\nBone Daddies is very well lit, white and red walls, trying to get in colours of Japan maybe? High stools which I never have been a fan of but it creates a quick turnover so Iess queuing. I would associate it more a quick lunch or dinner as it does get packed as seating is limited so trying so trying to get a group of friends to dine here is not ideal. It's place you are very likely to be seating next to a complete stranger if you have an available seat next to you so no room for personal space here.Still I love the laboratory feel to it with the random jars containing condiments to hair bands and even bibs for those messy eaters. Makes life a lot easier for those who keep dropping their chopsticks and could just use the mini self service area and pick a new pair up conveniently.\nSo I my lunch order was the obvious choice of Tonkotsu whilst my boyfriend ordered the kimchee seafood ramen which uses fish broth instead of mine being pork. We both ordered an extra egg too for £1 which is very reasonable as some places sell it at £2.50!! I only managed to have a few sip of the kimchee broth and a feel mussels and already felt the intense heat and spice kick in. There was a generous amount of seafood of prawns and mussels. The broth was slightly sweet for easier consumption but I'm not going to review anymore as it would be wrong of me to judge based on a few sips.\nSo moving on to my Tonkotsu, as much as I enjoyed the thick creamy broth and the firm bouncy noodles the broth really did needed depth. Creamy and thick was all it was but flavour wise it was lacking. Although we were given the choice to add whole cloves of garlic in the broth with the garlic presser as well I felt my broth was definitely hungry for some. I suppose I'm just used to tonkotsu having many notes of flavour. But texture and ingredients compensated on all that was lost to make it still enjoyable with a nice addition of black sesame oil for presentation and some flavour. The pork belly was incredibly tender throughout, generously sliced in perfect thickness. Eggs top notch, rich egg yolk still runny inside and gently seasoned. Nice crunches came from the beansprouts and bamboo too. \nIf I was purely reviewing on the ramen this meal would have been a 3 out of 5 but overall with the quick service, decor, menu choices it grabbed itself an extra star, Will need to go again to try it's other ramen though as I do want this place to do well. It definitely has the potential.",

Since then I tried many of the shops and restaurants in London and there are some decent eateries out there, but this one is my new favorite. The menu is simple with a good range of ramen plus some rather nice side dishes. We had a spicy version and a normal meat version and both very delicious. I have to say that the broth was amazing. So full of flavour with a near silky texture ... it was pure pleasure. The ingredients of the soup were also very nice, with eggs, which were still a bit gooey in the middle and meat which was very tender and nicely seasoned. I haven't eaten such nice ramen in absolutely ages. \nI will definitely go again ... and bring all my friends with me.",

Maybe this is the best ramen in London but it pales in comparison to ippudo in NYC. That said I didn't expect it to be as good as ippudo but when the soup came - my noodles came out hot, broth Luke warm and the yolk on my egg was COLD...guess that shows they pre make the egg. Normally the eggs are supposed the be deliciously warm and runny and cook in the hot broth. I hate leaving negative reviews but hopefully it helps the restaurant for the future....warm up your broth its soup for goodness sake.",

I went to Bone Daddies on a weeknight by myself, and there was still a queue, though I got a seat with a minimal wait. Being gluttonous, I got the soft shell crab starter and the kimchee ramen. The crab was fine, though I wouldn't get it again for the size and price. The ramen was quite delicious and surprisingly spicy. Maybe even a touch too spicy? I feel a little ashamed saying that. But very delicious indeed. The noodles and egg were perfect.\nThe music was a bit too loud for my preference. I would have been hard pressed to maintain a conversation with someone. In and it for the ramen, that's what I say. Correspondingly, service was fast, but 12.5% added automatically seems a bit much.",

Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit because there are a few ramen joints nearby. But this place is by far the most crowded. Holy smokes, there is a line that wraps around the block around 7 PM. Heave only knows why. Maybe I have been spoiled with ramen from Japan, maybe I have been spoiled with free ramen at the office, maybe I have been spoiled since my bf can literally eat ramen everyday, but this is just not ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu broth and it was pretty plain. Tell me how a pork boned broth that has been stewed for 16 hours can be bland? Beats me. We also ordered 2 orders of the fried soft shelled crab, popcorn chicken and chinese broccolli. Firstly, the sauces accompanied with the appetizers are all a bit weird. Perhaps because the British love mayo? Everything was mayo based..broccoli with mayo? For the love of god, wwhy?!?! Nevermind that, I also ordered corn as an addition to my ramen and it was this smoked corn. Kinda cool, but didn't vibe well with my ramen. Think of grilled smoked corn bits in your flavorless ramen. You taste burnt corn. Need I say more? Save your 15GPB.",

Guess it's a bit like SF), we came across a ramen shop and stepped in. At 5:30pm, it was already packed, which is a good sign. Hubs got the tonkotsu and I ordered the spicy miso ramen. Great broth and good noodles. Pork were ample and eggs cooked perfectly. What a great dinner! They even provide plastic bibs for you to wear...which most people did not use, but I did just because. Another surprising and amusing touch was a jar offering hair bands for the ladies with long hair -- because it's annoying to have hair falling into your face as you labor over the lovely soup and noodles! There was even a garlic crusher with garlic on the counter and a sesame grinder for additional flavor. Great place. Don't miss.",

                "description": "Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to try Bone Daddies on a chilly Tuesday night before a gig at Madame Jojo's around the corner. We arrived at 6:40pm to find the queue already out the door, but were assured that the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. Waiting in the bitter cold certainly increased our craving for a hot bowl of soup, and luckily we were seated just 10 minutes later at the bar facing the street window. \nAfter unsuccessfully trying to make ourselves comfortable on the bar stools, we ordered the following dishes:\n+Spicy Kimchi Ramen with Prawns, Mussels, Egg, and Corn in Fish Broth - Though not listed online, our amicable server assured us that this dish (his favourite) has become a permanent fixture on the menu. This aggressively spiced soup exceeded my expectations and is now one of my favourite noodle-based soups in London. The opaque red broth coated the ramen noodles in a clean fish flavour with a strong kick from the chilli. The lightly fried prawns and mussels that topped the soup were tasty, but the amount of seafood was a bit skimpy.\n+Tantanmen Ramen with Sesame, Chilli, Pork Mince, and Bok Choy in Chicken Bone Broth - This soup tasted mainly of peanut butter, which was an unpleasant surprise to my bf. Though we were warned that the dish contains peanuts (in case of an allergy), the predominant peanut flavour should be mentioned in the description.\n+Pickle Plate - A well-executed plate with a variety of pickled vegetables (cauliflower, daikon, carrots, beets), kimchi, and pickled Asian pear. A must for any lover of pickled foods.\nI also ordered a Maiken-Me cocktail (shochu, ume shu, watermelon, salt) which unfortunately tasted like the nondescript cocktails served at karaoke bars around London and cost nearly as much as a bowl of ramen. Save your money.\nI thoroughly enjoyed my seafood ramen with kimchi, but am not sure I would try any of the other broths on the menu after struggling with a few spoonfuls of my boyfriend's Tantanmen. I am not generally a fan of tonkotsu broth to begin with though, so I found the lighter flavour and consistency of the fish broth welcome. However, Bone Daddies should be more explicit about the strong peanut taste in their Tantanmen ramen. Many people (including my boyfriend, unfortunately) have a strong aversion to the taste of peanut butter, which the broth resembled after it had cooled. The Tantanmen ramen reduces my rating of Bone Daddies from four stars to three. \n(Visited November 2013)",

So take this review with a grain of salt.\nMy girlfriend and I came visiting London to try out some of the tastiest food stops we could find on Yelp and through other review sites. We are both huge ramen fanatics, so we had to give London's highest reviewed ramen shops a stop. Unfortunately we were left disappointed. \nWe ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the tantanmen ramen. The portions were decent. The price was decent for London standards as well. But the ramen....was just not ramen noodles. In fact, the ramen noodles reminded me more of pasta noodles than anything else. (Completely different type of noodles.) \nThe broth itself had a strong peanut taste to it, and didn't taste like pork broth at all. Bear in mind that authentic tonkotsu broth is supposed to be created by slow cooking the fattiest pork belly for over six hours to create rich and intense flavors.\nIf this was named something other than ramen, then I would probably say it's a decent eat. But to take the name of ramen and to create something completely different....\nWell. I definitely can't be recommending the ramen here to anyone. If you're ever in Japan, Los Angeles, or San Francisco---definitely stop by some of the highly reviewed ramen shops there so you can taste what real ramen tastes like.",

I'm surprised we were seated so quickly on a Friday night, but hey no complaints there! The service was efficient and friendly, no complaints there, and the food came out quickly.\nMy friend and I both had the tonkotsu ramen, and I ordered mine with extra egg based on Yelpers talking about it. I'm DEFINITELY glad I ordered it, because the egg was delicious. The broth was delicious and rich, so rich I couldn't finish it in the end, though my friend happily did. There's ample noodles so although the price seems a bit steep for what it looks, it is DEFINITELY filling and worth the money. The only downside I have is that the pork could have been cut into smaller pieces instead of just laid in one sheet on top of everything - made for some awkward chop stick work!\nOn the table is garlic and a garlic press, as well as little bowls of chilli paste, perfect for both of us who like our food spicy and garlicky. You eat around a table communally with others, and although it seems a little tight there's enough space for everyone to be comfortable (unlike the awkward shoulder-to-shoulder seating at Flat Iron). \nI've been dying to come here after a bunch of good reviews and I'm so glad I did!

In retrospect, I think I would have preferred one of the other choices because of my preference for thinner broth.  Despite the thick broth, the ramen was absolutely delicious.  It tasted fresh, with tons of flavor.  The only topping I added was chili oil to make it spicy.\nWe came late in the afternoon, so we had no problem with getting a seat.  I have heard it can be difficult to get a table for dinner since they're so popular.\nOne last thing I have to mention... I love that they provide plastic bibs and hair ties to insure clean eating!",

The chicken's more tender than you expect and not dry at all and you just need more of those cock scratchings (lol). \nButtttt... The best best best thing about this place is its sides. SOFT SHELL CRAB. YES. That green chili ginger sauce is SOOOOOO GOOOOOD! I like ramen and all, but this is why you come back. This and their fried chicken. Yeah, there are a bajillion chicken shops in London but this is FRIED. CHICKEN. Fried chicken that tastes so good it doesn't even have to be crispy to win you over. By the end of the meal the last one right at the bottom of the little metal bucket maybe sitting in a little condensation still makes you go yessssshhhhh.\nApparently they now make their own gin up in Cambridge which is pretty cool. Their MAIKEN-ME (watermelon shochu cocktail) was a bit too sweet for my liking and not quite watermelony enough unfortch but mad props for the g&t!",

Anyway, we got there around 6:30 on a Monday, and had to wait around 10min to get seated - so I can easily get that it can get over crowded during the weekend.\nI went for a Tonkotsu ramen - and not wanting to be crude, it was not far off a foodgasm. The egg was perfect squishy, the noodles were tasty, the broth has just the perfect seasoning. Not bland, not overpowering. Nom nom nom.\nOur night out cost us 17£ each for the ramen + extra + diet coke - which for Central London is not excessive, and in this case a very good value for what I got in my plate.\nCan I go back tomorrow? :D",

I've been told by my friend that lived in Japan for 4 years this is quite normal as in Japan you would normally just eat at the counter after a heavy night out on the drink. There comment was it was a shame that they also didn't serve gyoza to go alongside the ramen.\nWhen we arrived on a Saturday evening we didn't have to wait long for a table and while we were waiting they served us drinks from the bar.  The beer wasn't too badly priced and the ramen was around £10, which is the same at a lot of other ramen places I've been too in London.  We found out that the chef is Australian but of Japanese descent and that you can request your noodles hard or soft, which is authentic to the cuisine.\nI ordered the dipping ramen, this is a cold ramen dish perfect for a hot summers day.  The dip that it comes with is hot though.  I do like this dish but I find it a bit trickier to eat using the dipping sauce and always feel there isn't enough.  I'm sure that it's much healthy than the traditional ramen and it's still pretty tasty.",

We went for the 20-hour broth, of course.  It was insipid and bland.\nService was horrible, as well - our waiter basically ignored us for 20 mins before we could place our order, or grab our cheque.

The photos looked absolutely exquisite. \nThe scene is rock 'n roll. Hectic, loud music, hip waiters running to and fro-and packed. \nMy wife and I started with the tuna sashimi with citron dressing and fried chicken. Both, where so incredibly salty that they were barely edible.\nFor Ramen, my wife ordered soy sauce and I the tonkotsu. For sure when they arrived, they were the most beautiful bowls of ramen that I had ever seen. Unfortunately the flavor didn't match the esthetic. While they were very good they would certainly not the best Ramen. They both lacked something. The flavors were off.\nThe ramen definitely not bad at at. It's just that the whole scene is style over content.\nThe one thing that we both thought was fantastic was the soft serve black sesame ice cream. \n______",

Of course, noodles are my favourite part, so I think they could be a bit more generous with the noodles. \no Broth - Best part! The spicy miso really takes the ramen broth over the top. \no Pork - Not much to note here, mostly because the meat portion was a bit skimpy. What was given was delicious.   \no The egg -  Finally, a place that acknowledges the importance of the egg and keeps  it as a standard component in the ramen. Well done! I forgive you for the light meat portions. \no Overall - Super delicious.  \nThe menu had a wide selection ramen flavours and sashimi as well.

We ordered the fried chicken and the chashu pork croquettes as starters, but the fried chicken didn't come until later and was served with our ramen orders, which was a little too bad. Both were very good though! They have a few ramen specials on the board, but I went with the classic Tonkotsu Ramen, which did not disappoint. I also love how the restaurant has garlic crushers on the table, because I definitely think adding one into the soup made a world of a difference. My friends ordered the T22 and they really enjoyed it too. And I don't know what they do to the eggs, but the yolks are bright orange and they sure look unique!",

The place was packed with Asian clients, so it looked promising, but I guess none of them were Japanese, because this was not a RAMEN experience, it was entirely something else.  The ingredients on top were cold, as Eve mentions (pity I didn't read her review before going) and the broth was warm at best.  Although my Tantanmen 2 dish promised sesame, chile, chicken mince and bok choy in a chicken bone broth, what it had was massive amounts of PEANUTS!  It was so rich it tasted like peanut butter.  Since when has ramen tasted like that?  Perhaps I ordered poorly, but my wife also agreed.  Our children had the Soy Ramen and that broth tasted as though they'd simply throne in a few Knorr chicken stock cubes and some soy sauce.\nSorry, but this isn't a Japanese restaurant, IMHO.\nOh, I almost forgot to mention the highlights...the Clarence Court egg was impressive (and delicious), as others have mentioned, and the beer was VERY cold!",

It was not all plain sailing as I had to work past a pretty significant queue to get into the restaurant itself.  However, once inside, everything was spot on.  The decor was funky with stools jammed into every conceivably place which made for a cosy atmosphere.  This said, without cramming in all this seating, I dread to think what the queue was like.\nThe ramen itself was the real deal.  I opted for a special, the Sour Pepper Ramen, with roast chashu, karaage salmon, grilled spring onion and an egg.  The broth was perfectly judged with its deep spicy flavour providing a solid base for its accompaniments.  Indeed, the broth was so lovely, I would probably have been satisfied with this alone.  Of the accompaniments, I loved each delicate flake of the salmon and the perfect texture of the egg.  However, the best aspect of the dish was its variety.  Every bite brought another delightful taste senstation.\nOn the side, I ordered some edamame beans.  Served warm with a good slug of salt, these were lovely, if not the most original choice.  Looking at the other reviews now, I suspect that the soft shell crab might have been a better option.  I look forward to doing just that on my next visit.",

                "description": "So the trouble with Ramen in London is that most of the ramen places are still predominantly offering Tonkotsu based ramen with pretty thin noodles. I think the reason why they do this is due to the local palate and familiarity with this type of ramen.\nHowever, I'm afraid my favourite ramen is made with a miso/chicken based soup with a much thicker noodle with lots of fresh bean sprouts, spring onions, bamboo and sweetcore. Ideally served with a nice strip (not a slice) of fatty oily cha shu pork on the side.\nIt's a good place to visit and the atmosphere is pretty vibrant (it's in Soho!). I guess the owners haven't dared to venture too far beyond what the local customers are familiar with. One further example of this is that a popular Japanese drink, calpis is not on the menu but can be ordered as a cocktail?!\nOkay, if you ask them very nicely they will serve this for you but I guess it's just too foreign for them to want to list it on the menu. Overall, the place is not bad for a bowl of ramen if you're desperate but I honestly have had much better (and cheaper!) in other countries.\nSadly this is a common trend in London where foreign palates needs to be adapted to the local established expectations. It's more a comment on the lack of adventure and acceptance of exotic flavours of Londoners.\nMaybe I need to reset my own expectations in order to really enjoy what this place is all about.",

I got the 22 hour pork one and the broth was so thick it was almost like pasta with lots of sauce. But I went back the next week and had a miso ramen with extra hard boiled egg. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It was delicious. The cocktails, I've tried mostly sake ones, are delectable. Definitely go, but talk to your waiter about what kind of ramen would be best for you. \nFast and good service too.",

My favorite ramen in the whole world is Ippudo NYC and in my experience nothing has even come close to being on that level. However, Bone Daddies changed everything. First I started off with the sweet and spicy pork bones which was an amazing appetizer. They were ribs with quite a bit of meat on them with a very spicy peppery sticky sweet sauce. I couldn't stop licking my fingers. I also tried the hamachi sashimi appetizer which was wonderfully fresh with a hint of ponzu.\nFor my ramen, I chose the tonkatsu ramen because of the 20 hour pork broth. The broth was rich in flavor, the pork was tender and juicy and I ordered an extra egg because I love the way they're cooked with a custard like yolk. Next time I'll be order the tantanmen to get a little more spice!\nYou might have to queue for a bit but I didn't mind. The waitstaff were super nice which is not always the easiest thing to find in London and they made the queue outside bearable with a shot of sake!",

It certainly did nothing to convert me to the ramen cause. I spent £23 here and left hungry. I could have spent that on a decent roast and left groaning. \nThey charged 3 quid for a tiny cup of tea, I had two. That's £6 for about a half pint of oolong tea. \nI wasn't a fan of the tonkotsu ramen itself, it seemed pretty average and I didn't like the meat. I've had better ramen at beatnik Vancouver dives for about $5. \nHowever, the fried chicken was the best I'd ever had. My advice: do not share a portion, get your own. And the soft shell crab was divine. Get your own. \nI thought the service was friendly and quite good, we stayed for an hour and they never rushed us once, despite the queue of people waiting. \ni must be in the minority of not thinking this place was great, because I showed up at 11.45 and by 12pm, there was a queue of Asian families behind me. So, I guess you had better go and make up your own mind about the place. I probably won't be back.",

Such eerie, cloudy and unbelievably unhealthy broth yet oh so nourishing - and that's the charm of it. Pretty standard toppings, nicely made egg, and yes, as much garlic and chili as you would dare to add. \nThe big thing going for Bone Daddies is the tonkotsu broth. The noodles aren't exceptional, nor are the sides, or probably even many of the other dishes, but that's fine. The tonkotsu broth makes up for it, in droves. \nIt's got a wonderful little atmosphere, it's obviously in a great part of town, and if you head there at the right time there will be a queue - that's the sign of a good ramen joint in my books. \nGet the tonkotsu, that's the signature dish. I would be happy if they stopped making the other types of ramen, and just focussed on perfecting it, but since when have you seen a restaurant in the UK focus on one thing only? \nAnd finally, only 4 stars because the other broths really aren't worth writing home about, the chāshū is cut way too thin, and the noodles are a bit meh... But really these are minor gripes, so go forth and set yourself a new ramen baseline.",

                "description": "The latest in our Ramen Club outing was to Bone Daddies, the hip new noodle joint in Soho that's staying true to Japanese way of life. It's the latest in the trend so the core challenge is to differentiate itself. Now we (mostly me, but this is based on discussions with said Ramen Club too) judge ramen on a number of categories: Noodles, veggies and associated toppings, meat, egg, and of course the all important broth!.\nNoodles - Cooked perfectly with just a hint of resistance in each bite. I find that too often the noodles are cold (not enough time out of the fridge before the broth is poured in) or mushy (cooked and then broth is added). So this was a noodle win topped only by Tonkotsu's offering.\nVeggies & toppings - The veggies in my bowl were crunchy and flavourful so my one gripe would be that there weren't enough of them. The toppings were sparse in the bowl but I appreciate that you can add from a variety of items on the table. There is a sesame seed grinder (I've never ground sesame into anytime but it helped bulk out the broth) and a garlic press with fresh garlic cloves (brilliant idea!). The one thing lacking was extra fresh chilli although to be fair there was some chilli oil (just not my thing).\nMeat - This was the disappointment in the dish. I found the meat to be lacking in substance in both form and flavour. Cocoro still wins in my book for best meat although Ittenbari would be a close second.\nEgg - Let me qualify this by saying I don't like egg. I have it scrambled and occasionally poached with salmon but it really isn't my thing. I haven't enjoyed it at any other Ramen place but at Bone Daddies it was incredible and I wanted another one. Yes, it's that good.\nBroth - I opted for the 20 hour Tonkotsu broth. It's thick and rich and full of meaty (and fatty!) goodness. If there isn't enough fat for you, you can opt for an extra pipette of fat for 50p. One of the better broths in London and perfect for a cold wintry day (like today) and only beat by the spicy Tonkotsu from Cocoro. Man, I wish I could have a bowl of it now!\nOverall, it was one of the best bowls of Ramen I've had in London. Individually, I don't think most of the components were worthy of the top spot but put together it's incredible. Also special note to the manager for his impeccable customer service in dealing with our large group (and remembering YGO who came a few days earlier), the bartender for taking the time to talk about Japanese whiskey with me (and gave me a free taster), and our sassy waitress for impeccable banter.",

Rock-n-roll Asian paraphernalia is plastered all over the walls as the most awesome music sets you in the mood to devour a huge bowl of ramen. I've been here at least 4 times, with varying sizes of groups, and every time we've been accommodated in the nicest of ways. There are more than a few delicious choices to make. If you're having trouble deciding, the staff know the menu backwards and forwards. They'll help you out.\nMy usual here is the Tamtamen 2. Nutty broth, cashews, chicken, veggies, GET IN MY BELLY. While it's on the spicier side, it's not too bad. Just the right amount of punch. I can never finish a whole bowl there's so much to eat! I stuff myself until I can't anymore and then mourn over the loss of uneaten ramen. I wish they had places like this in the States because it's just fantastic! It does tend to get a bit crowded during the lunch and dinner rush, but turnover is quick. Also keep in mind that they close in between lunch and dinner!\nThis is a must-eat if you're in the Soho area!",

Besides, all you really need to know is that Bone Daddies belongs right in Soho, with its trendy wall decor, trendy menu on a clipboard, trendy good looking people (hello good looking people).\nI walked here on 9 pm Tuesday, and was surprised how busy it still was even an hour before closing, but was relieved to be seated promptly at a communal table.  I have no shame eating alone when it comes to the ramen call of duty.\nOrdered the £8.8 Unnamed cocktail (Nikka All Malt, Pink Peppercorn Vanilla, Ume Shu) which was served quite bitter in a martini glass and very strong, but I'm all for pre appetizer inebriation.\nAlso ordered the £5 fried chicken, a little bucket containing 8 morsels of Asian style fried chicken with a slice of lemon, and finished it all myself... to the obvious amazement by my wide-eyed waiter. It was a bit salty and lacked seasoning but the lemon helped dispense some flavor.\n20 minutes post chicken inhalation, my £11 Tonkotsu ramen finally came.  It was decent, with two soft boiled egg yolks shining like a beacon amidst waves of noodle and a sea of creamy broth.  I compare all ramen places to Ippudo in NYC, and I'm sure my standards will reset yet again when I go to Japan.  I liked the place, but wasn't slurping out of my bowl like a human vacuum the way I do when I'm at Ippudo.   Something was missing- maybe it was that the broth wasn't as flavorful (although putting in the chilli oil did wonders) and maybe the noodles weren't as starchy.\nIn any case, I liked Bone Daddies and would come back to try the other ramen offerings.",

I was blown away by the flavours of my chicken-based T22 soup with added corn, which unexpectedly pipped my wife's Tonkotsu for taste and appearance.  We also enjoyed the beautiful pickled fruit and vegetables, salty fried chicken and far too many of the garlic cloves that are at your disposal.\nAnd of course, as a molecular biologist I also had to order the pipette. A dollop of extra fat (presumably duck) didn't actually do much for the already-fatty T22. Perhaps it's more needed for some of the other soups which we'd love to come back and try - especially the Chinese-inspired Tantamen.\nThe only negatives were that the big bowls only come half-full and could easily fit in a little more broth, and that the over-chatty staff coming and asking you how you're doing every five minutes takes away from the Ramen experience, especially when not one of them is Japanese.",

Walking inside, the music was loud, we could barely hear each other but we all know that's the trick in this kind of places.\nSo queuing, ok past that. We're off to decide on food. Simple menu, few dishes, mix and match. Got the Tantamen and the Soft shell crab, as so many people do in such places.\nI thought the soft shell crab in nearby Shoryu ramen was OKish, well I take it all back, that was awesome compared to what I tasted at Bone Daddies. Most flavourless, oily and soggy piece of crab I'd ever had in my life. Such a disappointment and practically too expensive for £8.50.\nPast that, off to the noodles. The noodles were nice. The flavours were bold, too bold for my liking. I think the adaptation of rock-n-roll-esque decor, they tingled with the taste to be liked by the UK audience. Nothing wrong with that but my bowl tasted like a race of bold flavours. There was a lot of oil in my sauce (that only made them taste more delicious) but the profile was completely different to what I've had before. It wasn't bad - it was actually pretty nice but strong! I find it hard to say that I didn't enjoy it, but at the same time I wasn't head over heels.\nThat's why the three starts. Its a pleasant experience.

More noodle soup places need to do this\n* The fried chicken is awesome\n*  The Asahi smooth head is really great (never seen it in the UK before)\n*  The food really is so, so good\nBut it just misses 5 stars because:\n* I don't like the atmosphere, it's too loud, crowded and I'm pretty short (5'4) which means I am so far from the ground on the stools it's slightly concerning\n* There's nowhere to put your bag or coat if you're on the side of the table nearest the door\n* The service is erratic. Doesn't bother me so much but our fried chicken we ordered came half an hour after our ramens, even though we asked after it twice, which was slightly annoying as it would have been delicious before, but after we were all a bit greased out\n* Please, please give your noodles a little more spring and bounce! For me that would crown this the perfect ramen!\n* My bowl was slightly lacking in stock, there wasn't enough to slurp with each spoonful of noodles and I felt I was running out\nNext time I would come at an unusual time so it wasn't SO packed (although the food was so good I'm perfectly happy to queue for 20 minutes again.

And it was glorious.\nAlong with several of the others, I ventured for the tonkotsu ramen and there isn't anything more I can say than what the others have already said, but I'll go ahead and repeat!  Oh, that broth.  That broth was so tasty.  And Yee Gan graciously shared his pipette of fat with me, which made the broth even tastier!  How often do you get to share a pipette of fat with someone?  Not often.  It cracks me up just typing it out.  There were some sprouts, but nothing overpowering, and they softened up nicely in the bowl.  I think it may have been marginally better if the noodles had been slightly harder in the beginning as they were quite soft by the end.  I couldn't finish my bowl due to the almost overly generous portion of noodles.  But they were very, very tasty!\nThat egg is the stuff of my dreams.  I was looking over at Katie and Rob's bowls with a bit of jealousy as they had the foresight to order a spare egg.  The yolk is so buttery!  Om nom nom.  All the extras on the table really added to the dish.  I know I probably should have tried my first ramen without any additives, but when you're given a garlic press to play with, how can one resist?!  The pork slices in the ramen were so tender and were falling apart upon contact.  And with just a bit of fattiness, they added to the rich broth and my half-fat pipette delightfully.\nI ordered the yellowtail starter which was really nice, but nothing outstanding.  Just good, fresh sashimi with a bit of chili, cilantro (because I'm a Texan and can't get behind \"coriander\") and some soy.  I tried a bit of Rob's fried chicken and agree that it just wasn't quite crispy enough.  Think chick-fil-a nuggets without the pickle juice marinade, if you've ever had them.  Also had a bit of Yee Gan's soft shell crab, which was tasty and came with a lovely, spicy sauce, but also could have used a bit more crunch.\nMy first Bone Daddies ramen will most certainly not be my last!",

                "description": "You always know it is a good restaurant when you see a long line of people waiting outside, even when it is cold. Bone Daddies is such a place. I passed by it several times without knowing its name, but only identified it as the busy Japanese place in Soho. \nA few days ago, I took advantage of dining out on my own and presented myself to the host as a lone diner and got seated immediately. As I was rushing to something else, so I just ordered Tonkotsu (Pork) Ramen, which seemed to be the only option in my opinion, because all other ramen comes with chicken broth. I am no expert in ramen, but I have eaten enough of it to develop a taste for thick and creamy broth that only seems to come with pork bone broth. I was not disappointed, as a matter of fact, I think it is the best ramen I tried in London! The broth was thick and creamy, the noodle was al dente and the eggs had semi-runny yolk. It was perfect. If I had to complain about one thing, I wish I had a bit more broth! Oh, yes, don't forget to help yourself and add some extra fixings to you bowl: you can grind your own sesame (please do, it adds so much taste to your noodle), mesh you own garlic (only for the brave and no meeting other people afterwards eaters), and chili oil. All I can say is Yummy! I can't wait to come back and give the chicken bone broth a go and also try out some appetizers everybody raves about.",

                "description": "Believe the hype. In fact, take the hype, tag on a little extra and then believe it. You won't be disappointed.\nAnd there is hype around this place. The queue for a table was 45 minutes' worth when we showed up, longer for those in parties of more than two people. Long wait times seem to be the way of the world at the moment for the hotly-tipped eateries of the moment (e,.g. Meat Mission, Honest Burgers, Burger and Lobster etc). Ordinarily I'm a huge and vocal sceptic as to whether food can be worth waiting that kind of time for. Surely it can't be THAT much better than rival, less heralded places?\nBut Bone Daddies proved it most certainly can be. The Tonkotsu Ramen I went for, with extra egg was the best ramen I've had and a well thought out dish comprised of pork, veg, ramen noodles and a mild but well-balanced and welcome seasoning. My dining companion's Tantamen was spicier but similarly well-received. Furthermore, it was filling. My appetite's increased recently due to my stepping up of various sports but I was not disappointed with the portion size. Yum!\nThe service was incredible too. Friendly, and willing to engage in banter about possible connections between Bone Daddies' menu and the movie Donnie Darko (yes!). Accurate as to how much longer we'd have to wait for and then helpful in steering us relative ramen newbies to recommended dishes. And complete with an unexpected surprise too: after we sang their praises and said that we'd like to help them in return by giving back their table (we had a movie to run for), the waiter arrived with the bill, declaring that as we'd been such nice customers he'd taken 10% off!! What the....? Before this happened this place was lighting up those five stars - now it was making the case for a bonus sixth.\nThrow in the rockin' music (think 70s rock) faintly reminiscent of Meat Mission but not turned up to 11 and I had a great time here. Bone Daddies, I salute you.",

                "description": "**SPOILER ALERT** I'm going to rain on this parade.\nI spent a miserably cold and wet Saturday in a 9-5 exam class in the City.  To lift the spirits, I dragged my boyfriend to Bone Daddies for an early supper on the way home.  I suspect I was in the queue mentioned by the first reviewer (I overheard him talking about Cocoro!)\nWe ordered chicken karaage, yellowtail sashimi and edamame to start.  As mentioned in a previous review, the karaage was not crispy and I, too, believe that it may have been preperared and reheated.  The flavour was correct but overall it was disappointing -- afterall, what is fried chicken without its crispy shell?  The yellowtail sashimi was also nothing special: fish slices drenched in a non-descript soy-based dressing and sprinkled with coriander leaves.\nOne portion of tonkotsu ramen, one portion of chicken tantanmen ramen.  Both came out barely warm which makes clear how these dishes are prepared.  \nMethod: \n1. Put stone-cold ramen noodles into bowl\n2. Ladle broth over noodles\n3. Top with more stone-cold (pre-prepared) ingredients: split soft-boiled soy-braised egg, meat (char siu slices in case of tonkotsu, minced chicken in case of tantanmen), soy-braised bamboo shoots, beansprouts and wakame\n4. Serve\nBone Daddies, this doesn't work.  Basic formula: cold ingredients + soup that is not hot enough = lukewarm noodle soup dish.  Any Asian will tell you that prior to constructing any noodle soup dish the noodles must be dunked into a vat of boiling stock or water.  This heats up the noodles which then ensures that the noodle dish is hot.  Or, failing that, just ensure that your broth is nuclear hot.\nThis all detracted from what could've been two very flavourful broths.  Unfortunately, we couldn't tell (although I think the tonkotsu had potential): heat brings out flavour, remember.\nI had high hopes for this place but, like in any good ol' black and white love story, slipped out of the joint into the damp night with a heavy heart.",

Job well done.  The bowl of tonkotsu I received last night was basically Gojira in ramen form.  Not only does it look fantastic, but the taste doesn't let it down - the slabs of pork are delicious and falling apart, veg in the soup add just the right amount of crunch, and the fried garlic topping is a great little bonus.  The real star of the show, however, is the egg.  Not only do you get a whole egg (not everywhere can say that), but they are perfectly soft and totally delicious - however they do them, they are amazing.  Job well done.  \nOn top of that, there is a plethora of condiments to choose from - on the table is a sesame grinder, soy sauce, pot of chilli oil (the kind with chilli flakes in it), and the pot of pickled garlic and a garlic crusher.  Awesome.  Oh, and you can also get additional toppings too for a couple of extra pence here and there: nori, pulled chicken, pork mince, extra egg, and - the big one - a pipette of fat.  Hey, as much as I love my arteries, I think I love pork fat a little bit more.\nThe side dishes on offer include softshell crab, yellowfin sashimi, and fried chicken (obviously in a bucket).  The fried chicken was tasty, although is wasn't particularly crispy which was a let down.  Still, you get a decent quantity for your £5.  The other sides were good, although I wasn't blown away.\nOn Josy's recommendation, I went for the hot Junmai sake which was nice and very clean tasting, although I cannot profess to be an expert in such matters.  The drinks menu is pretty comprehensive generally, containing a range of cocktails, a large selection of Japanese whisky, and a few sake options.\nOverall, I had a great experience with the Yelp crew and the staff were ever helpful (even if we did have a ridiculous number of people and kept sending them to get water).  The decor is cool too with a mixture of retro and vintage Japanese photos and Asahi adverts...however, the jars on the shelf on the back wall look like they contain Alien foetuses, and there are no Lucky Cats anywhere to be seen.  What's that all about?!\nBone Daddies is very very good, and I'm looking forward to returning soon.  It's a bit annoying that ramen in this country isn't really a cheap-and-good-thing like it is in, say, the States, and ultimately £11 for a good tonkotsu is great considering that Wagamama's ramen is hitting double-digits these days.  However, I will take solace in the fact that Bone Daddies will always be able to provide me with a noodle soup to keep hunger locked up until, well, whenever the pork fat un-congeals from my stomach.",

Second and third time because I kept reading reviews about how good it is, so I figured maybe I ordered the wrong thing?\nI still remain disappointed. To me the broth tastes very one dimensional- donkotsu was super greasy and creamy (like cream of mushroom consistency, or for Americans, thanksgiving gravy consistency!!) but did not have multiple layers of tastes (the way the broth does at Ippudo New York for example, or the many ramen places in Tokyo.) same for miso and shoyu ramens. They make such a big deal of the fact that they \"stew the donkotsu for 20 hours\" but what's the point if all you can taste is pork fat?! I had to sprinkle 4-5 teaspoons of hot chili oil to make it more palatable (and I don't normally like spicy food) but even the red chili oil/sauce had no kick at all. (I am now thinking that maybe I should have ordered the spicy miso...) \nThey are also super stingy with the toppings and the amount of noodles. I ordered some additional nori and they gave me 2 small sheets the size of half of my palm! (And turns out the the original doesn't even come with nori to begin with...) the amount of noodles was so small, I couldn't help but wonder how guys bigger than me could possibly be satisfied with just one bowl of ramen? The noodles do not have a good texture. They are almost somen-like. And I still ended up paying 12.60 pounds for it..which I guess is a good deal for a sit-down meal in central London.. But still. (And as a side note, what's with this custom of automatically including service charge on the listed price?  It's not a huge difference, but I find this slightly annoying since it feels like some sort of gimmick to charge you more without making you realize it.\nBack to the ramen: I have come across ramen places of this style in Tokyo too (super greasy but one dimensional broth) and I didn't like it there either, so maybe it's a matter of taste. But a part of me is thinking that if I am the only asian-looking person there all three times I went, it's not particularly a good sign... I don't think I will come back; I much prefer shoryu and I am still having a hard time understanding what all the hype is about this place.",

                "description": "Has anyone watched that Five Guys YouTube video where the guy takes a bite of his burger and says \"Dayum..Dayum..DAYUM\" - that was my reaction when I took a bite of the Bone Daddies Ramen soft boiled egg. Mine was perfectly cooked in my Tonkotsu Ramen with the yolk a perfect golden syrup but not too runny that it melted into my broth. It tasted divine with my noodles and I thought it could have been a dish of its own but actually, since they marinate the eggs first (kudos as not all ramen restaurants do) it might be too salty to eat on its own. And surprisingly everyone's dish around me also had a perfect looking egg. Not easy to clone perfection! Okay, enough about eggs.\nUnfortunately, you won't get your choice of staggering ramen permutations here, i.e. there is no option for soft or hard noodles and I'm not sure if they will give the option upon request. Try next time and tell me if it works! The noodles I had were thin springy goodness and not too soft, but not al dente either. Eat quickly before they get soggy. Noodles don't taste homemade but I can't have it all! You're probably not likely to ask for lighter broth either; it comes very rich and creamy already but if you want even more thickness, you can add extra fat!! Oh, and the bowl is super big but the broth and toppings only fill half the bowl. The bowl was begging for me to fill it with more noodles or broth so I will make a note to order extra next time. Overall, for 11 pounds, I'd say the meal was pretty worth it. \nI also had a Mr. Sparkle which was a virgin drink with orange juice..grapefruit juice..and oolong tea...there might be something else but that was basically what it tasted like. Contrary to its name, there is no sparkle - as in, it is not bubbly. It didn't particularly stand out as you can tell I have a hard time describing it ..unlike my rambling soliloquy about eggs. However, if you're looking for a clean and light grapefruity drink to try, then order this. Otherwise, go bold with the sakes :) \nAmbience-wise, the restaurant was really quite loud. The place was popping on a Tuesday night. I went during dinner and needed to shout to communicate and had a hard time hearing others. But most of the time is spent stuffing your mouth with food anyways, so it's not too unfortunate.",

                "description": "The egg! Oh... the egg.\nPerfectly marinated, soft, gooey centre... Glad I ordered an extra one.\nI had the corn butter miso ramen-- SUPER rich, velvety and quite buttery soup. The thing that makes this ramen great is the attention to detail- the corn is clearly fresh, not frozen and charred before being tossed into the bowl. They give a fresh crunch to the dish. Perfectly cooked noodles with good bite/chew, lots of goodies in the bowl (sprouts, bamboo shoots, shredded chicken, wakame, etc.) with a variety of textures (though I wish the fried garlic that came on the tonkotsu ramen was available as an extra for the other dishes-- I had fried garlic envy!). Plus, I love condiments, and the pickled garlic, chilli oil, sesame seed grinder, and soya pot were fun to play with and allowed me to customize my bowl. Since the broth was so rich with butter, I didn't feel like it needed the extra pipette of fat that others agreed enhanced the tonkotsu broth. \nAs others have said, the Karaage chicken (fried chicken as they call it) had the right flavour, but wasn't crispy enough. That said, in spite of that, I REALLY liked it and would order it again. Perhaps it is the container that they use? Though attractive, perhaps too close of quarters with the steam?\nOnly two gripes: There were some cartilagey-bits with my chicken (like, crunch-ow kinds), but to be expected, I think, in a chicken broth (though I would have preferred to not have those). And, as another reviewer has said, my broth wasn't nearly hot enough. Now, I've heard that some ramen places don't serve their broth piping hot on purpose, as a warmer broth is the more optimum temperature for appreciating the depth of the broth. If this is what they are going for, they should outright say it. Otherwise, I think they need to watch this-- I was surprised how luke-warm it was. \nService was good, friendly, and accommodating (though I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group in the future since they don't take reservations). \nI'll be back, and soon.

I don't care for the furnishings and the complete lack of sound-absorbing materials means that the place is an acoustic fustercluck, but the food and the service is good.\nThankfully offering more than three viable choices (I'm looking at you, Tonkutsu and Ittenbari) the menu is semi-traditional. Thank gods they didn't try to over-fusion anything.\nA pattern I've noticed with fairly good r^2 is that food quality is inversely proportional to pages of menu used to describe the ingredients, process, ritual sacrifices and ablutions involved in making the noodles. Bonedaddies' food menu fits on one page (on a clipboard, neat-o!).\nI had a T22 which I chose a) because I was ramening with someone who keeps Kosher and b) because I couldn't resist COCK SCRATCHINGS (think chicken pork scratchings), which were more than just a novelty ingredient.\nToppings are varied and interesting, ranging from just meat, nori, eggs and the raved-about pipette-o-fat to the Xzibit-pleasing £2 extra portion of noodles (Yo Dawg, I herd u liek ramen so we put some ramen in ur ramen...)\nDrinks are good but not cheaper than any restaurant, sochu is decent, Japanese whiskey range is luckily wider than Suntory.\nService is chirpy and is adorably cool-because-I-joke-around-with-customers rather than cool-because-I-look-down-on-people-buying-my-food-and-paying-my-wages.\nAll in all, a pretty decent joint for 10-quid noodles (actually 12-quid for brosized noodles).\nProtip: get the traditional pickles to share if you're having a bony stock; acidity offsets the heavy creaminess delightfully. Also, this sucker is open pretty late on a weekday.",

I've gone several times to confirm and I have - the ramen is just not that tasty. It's OK.

The waiters were friendly and understood we wanted a quick meal before our movie. 2 steaming bowels of noodles arrived in about 10mins. My Tantanmen arrived with its inviting reddish chilly oil floating on the surface. The menu does say bok choi, but ONE leaf??? The one slice of charshu pork was deli-ham-thin like everyone has mentioned. Broken cashews gave a nice crunch to the chilli pork mince that packed a nice punch of heat. The broth was tasty but don't let it get cold as you'll soon feel the pork fat start to coat your mouth.\nMy wife had the Tonkotsu Ramen which is her benchmark test of all ramen bars. The 20hr pork broth was seriously rich. Too heavy for my liking, but you can always order something else.\nI think I'm missing something here. This IS a noodle bar. And this is where it failed miserably. Hidden underneath all the nicely decorated and flavoured ingredients lay the pitiful existence of a small portion of ramen noodles. They had a strange floury taste, like eating a raw pancake. I don't think they were undercooked either since they were close to turning into a very post-al dente gloopy mess. £11 will get you quality ingredients, but not a great serving of noodles.\nIts all most likely paying for a fancy burger but the only think to compliment is the lettuce and ketchup!",

We ordered the fried chicken along with two bowls of ramen (T22 and miso). When I get a bowl of ramen I expect the soup to be steaming hot. Unfortunately, the soup was just warm so marks off for that. The miso one had way too much miso which overpowered the chicken bone soup and made it too salty. \nLast but not least, we found the fried chicken was served raw and this was after we ate most of it.  After inspecting, manager was very apologetic and tried to blame it on the fact that they use corn-fed chicken which didn't make sense to me. However, the meal was on the house which was a nice gesture. Anything less and I would have given a one star review. We were very worried after the meal but thankfully didn't get food poisoning!

No. Because I'm an elite yelper, and that's what we do in this town. We give our two pennies (cents if you're Ameri-porean) worth even if it doesn't mean a darn.\nSo. Since I'm spectacularly late, I'm going to make up for it. \nGET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS ON EVERYTHING!! \nYou'll thank me later.\nIf you've been following the tales of my exploits for noodles and swimming, you'll know that my professor friend and I go swimming once a week and we end up somewhere in Soho for noodles after. This time around, it was Bone Daddies turn. Besides knowing there was an elite event here, and having walked past and had one of the sexy waiters try to seductively lure me in (with good tasting noodles - and it certainly helped that the waiter was hotter than the broth they served here), I had to try the newest installment of gourmet ramen in my neighborhood.\nFor starters, try the BD Fruity or the Carrot and Ginger juice. Both excellent drinks on the menu. \nBoth professor and I were torn at what to choose on the menu. The good thing I guess is that they have all kinds of sides. So, if you want nori on the chicken ramen, or an extra egg in that soy ramen, you can add them in at a bit extra £1 for an egg, £0.20 for the nori. \nWe decided to go for the Ramen Salad (a ramen dish tossed in sesame sauce) and the Soy Ramen. Intrigued by cock-scratchings, we asked the friendly Aussie waitress about what they were. Apparently it's chicken skin/fat that's been fried to a crisp and sprinked on top of the noodles.\nNow, here's the tip... Cock-scratchings are not on the list of extras, but as mentioned above and I'll mention it again, GET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS SIDE ON EVERYTHING. It's like the fat pipette. Indulgent, but you won't regret it. \nEverything was impeccable, and the sesame seed grinder was doubly a treat. 5*s would have been given if the broth was steamier. Was too cold by the time it reached the table. I will definitely be back. :-)",

We got there and waited in a line for around 40 minutes, but it didn't feel too bad because we had expected this.  While we were part of the \"inside\" section of the line, we could order a couple of drinks which was great.  I was already a third of the way through my pint of Asahi by the time we sat down.  Having a drink also makes the waiting period pass more quickly.\nThe signature dish is the tonkatsu ramen (£11), so we ordered one each.  It really is excellent: the creamy broth is packed with flavour and I liked the noodles and the eggs.  The pork was tender too, but I only got one piece in mine.  We also ordered sides of fried chicken (£5) and softshell crab (£8).  Both of these were nice, but the chicken was a bit dry.  The service was friendly and personable.\nI was happy with the experience, but it was on the expensive side.  This place won't suffer for that, given the high popularity it has at the moment.  I am pleased to have been here once to try the excellent ramen, but I would be leaning towards visiting one of the other good ramen restaurants where there is not such a long queue.  Then again, it could be worth a trip during the quiet time of the week (whenever that is).",

                "description": "Jumped in last night for a bite before heading home. While it's not completely authentic, it is an excellent Western take on Japanese/Chinese noodles. The hubs got his normal tonkatsu ramen. The broth was steaming hot and unctuous, but the pork a little chewy. Still, for someone as picky about his Japanese carbs, he deemed it a success. He was thrilled by the fact that they serve a bowl with two eggs, instead of just one (it's the little things, really). \nI tried the tantanmen ramen--a take on Sichuan dan dan noodles (often on the top of my cravings list). It was spectacular. The broth was a beautiful combination of spice and umami. Let's just say, I could eat that bowl of noodles every day. The burn builds substantially with each bite, and by the end my nose was a bit runny (a sign of an excellently hot dish in my book). We also tried the karaage (fried chicken), which was well fried, but the breading lacked a bit in flavour.\nTopped off with some ice cold Asahi, we were both impressed with this new spot in Soho. And while they say they're open late, I've yet to come across a noodle place open past Midnight. My little American gripe--Midnight is not late. I've barely just finished dinner by that point. Other than that, the space is large and open playing some of the best American rock from the 70s to the 90s. We sat at the counter facing the hipster cycle shop across the street, which (of course) meant brilliant people watching. \nAll in all, a new staple to our Asian restaurant repertoire.",

Yes, the dishes are not exactly how a traditional ramen bar in Osaka would prepare them (but maybe a hip place in Tokyo's Daikanyama district would) but nonetheless they are very tasty and I find that it gives the place part of its personality.\nI had to queue outside 2 out of 3 times, but the waiting was ok and you could already order beers while standing up in line (when you were inside the bar). Plus, in most good ramen places in Japan I had always had to wait in line for a bit.\nThe people are also an interesting mix: several Japanese were eating there, and this is always a good sign. You could see locals (albeit towards the posh side of the spectrum) and tourists alike plus your occasional hollywood star and successful musician (I'm referring to you Gwyneth P. & Chris M. ;-) but nobody seemed to care (which is nice).",

Price wise I would say the ramen was the same (the 20hr pork ramen costing £11). We arrived early, at 12pm to ensure we wouldn't have to queue for a table and good thing we did. \nThe place isn't huge and we were seated at the bar type of seating, not really wanting to share with another party. For two of us we ordered the fried chicken starter and the salmon sashimi. Originally we had wanted the soft shell crab but due to their soft opening the night before they had sold out! The fried chicken was perfect, not overly oily and with a squeeze of lemon gave the perfect sharpness to accompany it. The salmon sashimi was fresh and came with a lovely light sauce on top with little crunchy balls on top (no idea what they were, but they were good).\nOf course we both had to order the 20hr pork ramen which came with bamboo shoots, an amazing egg which looks smoked and was just perfectly cooking with a runny yolk. The broth and noodles were both tasty and the egg was my favourite accompaniment. To drink I ordered the fresh carrot and ginger juice which was fine, nothing special but I expected what it said on the tin. \nWhen we got our bill we had been given a goodwill discount and only ended up paying £26 for two of us for allll that food/drink. I assume this is because it was still during their soft opening period. Without the £20 off it would have been rather pricey for a bowl of ramen.\nUpon leaving space was quite tight and we have to squeeze to get out of the place, but all in all a great place, albeit a little pricey.",

I appreciated that the serving was so big but I thought the ramen noodle itself was too thin, and the soup was a bit too thick, but it did taste good especially with the egg. Each table has a container of garlic, a garlic crusher, and a sesame vial, which all I definitely took advantage of. \nOverall I really enjoyed Bone Daddies: good setting, good food and good service!",

If you told me that my favorite lunch place in London would be a ramen shop, I could've (rightfully so) called you a maniac. This place pleasantly surprised me though. Whenever I went I always got Tonkotsu Ramen, since who needs anything else? One time my coworkers got some appetizers which were pretty good too but let's face it: you're here for the ramen. Having been to Japan and living in the bay area, I feel lucky to have tried so many good ramen places and Bone Daddies is up there--maybe even better than most in SF. The broth is excellent, the meat was cooked just right and the portion size is perfect for a quick but filling meal. The price for a bowl is a little expensive, but hey, it's London and luckily for me, I was reimbursed me for my meals.\nIf I'm ever back in town you know where I'll be for lunch.",

I understand that there is an aesthetic and a brand to uphold but let me tell you this - whilst eating Ramen, I do not want to have Pearl Jam's \"Jeremy\" or \"Them Bones\" by Alice in Chains, or any other \"chin-rock\" classics piping out into my ears. Ive tolerated it each time but today I realised I could take no more when at approximately 7:25pm, my ears were assaulted by the Stone Temple pilots. In 2015 there is no excuse for this. I was in such fear that the next song was going to be \"Mmm Mmm Mmm\" by the Crash Test Dummies, that I had to rush the ramen down in light speed and get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. Quite a stressful experience, and as a result marks have been lost. Three stars, but could be so much more.",

We ordered the tonkotsu ramen to test out the broth.  How disappointing! The broth was very bland, it doesn't taste like the 20 hour pork broth it claims to be on the menu.  It's also covered with a lot of oil.  Just a reflection of what a long way we are from having authentically good ramen and an appreciation for proper ramen here.  The only good dish we had for the night was the pork bones, covered with a sweet sesame sauce, it was delicious but the portion is a bit on the small side.  Then we also had the black sesame soft icecream, which was ok but a bit too sweet.  They really should work on their broth.  Now that I  have gone to the holy trinity of ramen - bone daddies, shoryu and tonkotsu, i have to say tonkotsu is the most balance and has the best broth.  Still a long way to go London!\nI did notice at Bone Daddies that they provide you with rubber band to tie your hair up while you are working on your noodles, a nice touch!!",

We got there around 6:30PM knowing they don't take reservations. They were nice enough to take my word that my two friends were on our way and sat me down ahead on stools in the back.  That being said, I see the merits in waiting for the full party to be there as the two guys in front of me said they had a table for 10 and took up one of the coveted tables, only to have 6 in their party ultimately arrive - leaving us in the kind of awkward side by side seating in the back where it's a bit difficult to get your stuff together and have a dinner conversation. The staff, though, was quite friendly and accommodating even the small space.\nBut anywho, on to the food - \nThe starts \nAppetizer: Fried chicken: Delicious  - A must order. I wouldn't have even thought to order this at a Japanese restaurant but you won't be disappointed - it's perfectly crispy, comes with a squeeze of lemon and really hits the spot - perfect for sharing.\nYellowtail sashimi - Fresh and delicious - a nice compliment to the added fried chicken calories!\nI went for the Sweet 3 Miso Ramen and...eh. I mean, don't get me wrong it was good as Ramen - the broth was hearty and the noodles were right on but as toppings and meat go, I just needed more to offset the saltiness of the broth.",

However, I went in for lunch today and ordered the Tantanmen 2, my favourite one, and then once I realised I couldn't finish this incredibly rich, chicken bone fat infused amazingness, I asked for a take-away box. I was then refused a take-away box. Here are the reasons why:\n(apparently)\n: there is no room for take away boxes (really?)\n: they would have to allocate another layer of operations to justify having a service to do take-away boxes (that doesn't really make sense, but okay)\n: it's wasteful of packaging, more so than actually chucking away half of a ramen bowl\n(despite having wooden chopsticks instead of reusable ones, but ok)\n: one can't control the experience of the ramen if it's boxed up and sent away with the customer who paid for it \nAnyway. All arbitrary reasons to me.  Look, if you want to have a new take on a non-native (aka the owner is not Japanese) in an international city like London, you make allowances like offer tupperware for those who would like to continue experiencing your delicious product. None of the reasons the owner presented as justifications for not offering a take-home option were air tight. The basic answer was, 'We just don't want to. And the customer can f*£$ off.' Fair enough.\nI never thought I'd say this, but I'm going to Tonkatsu next time.",

I though I'd waited that long, I might as well try the ramen. Lukewarm tonkotsu is not nice. Neither is the tough-as-old-boots chashu pork on top. I have a strong feeling they made my serving and forgot about it for 20min, despite me asking the waiter a few times why it was taking so long.\nThen they had the nerve to add a service charge.",

But I have yet to experience a ramen that could match or best this place. Even Samurai Mama's in Brooklyn, Minca in Alphabet City, and the best Japanese places from the East Village, San Francisco, and Los Angeles were nearly as good as this place.\nThe one catch - it is expensive. And crowded.\nHowever, there is something to be said about walking into a Japanese spot when you're not anywhere near Japan and seeing that it is packed with all the hip young, tattooed Japanese urbanites, Japanese yuppies and bankers as well as smiling young Japanese girls with their big cameras and little purses. This is the place for you.",

We were disappointed by the ramen having tried the two tantanmen variants. The soup was thick but a bit bland and heavy on peanuts which added an unwelcome sweetness and starchiness. Missed the savoury umami that's really important in any noodle soup. The noodles didn't hold their texture very well either. Soft shell crab was OK but nothing special. Would definitely recommend Shoryu over Bone Daddies for its more subtle soup, noodles with better bite and excellent range of sides. Altogether better as evidenced by the preponderance of Japanese diners (compared with Soho hipsters).",

                "description": "I miss living in Japan. I miss it so much, this was my second ramen outing in one week. The first to Shoryu, the second to Bone Daddies. The atmosphere in Bone Daddies is more hip than a typical ramen shop, but it's tightly packed. Which means there is a lot of rubbing of butts...not as bad as riding the JR Yamanote line in rush hour in Tokyo, but pretty close. Though, the communal seating and bar seating is good for dining out by yourself or if you come with friends. Well, good luck finding seats on a weekend night if you have friends. The place fills up fast. However, I was seated within a few minutes since I was by myself.\nI had the Tonkotsu ramen, and I have to say, I do prefer Shoryu's ramen...in egg, broth, noodles, the whole package. Bone Daddies is good, but I prefer Shoryu. Bone Daddies does have some fine, fine fried chicken (kara age).  Everyone around me was eating the soft-shelled crab, and seeming to enjoy it. And there were some cute waiters....just saying. All the waitstaff is really attentive and pretty fun.\nThe highlight of my outing was watching some chick curl up the ramen noodles with the chopsticks and the soup spoon like it was spaghetti. B****, please, that's not how you eat ramen!!! The hair ties on the table are so you can get you hair out of the way while you slurp it down! \nWell, in the end, glad I tried, but I prefer Shoryu's ramen, especially their egg. Price is similar, but I think Bone Daddies may be a few pounds more expensive. I wish I could put my finger on exactly why I prefer Shoryu, but I think it's worth trying both places for yourself.",

Very tender and well made cha-shu makes customer happy. And the quality and taste of Donkostu soup is good. Deep and long time boiled. However, when i was served, noddle and soup was nt hot . it was served with warm-cold. I was disappointed. Evenmore, the combination of topping and soup anf noodle is not good. Separately its good taste though, Too lack of ginger, not hot soup, and lack of bean sprouts. all together its disapointing for me. Because it served as warm-cold, the taste of soup is more greasy. \n As a big fan of Donkostu ramen, im disappointed, but Still one of the best ramen spot in london. I tried Ittenbari, Nagomi,, ect, Bone daddie is one of best. I want to try Chiken Gara-age. For donkotsu gourmet, its bit disapointed but still one of the place for reducing thirsty for japanese dish.",

As other yelpers have alluded to, they specialize in ramen noodles.  I started with the fried chicken which was fantastic, not greasy and very crispy.  The white meat was tender and juicy; I would think of them as more chicken morsels than traditional fried chicken.  Then I ordered the tonkatsu ramen.  The noodles were perfect, not too soft, with a certain amount of bite.  The eggs were extraordinary and the meat perfect.  My only complaint was the broth had been reduced for 24 hours, so it more resembled a thin gravy.  Personally, I like broths a bit less thick, but it was still very very good.  The service was friendly and nice.  I'm definitely going back.",
