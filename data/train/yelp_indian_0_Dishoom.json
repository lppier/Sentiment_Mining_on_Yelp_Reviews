                "description": "varunmurali.com/blog/dis…\nIrani cafes have this inexplicable homely feeling about them. I absolutely love going to Kyaani with my brother back in Bombay. At Kyaani you have to get the buttery bun maska, spicy and juicy chicken farcha with the delicious gravy poured all over it, and of course the timeless salli boti.\nI've actually never been to an Irani cafe outside of Bombay even within India. So when I head about Dishoom a couple weeks ago I was stoked! So many people recommended it to me so there was little chance I would skip visiting this homage to Bombay's Irani cafes.\nI really wanted to love Dishoom, but unfortunately I felt a little let down. Though the menu was stacked with favorites of Indian cuisine, I saw few traditional Parsi dishes on it. They did have bun maska (though not for lunch) and keema pav and a few other classics.\nDishes\nThe keema pav was pretty delicious. Spicy and authentic. Complemented the hot buttered pav really well. I would have been content to stop right there given how filling and value for money that single dish was.\nMy friend who I was eating with vouched for the okra fries. He was not wrong. They were super tangy and chatpata. Fried well and not oily at all.\nMy friend ordered the pav bhaji. Not a fan. The bhaji was waaaaay too smooth. I strongly believe you should be able to actually tell what you're eating in a pav bhaji. You need different textures to come through. The bhaji also tasted almost too creamy. It felt more like a paneer makhani sauce than bhaji.\n   \n The chicken biryani was the biggest let down. Mild, bland, uninspired. The chicken was tender I'll give it that. Not much else going on with the dish. It was just mushy and the rice was over cooked.\nYou can't keep me away from black dal. The menu featured it as one of their best items so we ordered it. Good, not great. Could definitely use a bit more flavor but the expected creaminess was there for sure.\nOh and the rose lassis were pretty great!\nWould I come back?\nI think I would maybe once a month or so, but I would definitely stick to the smaller dishes and appetizers. Unless someone else at the table orders a main course that tastes good that is!\nI think the small plates are super value for money. They get you pretty full and taste great. Definitely worth checking out!",

                "description": "Dishoom is a beloved string of modern Indian restaurants in London. Though you'll find classic dishes like murgh malai and lamb samosas, Dishoom's rendition of Indian food is through the lens of Irani cafes in Bombay. \nThe Covent Garden location is largely walk-in, and rain and shine you'll find shivering hordes waiting to get in and being treated to delicious cups of hot and milky chai. We timed it relatively well on a Sunday night and ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get in, and then another 15 at the bar.\nThe cocktail list is long and to-theme, including a thoughtful list of mocktails. The majority are 8.50 pounds. Cyrus Irani, my choice, was a straightforward tequila sour; Debonair was a fine frozen drink. By far the best drink here is the Hoppy Paanch, an IPA, Johnny Walker, and butter syrup concoction that tastes far better than that description. I drank most of my boyfriend's (oops).\nOnce seated in the cozy and buzzing downstairs, we ordered everything to share, with a little help from our waiter. Complimentary papadum with tri-colored dips was a satisfying, if standard, way to start off the meal; pau bhaji and okra fries (4.50 each) were both well-done and nice ways to continue our carb streak.\nOur larger plates were spiced and fragrant gunpowder potatoes (6.70); decent lamb chops (12.90) strewn with pomegranate seeds; a fine chicken ruby (10.50); and a delicious but small prawn dish (17.50). Although we were happily in a food orgy, mopping up sauces with naan, I couldn't help but wonder what I was missing.Everything was done well, but nothing was really above and beyond in the way that, say, Pondicheri in Houston is.\n Prices are elevated but not too bad; we had a bill around 75 pounds for our party of four (excluding drinks), and that was somewhat inflated by the prawns. \nService is rushed but reasonable given the popularity. Bathrooms are very nice. Decor and atmosphere in general is great.\nI understand why Dishoom is a must-go in London, and it has plenty of convenient locations, but I was expecting something just a little extra.",

                "description": "One does not go to London without going to the legendary Dishoom. It's the only place on Yelp that has 1300+ reviews and 4.5 stars. I had high expectations and was nervous that this place would be severely overhyped, but Dishoom was an A+ in my book.\nI heard the wait times can be insanely long (one night we called and they said it was 2 hour queue for dinner). So we decided to go the next day for lunch and prayed to the food Gods. We got there at 12pm on the dot and our prayer was answered as we got seated immediately. The place was already packed on both levels. Decor is cute and what I love about this place is that for every meal purchased, they donate a meal to an organization charity :) More reasons to eat here!\nWe ended up with the chicken tikka masala (called chicken ruby on the menu), the paneer masala, black house daal, garlic naan, and the keam. Everything was beyond fantastic. As everyone suggests, I highly recommend the chicken ruby and  daal (vegetarian and slow cooked for 24 hours). Consistency was nice, creamy, and not overly thick. Tender chunks of meat that just pair so well with the naan. Thankfully for me, the food was not terribly spicy which made my eating experience more enjoyable.\nService was prompt, courteous, and on point. Water was always refilled without asking, and the flow of the place didn't make me feel rushed despite the growing lines outside.\nOverall, I would recommend coming here to cross it off the bucket list. Wasn't expecting such amazing Indian food in London and am pleasantly surprised, but no complaints here :D\nNote: the dishes do not come with rice. You need to order it separately and it costs around $3USD per bowl. \nNote 1: there also seems to be sister locations of Dishoom nearby? Haven't been there but would imagine it to be similar, so if this place is packed maybe stop by it's other location.",

                "description": "I have to say this restaurant is overrated. Their food is good, but it's not that good.\nThey do not take reservations. We waited for about 35 minutes or so outside and then 15 minutes or so at the bar downstairs. Once again, their food is good but I don't think it's worth waiting for close to an hour. We ordered the lamb chops (my favorite), murgh malai, and chicken ruby. I would give 4 stars for the food, but with the long wait, I cannot give more than 3 stars.\nPro-Tip:\nEven if the queue looks relatively short outside, it's likely to be a long wait as there are people waiting for their tables at the bar downstairs.\nI would not return to Dishoom nor do I recommend this to anyone. There are many other good restaurants in London and there's also better way to spend time than waiting in line.\n******************************\nIf you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful\" so that I can improve my reviews.

                "description": "It is well known that London has a sprawling Indian food scene that serves some of the best Indian cuisines outside of India. Dishoom, a small chain of seven \"Bombay Cafes\", is definitely on the top of the list for both locals and tourists alike.\nOnline reservations can be made for breakfast and lunch only. They do not accept reservations for dinner and the only way to get in is the old traditional way - stand in line! There have been times when we walked past a Dishoom during dinner hours and saw lines wrapping around the block.\nThe \"Bombay Café\" style features a casual but moderately upscale and comfortable environment with cool vibes. The atmosphere is friendly and vibrant, and is always a perfect place to chill, and to grab some yummy Indian food with a couple of bottles of Kingfisher.\nVEGETABLE SAMOSAS:  The skin was paper-thin and fried to a perfect crispiness that when I sank my teeth into it, the skin just crumbled and melted away while the filling made with veggies and mashed potatoes greeted my mouth with a warmly spicy yumminess.\nCHICKEN RUBY:  It looked like a variation of the famous tikka Marsala which was a tomato based curry with cubed chicken breast meat.  The ruby dish, however, came with makhani sauce which was silky and smooth. It really tasted like tikka Marsala but with a stronger flavor of ginger and garlic. It had a nice balance of sweetness versus spiciness and was delicious beyond words.\nGUNPOWDER POTATOES:  If you asked me to recommend a \"must-order\" item then this is it, not just because it was so amazingly good, but also because you can't find this anywhere else. Skin-on potatoes were fire grilled, cut into pieces, then sautéed with butter and an abundance of peppers and exotic spices. It was without a doubt one of the most memorable potato dishes that I've ever had.\nWe also had a roti to mop up the sauce from the ruby chicken, some rice, and a bowl of vegetables. Everything was good beyond belief.\n5 stars+",

(It was a lot for a solo lunch...) The black daal is amazing, although there's so much else I want to try here it's hard to say whether I'd get it again next time. \nThe chicken ruby, on the other hand, would be hard to ever skip -- I get that this is the most basic of Indian dishes, but it's so incredible, and the one here is probably my favorite. \nOf course, the naan (both the regular and, especially, the garlic) are amazing too. I really liked the roti as well, but it wasn't at the same level as the naan in my opinion, and actually made me appreciate how incredible the roti is at Roti King (where I went for the first time on this trip).\nOverall, really amazing food for surprisingly cheap prices, if you can get in...",

I'm not a HUGE fan of daal in general, but they season it very well.\nThe bollybellini cocktail was delicious, I could have had 3 more if i wasn't so full from the food we ordered!\nCalamansi smash I thought it was acceptable in comparison to the other, but my boyfriend really loved it.\nI forgot the name of our server, but he was only on his 4th day serving and was absolutely amazing!

Definitely recommended to make a reservation - it's really easy on their website, and there is almost always a line when coming in.\nService is polite but somewhat curt and rushed given the amount of people there are coming through. There is a very large downstairs seating area, and the booths have fun fans that cool you down from the spice.\nTheir menu is huge with a variety of dishes from across India. Most of the dishes are sized and made to share, and the back has a large drinks and chai menu. The drinks are very small portions. Lassi is thick and yogurty, and the chai comes creamy and sweet. \nFavorite dishes:\nHouse Black Daal: Amazing, very spicy and creamy. \nChole Poori - chickpea curry with a very interesting pairing of sweet halwa mash, comes with puffy poori bread. Delicious must have.\nPaneer: their paneer dishes are delicious, all well flavored with chewy paneer. The mattar paneer came in a sauce that was very tomato-y, and had very few peas.",

Saturday night there was a two hour queue, and we were told it was no shorter at their other establishments in the city! It ended up being a social experience, talking to others in line, so the time went by quickly. Probably better with a group. The food was indeed fantastic, which explains the popularity. The chicken tikka was so well seasoned that every bite was precious. Also enjoyed the ruby chicken curry, calamari appetizer and the nan.

The fried okra was good enough.\nI don't think I'd wait over an hour for this. Come during lunch, the line is much better and it's the same experience!",

While I don't remember the cocktails anymore (I believe they were whiskey sours), I do remember that they were delicious - although not the most alcoholic. \nWe shared the plain naan, chicken biryani , house black daal, and spicy lamb chops. I loved the spicy lamb chops and ate all of it since my partner was vegetarian :); the chicken biryani, although huge, was a bit too bland for my taste with dry chicken. \nThe next time, another dining partner and I tried the jackfruit biryani, and cheese naan. GET THE CHEESE NAAN. It was the most delicious thing I've ever had. \nAlso, I loved the different types of Kulfi on a stick - my dining partner from India said it should've been only a few cents on the streets of New Delhi, but I didn't mind spending a few bucks for the most delicious and creamy dessert of my life. \nGreat service - make a reservation and you'll be all set!",

I made the reservation in advance based on my friend's recommendation and you should too!

What we were told was 3 dishes per person and everything is meant to shared. We order 5 dishes for the two of us so we ended with a bunch of food left and it's sad that we couldn't take away.\nMy favorite:\nChicken Ruby !!!

The place was packed. Loud, casual ambiance with both table and booth seating. Looking around, you can see the naan being made fresh behind the counter.\nFor drinks we ordered the house chai and mint tea. The chai was the best chai I've ever had. Rich, spicy, and soothing, the (sadly) small glass of chai was an excellent way to start the morning. The mint tea could be smelled from a mile away, that's how fresh and refreshing the mint was.\nWe ordered the bacon naan, akuri, the big Bombay, and the kejriwal, which was eggs on chili cheese toast. The bacon naan was superb. The tamarind BBQ sauce complemented the bacon extremely well. The Kejriwal was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and the flavors didn't meld too well together. I'd rather have had a second naan. The other people in my group enjoyed the Akuri and The Big Bombay, especially commenting on the taste of mushrooms. \nIf I could give half-stars, this place would get 4.5/5. Not perfect, but pretty darn close.",

                "description": "My wife and I went here during our last night in London because it had a good Yelp rating along with the other parameters we used. I thought the food was great and normally the pros and cons of the place would have evened out to a 4 star experience, but the waiter we had was so bad that the meal ultimately ruined what would have otherwise been a pleasant end to our U.K. vacation. Frankly I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I'm restraining myself out of a greater sense of fairness and keeping it at 3 because I think overall this place is well managed and I can't justify dropping it lower mainly because of one waiter with a bad attitude. Thus, at the end of the day we sort of got what we paid for (3 stars), but it's not a place I'd really want to go back to or even recommend for others to try (3 stars).\nWhen we first arrived we reached the back of a line outside the door and the staff did a great job of managing our expectations re: wait time and I thought it was really nice that at one point one of the waiters actually came outside with complementary tea for all of us. One of the people in line with us talked about how one of his friends always wants to come to this place whenever he visits London and I really liked how we could see what people were doing in the kitchen.\nThen we got in and we had this waiter who seemed nice, but after the first glasses of water he never refilled them for us after being asked more than once. Thank God the food wasn't too spicy -- otherwise, we would have been in trouble! And he did that thing that too many waiters do where they hold you hostage with your bill and you have to flag them down, and this was getting pretty late on a Sunday night. Overall it gave us the impression that he just had this attitude of oh, these people are just American tourists, they'll never be back so forget about them. Adding insult to injury our bill had something called \"voluntary\" [tip/gratuity] instead of just charging an honest price for each of the items and managing our expectations instead of making us think oh wow, these prices are actually reasonable despite being in the heart of London.\nNegatives:\n-really small portion sizes -- this was to be expected and considering the prime location would not have been an issue if other basic things had been up to par\n-no complementary rice -- this is more of a critique of U.K. Indian restaurants in general, but really? It costs almost nothing to make rice and an Indian restaurant without free rice is like a Mexican restaurant without free chips & salsa\nPositive things:\n-Excellent fresh taste, about as good as one could expect of Indian food (psst! There's also a great Indian restaurant in Salisbury near Queen Elizabeth's Park that's even better. My experience in the U.K. is that restaurants in outlying areas are better in addition to being more economical and in London you're better off just going to one of the big grocery stores)\n-Great atmosphere, no complaints there\n-From a cultural standpoint I liked that they offered Iranian items -- the lamb was quite good",

The line moved pretty quick and before we know it we were seated. We waited about 45mins which wasn't bad. We ordered 4 entrees for the 4 of us. We also ordered 2 sides which were bowl of greens and basmati rice. All dishes were amazing and it was an awesome experience. Most of their dishes are dry and not saucey like other Indian places I've been to in the past. We were all stuffed and super satisfied with the service and food. Definitely a great place for romantic dinners with the dark atmosphere inside. Even though we were full, we still wanted to order more. It was impossible to stop talking about it after we left the restaurant. \nGarlic Naan: Oh my god! The garlic naan was perfect with the chicken ruby we ordered. The naan itself was just as amazing. It had just enough garlic and butter on there to make it super flaky and good. \nMahi Tikka: Hands down best dish of the night! There were 4 big pieces of fish which was perfect for each of us to try one. The fish was super fresh and amazingly good. It pretty much melted in my mouth after taking one bite of it. I've never seen fish at an Indian restaurant before, but man this was literally hands down best dish ever! I almost wanted to order another one. \nChicken Ruby: This was really really good. It was the red tomato sauce with chicken in it. There were big chunks of chicken in there which were super tender. I ordered some rice and ate it with the sauce. The sauce wasn't super overpowering the chicken or over spiced at all. I'm super picky with my sauce, but this was really good to the point that I would be able to drink it just by itself. \nDishoom Chicken Tikka: This was probably one of their signature dishes. The chicken thighs were super juicy and smooth. They definitely didn't over cook the chicken.\nI will definitely come back when I visit London again.",

We're so used to hitting up the cheap all you can eat Indian buffets..that Dishoom atmosphere, presentation, and selection just blew me out of the water. There will always be a wait here... but the hostess stand makes up for it by serving hot chai and mint tea to those who are in line! Tasty as well. Took about 35 minutes to be seated so I was starved. We started out with cocktails, the bf and bro got the house beer while I gotta chilitini, spicccay but really all the drinks were very unique and delicious sounding... wish I wasn't a broke med student. We didn't want to eat too much but did anyways. Started out with the okra fries.. so crispy. The got the pav bhaji, Dishoom chicken tikka, and chole puri. The most flavorful was the chicken, very tender pieces and creamy curry. It was a little different, they put a lot of lime juice  in the chicken tikka .. was s different spin I've never seen before, but very tasty. I think the chole was the most underwhelming, couldn't compared to the chicken. Pav bhaji was flavorful as well but messy. Dessert we shared a malai kulfi, yum... a sweet end to a very filling meal.\nExpensive? Yeah but what isn't in Europe? Don't go here if price is an issue. But... you'd be missing out honestly, it's definitely worth the experience even if it's a one time thing.",

It was only later that I'd notice that Ruggy and other Yelp dignitaries had experienced the majesty of this modern Indian tapas hangout slinging traditional street flavors.\nBeing jetlagged and coming here at 4:30 pm probably helped my cause of getting in without much fuss. The wait was about 5 minutes and only the arrival of my East India Gimlet and lamb samosas were able to drown out the guilt I felt over snagging a three-person table by myself.\nBefore I was seated, I waited at the bar downstairs and had time to admire the cavernous layout and dimly lit rooms, surprisingly sexy and mysterious compared to the Indian restaurants I've experienced in New York.\nI ordered up the items I understood to be standouts here, and they didn't disappoint. In addition to the aforementioned lamb samosas, the house black daal and chicken ruby curry were both out-of-this-planet good. I mean, plate-licking good stuff. Make sure you don't miss either dish.\nLooking forward to a return visit on my next trip to London. Come at off-peak hours and order up a bunch of stuff.

This place came highly recommended and we decided to go for breakfast. \nI immediately noticed this restaurant is decorated and serves food from more of a colonial perspective, whereas in the Bay Area, it seems more homey. I guess this isn't too much of a surprise given the history between the two countries.\nWe had:\n-KEEMA PER EEDU:\nA Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicate morsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs and sali crisp-chips. Served with home-made buns. \nThis was my boyfriend's dish and he loved it. Said it was better than the typical versions he had of this and that the buns were delicious.\n-DATE & BANANA PORRIDGE:\nOrganic porridge oats cooked with milk, banana and sweet Medjool dates \nWe weren't sure what to expect with this dish but both really enjoyed it. The banana gave it a fresh flavor and the dates sweetened the porridge without making it too sweet. This is free refills but honestly, one bowl was enough for the two of us.\n-EGG NAAN ROLL:\nTwo fried free-range eggs with saffron-yellow, runny yolks. Warm and most gratifying \nI ordered this because it seemed unique. It was but the sauce may be a bit sweet for some.\n-Chai tea: pricey but delicious\nI really enjoyed this spot and will have to come for dinner next!",

                "description": "I knew I wasn't going to come to London without dining at Dishoom, I foolishly tried walking over at around 630P to dine before a 730P production in the area. Laughable!!! My advice, DO NOT DO THAT! This place is crazy busy and the wait time was well over an hour on a Friday evening after 6P. I stood there for awhile contemplating weather or not I thought I'd make it in and have enough time to enjoy dinner before realizing it just was not going to happen. I asked the host what time they close and if they are this busy after theatre. He mentioned there would be a wait later in the evening before they close but it wouldn't be this long at all. I decided then I'd hop out of the line and go to theatre hungry. \nI came back at around 1015P and waited for around 20 minutes and enjoyed the best dinner. All of my usual, very basic (I know) menu items: somosas, Ruby Chicken, Rice, Cheese Naan, a beer and their delish warm chai tea they pass out to the folks waiting outside in the cold for a table.\nService was friendly, food arrived quickly and I was in and out in less than an hour.\nI'd definitely recommend dining here but planning it out accordingly since no one really enjoys waiting long periods of time to eat.",

The queue was obviously long. But worth the wait. Mostly for such hospitable waiters who came by with different drinks like warm chai tea or sherry wine or lemonade. All so delicious too. Then it started raining and they brought out large umbrellas!\nThe staff, for working at such a popular, busy restaurant, were friendly, upbeat, and playful! I loved that they weren't grudgingly leading the next millionth customer to a table.\nCan we talk about the atmosphere? The hanging lights? The beautiful decor? I was head over heels for everything. Even the toilet!\nThe lamb chops were definitely delicious. My friend ordered garlic naan to share, and I was surprised the garlic was actually so present in comparison to other sad naans I've had. \nDefinitely wouldn't mind using up another London trip to eat here again. Beware of an hour wait though! It'll be worth it.",

                "description": "My hubby and I came here because of how many good reviews this place has. When we walked up to the restaurant it looked very nice but noticed there was a long line waiting outside (not a good start since it was very windy and cold that night). A lady came up to us to let us know it'd be about 1 hr wait and although we were pretty hungry we decided to wait. \nOutside looking in we could see a long row of empty tables, which we assumed was for a large group who had reserved (funny I saw a review that said they don't take reservations...hmm?). We waited about 30 min outside. We then were lead downstairs to wait inside at the bar for another 20 min or so until we finally got seated upstairs. Looking around we still noticed the long row of empty tables with no group.\nThe food honestly was not the best. I liked it but back in FL I've had much better Indian food with wayyy tastier garlic naan bread. Our server was very nice but didn't check up on us as much as we would've liked (that could be a UK thing though, since we are from the US the servers are always coming up to ppls tables to check up on them). The drinks were good though(1 star for the drinks)\nAfter about 10 min of us at the table finally we see the big group come in to sit at the long empty row of tables. I'm pretty sure everyone that was waiting outside in the cold could've sat at those tables and been done eating by the time that group arrived. I've never been to a restaurant where they reserve your table for more than 10 min for your group to arrive and have waiting customers outside in the cold. Even with all that I wouldn't have been so annoyed if only the food was to die for but it wasn't. It really wasn't all that great.",

                "description": "3.5\nApparently a trip to London is not complete without visiting Dishoom - if you're in the area I'd definitely check it out (there's a few locations around London).\nCame on a weekday afternoon for lunch and was seated right away. The decor is rustic with a mix of contemporary - not like your typical North American designed Indian restaurants which was unique. I really liked the vibe here - not too loud with bustling kitchen sounds and aromatic Indian food being prepared. There's cut-outs of articles on the wall and marble tables...it's quite aesthetic I have to say. \nI wasn't too overly impressed with the service, in fact I would say that's what takes away part of the stars for my rating. The waiter was questioning whether I knew Indian food (I definitely do, ahem)...in any case the food arrived swiftly. \nI got the matar paneer which was a curry made with soft cheese (tofu like texture) and the naan t accompany it (costs extra) and my friend got the biryani. The paneer was delicious and definitely had authentic flavours (can confirm authenticity after having paneer in India a few months back). However, this place was quite pricey for lunch...I'd go back occasionally if it was in my route. For the price I'd expect much better service and a more unique menu instead of standard Indian fare. \nIn all not a bad experience and if you're in the area (Trafalgar Square) definitely venture in!",

                "description": "I hate waiting for food. I see no reason to make yourself feel terrible when you can easily relieve your pain by walking across the street. \nBut, Dishoom is the rare exception I will make. I came at 9 PM and had to wait 70 minutes to be seated, but after hearing the hype, I knew I had to verify. (also 1 hour is probably the furthest I'll be masochistic for)\nI ordered the jackfruit biryani, chicken ruby, and plain naan. I'd been starving all day, but wow this was incredibly filling. The ruby was my favorite. Think tender chicken with a rich, silky makhani sauce. Essentially a curry with spice and flavor. Smooth like butter. The biryani was great too - a veggie option to balance out the savoriness of the ruby. The sauces that came with the dishes were also incredible, with a spectrum of yogurt sauce and spicy sauce and in between. Overall, I appreciated the breadth and depth of the menu options as well as the accommodating items they served with them to ensure anyone will be satisfied regardless of taste preference. \nThe restaurant was beautiful as well. They give you a newspaper like menu in a headline-like fashion featuring the different menu options, while giving an overarching background story about the restaurant's mission on the top header. Found it pretty cute. Even took it home for kicks and giggles to memorialize this visit.",

Dishoom Chicken Tikka (7.90)\n3. Paneer Tikka (7.70)\n4. House Black Daal (5.90)\n5. Chicken Berry Britannia (9.50)\n6. Chicken Ruby (9.50)\n7. Garlic Naan (2.90)\n8. Steamed Basmati Rice (2.90)\nEvery single dish was outstanding! If I had to choose my top 3 dishes to order they would be the Prawn Koliwada, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and House Black Daal. But honestly, you cannot go wrong with any dish you order! The Prawn Koliwada was so crisp and fresh and the chutney was unlike any I've ever had! I was so obsessed. Both the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and House Black Daal were so flavorful and rich in the best way. The chicken in the Dishoom Chicken Tikka was tender and juicy and cooked so nicely.\nThe service here is fantastic and the ambiance is very fun and trendy. If you have not been here before and you're visiting London, Dishoom is a must! My family and I arrived here around 4pm and waited for about an hour! Apparently the wait is much longer near dinner time so if you're flexible I would definitely come as early as possible! Would love to come back to Dishoom the next time I am in town.",

                "description": "Dishoom was our first dinner in London! It was beautiful weather so standing in line for about 40 minutes didn't seem like a chore! They provided us with lemonade in line and then sent us inside to the next part of the line, which was the bar area. Their seating/waiting system was really well thought out and seemed very efficient! We were seated in under an hour, which was our original quote time. The food was delicious! We tried a lot of entrees and were absolutely stuffed by the end. \nWe ordered the paneer tikka & vegetable samosas to start, all were delicious. The flavor on the paneer was good! The chutneys that are served with the breads and starters are amazing! \nFor dinner we ordered the Lamb Boti Kabab- grilled lamb, which was perfectly cooked and so tasty. The Chicken Tikka flavor was great, the meat is chicken thigh, so be aware if you aren't a fan of dark meat! The Chicken Ruby was also interesting and tasty- a sweet and spicy sauce, it was a unique chicken dish! We also ordered the Gundpowder Potatoes- SO GOOD, probably my favorite thing we ordered, a variety of spices that really was a perfect combination. A few naan bread as well! To finish we had the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. \nI would say the food is well priced and tasty! They have a smaller menu, but that allows them to get food out quickly- if you are looking for a lot of the classics you won't necessarily find them here. Everyone at the table was impressed with the food. \nService at our table is where our review turns a little negative. Service from our specific server was a little lack luster- we had to ask someone else for water that was walking buy with a pitcher. Our server left and went on break during our meal, and so we were left with no one to get our check or clear our table. We waited a significant amount of time and didn't spot her, but finally saw her come back in with take away food for her break after 25 minutes. Thankfully we were able to steal a waiter from another area to help us get our check. Overall it was a fun experience- I wish the service at the table would have been as stellar as the service during our wait! Food was good!",

I got the cobada colada (I think, it's a tongue twister!) It was absolutely delish and tasted like a vacation in a glass.\nOnce seated, our waitress was incredibly kind and recommended a bunch of stuff. We went with the black daal, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, rice, and garlic naan. All were so flavorful and tasty. Our favorite dish was the chicken ruby. All dishes are meant to be shared. Everything is also very reasonably priced in my opinion (nothing we got was over 10.)  \nFor a restaurant with over 1200 Yelp reviews, I see why! A unique and exciting food experiance.",

HAZAHHHHH!!! \nThis is now my third visit to Dishoom, and to be quite honest, it has only gotten better and better for me. I'm not even quite sure how to describe this experience because it was so amazing. \nWell, they have a Christmas dinner option with different price options. We had the £30 option which included 3 starters, and 5 entrees, and an option of 1 dessert. It was family style and there was so much food. \nAnyway, the point is you should go for Christmas dinner because it's awesome, and if it's not Christmas, you should still go because it's delicious. See below for my fav dishes:  \nBhel (crunchy puffed rice tossed with fresh pomegranate, tomato, onion, lime, tamarind, mint)- it's a lovely starter with especially nice textures and very fresh. \nSamosas- because samosas. \nJackfruit Biryani- The jackfruit tastes like chicken- it's even got the texture of chicken and it's very confusing for a vegetarian but also a wonderful experience. Hahahahaha so weird. Anyway, the rice itself has fantastic flavour and a good amount of spice. One of my favourite dishes  fo sho. Sometimes rice makes me nervous because I feel like it'll be too dry, but this rice is so great and perfectly balanced. \nMattar Paneer- Creaaaammmy baby! It's just so good. The sauce is the magical thing. It's so rich and delectable. The paneer is a nice touch, but I'd just take the sauce with the peas. Delish. \nHouse Black Daal- So, the first time I tried this dish, I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know what it was. But the second time... holy guacamole batman, this shit hit the spot. (apparently I start to sound super American when I get very enthusiastic about something and I'm now starting to notice it as I type). BUT FOR REAL GUYS THIS DISH IS SERIOUSLY LIKE THE BEST. There you go. The flavours are so deep, and it's like the flavour just gets deeper and more delicious as you eat it. \nTheir mango Kulfi on a stick is absolutely amazing. I was so full but I managed to eat mine and two other people's because they were so creamy and delightful! \n***random side note*** I was actually very upset towards the end of our meal because there was so much food left over and I didn't want it to go to waste. (We were going to a bar afterwords) I started freaking out a little bit and eating way more than normal, but wasn't hardly making a dent. Then I had the genius idea of just taking it all with us out and back home. So I did. And I brought it to work the next day and fed everyone twice! WINNING!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and of course I also kept extra for myself. \nI LOVE DISHOOM.",

                "description": "Wow! I cannot say enough about the food at Dishoom. I adore Indian food but my cousin, not so much. Even so, she thoroughly enjoyed the food at Dishoom. We ordered several items to share among our group of 4. Chicken tikka, Mahi tikka, Chicken Ruby, gunpowder potatoes, lamb samosas and 2 orders of naan bread. Our favorite dishes were the samosas, chicken ruby and potatoes. The chicken tikka had some grissle pieces so the quality of meat wasn't up to par and the mahi was under seasoned for my taste (and it's really tilapia). But the service was amazing and the side sauces were a nice addition to any bite. I loved the red spicy sauce on everything! I highly recommend this restaurant and the chicken ruby with a starter and some naan.",

The Indian restaurants in Florida mainly serve lunch and dinner only, so an Indian restaurant open for breakfast definitely piqued my interest. There's multiple Dishoom locations throughout the city. For breakfast, we made a reservation online at their Covent Garden location. When we arrived around 8:30AM, it was pretty empty! I don't think the reservation was even necessary at that point. But around 9:30 -10:00 AM, when we were leaving tables were filling up quickly. \nFor appetizer, we ordered the bacon & egg naan roll. Hot & fresh baked naan with chili tomato and fresh herb sauce. I ordered the Kejriwal as my main meal, which is two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. The fiance ordered The Big Bombay, the sausage and baked beans English-style breakfast with an Indian twist. Every plate was bursting with bright colors and looked absolutely delectable. An explosion of flavors in each bite. \nGo early to avoid the lines. Best and most unique breakfast you'll have in a while! We loved it so much that we visited another location by the train station for late dinner.",

The ability to make reservations online way in advance is an automatic plus-one rating from me. \nFirst thing I noticed was that there was a huge line forming outside in the rain. Once I mentioned the reservation, we were led to our table on the ground floor immediately. The kitchen is on this level, so you can see the craziness from your seat. There is a downstairs portion of this restaurant, which I was grateful to not be seated in because there are no windows and I get claustrophobic. However, when I went down there to use the restroom I notice it was very interestingly decorated, with little alcoves for your party and different artwork. It probably is also less hectic and provides more intimate seating. \nHere are the dishes I tried with photos attached: \nKeema Pau- spiced lamb appetizer to get you going\nMasala Prawns- Large, grilled, and seasoned\nRoomali Roti- A paper thin bread \nChicken Ruby- Luxurious chicken curry\nGarlic Naan- Personal favorite for any Indian meal\nThe food here is well spiced, fresh, and cooked to perfection. It definitely lived up to the hype and has earned return visits and recommendations from me. The service was impeccable as well. This is a perfect restaurant for date night, special occasions, and to treat yourself. Their large drink menu also makes this an option for you to make a night of it with coworkers or friends.",

Unfortunately, the only time that I could visit was during the morning, so we opted to try the food prior to our trip to Buckingham Palace. \nLuckily, we got there before the brunch crowd, so we were able to be seated right away. The menu didn't have a ton of choices, but I decided on the Big Bombay breakfast, which included eggs, beans, sausage, bacon and some rolls. It was a relatively simple breakfast (and a lot of food), but everything was nicely cooked and flavorful. Paired with some orange juice, this was a good start to the day exploring London.

We went on a Sunday night and were in line for around 30 mins before they invited us in the bar area, followed by a proper table in the dining area in around 20 mins (total 50 mins)! We did not mind the wait. \nAt the bar, we ordered Kala Khatta (non alcoholic drink,  mixed with  flavorful  spices, traditional to indian palette) and dishoom india pale. Both were great and we could not wait for the main course!\nFor main course, we ordered lamb samosas, pau bhaji, chicken ruby, garlic naan and roomali roti. Lamb samosas were 5/5 and Pau Bhaji may be a 4/5 (i have had better). They served samosas with three different chutneys, which was amazing! Chicken ruby was tender, juicy, rich in flavors, and lip smacking good! I literally could have wiped the plate clean! So good.\nWe ended the dinner with house tea, which was AMAZING!!\nCan't wait to come back.",

It was a Thursday and the line at 5PM was literally wrapped around the street. It was the longest line we'd ever seen, but it sure stirred some interest and we made a reservation for that weekend! From what we've heard from friends, it's not easy to get a reservation a few days away so we were pretty stoked. I think they take reservations until 5:30 so if you walk in before, there should be some open tables.\nI'm giving 4/5 because I found the portions small, but it is advertised as \"small plates\"/tapa style so it's an opportunity to try a bit of everything. We ordered the murgh malai, lamb kabab, and some garlic naan. Everything was really delicious!",

So good we went back twice in less than 24 hours. \nSmall plates: We had the okra fries, lamb samosas, and keema pau- all SO amazing. The keema pau is Iranian and was soooo delicious- the lamb is flavorful and a little oily, which makes it go perfectly with the homemade bun that goes with it (which is toasted to perfection!). \nMains: between the two days we tried the chicken ruby (twice!!) which is basically their version of butter chicken. It is honestly the best butter chicken I've ever had. We also had the chicken berry biryani which was delicious- the berries gave it a nice and different flavor. We also had the house black daal which was delicious, and I'm a huge daal lover. My bf also had the dishoom chicken tikka roll was very tasty also. And of course we had garlic naan with it all!\nDrinks: my bf tried the dishoom pale ale and thought it was really good! I also had the bollybellini which was very tasty, but definitely a sweet cocktail. I also had the baileys chai which was so delicious, perfect amounts of both and an amazing cream on top. \nDessert: we had the dishoom chocolate pudding- so good!! It's more of a molten chocolate flourless cake, less like a traditional American pudding. It comes with a spicy chili ice cream which is so unique. Overall very delicious",

                "description": "With so many great food options throughout London, it is amazing how crowded this place gets. Once you eat here, you will understand the clamoring to eat here.\nMy partner and I came early as to not wait in the line in the rain. The staff are very friendly and the restaurant is a great mix of classic London lobby restaurant and modern Indian bar. They have two floors of dining areas and patrons can wait at one of two bars if they are allowed to navigate the queue outside.\nThe first highlight of this dining experience were the cocktails. Unique, ethnic inspired cocktails are a great addition to delicious Indian food. The Viceroy Old Fashion (£9.50) and the East Indian Gimlet (£8) were the best drinks. In terms of the food, I would highly recommend house specials. The Pau Bhaji (£4.50) and the Daal (£6.20) were packed with flavor and were perfect for dipping breads. We split a lot of small dishes and this seemed to be a good method of enjoying lots of different dishes. It seemed like most tables were employing this tasting method.\nOverall, this place is great. I have no complaints. I would recommend getting here early as the line was very long when we were ending our dining experience.",

                "description": "A unique Indian dining experience, far different from the more traditional restaurants I have experienced in the past. Dishoom creates a fresh, modern take on classic Bombay cuisine in a visually stunning ambiance. Gilded light fixtures, beautiful antique photos, dark wood details, and intricately tiled floors provide a glamorous fine dining vibe. The interior is enormous, with two floors of seating. This would be a good place to come with a large group. Service was elusive and difficult to summon, but the place is super hectic so we did not really mind. \nTo drink I tried the Rose Lassi, which was delicious. Nice subtle floral flavors, and the perfect amount of sweetness. We shared the Gunpowder Potatoes and Bowl of Greens, both of which were simple, flavorful plant based sides that would compliment any entree. My main was the Jackfruit Biryani, which was excellent. The jackfruit was not shredded as I expected, but served as larger chunks in a bowl of rice. Richly spiced and deeply savory, the tender meat substitute provided a perfect contrast to the aromatic basmati rice. The trio of condiment sauces served on the side further enhanced the complex flavors-do not skip on adding these to your food. My boyfriend does not like Indian food (at all), and enjoyed his wrap. Lunch for two came to just around £45-a bargain considering the quality of ingredients and generous portions. I would not hesitate to recommend Dishoom.",

I mean, the food here is phenomenal and worth your time, but if you're visiting on vacation, you don't have all the time in the world to be spending it in line!!! Make a reservation! \nAfter 5:45pm, they only allow reservations for parties of greater than 6. However, if you have less than 6, you can still make a reservation for any time before 5:45pm. \nThe inside is insanely hip and historic at the same time. I love the modern accents that feature decor that look like period-pieces from the 1920s. It also helps that you're greeted by the most aromatic and inviting smells as soon as you step foot into this establishment.\nThe food speaks for itself. You won't be disappointed by anything you order. Some of the food is so innovative and different, but not lacking at all in flavor. I was so surprised that the chicken tikka masala did not have sauce! The chicken pieces were just expertly soaked/braised/infused/whatever with the flavors that the sauce is still discernible, even if you're not seeing it. It's quite an incredible culinary feat, if you ask me. \nAlso, I loved seeing the open kitchen downstairs. So efficient, spacious, and clean.",

Also, the quality was much better here!\nFirst of all, they have a great waiting system. They gave us a remote that buzzes when your table is ready. When it buzzed, we went straight downstairs. I'm not sure what they use their upstairs for (maybe reservations) but they were directing all walk-ins downstairs. \nSecond of all, the staff is amazing. Everyone that helped us was very kind. Our waitress, in particular, knew the menu very well and was very sweet. \nThird of all, the food was INCREDIBLE. I got a mango lassi and the Bedmi Puri. My dad got the Chicken Curry and an order of naan. They were both incredible and plenty of food for two people. The Chicken Curry, in particular, was very flavorful and pairs very well with both a Puri and naan. The mango lassi was my favorite part. It tasted just like we got it in India - very well done, sweet and tasty. \nI would recommend this place to everyone that visits London!",

We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and arrived at 11:55 and just barely got a table for 2! The place was packed. \nWe ordered:\n-Rose & Pistachio Lassi (must order) \n-Pav Bhaji (must order) \n-Lamb Biriyani (must order but try the chicken instead)\n-Ruby Chicken Curry\n-Palak Paneer \n-Naan \nThe food was all 5 stars. I highly recommend ordering the biriyani. It tasted just like my mom's homemade biriyani which takes 2 days to make- with the exception of Dishoom's lamb being a little tough and the cashews not being roasted. When I took my first bite, I was sent back 15 years to my childhood. It was incredible. Next time I come here I want to order the chicken biriyani. \nNow that I am back in Boston, I am craving that rose and pistachio lassi. As soon as it was served to me, I slurped it down in under 1 minute. The rose wasn't over powering at all and the lassi was light but had amazing flavor. \nNext time we are in London, we will definitely be back here! What was really nice too was that the whole restaurant is decorated with family memorabilia-even the bathroom stalls!",

Even though this was 2 $$, it was still relatively expensive.  \nFood/drinks ordered:\n- Sweet & mango lassi: Dishoom did their own twist to the traditional lassi.  It's a bit more watered down and they added ice to the mixture as well.  The spices they added to the lassi are an acquired taste.  The mango lassi was actually more tangy than sweet.  \n- Okra fries: This is actually pretty good.  Crispy and quite flavorful.  I liked \n- The black daal is their specialty, so I got this.  It was flavorful and tasty.  I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it was still good.\n- Chicken ruby: tender and tasty.  Again, this is just average.\n- The prawn mooli was really nice.  It was light and the prawns weren't overcooked. \nOverall, I didn't think there was anything special about the restaurant.  If I wanted exceptional Indian food for lunch, I'd go to Tamarind @ MayFair for lunch.",

I am not a believer in standing in line for good food, especially in London, when there is so many good ones around every corner...but I have stood in line numerous times for this spot. Why? Because if you stand in line, at times they will bring you the most amazing chai to make it worth your while. Now in any other Indian restaurant, you are going to see your usual samosas, pakoras, naan, Tikka masala, etc...sure you will see those here, too, but this restaurant you will offer you things not offered elsewhere. The chili cheese toast for one is delicious...simple, with cheese and chives...I don't know why it is absolutely mind-blowing, but it is. Then, you get to the nitty gritty with the okra that is so crispy and always feels fresh. The roomali roti lives up to it's name by being handkerchief thin that you can inhale five before you realize.\nNow don't forget to go downstairs to the bar and have the bartender whip you up some unique drinks or the very reliably yummy mango lassi. The wait staff could not be nicer. Rain or shine, and I hate the rain, I am willing to wait to eat at this restaurant...now that's saying something!",

                "description": "Trust me when I say the 60 min+ wait is totally worth it! We wanted to enjoy our last meal in London, so I suggested we do Indian since 1. it is popular in London and 2. it is our favorite cuisine to eat. We arrived here on a Monday night at 8:00pm and were told an hour wait. We got in the line and were immediately brought complimentary chai tea while we waited. Once we made it to the front of the line we were invited to have drinks and snacks at the bar downstairs. This was after about 30 minutes of waiting outside. We sat at stools near the bar but decided to just wait until seated to order any alcohol. About 10 minutes after we moved downstairs, we were shown to our dining table. \nOur server was very knowledgeable and happily shared suggestions and recommendations. Everything is served family-style and the portions are smaller so it's recommended 4-5 dishes for 2 people. We started with the lamb samosas, which come 3 per order. The outside was crisp and the lamb was well-seasoned and plentiful inside. We ordered the mahi tikka, adwahi lamb, and the ruby chicken along with 2 orders of garlic naan.\n*Mahi tikka: this is sustainable Asian basa fillet in a subtle yoghurty marinade. This was a nice and light dish and tasted good with the extra lime. Even though this was good it was my least favorite and I let my husband eat most of it.\n*Adwahi lamb: The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. This was deliciously spicy! Really generous portion too. The lamb was well seasoned and tender.\n*Ruby chicken: Tender chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce. This was my favorite dish! Very rich and flavorful and creamy. Best mopped up with garlic naan! Lots of tender, well-flavored chicken mixed in.\n*garlic naan: Some of the best garlic naan I've ever had! We ordered one order with butter and one without. I'm sure you can guess which was preferred at our table! The naan was soft and well-cooked and evenly flavored with garlic.\nWhen visiting London, Indian food is always a solid option and look no further than Dishoom to provide a 5 star dining experience! From getting in line until walking out the door, we both felt well-taken care of and that we were valued customers.",

Upstairs and downstairs seating is available. \n2. What is the wait like?\nOn a Wednesday evening at 7:30 pm, we were quoted a 1 hr wait. We expected that we would have a chance to explore the area after putting our names down, but Dishoom requires that all customers wait in line. To placate hungry customers in line, the restaurant offers warm chai tea and small bites. \n3. What should you order?\nAccording to our waiter, the restaurant's famed dishes are the chicken ruby, prawns, house black daal, and calamari. \nWe ordered several dishes suggested by our waiter including the calamari, chicken ruby, house black daal, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, cheese naan, and garlic naan. The calamari was a nice starter that we enjoyed with the various dips, especially the spicy house sauce. Among the other plates we ordered, our favorite was the chicken ruby, which was pleasantly less creamy than the chicken tikka masala that we are accustomed to but loaded with just as much flavor. It served as the perfect accompaniment to the naan. We liked the other plates that we ordered, though we would have preferred the spicy lamb chops to have been cooked a tad less longer. Overall, we were extremely happy with our meal and left with content bellies. \nDishoom was a fantastic first meal upon our arrival in London, and we would undoubtedly return.",

                "description": "Everyone always said London had some world-class Indian food, but I was skeptical as to how much it outstripped the States in this regard until I actually came. \nDishoom is a wildly popular Indian restaurant with many locations throughout the city. My friend and I chose to visit the Covent Garden one as it was most convenient for us. We secured \"lunch\" reservations for 5:45PM, effectively making this an early dinner (and this is the way to go as they don't take dinner reservations, and the line was out the door for walk ins while we were seated immediately; the lunch and dinner menu are the same).\nWe ordered the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black house daal to share - a greatest hits of the menu, if you will. Everything was phenomenal, with depths of flavor that I never tasted before in Indian food, all melding together with none of the harsh notes that I've sometimes found NYC Indian food suffers from. Somehow even the naan was orders of magnitude better than the ones I've had in the US.\nBoth of us loved the restaurant so much that we had to come back the next morning to try breakfast (and more lunch). We arrived and were seated immediately at ~11:15. My friend and I ordered a keema per eedu, breakfast lassi, and bottomless house chai. Everything was, once again, phenomenal. The keema is quite heavy and comes with two buttered buns. Even something as simple as the chai was great - I'd never understood the appeal of it until I had a glass here.\nOf course, we also had to order off the lunch menu once they started taking orders at 11:45 since it was our last day. For that, we split the roti, chicken ruby (again), and the pau bhaji. Once again, everything was amazing and we cleaned our plates. For dessert, we each had a kulfi, which was a nice, light way to end a large meal.\nPlease bring Dishoom to NYC! Until then, I'll be dreaming about this place.",

We arrived around 7:45 and the wait was a full hour, outdoors. They serve you a nice warm chai tea while waiting, which was lovely. I really wasn't sure what to expect as we peered through the windows watching people eat. It looked rather crowded from the outside peeking in but it's actually huge and there's a whole bottom floor with more seating.\nI took one bite of the curry and completely understood why people wait an hour out in the cold and rain to eat at this place. It was hands down the best curry I've had anywhere in the world, including India and Thailand. I'm usually pretty good at guessing ingredients in dishes but I had no idea what they put in here to make it so amazing. The rest of the food was also very good, including the lentils, which I don't usually like. The lentils had a nice texture, not mushy like what I've had in the past. If we had more time in London, I would have come back here just to eat the curry again- it was that good.",

My friends and family have heard me rave about it for years and I still stand by the fabulous menu! My husband and I visited the covent garden location on a Friday evening back in April - literally during peak dinner hours. I knew we would have about a 2 hour wait so we made sure to have a snack beforehand. Loved that the host outside was handing out piping hot glasses of chai, it helped make the wait in the rain a little better. \nWe were finally seated in the downstairs dining area and it was bustling with people, just as I remember it on Friday evenings. When I was in grad school, dishoom was my weekly indulgence of Indian street food and I had the menu memorized forward and backwards. I liked seeing that most of my favorites were still on the menu - black dal, gunpowder potatoes, paneer tikka and murgh malai. We tried a new dish this time, which I really enjoyed as well, the goan shrimp curry. Everything tasted fresh and so delicious! I still feel like this is some of the best Indian food you can find in London!",

Once we were seated, our server came over to explain the menu to us a bit. Due to the combination of the noise level in the restaurant with the velocity and volume of our sever's voice, I couldn't decipher what he was saying. \nOur food was good. The Mahi Mahi tikka was the best. The Chicken Tikka was super spicy. The server was busy and therefore the customer service lacked. When we were finished, he cleared our plates and we advised him that we didn't want dessert. We waited 20 mins at our seats for our check. We had to track him down to ask for it. We paid cash and were waiting for our change, he took our cash and disappeared for another 10 minutes.

The interior design is well put also - modern vs authenticity.  \nWe both had the bacon naan roll and it was delish!  I had also ordered the fire toast, but it wasn't anything special.  Just toast, but the home-made preserves: pineapple-pink-peppercorn jam, and tangy orange marmalade with star anise was yummy!\nMy friend really loved the dinner menu and wanted me to try AND only another 30 mins till dinner menu, soooooooooooooooooooooooo we decided to stay!!!!  We took our time eating and chatting.  I had ordered the house chai and that was great decision, plus free refills!!  The lassi with fennel was something else, quite refreshing.  \nWhen it was time to order, again, I ordered the Ruby chicken with rice....make that two!!!  We had the same thing again and it did not disappoint.  I truly enjoyed it.  Boy were we stuffed!  But good and satisfying stuffed.  I would love to come back again, but I'm 5600 miles away now! \nThanks for the great experience!",

So this was apparently supposed to be the best Indian place in London and I figured I had to try it on my weekend visit. Got there at 6 pm and the place had a huge line outside. No, they do not let you put your name on the list and go for a stroll. You have to stand in the line, rain, wind or shine. They do bring you chai and sherry while you're waiting though.\nOnce inside, the ambiance was beautiful. They have amazing Indian decor. We ordered the chicken ruby, dal makhani, kheema pav and roomali roti. Every thing was spot on except Chicken ruby. Chicken ruby was sweet for my taste. Service was good and prices were very affordable.",

                "description": "What a lunch feast to remember! Came here with a group of 10 for lunch a couple weeks ago and had the most amazing time. We had originally wanted to come for dinner, but couldn't get a a dinner reservation for any Dishoom in London! But lunch was excellent, and it's nice that they save a good chunk of their tables for walk-ins. Our server was very patient, kind, and attentive. She explained many dishes to us and gave us excellent recommendations. We ordered family style so I got to try a bit of everything. I had the:\nRose & Cardamom Lassi: so good!!! Very refreshing and I loved the rose flavor. A perfect complement to all the spices. \nCheese Naan: oh my gosh, so much cheesy goodness!!! The cheese was plentiful and beautifully melted and the naan had a nice moisture to it. Definitely wish we had ordered more of this.\nChicken Ruby: yum!!!! This is so much less creamy and better than the chicken tikki masala I am used to getting in the States. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so delicious.\n \nAwadhi Lamb: some of my friends loved this, but It wasn't one of my favorites. The lamb flavor was a little too strong (does that even make sense?) for me.\nKeema Pau: same feelings as with the Awadhi--I just couldn't get behind the lamb here.\nDishoom Slaw: a little too much sauce, but it was nice to have something to cool down my mouth.\nBowl of Greens: greens! Yay! Simple bowls of vegetables that went well with all the sauce and meat we had.\nBlack House Daal: people loved this dish, and they're known for making it. I personally thought it was too sweet.\nOkra Fries: reminded me of some Southern-fried food. A little too oily (but I always feel this way about fried vegetables), but nice to nibble on.\nDishoom Calamari: this was delicious! Nice, light, a little sweet, and with the tiniest of kicks to get your senses going.\nPau Bhaji: solid vegetarian dish. Loved the simple flavoring. Not as much of a fan of the bread, but that's probably because the Cheese Naan blew me away.\nFantastic service, great ambiance, and very affordable prices. Can't wait to come back!",

I'll most likely come back just as a follow up as I clearly must have missed something. But $7.50 USD for a piece of naan with bacon inside seems ridiculous. My fiancé ended up getting the Bombay omelette which was a little more filing and interesting but I was completely underwhelmed by the bacon naan wrap. I did observe other people get the bacon with egg which seems to give you a piece of naan that's twice of big. Looking back, perhaps I got the wrong item but the bacon naan is the suggested favorite on their menu.\nI will comment that their service was super on point though and that the atmosphere and decor were very nice and fitting.",

However we waited only about 40 minutes and was seated. While in line we chatted with a family from Seattle who had been there and loved it, and highly recommend the fried okra appetizer. They were right about the restaurant being worth the wait and about the okra! We ordered Chicken Ruby which was like chicken Tikka masala, and it was super delicious. We also ordered another curry and it was good, but not as good as the orange curry. We also ordered lamb and chicken tandoori and both were flavorful and tender without being dry. The plain and garlic naan were great to dip the curry. Overall a delicious experience, definitely recommended and definitely will return next time we are in London!",

Dishoom was one of the highlights of my trip to London and, the food and service I received were worth the long lines.\nAs everyone else is saying, I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. I came a little before 6:00 pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes - mind you, I was by myself. The waitresses will also provide you with a little hot drink (chai tea?) while you wait outside. Good thing some fellow Americans were also waiting in line; they told me what to try and order as I had no idea what to get. They recommended me the Chicken Ruby with some Naan and a side of Basmati Rice. I also ordered a delicious and sweet Mango & Fennel Lassi. Everything was tasty. The Chicken was flavorful, rich, and deliciously spiced. The Naan and Rice complemented the Chicken and the sauce perfectly. Oh, and the dips...! Amazing. For 1 person, that was a lot of food. Plus, the service was exceptional. \nWould I recommend it? Of course. If you're visiting London for the first time, Dishoom is definitely a place to try!",

Now orginally my wife and i were going to head to DUM biryani house but saw the greaaat reviews and number of reviews for DISHOOM. So i ll go thru pros and cons\nPROS- ambience is amazing. The lighting the old indians photos were superb touch\nThe cocktails honestly were the best part of the entire experience.  I had an excellent manhattan and my wife a colada. So no issues there. Service was great. All employees were friendly.  \nTo the food. Best dish we had was the chicken tikka off the grill. Tender and flavorful and with the chutney selection you could make as spicey or mild as needed\nMattar paneer was good with excellent flavors and one of there signature dishes the black dhal was on point i must say.\nCons- spicy lamb chops, first werent spicy and second they were overcooked. Cmon man there should be some red. \nWe also got the signature prawn moilee in a yellow curry and it was just OK man.  I mean the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I wouldnt even say they were prawns. It wasnt bland but i did have high expectations. My wife ordered some coleslaw and felt the yogurt in their mightve been old. \nTo summarize id say its a good place overall but if your expecting curries like some tikka masala vindaloo or saag .. yea not here. I mean im torn, i think people will enjoy the overall experience in general but really if youve been to other indian restuarants around the world this isnt even top 5 food wise. \nGo enjoy and have drinks and other small plates and judge for urself",

Went for a late dinner and arrived around 9:25pm. Even at that hour there was a line 30 minutes deep, but the wait didn't seem so bad as the friendly staff handed out complimentary fruit (grapes and dates) and drinks (chai and mint teas). \nUpon getting to the front of the line, you are given a buzzer and directed downstairs to the bar, where you can order drinks and snacks while you wait. Got the Bollybellini, a tasty fruity concoction, and waited no more than a few moments until the host seated us. They were more than accommodating when my companion and I wanted to switch to a different (read: bigger) table.\nOur server Ali was as friendly as could be and even gave us some great recommendations/suggestions. Between us two, we got the vegetable samosas to start (which we ended up getting an extra order of halfway through our meal -- yes, it was THAT good!) along with the Dishoom chicken tikka, spicy lamb chops, Butter-Bhatta, the Black House Daal, garlic naan, and steamed basmati rice. I could have just gotten the Daal with basmati rice and I would have been a happy camper, tbh. But really, everything was delicious and very flavorful! The garlic naan could have used a little more garlic flavor, but other than that, everything was superb! \nAside from the great food and very attentive, helpful and friendly staff, the prices are reasonable. I would note that this place is more on the trendy side and the size of the dishes are similar to tapas style. Would definitely come back here the next time I'm in London! Already itching to try the Chicken Ruby and the Mahi Tikka. Again, Ali was an amazing server if you're lucky to get him, and really the whole staff was just top notch!!",

With hype comes the slight chance of disappointment if it doesn't deliver, but guys, the Dishoom hype is real! \nWe ordered the ruby chicken, which by the way, was so good we ordered two! It was basically a flavor explosion of zesty tomato and coconut creaminess. We paired that with cheese naan which you should absolutely order. \nWe finished that off with the okra fries ( which I would trade for French fries any day, and that's saying a lot!). The entire meal at Dishoom was so memorable that I still dream about it from time to time :)",

                "description": "I didn't think Indian food would one of my favorite meals in London, but it was! Dishoom is London's first Bombay cafe, and it lives up to the hype.\nMy friends and I arrived around Dishoom on an afternoon around 2 PM, and luckily, we only had to wait about 30 minutes.\nWe ordered the following:\n- Pau Bhaji (mashed vegetables with pau buns) - This was our appetizer to start, and it was delicious! It was flavorful with a slightly spicy kick, and it came with hot buttered buns to dip in the mashed veggies. \n- Spicy lamb chops - Deliciously spiced and well-cooked! The lamb was tender yet crispy on the edges, and it didn't taste gamey at all to me!\n- Dishoom Chicken Tikka - Chicken tikka is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so we had to try this. It was a little sweeter than I expected, but still good nonetheless. \n- House black daal - This was like a thick and hearty lentil soup. Creamy with great flavors. \n- Plain naan, garlic naan, cheese naan - Naan is a MUST at any Indian restaurant. They were all good, though the cheese was interesting since it's not a traditional naan flavor. I do wish the garlic naan tasted more garlicky and the cheese naan had more cheese though. \n- Roomali roti - The roti was recommended to us to pair with the chicken. I didn't think the roti was anything too special though. Texture-wise, it was like a super thin tortilla. I preferred pairing all the dishes with the naan.\n- Yogurt - Another recommendation from the waiter. This helped cut some of the intensity of the otherwise strong flavors of the other dish, so I thought it was a nice balance.\n- House sauces - The waiter brought out 3 house chutneys/dipping sauces (tamarind, mint, sweet chili?), which were delicious. The chili one paired REALLY well with the naan and other dishes - so much so that was had to ask for more!\nWe also ordered the Bombay presidency punch to share (a bowl of jaggery, lime, Darjeeling tea and Ceylon Arrack), and it was amazing! It may be a bit dangerous, since it tastes so good and refreshing that you might just forget it's alcoholic. Our waiter actually forgot to put our order in until we asked halfway through our meal. By the time we got it, we were almost done eating, we so just sat there a while sipping some \"punch.\" \nOverall, it was a fun, delicious, and flavorful meal with great ambiance and excellent service too! If you're in the area, I'd recommend having a meal here!",

                "description": "My husband and I had lunch at this location the other day.  We arrived just before noon.  We did not have a reservation, but the hostess said that was no problem.  She would seat us at the end of a long table for 10 people, but said she would need it back by 1:30.  This was not an issue for us, but it did seem a bit odd.  I've only been to a few places that have told me I can have a table for a limited amount of time, but most of the time it is because the restaurant is so amazing that they are overbooked, so although in one sense it bothered me, in another sense I was now even more excited to eat here because, dang this place must be good.  \nFor drinks my husband ordered a watermelon cooler which he described as a watermelon mojito, no alcohol.  I was debating between a chai and a lassi.  I love both, but I have a tendency to fill up on lassis before my food arrives.  However, there was a guy at another table with this gorgeous pink drink.  When I asked the server what it was and he said the rose and cardamom lassi, I knew I had to have it.  To be honest, it was my favorite thing I consumed at this meal.  It was heavenly.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and the a gorgeous flavor of roses, but it did sort of fill me up.  \nFor entree my husband ordered the lamb chops.  He saw a thousand things he wanted to order on the menu and was having a terrible time deciding, but once I started showing him pictures on Yelp he knew that is what he wanted and he said they were incredible.  I'm not super into red meat right now.  My pregnancy has largely turned me off to most red meat,  but they did look gorgeous.\n  I ordered the chicken ruby.  Here's my issue, it was one of only 2 curries on the menu.  I mean it is kind of cool to go to an Indian restaurant that has different stuff and when we were in India most restaurants had curries, and tandoori, and biriyani, but I really felt like 2 curries was a super limited selection.  There was no korma, xacuti, vindaloo, madras, etc.  For my personal taste this lack of selection of sauces was a bummer.  \nThe chicken ruby was very good, but far from the best I've ever had.  It tasted like butter chicken to me.  The spicy flavor didn't kick in until the very last minute.  I ordered it with basmati rice which was fine, but in no way special, and roti, which again was fine, but not special.  \nWith his lamb my husband ordered the black daal which everyone raved about and we found to be lackluster.  These were far from the best lentils we've ever had.  \nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit odd too.  We sat upstairs and I am glad we did.  When I went downstairs it was like a whole different restaurant.  It was loud, crowded and cramped.  The upstairs was a bit like that, but not to that extent.  \nFinally, the prices were a bit steep as well.  After, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, this was the second most expensive meal we ate in London, so it is pretty pricey.  We definitely enjoyed it, but I don't think we enjoyed it that much and for all those who say this place is worth the wait, I am going to have to politely disagree.  Again, it is good, but it is not outstanding.  Perhaps I am spoiled by my vast selection of Indian at home or by the fact that I have traveled and spent time in India.  I had really high expectations for Indian food in London and this didn't really meet them.",

Definitely a crowd favorite this one. At least I can say I've eaten Indian food while in London. \nBut then again, I do believe I've eaten my fair share of really, really great Indian dishes in my neck of the woods (that is, Phoenix, Arizona). Go figure. \nThis is a nice place to take your date to, but I\nimagine you'd be good enough to look for better, less expensive Indian places soon after that first date (if you and your companion hit it off and both appreciate Indian food at its best).",

My fiancé is not a fan of Indian food so that was another reason we didn't come here for dinner. We did walk by on a Friday night and there was a queue to get in and it seemed like quite a long one. \nAnyway, I ordered a chocolate chai since it was a little brisk this morning. It was perfectly warm and it had all the aromas that you would look for in a chai... if drinks could give you a warm fuzzy hug, this drink would be the one to do it. \nFor our meals, we went with the naan wraps with egg. I got the sausage one and he got bacon (extra crispy). While it was good, it was not anything to write home to. His bacon was not crispy to start with - maybe some burnt edges. I gave him half of my sausage naan roll and I got half of his bacon naan roll. \nI want to come back here for dinner one day as I really enjoy Indian food. In the meantime, I will have to convince Brian's tastebuds that they like Indian food.",

                "description": "Our party of four came around on a Saturday at around 6, expecting a wait. The line didn't look too long but in reality, it was a 1.5 hour wait. Their waiting system is actually pretty orderly. It's like getting into a nightclub. They have ropes (non-velvet) and have people line up. I'm not sure if this is just to make it look like it's poppin', because there were quite a few empty tables inside. Maybe they were for people who made reservations (only available for groups of 6+). While you're waiting, a waitress comes around and gives you small samples of hot chai tea latte. It was a bit too sweet for me, but it was a very nice gesture, especially since it was windy and chilly that day.\nFinally, once you get inside the exclusive Dishoom, you'll wait about 15 more minutes while they prepare your table. That's how they get you to order a drink at the bar downstairs. So I had the Chilitini (Luksusowa vodka with pomegranate, lemon juice and chilli liqueur) and for 7.50, it was pretty inexpensive for a cocktail (compared to NYC, anyway). I really liked the flavor and the bite that the chili liquer gave it, but I wish there was a bit more vodka in it. I guess I'm just used to stronger NYC cocktails, where they don't measure out the liquor.\nOnto the food. Here is what we ordered:\nGarlic Naan - our waiter recommended two orders for four people, but I'm glad that we didn't go with his suggestion. It was very oily, so it would have been difficult for one person to eat more than a certain amount of it. Could have used more garlic.\nLamb Boti Kabab (pieces of tender lamb marinated with red chilli, garlic and ginger) - the flavor was good but the lamb was pretty dry. It definitely needed some sauce with it.\nHouse Black Daal (Indian spiced lentils) - this was like a soupy bean dip. Not my favorite but it went well with the garlic naan\nChicken Ruby (chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce) - this was probably the star of the show, as it seems like the majority here would agree. The sauce is great (again, especially with the naan), and the chicken wasn't dry.\nNote - none of the 'entrees' come with any sides so you'll want to order naan or rice to go with it. The portions are on the smaller side so it's best to order a bunch of dishes and just share them. That way, you'll get to have a great variety.\nI don't know how packed their other locations get. I also don't know if I would wait another 1.5 hours to eat here again. But I do know that it was a great London Indian food experience.",

As visitors in London, we had to experience this popular place for ourselves and I wouldn't say I regret it at all. Best Indian/Pakistani cuisine in London hands-down. Food was delicious-perfectly seasoned, fresh and authentic. We got the \"recommended popular\" dishes- if it is your first time I'd go with their recs too. Chicken Ruby, Garlic Naan, Spicy Lamb Chops and a beef/goat curry (forgot the name but ask them for the popular curry dish). All the items were exceptional and satisfying.

It was a chilly November night and I waited outside in a short queue to get in. I think I waited about 30min but I heard it was worth it so I stayed. I know other reviews said that the staff came out with fresh hot chai to keep the guests warm as they wait but no chai that night. \nFinally inside lead to go downstairs by the bar area which I find really intimate and fun and dim. The downstairs also had a dining area versus the main floor. There at the bar, another 10-15min until they call you for the table. It was quick for me because I was dining solo.\nOrdered the usual mango lassi, chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, garlic naan and dessert. UFF. SO. GOOD. The staff were very attentive of me and other guests. Probably ended up spending 40 quids but I still love it! Everyone should gooo! I know I will the next time I'm in London!",

We didn't end up having it that night since I soon realized how popular of a place Dishoom is but upon entering and smelling the wonderful aromas of food I decided that we absolutely HAD to come back to try this place before we left for home!\nWe were able to get a quick seat coming to this location for lunch around 11 and we ordered basically everything that was popular on the menu and that our waiter suggested! We got the chicken ruby, pau bhaji (10/10) would recommend, garlic naan, house black daal, and lamb shanks (not a lamb fan usually, but would also def recommend. the pomegranate seeds are a unique touch). for the three of us, we honestly planned to order so much more food since it is served tapas style but our waiter warned us (so sorry I forgot his name but he was wonderful!) that it would be a lot and he was definitely right, we were SO full!\nThe decor of this place was adorable and everything is so nicely presented. it's also priced really well for the food you get!

Hands down the best restaurant I went to in London.\nTwo friends and I ordered the garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka masala, black house dal, chicken ruby, lamb and vegetable samosas, a bowl of greens, and a few sides of basmati rice. I also got the Bombay colada - one of the most unique and tasty drinks I've ever had. A little spicy and super refreshing with a good kick. All the food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable; our waitress was chatty and funny and recommended several of the above dishes to us.\nMoving on to the main dishes - so impressed! Out of all the entrees, I would recommend the dal the most - very meaty and flavorful. The chicken dishes were incredibly tangy and spicy (ask them to tone down the spice if you're not into that). The garlic naan was warm and buttery and absolutely delicious! As was the roti - it absorbed the flavor of the previous dishes well and came with three very tasty sauces. Great samosas (I liked the vegetable more than the lamb) and uniquely crunchy / salty / flavorful greens. Overall everything was very very good and prices were reasonable, especially for London. It's a fun place to eat with a lot of people since dishes are pretty small - grab some friends and try out a bunch of things! \nOh, and make a reservation in advance - it gets super busy.

                "description": "When we searched \"Best Indian food in London\" on Yelp, Dishoom seemed like a no-brainer since it boasted over 1000 five star reviews. After learning the wait time for a table was over an hour and a half, we thought \"If people are willing to wait over an hour and a half for a meal, this food must be outta this world! No one would be stupid enough to waste almost 2 hours of their life standing in line for mediocre food!\"\nWe debated whether we should stay or go, but the curiosity of why anyone would wait so long for a meal got the better of us and we decided to wait it out. There were several hostesses who put your name on the waitlist and bring you hot chai while you stand in the cold London streets. Exactly 1h30m later we were ushered inside. The restaurant was simply decorated, elegant, classy, but simple. I was surprised at what a well oiled machine it all seemed. I must have counted at least 5 hosts/hostesses (at least)! Over 20 servers, and hundreds of guests. We were guided downstairs where the ambiance wasn't as pretty, and after 1h30m of waiting we were seated by the staircase (where guests came in and out of), not the best start. My expectations are now really high given that I agreed to wait so long. We ordered a spicy shrimp dish with tamarind sauce, the paneer tika masala, naan, and the jackfruit biryani. The spicy shrimp dish, though a tad bit over salted, tasted delicious, and the sweet tangyness of the tamarind chutney made it a really flavorful dish. Unfortunately all the other dishes we ordered were underwhelming. The paneer tika lacked spices, it was flavorless, and other than the fact that we were eating cheese --- cause who doesn't love cheese, it wasn't very special at all, and it was even a little dry. The naan was neither bad nor good. It was just your every day naan that you can get anywhere (without having to wait over 2hrs for it). But worst of all was the Biryani. It was overpriced dry and flavorless rice, with very scarce pieces of equally flavorless jackfruit. The service was also all over the place. Although the host staff was friendly, our waitress was flustered and barely came to our table, we had to ask for water several times before it was brought to us. Lastly they boast to offer \"unlimited chai\" but when you're paying almost $5 per chai, it BETTER be unlimited refills. \nUnder normal circumstances (meaning, if I hadn't had to wait in line for 1h30m, and then another 30m to get our food), I would given Dishoom 3 stars. Had the food been exceptional, I would have had NO hesitation rating it 5 stars, however, due to the mediocrity of it all, add the extensive waiting period, i would argue that 2 stars is a fair rating. As we were seated at our table, we heard many Americans chatting at several tables nearby and we realized Dishoom is more of a hyped up tourist trap than a legit establishment for fine Indian fare. I encourage folks to read The Guardian review of Dishoom (by Jay Rayner) before waiting 2hrs for an overpriced Indian meal. If you want to stand in line, then go ahead! But we'll be opting for a place in Southall with better food and no wait!",

I wasn't a huge Indian food lover, but that's because we get a different version in the Western world.  I'd recommend asking your helpful server for suggestions - many sections have highlighted dishes and we ordered all of them to try.  The cocktails were fresh and yummy as well with a nice wine selection by the glass.  However , we did order the naan garlic bread, followed by the cheese naan ‼Save room for dessert - the chocolate custard was divine.  \nPart II- breakfast was a no wait / walk in at 10am!  We had the bacon naan and chai tea which was amazing!!",

I don't know if we were lucky or they usually over estimate their wait time but our wait was only about half an hour. Their dishes had so much flavor but my favorite was probably the chicken ruby, bowl of greens, and the lamb chop. I could probably do without the gun powder potatoes though. Thought I'd get really flavorful potatoes but it was just baked potato with a dipping sauce that didn't do much for it. I have to say their service was top notch! Our server Laura (I believe) was such a sweet heart who really took the time to explain the dishes and provide us with information and recommendations. She made us feel welcome and that's more than I can for a lot of our experience here in London.",

                "description": "This place 100% lives up to its expectations! As soon as I told friends I was going to London, every single person told me I must visit Dishoom. Luckily, I have a friend who lives in the area and she made a reservation for us as soon as she found out I was visiting! \nWe ended up getting to the restaurant about half an hour before our reservation and just thought we'd check in to see if our table is ready. They directed us to the bar while they got our table ready. It was only about 10-15 minute later that we were seated at our table. Service was out of this world from the very moment we walked in! \nWe ordered the chicken tikka, paneer tikka, black daal, pau bhaji, gunpowder potatoes, chilli cheese toast, jackfruit biryani, raita, garlic naan, and rumali roti. All for only 3 people - we just couldn't resist! Everything was so delicious - I don't think I could pick a favorite. I will say though that I'm not really a fan of daal, but their black daal was pretty delicious - even to me. Something that I wasn't really expecting to like, but loved was the jackfruit biryani. I've never had it before, or really any dish with jackfruit in it so I wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out to be what I probably ate the most of! I highly recommend trying it. \nTIP: MAKE A RESERVATION! I walked by the restaurant a few times during my trip and every single time there was a looooong line outside. I would have hated to be one of those people waiting in the cold. If you like Indian food and you're going to be in London, you're going to want to go here - just go ahead and make the reservation. :)",

We were given a wait time of 40 minutes. What's amazing is that once a spot opens at the bar, they let you wait there and you have the chance to order appetizers and drinks while you wait for your table. Luckily, our wait time was way shorter than they said and we got seated in 20 minutes!\nWe had vada pav, calamari, and samosas as appetizers. For entrees we had two orders of the chicken curry, and order of daal, and the lamb biryani. Everything was absolutely delicious! My favorite dish was definitely the chicken curry. The curry itself reminds me of tikka masala because it's rich and creamy. The chicken was very tender. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere.",

                "description": "Last year, Dishoom was named as the best restaurant in Britain according to Yelp. Unsurprisingly, the wait at this Bombay-inspired café averages an hour. While it is quite long, they do offer hot tea (chai and mint) as you queue up. Grab a glass - it'll come in handy as the chilly evening sets in. It's also both free and delicious, so there really isn't any reason not to.\nFor being such a casual place with a reasonably priced menu, the ambiance here is quite upscale. To boot, the attentive waiters running around with smiles on their faces make for great service. They bang those dishes out blazing fast. I received my order within 10 minutes of placing it.\nOn the flip side, I think that the food here is a tad overhyped. While they do serve very solid Indian fare, I was not quite blown away as I hoped. Per my server's recommendation, I ordered the Chicken Ruby, the House Black Daal, and the Garlic Naan. All very good, none particularly outstanding. What actually wowed me the most was the mint & coriander sauce that was served on the side as a dip. That stuff was to-die for, so make sure you at least give it a taste!\n**UPDATE**\nSince writing my review, I've been to Dishoom several times more, trying both their breakfast and all-day menus. Here's the lowdown on everything I've tasted.\nBreakfast:\nBacon Naan Roll (£5.90) - 5 stars\nBacon & Egg Naan Roll (£5.20) - 5 stars\nBig Bombay (£11.90) - 4 stars\nAppetizers:\nPau Bhaji (£4.50) - 5 stars\nOkra Fries (£4.50) - 5 stars\nVegetable Samosas (£4.20) - 3 stars\nEntrees:\nJackfruit Biryani (£9.50) - 5 stars\nMahi Tikka (£8.70) - 4 stars\nMurgh Malai (£8.50) - 4 stars\nMasala Prawns (£11.90) - 4 stars\nSali Boti (£12.50 half / £16.90 full) - 4 stars\nDishoom Chicken Tikka Roll (£7.50) - 4 stars\nChicken Ruby (£10.50) - 3 stars\nHouse Black Daal (£6.20) - 3 stars\nAwadhi Lamb Biryani (£11.50) - 3 stars\nDishoom Chicken Tikka (£8.50) - 3 stars\nSides:\nCheese Naan (£3.70) - 5 stars\nGarlic Naan (£3.20) - 4 stars\nPlain Naan (£2.90) - 4 stars\nRaita (£3.20) - 4 stars\nDrinks:\nHouse Chai (£2.70) - 5 stars\nChocolate Chai (£3.20) - 4 stars\nViceroy's Old-Fashioned (£9.50) - 4 stars\nRose & Cardamom Lassi (£3.90) - 4 stars\nMango & Fennel Lassi (£3.90) - 3 stars\nDesserts:\nBun Maska Pudding (£5.60) - 4 stars\nPistachio Kulfi on a Stick (£3.70) - 2 stars",

I liked that the wait seemed fair (followed the sequence in which people arrived) and they handed out hot tea while waiting. If you are waiting outside in line, they eventually move you to the bar where you may wait another 15-30 minutes. \nLuckily the food was worth the wait! We had their house dal and chicken ruby with rice and naan. This was one of my fiancés first Indian food experiences so I told him if he did not like the food here then he would probably not like Indian food anywhere. Thankfully we both loved it!\nFor dessert we had the chocolate pudding with vanilla chili ice cream. They were definitely the perfect complement to each other as I don't think I'd enjoy the chili flavor of the ice cream without the richness of the pudding.\nI'd highly recommend coming here!",

From our yelp search, we made reservations here.\nTwo stories and we would recommend reservations given how popular it is. We decided to be brave and order a bunch of things we never tried. \nPAU BHAJI (A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered, home-made bun, Chowpatty Beach style. No food is more Bombay. (V)(S)4.50) - This was boxed on their menu and I wanted some veggies. This was our favorite item! It was so flavorful! Can't believe its veggies!\nAWADHI LAMB (The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. (S)10.50) - My husband loves BIRYANI so we ordered this. We ordered yogurt to go with it. They gave us a big bowl of it! The yogurt was really refreshing and delicious but unfortunately the biryani was so-so. Not as flavorful. \nHOUSE BLACK DAAL (A Dishoom signature dish -- dark, rich, deeply flavoured. It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. (V)5.90) - Also boxed on their menu. It was our second favorite item. It is made from what I think is mung beans (or similar). You don't like mung beans then I wouldn't order this. \nDISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA (A family recipe, using a marinade of sweet vinegar, not yoghurt. Laced with ginger juice, turmeric, garlic and green chilli. (S)7.90) - As close to the famous chicken tikka marsala you will get here. Came with 4 big pieces of chicken. Its not as creamy but good. It was a bit sweet for me. \nGarlic naan- we got one. You can get it buttered or not. It was good. \nOverall, it was a good meal. Unfortunately, I don't eat Indian food that often so I am no expert. Flavors were very different but good from the Indian food I've had in the States.\nPlenty of restrooms that is pretty nice.",

The wait for two on a bank holiday, sunny weekend was average, but the queue kept moving. People have mentioned the lemonade that they serve in the queue: it's true, but it's salty.\nAfter being seated, my husband and I ordered the greens, basmati rice, roomati roll, the minced lamb and the daal. Hands down the best was the black daal and the greens. I could have eaten a whole bowl of the greens myself! The sauces and spices with each dishes are very carefully balanced and flavorful-- nothing was overbearing from the other and everything on the table was complimentary to the other entrees. \nAfter a long day of leisure outside and exercise, I highly recommend ordered one entree and one bread/rice per person. We threw in the greens for color. \nFantastic and we will be back!",

                "description": "I had a great experience at Dishoom.  I was visiting from the USA, where we have plenty of excellent Indian restaurants, but knowing how integral Indian cuisine is to the UK culinary world (chicken tikka masala is an unofficial dish of the UK!) I just had to try an Indian restaurant while I was here.  Dishoom came highly recommended by several UK Yelpers, so one night after work I made the trek to Covent Garden to check this place out.\nUpon reaching Dishoom, I nearly turned away in dismay.  There was a huge line out the door, and I was told that it would be an hour wait.  This was at roughly 7 PM.  I decided to hop in the queue anyways, and I'm glad that I did, because it only took 25 minutes instead of the estimated hour.  While waiting in line, the restaurant offered its waiting patrons free cups of hot chai tea - much appreciated, especially on a cold London evening.\nOnce I finally got seated, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambience of Dishoom.  Hip, modern, and fancy... yet all the food items on their menu were very reasonably priced.  Upon my server's suggestion, I ordered a bowl of their signature Black House Daal, a bowl of their Chicken Ruby curry, and some Roomali Roti bread to mop up all the sauces.\nThe Black House Daal was excellent.  Very rich and hearty, with some nice texture and flavor from the lentils.  I'm sure there was an ungodly amount of butter in it, but it was oh so creamy and delicious.  The Chicken Ruby was quite tasty as well (the chicken was amazingly tender, the curry itself had a nice balance of sweet, spicy, and tomatoe-y) but I prefer my curry on the spicy side, so I wished it had packed a little more heat.  The Roomali Roti was a great choice - nice and fluffy and light, a perfect complement to wipe away all the curry and daal.\nMy server, Ali, was a total star.  Funny, welcoming, prompt, and professional.  He did a great job with all his recommendations and made my meal excellent.  Dishoom management - if you're reading this, give Ali a raise! (or at least a high-five).\nSo why only 4 stars?  The food was great, and I loved the Daal in particular, but I guess hearing all the hype for Dishoom, I had expected a little more.  Don't get me wrong - it was still an excellent meal, maybe just not worth the wait (even a shortened 25 minute one).\nOVERALL: 4/5.  Great Indian food - very reasonable prices, especially given its location in Covent Garden.  Very long lines, so you really have to be craving Indian food to make it worthwhile, but I really enjoyed my experience here.",

I wouldn't even try getting in for a pre-theater dinner, but thankfully they accept breakfast reservations and they held ours even though we arrived just after the 15-minute window. Breakfast at Dishoom is always a pleasure, but until this meal, I thought it ended abruptly at 11:45 a.m., the last seating time for the meal. Not so, at least here on this day: They kept bringing us chai long after that time and after we'd finished our meals and settled in to read the papers. We finally, reluctantly got up to visit the nearby Portrait Gallery and National Gallery.",

                "description": "Dishoom brings a freshness and uniqueness when it comes to Indian restaurants. The decor is thoughtful and intentional- it pulls through all of the fun and interesting things I saw growing up as an American Indian. All of the toiletries, movie references like the word Dishoom itself. It's a phrase like \"pow\" scene in superhero comics associated with a fighting scenes in Indian films. So it's fun, nostalgic and curious to be in the place. The food is also an elevated experience - the food options I'd say are classic choices - Phav Bhaji, Samosas, Matar paneer, etc. they taste really good though and have an extra pop. Drinks are great. I like their Bellini.",

This was our fault, we just stumbled upon this place and showed up without reservations - make reservations! When we got in the place is really cool, it has an old time hipster decor and we ate downstairs which was less busy than the upstairs area. However, we were right next to the people to our left and right, almost felt like they were eating with us! But the food was really good, just be prepared for smaller portions (we ordered naan, rice and the black Dal in addition to our plates) I don't eat spicy food that often, so I ordered the least spicy thing and it was still pretty hott - but delicious. The black dal was by far the best, we put it on everything, dipped our bread in it, and it took a bit of the spice away when your mouth got too hott (highly recommend getting this). Cool place, very authentic! Drinks are also very interesting (but pricey) - the bartender kicks butt",

We came in around 2:45pm local on a Friday, so it was a short wait...but after ordering the food (with some recommendations from the server), it was completely worth it. Specifically, the Chicken Ruby (their 'makhani' style dish) was off the chain, the House Black Daal was so so tasty, and the Lamb Boti Kabab was perfectly seasoned - extremely balanced and still juicy. Even the garlic naan was freshly glistening with butter!\nThe only slight disappointment was the Prawn Koliwada - I think we expected something slightly different, and while it wasn't bad once the main dishes came out, we completely ignored it and crushed everything. \nThis place is so so good!",

I don't even like Indian food, but I knew I had to try Indian being in London, and this place did not disappoint.\nGreat location in Covent Garden just down the street from Leicester Square tube station.  Kid/baby friendly (though they make you store your folding strollers/pushchairs at the front).  No wait without a reservation for a weekday lunch, but at dinnertime I saw queues outside starting at 5:30.  They had free chai for those in line to temper the wait though!\nEverything we had was absolutely delicious:\n* Rose Lassi with cardamom - so mild, fragrant, creamy and just lovely.\n* House Black Daal - their specialty!  the lentil dip is rich and flavourful\n* Lamb Boti Kabab - we had this with the black daal and raita; you can't go wrong with lamb in my books\n* Jackfruit Biryani - my favourite dish, the jackfruit added a bit of sweetness and was quite light\n* Raita - creamy and cooling mint/yogurt/cucumber sauce that went well with the lamb and jackfruit dishes\n* Chicken Ruby - tender chicken an a bit of a spicy kick\n* Garlic naan - nice and both chewy and crispy\nPrices were definitely reasonable.  Service was knowledgeable and quick.  Downside is that I will never be able to eat Indian food ever again because I now have impossibly high standards!",

We were quickly moved into the basement where the bar was...not much seating but packed and cozy. \nOnto our food. We decided to yolo it and order pretty much one from each section. Great decisions made that night ;)!!\nGARLIC NAAN 2.20 -soft and fluffy naan bread with garlic flavors floating out while you eat. GET IT!\nSTEAMED BASMATI RICE 2.20-typical rice..I got it mixed up with the yellow rice...but this does pair well with the curry dishes.\nOKRA FRIES 3.70 -deep fried and a tad oily.\nPAU BHAJI 3.90-super soft warm buns meant to be dipped in this veggie paste?...it was mouthwateringly tasty.\nGUNPOWDER POTATOES 5.90-chunks of potatoes mixed with spices and a hint of lime juice. It was a lifesaver when we got hungry in the middle of the night and decided to eat the leftovers. \nCHICKEN RUBY 8.2-not your typical curry flavor.

I'm sure you could close your eyes and point to any random dish on the menu, and it would be delicious. We ordered lamb biryani, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, black daal, and garlic naan.

We had less than 15 minutes to order from the breakfast/brunch menu, but were not allowed to order from the lunch menu for nearly 30 minutes. Reminded me a bit of my childhood, going to McDonald's and driving up to the drive-thru window and finding out that you were either too early for the lunch menu or just missed the breakfast items by 3 minutes.\nWe opted to share a popular breakfast item, the bacon naan roll with the house chai, and stick around to be one of the first to order from the lunch menu. By the time we received and consumed the bacon naan roll it was indeed time for lunch.\nHaving already a base of food in our stomachs we didn't over order, which seemed like it could have been easy to do considering the extensive menu and the desire to want to try everything. We ended up going with some Dishoom staples, the black house daal (lentil curry), the chicken ruby curry, and some garlic naan and roomali roti to soak up some of the curry goodness.\nWe enjoyed both curries and the accompanying chutneys with our roti and naan. And, in the end, we felt like we came at a good time - we were able to try a delicious popular brunch item and beat the lunch queue that grew quite quickly at 12:00pm.",

                "description": "So, in advance of going to London, I was told to go to Dishoom as it was the best Indian restaurant. Since I was hearing this from another Indian person who is family, I felt I had to go if it was possible. Considering this location is right near Trafalgar Square, it was quite perfect to stop by in our travels.\nI was told in advance that the restaurant doesn't take reservations. Apparently it does. We arrived and were told there was a 40-minute wait. So, we put our name on the list, said screw it, and just walked around the general area. When we returned 30 minutes later, our name had already been called and they moved on. It was an annoying start. So we had to wait another 40 minutes that was actually 30 on their patio before being entered into Dishoom.\nWe waited for a little while longer in their bar area before being seated. \nThe vibe in Dishoom is pretty cool. It's packed and we were seated with other guests at long family-style tables. \nOkay, let me get to the point: the food is some of the best Indian food I've ever had at a restaurant. The house black daal is unbelievable. They claim it is \"cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony\" and you can taste the preparation. The harmony is delightful. For that alone, and at 6 pounds, it is worth going. The other items I got were the okra fries and the paneer tikka, both were delightful as well and I'm sure the meat options are good too for those interested.\nYou could easily break your wallet if your eyes get too big for your stomach as everything looks and is delicious. However, for 2 people, we simply ordered these 3 items and garlic naan and it sufficed in the late afternoon after a long day of walking. To me, it was certainly manageable pricing for quite good food and ambiance in London.\nI still will rate Dishoom 5 stars but there were two downfalls. I would say the reservation and seating situation was just a little unclear and odd given the popularity of the restaurant. I also think the service was a bit odd at times. I mean it's odd for me as an Indian person to have a white guy tell me about Indian dishes, but hey, that's just me and I know that's his job. But, more so, our server just kind of disappeared at one point without telling us and another server seemed to have no choice but to start serving us and handle our bill when she realized that guy was just gone. \nBut, the reservations/service situation aside, Dishoom was that good that it didn't matter. You should definitely check it out if in London and especially because I'd expect as a tourist you'd be visiting this busy area of the city at some point anyway.",

I waited an hour and half to be seated but while you wait they give you yummy indian tea (chai) and mint tea. Once we got inside I was so impressed with the ambience it's completely different from what you would expect from an indian restaurant. I ordered the famous house lentils, naan, lamb boti, chicken ruby, and rose/cardamom lassi. Everything was good. When I go again I don't think I'll get the lamb boti. I thought it was okay. But everything else was spot on. If you love lassi you have to try the rose and cardamom lassi, you won't be disappointed.",

I over-ordered intentionally so I could try a few things and take home leftovers. By far, my fave was the Chicken Ruby.

I made reservations online, couldn't get any dinner reservations, but got one for lunch on a Monday. Once we got there, we were promptly seated. The service is just amazing, they charge 20% as service fee though. The food was good, not great. Living in San Jose, I think I have been spoilt and have many better food options available around. We tried the chili cheese toast, local beer, ruby chicken, rumali roti (which wasnt that great). Overall the food was pretty good, ambience, menu, service, drinks all pretty nice. Its more of an experience to go there and enjoy a meal. If you are looking for really good food, may be there are other indian places in London which serve better food as this was catered to the english taste.",

The service once you get inside Dishoom is top-notch and the Indian food is above average (had the black daal, the Chicken Ruby, the Roomali Roti and a cheese naan), but I'm not sure it was necessarily the greatest Indian I've ever had...maybe, in part, because I've been to India twice and loved the food on those trips.\nBut then?  I had the lamb samosas for dessert.  Sweet Jesus, these were amazing.  The samosas canopy shells were fantastic, the minced lamb inside was tasty, and the three spices left on my table were all excellent.\nIf I could make reservations here and know my seating time, I would have eaten here a couple more times to try other items on the menu.  As it was, very strong, but you can tell there are some very specific treasures on this menu!",

There was definitely a pretty long wait (a bit over an hour) but I think it was very worth it. \nWhen you arrive you put down your name and at least one person per table has to stay and wait in line. While waiting in line, you will be offered a hot chai or water (definitely take them up on the offer! Especially if it is cold out!). Once you get to the front of the line, you'll be handed a buzzer and taken to the bar where you can order drinks while waiting for your table. Before you know it, your buzzer will go off and you'll be taken to your table to begin your amazing dinner. \nWe ordered the chicken ruby, black dhal, spicy lamb chops, paneer, lamb biryani, naan (x3), and a bowl of greens. Everything was so delicious and my table of 4 finished off just about everything. I definitely wish some of the items on our table were a bit spicier (I LOVE my spice and was craving some heat) but overall, everything was great and I'll definitely be back to try some more items on the menu. However, I'll definitely be back for the biryani and the black dhal!",

The staff gets to you very quickly, which is nice. Ordered the Behl, which was strangely addicting. The Dahl was also very good. Spicy Lamb was good, but my chop was over cooked. Chicken Tikka roll was very amazing, but it's a wrap, not a roll. Chicken curry was also delicious. Roti was good, but I was craving naan a little more. Chicken tikka looked good, but as far as I could tell it was just grilled chicken (did not try). They don't ask if you want a dessert menu, which was nice and odd at the same time. I'm not used to restaurants doing that. The bathroom has an unnecessary amount of stairs (you walk up 2 stairs to get in and 1/2 the br is another 2 steps down... make it flat!!!). Overall good food, tho wait might not be worth it.",

                "description": "A few friends who recently visited London had great things to say about Dishoom. Mainly, it being a local, swanky, fun, loud,  delicious time. So immediately after landing and putting the luggage away, this place came to mind for dinner. Awesome introduction to London. Technically, Dishoom is \"Indian food,\" but it's also a a neo-fusion of culture and taste.\n Auspiciously, everything on the menu is a good choice. The host may attempt to recommend you get three entrées a person--my girlfriend and I ordered plenty after getting two or three entrées (altogether, not each) with rice and naan.\nThe food was so good!! Had we gotten another entrée or two, I definitely would've eaten it I would have fallen into a food coma immediately after.\nThe music in the background is great, some sort of blend between 1920 jazz, and swanky dance music. \nThe wait is generally 30 minutes to an hour, but you can generally find a spot at the bar to grab a drink while you wait. If you're starving there's also generally two or three snacks at the bar you can purchase. For example, my girlfriend and I ordered vegetable samosas. Soooo good! Crispy light crunchy on the outside, nice veggie-mush on the inside.\nDefinitely not cheap, but not annoyingly expensive. I think the price is just right. Well, there are a few outliers that are more expensive. But the median price ranged from £9-15£. \nSo, more than I would normally pay at a pub, but also a very nice dinner. Would definitely go again if I were to visit London. \nYou can wear whatever you want to dinner, but I would generally go with smart-casual-- A reasonably nice shirt and a reasonably nice pair of jeans at least. \nThe staff was wonderful. We got pushed out the door a little quickly but it was in a very polite way given we were literally the last customer of the night (we arrived about an hour before closing). So instead of, for example, being offered a dessert menu after the meal, we were brought the dessert menu and asked if we would like to close out now or after dessert. Or as we looked over the main entrée menu, the host would comment we only had about 10 minutes to choose ab order before for the kitchen would be interrupted from it's closing process. That was annoying. I kind of understood... but at the same time, we did arrive an hour before closing, not five minutes before closing. And empathy aside, we did spend a combined £40-£50 (including drinks). So as polite and eloquent as the host was,  the pressure (at the very least) did not add to the experience.",

Needless to say I did not give up, and came back on Thursday for a late lunch.    It was definitely worth it.  I had the fried okra which were very flavorful, a little to much spice for me but very nice.   I then tried the bbq prawns which were delightful, cooked on the tandoor, with the right level of spice and flavor, worth trying.   Then I went to the roomali roti with the house special chicken ruby.  This dish was fantastic.   A slight twist on butter chicken it had wonderful taste and was excellent.

Tender chicken in a rich silky curry sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. 10.50\n-PANEER TIKKA: Paneer is vegetarian first-class fare and a subtle cheese to make. Marinated then gently charred with red and green bell peppers. Not worth trying again, because there are so many other delicious things on the menu. 8.20\n-HOUSE BLACK DAAL: Dishoom signature dish -- it is like a dark, rich, deeply flavoured lentil textured dish in a rich subtle sauce. You can tell It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. 6.20\n-JACKFRUIT BIRYANI\nDelicious, savoury jackfruit and delicately saffron'd rice, potted and cooked with mint, coriander and sultanas. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. So much flavor and was expertly executes. 9.5\n-GARLIC NAAN\nWith minced garlic and coriander sprinkle. It is one naan cut in half.

They kindly served us chai milk tea. Then, they led us to the bar where we waited another 30 minutes to get our table.\nFood: I was very lucky to go with an Indian food expert where she made all the orders for us. Very delicious! I love their vegetarian options as well!\nService: Quite slow, but I understand because it's a Friday night so they were very busy. Our waiter kept disappearing when we needed him. Other waiters were helpful when we needed help.\nTip: Free wifi!",

The food was delicious!!!!!!!!!!!! There was a two hour line but it was worth every minute. If you find yourself craving Indian food in London, I highly suggest trying this place out. It's worth it! Trust me. It's worth it!!! I hated Indian food and I'm very picky about strong smells, but this restaurant was amazing. It smelled divine. Wow. Wow. WOW. I am officially obsessed with this restaurant. Wow. WOW. Wow.\nGet the Okra fries! Get the Garlic Naan and the regular naan. Get the Dishoom Chicken Tikka! You should also get the Black Daal & Ruby Chicken Curry. Honestly, just order the entire menu. If I was in London right now, I would.",

Probably my favorite dish. \nPau Bhaji was amazing! If you don't like to share food then I'd order 2 of these dishes then proceed to eat them both. \nHouse black Daal is a must. Eat it up with their garlic naan at your own risk because you won't want to stop eating. They may have to roll you out the front door after you pay. \nBad: Nothing",

It went really well with the green and orange sauce!  \nThe bean curry packed a lot of flavors but wasnt too overwhelming. I feel like I could eat it with naan or rice every day. The garlic naan was crispy and fragrant. Loved how well it was cooked. The other breadlike item was actually just like a tortilla so it wasnt too impressive.",

The flavors were on point and this was probably the most empathetic wait staff that I've encountered.

We ordered a few tapas style plates having been told we should order two each to share but it was too much food. You may want to start with one each or a few and then continue.

While on line, they would serve you some hot chai milk tea to wait as we were there during the winter. The line actually moves pretty quick and in less than an hour, it was our turn. Once we enter the restaurant, there is another short wait down by the open bar but the wait there was also pretty short and we were then taken to our table. \nThe curries were amazing! Although, I kind of wish I didn't order the mango dessert as it was just a Popsicle stick.

As soon as you get in, you dont get a table, you get a space at a bar. Then they call you for a table. They take your drinks to table and make you comfortable. Food was perfect. Had lamb samosa - tasty and lamb chops - very tasty. Mango lassi was ok. House chai is must have at the end of a meal. Choices are limited so make sure you check a menu online first and then come. If looking for something fancy indian dish, you will be disappointed. \nDrinks are of variety. Need to come again to try-'em all. I would come here again.",

It was long 45 min wait at 7pm but they were super nice and offered us hot Indian chai and sherry as we waited outside in the line. \nOnce inside, we really liked the vibrant and clean ambience with lingering indian spices from across tables. We ordered Keema Pau, Vada Pau, Bhel and Pav Bhaji for starters. Loved envy dish since it was cooked to perfection without any excess oil. Went in big group with Europeans and Americans and everyone could eat it without compromising on their spice-level threshold. \nFor the main course we ordered Chicken Ruby, Chicken biryani, Black daal, Roomali roti and Garlic naan. The biryani and dal were spot on. Wasn't too impressed with the ruby as it lacked the flavour and was bit bland. We wrapped out meal with kulfi and chai - hard to go wrong on these!\nService was great, waiters were friendly and we got complimentary far far. It was a reasonably priced restaurant and didn't burn a hole with all the food that we ordered. \nOverall, great food and service. Felt at home in this cosy restaurant and will definitely visit again!",

Last day before leaving London we came back around 2:30 figuring it was between lunch and dinner so the wait wouldn't be too long. We were wrong; 1 hour again, but this time we decided to wait. So glad we did. The food was fantastic. We had the Pau Bahji, the house Black Daal, the Roomali Roti, Prawn Moilee, and the Mahi Tikka. They were all so good. Also had the East India Gimlet which was a very refreshing cocktail. The service was very good. As I said, well worth the wait.",

While you wait in line, another hostess will offer samples of the House Chai to ease up your hunger.\nI dined solo and was seated at a small table instead of the bar so I was able to relax a little more. The staff were wonderfully attentive, great service and my waiter made sure to keep an eye out for me whenever I needed something. Based on the Yelp reviews, I ordered the vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, and garlic naan, and everything was delicious! The chicken ruby was spicier than I expected (I tend to eat mild to low-medium spicy, this was a little further along the medium range imo), and in hindsight I should've ordered some rice to offset it a little. I also requested still water, but I guess this meant bottled water and so I was charged another £3 for this (oops...next time I'll be sure to say \"tap\").\nAll in all, it's a pricier establishment but you won't be disappointed with the food at all.

If you use Yelp to search for good Indian food in London by ratings, the top five Indian restaurants that show up are Dishoom. While it's a small chain - the food is definitely is not chain like. They told us that the wait will be an hour and 15min. We almost decided to leave but we were only in London for a days and a half so we waited it out in the bar. If you have to wait get the Dal Moth - this little snack is so very tasty. \nThe atmosphere is very lively, and the staff super friendly. They even have a small kids meal menu. \nTurns out the wait was only 40min but even at 1hr and 15min it would still be worth the wait. The best dish we had was the Black Dal - it's their signature dish. It's cooked for 24hours and it's basically Dal with a light smoky taste. Very yummy :)\nIn all we had some samosas, four different curries and the chicken berry biryani - got a side or rice and some rita. That was plenty for a party of four. \nIf you have to have great Indian food, I would highly recommend Dishoom as a place to go. Pick the one on Kingly Street just a short 15min walk from Piccadilly Square. The neighborhood for this restaurant is very fun.",

They were very welcoming and they made sure you had everything you needed. It's A-La-Carte, so wait to be seated, order and pay at the table. \n2. Price- this place is affordable, and not expensive at all. For two people, you'll pay about £30, but that depends on how much you order though. \n3. Ambiance- modern and hip. There are two stories to this particular restaurant. I guess you can say there is a Ground level and a Lower Ground Level. Or perhaps as we better understand in the states, 1st floor and a basement. Haha. Dress code is casual. \n4. Food- we had cheese naan, Gunpowder potatoes, Chicken Ruby, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Vegetable Biryani. My favorite were the potatoes, and the Tikka. Everything was very flavorful and I have to say, it's the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to.\n5. Cleanliness- superb. I can't complain.",

Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. \nThe reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. \nComing back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.",

Dishoom was absolutely delicious, and even though I don't really eat Indian food, I love the food here! \nFood: 5/5! Actually all of the dishes were delicious, not a single one fell short. We had the okra fries and calamari, and both were fried perfectly, but very oily. Okra fries were almost like yam fries! The chicken tikka was good, but not spectacular. The lamb kebabs were better I think, but personally not a huge fan of lamb. The lamb biryani was one of my faves! The rice is amazingly blended with different flavours, and we added Raita to it too (felt almost like chicken over rice. We also ordered a bowl of greens which was actually very good and helped balance out the heavy meat dishes. I highly recommend the garlic naan and the matter paneer, those were the other highlights of the night. Drinks wise I really liked the mango lassi, and it was a perfect balance for all the spicy and oily dishes. \nIf you're in London this is definitely a must try!",

Chicken tikka, prawn moilee, and house black daal were all cooked to perfection.\nAlin was our server who took the time to explain the dishes and encouraged us to share- he was very knowledgeable on all the dishes and kindly asked if there were any dietary restrictions within our party.\nNo room for dessert but will definitely return again....and again! I had touched on reservations prior, make sure you book them. On our way out, there was a line of patrons half down the street- that should show you how great Dishoom really is!",

A club line and you need to head to the bar first before being seated. Why can't you just wait for an open table if you don't want to go to the bar. Besides my disapproval of the seating process, the food was delicious. The black daal is supposed to be the house special but I thought it tasted like bean soup. However the chicken curry and the rice with lamb was amazing. The garlic naan was best naan I ever had and wished each serving was more than 2. Going to come back here before my trip ends.",

However, while you wait you can have some chai (it has more spices than usual), water, or lemon water. Which was a nice thing while you wait. \nWe waited about an hour for a Sunday evening around 9:30. \nThe menu had a lot of options, some traditional and some they have made their own versions of.

You were wonderful. \nIn dire need of Indian food on a cold London evening, we found Dishoom through raving reviews online and once we got there its popularity was clear: the wait was permanently an hour and 30 minutes- there was even a line to wait for the 1h30m line!  We wanted to understand the hype and ended up waiting about an hour (I think they try to throw people off with that long time) and all the while they serve hot spiced chai- delicious.\nOnce we were in, I asked what the waiter's favorite dish was, chicken ruby, and tried that. We paired it alongside their lamb biryani and a cucumber salad veggie dish. The food was DELICIOUS. Definitely try the chicken ruby! So so good, we even came back and tried the suggestion of another waiter, malak paneer (just.omg.incredible!), the chicken biryani and garlic naan. Everything was well worth the wait! \nSome small downsides: the cider I tried here definitely is an acquired taste. I love ciders, and if you do too maybe give it a go, but it seemed to be watered down and a little spiced? Not my favorite. Otherwise, the dishes themselves can be on the medium/small side, and the mains don't come with any rice, bread, or veggie sides. So if you're ordering chicken tikka, that doesn't come with a side of rice, or a piece of garlic naan, or a small veggie dish. I'd keep that in mind, as the price can stack up quickly when you add all of those combinations up.\nEither way, Dishoom was delicious\n  and worth the hype! The atmosphere was an interesting old school London/Indian 60s and 70s vibe? Great experience!",

                "description": "Dishoom was our first stop in London for dinner and well worth the wait. With 700+ reviews already here, I'll give you a rundown of what stood out to me most. \n1) The line outside snaked around and around, but they sweetened the experience with hot chai tea and sherry. Once you get inside, you *may* think your wait is over but instead, you're transported downstairs to the bar area. We had enough time to get a drink and apps there. Our total wait time was about an hour but these little extras made it fly by. \n2) We ordered okra fries and lamb samosas at the bar, then Dishoom's signature dish (and vegetarian) house black daal, curry-infused chicken ruby, and garlic naan at our table. There's nothing I would not recommend. \n3) I love how Indian restaurants offer an array of non-alcoholic drinks that are delicious like laasis, and Dishoom takes that one step further with teas, coffees, and sodas. That being said, I still went with some cocktails including the super refreshing Bollybellini and classic Bombay Pimm's. \n4) I truly enjoyed reading the menu and learned that the restaurant donates a free lunch to schools in India for every meal you eat at Dishoom. \n5) I would've come back here time and time again (including for breakfast!) if I had more time in London. There are heaps of other dishes I need to try. \nSo there ya have it. Believe the hype. Love the hype. Taste the hype.",

                "description": "My wife and I found our equivalent of food nirvana here at Dishoom in Covent Garden.  \nAdmittedly it doesn't start well. When you arrive, if it's anywhere near a meal hour you'll find a line. However, I'm here to tell you that you must overcome any concern you have about the line, I don't care if it's raining sleet. Get in that line soldier and stick it out, the victory of incredibly delicious food will make the pain and suffering fade immediately. \nWe had the following\nButtered Plain Naan\nBlack Lentils\nLamb Sheek Kabob\nPaneer curry\nVegetarian samosas\n We loved everything. While my wife and I prefer yellow daal, this black daal was amazing. The naan was very fresh with excellent flavor and a touch of crispy.  I could have eaten 3 orders of the Lamb without the benefit of any sauces, but the sauces are so damn good I used them anyway. \nThe vegetation samosas were clear and away the most flavorful and balanced (potato to other ingredients) we've ever eaten, a great crutch in the crust followed by incredible flavor. I really wish I'd had room left to get an order of the lamb samosas.\nThe paneer curry (that's right cheese pieces in curry) was terrific and would satisfy anyone regardless of whether they're vegetarian or not. \nThe bar is where they send you to wait after you've made it in the door (3-7 mins) and they do a pretty good job there as well. \nWe can't wait to head back to London so we can return to Dishoom.",

The restaurant had this cool hip/fun vibe that you'd find in NYC, with very traditional flavors but with a modern twist. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu, our waitress probably thought we were crazy, as she tried to stop us & said this is plenty... Everything was delicious! Oh & those 3 little sauces they give you...ask for more as you will want more later! lol To top it off the service was great. Can't wait to come back again when I'm back in London. Wish you guys would open a location in SF!",

Plus the free wi-fi kept us occupied.\nWe were seated downstairs and the decor was awesome. Everything has such a great unique touch. \nFor food, we had the chili cheese toast, gunpowder potatoes, ruby chicken, rice, naan, and roomali roti. It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people. The cheese toast and ruby chicken was phenomenal. Honestly some of the best indian food I've had in a while!\nWe also got a bottle of wine.. everything was pretty decently priced for being in the heart of london and a fancy indian restaurant!",

I loved how the skin was crispy, thin filo and the minced lamb inside was flavorful. \nOnce we got a table, we ordered the House Black Daal, Pau Bhaji, Chicken Ruby, Prawn Moilee, and the garlic naan. Everything that came out was delicious but my favorite was the Prawn Moilee, which had perfectly cooked prawns and perfect broth for dipping naan. \nDishoom was definitely worth the wait and one of my favorite meals in London.",

                "description": "\"You HAVE to eat Indian food while you're in London!\" is what I heard over and over again before our trip.  We only spent two days in London, but Dishoom was definitely my favorite meal while we were there.\nWe got in line around 10pm on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be over an hour.  Several people in line decided to jump ship upon hearing this....DON'T BE THOSE PEOPLE!  We waited for maybe 20 minutes before we were seated.  I asked my friend who lives in London about this and she's had the same experience multiple times as well.  Even if the wait were an hour, the food is worth it.\n- Dishoom IPA: Yes, they have their own beer and it's good!\n- Okra Fries: Highly recommend this as an app.  If you think you don't like okra, think again.  This is not that slimy fried okra we have in the states!  The fries are crispy and really well seasoned.\n- Black House Daal: A signature dish for a good reason.  The flavors are incredible and we ended up ordering a second serving of garlic naan just to finish this off.\n- Chicken Ruby: Husband ordered this because it was mentioned in almost every single review and he loved it.  I had a couple of bites as well and ended up convincing him that should just share our dishes. HA! \n- Mahi Tikka: This was my order and it was SO good.  The fish is cooked perfectly, leaving it juicy, flaky, and tender.\nOur server was friendly and the food came out super fast.  My husband, who is normally not a huge fan of Indian food, could not stop raving about this place and has recommended it to several of his friends who were visiting London.  Now that says a lot!",

With that said, Dishoom was the spot that was recommended the most.\nSo, I get there after struggling trying to find the place. There's an intimidating line outside the door, the guy tells me it will be an hour wait. It actually took about 45 min. Good thing about the wait in line, is that they serve you delicious Chai tea.\nAny way, I get in and order the highly recommended, \"Ruby Chicken\" (their version of Tikka Marsala), Chicken Biryani, and a Naan with melted cheddar insided (if you're from Mexico or the U.S., no need to get this, it was good, but it's practically a quesadilla...been there, done that).\nEvery thing was so tasty even down to the 3 sauces that accompany every meal (chutney, tamarind, and some green sauce).\nThe staff was very nice, and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice as well...I sat downstairs.\nMy advice...try it!",

                "description": "Wow! What can I say about this incredible restaurant. From the moment you enter this vibrant, lively place you embark on an extravagant culinary journey. The food is not even close to the typical restaurant Indian food. It is in fact a fusion of Indian and British influence; a fusion of flavors. Wow! \nWe are very fortunate that we have cooks at our homes in India and in the US, so we do not usually eat outside Indian food. When one of my wife's friends suggested Dishoom, we immediately said that we did not want to eat at a restaurant. There is something sort of sacrilegious about Indians eating outside Indian food. Please don't ask me to explain why.  That's just how it is. \nBut Dishoom blew the doors off all of our conventional thinking. We did not expect to have such a great experience. Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was incredibly kind. Our waitress could not have been more hospitable. She explained all of the dishes as if we had never tried Indian food before in our lives. It was actually quite refreshing to hear someone describe our own native food in such an enthusiastic manner! All of the food she recommended was fabulous. I loved the Dishoom India Pale Ale beer. \nIf you are in London, you MUST go to Dishoom!",

They also passed out hot chai and mint tea to those waiting in line. Chai was the best i had...\nGot the naan (amazing buttery goodness)...and a lamb and chicken dish (forgot what they are called)..wish i got a sauce or curry based dish to pair along with it to sort of balance out our little feast but it was still divine. Portions are perfect not too big not too small(Ok maybe small for the states, if you are a fat American like myself get a couple of dishes). \nCouldn't decide between two desserts and I ended up picking one reluctantly..and our waitress brought us back both desserts and said the other one is on the house Sooo incredibly kind!!! They really treasure their customers. The desserts were soo good but I loved the chocolate one with the chili ice cream. My lord!!! I will definetely return to this gem on my next trip to London! I loved the vibe of the area too. A ton of young people!! And the inside at night is dark candlelit and relaxing.",

The line quickly grew moments after we arrived. Although we had to wait outside in the cold, servers brought out small glasses of chai hot chocolate. I had never been to an Indian restaurant nor tried Indian cuisine, and that was such a perfect introduction to what lied ahead. Once seated, the waitress informed us of how dishes were served family style there and went through various menu options and recommendations, which were incredibly helpful to me. I remember us ordering the chicken ruby, roti, house black daal, gunpowder potatoes, and a rice. We both found everything to be incredibly delectable! He had Indian cuisine before and stated that this was, by far, the best he has had. I fell in love. We regularly think back on this restaurant and wish there were one in Houston! We will definitely be stopping at a Dishoom if we're ever in London again.",

                "description": "When we were planning our trip to London, I knew Indian food had to be something we ate while we were there. I looked at many places until I found Dishoom. The reviews looked promising so we chose the Covent Garden location based on preference of where we wanted to be. \nWhen we arrived we saw a long line. It was almost like the lines you see to get into a bar/nightclub. I had been warned about the lines from other reviews but was surprised by what we saw. We were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our names down and apologized for the wait. He said it was going to be an hour and half. Yes an hour and a half. But we were determined and everyone else in line seemed to be in good spirits so we got comfortable and waited. They do take reservations for parties of 6 or more. The staff offered us some chai tea and green tea to sip on while we waited. The line moved and when we made it to the front, we were greeted with another staff member who led us to the bar. From there we ordered drinks and then a staff member came and took our drinks to our table. We were taken care of by 4 people even before we sat down. The restaurant's vibe is \nOur server came and made recommendations. By that point, we had already decided on what we wanted because we had plenty of time to look at it. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Chicken Biryani, rice, regular naan and garlic naan, and raita (yogurt sauce). The food was so delicious. The food comes out family style which is typical in Indian culture. Everything was well made, flavorful, and a good amount of spice. The service was fantastic too. Like I said, from the moment we got in line until we left, we were well taken care off. Definitely worth it.",

The samosas were delicious and the chutneys were just the perfect kick. We ordered the dishoom chicken tikka, and honestly if you love chicken that's the dish to get. There is no curry with it so I would recommend a naan with it. But it was the perfect amount of spices tied with the perfect texture. Finally, we finished off with some kulfi (mango and malai) and it wasn't too sweet, but just the right amount.\nI recommend anyone who is in the area to try this place, you won't regret it!",

I would recommend this place to anyone living in or visiting London. The ruby chicken, vegetable biriani, side of greens, Dahl, shrimp, and chickpeas are all so great. The okra fries are the best I have had. The food is so flavorful and for the amount of food you get it is very reasonably priced. Amazing food- can't edit to go back",

It was pretty tasty (after a few days of eating sub par food, since during the holidays most things are closed).  While most of the dishes had good flavor, there were some misses.  \nGrab a few dishes of curry, naan, tikka. The biryani is a good staple.  Some of the food has good heat to it, so don't forget to pair it with some raita to cool it down.\nAll in all, this is a great place for groups.  A good time and pretty good curry.",

Our server was Alin who gave outstanding suggestions. We had the lamb samosas to start, large Kingfisher beer, and we split the lamb chops, House Daal, plain naan, and Tikka wraps. Finished it up with the coffee Martini. I have a dairy allergy and they willingly adjusted the drink to fit. Overall outstanding. Would highly recommend to anyone trying to find amazing Indian food in London. Would absolutely make a reservation ahead of time Bc it fills up very quickly. Cheers!",

We decided to do it, but we were actually seated in about 10 minutes. The waiter was very informative about all the dishes and offered us a non dairy menu since I'm slightly lactose intolerant (meaning I can have some dairy but not a ton of cream or yugert in the dish). We decided on the following dishes:\nKEEMA PAU - spicy minced lamb \nReally flavorful and not too spicy.\nDISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA - grilled chicken with their family recipe no yugert. \nIt was so good and flavorful. The chicken was slightly chared on the outside and juicy on the inside. \nMASALA PRAWNS - delightfully succulent and tasty.\nGarlic naan - perfectly soft and slightly crispy\nA bowl of green - fresh green veggies \nAll the dishes were great and the 3 dipping sauces have distinct flavors and you must try all of them to see if you like sweet, spicy or minty spicy. \nI also had a Bombay colada (no rum), it was such a delicious drink I could have 3 more.\nWe really like this place. The only not so great  thing about it was the hostess kept telling everyone to go wait outside. It was a very windy day, luckily we found a spot to wait near the entrance to shelter us from the wind.\nBut this will not keep us from coming back.",

I loved my dish (is was similar to chicken tikka masala). My hubby ordered a dish and was disappointed it wasn't saucy. We had an order or roti and garlic naan. It was delicious!",

And the little bits of mint that compliment the savory sweetness perfectly?! Wow.. I could eat this for breakfast any day of the week.

The inside is supposed to be like a intimate cafe in Bombay, and it does not disappoint with the lovely decor and detailed furnishings.\nTHE WAIT\nThe queue is really confusing. Get in line outside the restaurant, but make sure you find the person with the iPad to add your name to the official queue. We didn't, and it resulted in a lot of confusion from the staff of what to do with us. There are heaters outside and wiki, so the wait isn't terrible. Plus, they bring around complimentary mint tea and chai (so good!).\nFOOD\n++ Lamb Samosas (4.90)- done really well with plenty of stuffing and a crispy exterior\n+ Pau Bhaji (4.50)- reminds me of a sloppy joe. The meat stuffing is a tomato-based dish, and you stuff it into the little rolls.\n++ Chicken Ruby (8.50)- one of the highlighted dishes here. Chicken cooked perfectly in a tomato-based sauce.\n+ Garlic Naan (2.50)- really small, with only two small pieces. Less fluffy than I would like.\n++ Prawn Moilee (16.50)- generous portion of giant prawns.\n+ Basmati Rice (2.90)\n+ Pineapple Pepper Crumble (5.50)- really interesting twist with the addition of the pepper, creating a nice sweet/savory balance.\nDRINKS\n++ Chocolate Chai (2.90)- chai + dark chocolate\n++ Naughty Chocolate Chai (6.50)- chai + dark chocolate + bourbon",

Even so, we decided to give Dishoom a shot since literally everyone ever told us to come and give it a try, so we arrived later in the evening, falling asleep because we were so tired. And boy are we glad we came.\nThe menu is extensive - lots of somewhat smaller sharables for order. We got a veggie mash, potatoes, garlic naan, chicken, and quite a few other items for just the two of us, leaving quite a few leftovers for later on. Make no mistake however - leftovers were because we were completely stuffed, not because the food was bad.\nI can't speak for authenticity, but the flavoring was delicious and unlike anything I had had before. Though distinctly Indian, the restaurant improved on the flavoring and had a great garlic naan that lasted in taste beyond its warmth. The okra was also exceptional, and the worst dish may have been the lamb or the potatoes, which really says something - they were good too. \nThe environment is also worth talking about. Its a bit like a transportation back in time, an underground bar and a nice sense of decor tying the place together.\nCome here, whether or not you like Indian food. You just may be pleasantly surprised.",

                "description": "London is known for having the best Indian food after the country India itself. When I visited London, I was with an Indian food fanatic who insisted on eating it as often as possible. After hearing about Dishoom and the wonderful reputation it had, we knew we had to visit.\nSince Dishoom is so popular, it's well known that you're going to encounter a long line when you arrive. We had read reviews of people waiting up to 2 hours. My sister and I came prepared for the long haul. We weren't going to leave, no matter what. Luckily for us, we waited outside for about 45min (thankfully since it was pretty cold outside). We thought we had finally made it in, but then we were directed to a bar on the bottom floor to wait longer at a bar. I'm guessing Dishoom does this to get you out of the cold, and get some drinks in your system while you wait. We were called to our table about 15 minutes later.\nMy first impression of Dishoom was how busy it was. The restaurant is loud and filled with voices of people having a good time. Every seat was taken and the restaurant worked like a machine getting people in, feed, and out again. I thought the large restaurant with so many people was overwhelming. While it was a bit off putting, I took it as a good sign that this place is so popular and liked by people, that it's very packed.\nTo start the meal, we got the vegetable samosas, and the keema pau. Both were the highlight of the meal for me. The vegetable samosas were tasty, and the keema pau was just as good. My main dish is where I think Dishoom failed. I got the Dishoom Chicken Teeka Roll and it was pretty bad. The roll was very dry, there was hardly any taste to it. I have to say, after hearing such great reviews about Dishoom, I was really disappointed. I'm not one to believe in the \"you got the wrong dish\" mentality. I think every dish should be good at a restaurant, not just a specific one. My sister got the mattar paneer and really liked it. \nI wanted to like Dishoom because of the great reviews, but it just wasn't as spectacular as people say. The service was great, the atmosphere was cool (but overwhelming), and my main dish was lackluster. Would I visit Dishoom again? Probably. I would see if I could pick a better dish and enjoy it more (even though this goes against my usual judgement).",

My wife and I were in town for a long weekend a few months back and made sure to come here after reading all of the good reviews.  It was so good, we ended up going back again 2 days later.  This was hands down some of the best Indian food we've ever had.  The wait is always really long, but it's definitely worth it.  The staff also gives out free chai tea and sherry since the wait is usually 40+ minutes.  Everything here is delicious, and over the 2 nights that we ate here, we enjoyed the grilled masala prawns, garlic naan, chole bhatura, chicken tikka, butter-bhutta corn, gunpowder potatoes, okra fries, fried calamari, pineapple pepper crumble, and chocolate pudding with chili.  The drinks are good too and I recommend the Dishoom IPA and Viceroy.  Highly recommend this place if you're in London and are craving delicious Indian food.",

I never ever take time to write reviews, but this place was so bad it has brought me here to write my first ever bad review.\nThey literally ruined our dining experience over water.  My girlfriend mistakenly ordered distilled water when she didn't mean to.  I remember the waiter framed the question in a way to deliberately confuse with only two options.  In any case, I am less shy than my gf, so I spoke up for her and let them know that's not what we wanted.  So they brought us regular water instead.\nThen a few minutes later the waiter walks over just to argue with us about the water. Completely unnecessary.  I calmly replied like an adult that it must have been a miscommunication then.  The guy just crapped all over our mood with his negative tone and arguing.  I was dumbfounded as he walked away from the table with his disrespectful tone with us.  We spent the whole dinner talking about what a terrible place this is.  We waited an hour in line in the rain for this terrible treatment.  \nThe food is not worth it.  You're paying for the ambiance and experience which was bad.  Either they have bad staff, or they are pressured by management to upsell the customers.\nSummary: Don't go here!  Better options elsewhere!",

                "description": "Review for Dishoom in Covent Garden!\nThis place is popular so just expect no matter what time you arrive, you will be waiting in line.  If you are lucky, only 10-15 minutes, but it can be as high as 60 minutes.\nHowever, they probably manage to make a long wait not seem as long by compartmentalizing you and keeping you moving. If you are outside, every 10 minutes they bring around fresh hot chai to keep you warm.  Within about 25 minutes, they move you to a new waiting area by the bar.  You hang out there, have a drink, check out the menu, etc.  By the time you are at your table, you already know your order, probably a little tipsy from your well crafted pre-dinner cocktail and ready to chow down on delicious food.\nWith this menu and with the usual blandness of English food, you really cannot go wrong with anything.  However a few items are my go-tos:\nChicken Ruby: This is what most people confuse as Chicken Tikka Masala.  Deliciously done and properly with a hint of cashew to thicken the sauce. \nChicken Tikka Roll: If you ever had a Kati Roll or Frankie, this is a classic preparation of the street food style from Bombay.\nKachumber Salad: A refreshing and citrus salad to help with the palette cleanse between the heavier meal dishes\nLamb Samosas: Your classic samosas but with Keema instead.\nPau Bhaji: Just comfort food for Indians but the burst of flavors is bound to make anyone hungrier for more.\nMalai Kulfi for dessert: This is the one item that is pretty good but can't beat India.  It's certainly good and will hit that kulfi craving.",

Don't worry, the staff is extremely helpful and patient in making sure that you know what you are ordering. Portions aren't that big, but for the price, it's still a great bargain. We ordered the prawn special and it was excellent. The flavors are well balanced and the prawn are fresh. We also made sure we ordered 2 naans to soak up the rest of the juices of the dish.

I was not disappointed. \nThe chocolate chai and mint tea served to those waiting in line certainly warmed my insides. And then, the business begins. \nI ordered the black daal, lamb biryani, and the garlic naan. Our server thought I was ordering for my friend and I, but I just wanted to try everything! If I had the option to take leftovers home, I would've ordered the Ruby Chicken.\nThe daal was rich,  smoky and flavorful-- perfectly partnered with the naan! You forget it doesn't have meat. The lamb biryani had a subtle, slow-burning heat. It's the kind of meal that makes you say, \"that hit the spot!\"\nBut as delightful as dinner was, I had to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did. The kulfi was so rich and creamy, it was almost chewy. It was almost custard.\nIf you are ever within the vicinity of this place, make sure you get in line! Build up an appetite and know it will be worth the wait!",

We were seated in the downstairs bar area to wait, and soon enough had a table. The decor is LOVELY and quite stunning and gives the whole place a great feel. The service is also great!\nPricing seems very fair, and the quality is wonderful. They are also quick to bring out dishes, too! Wonderful execution. \nWe shared: \n-lamb samosas. YES. Just yes. So flavorful and perfect. So comforting. SO good. The sauces they provide as well are just great. \n-Garlic naan. Kind of cliche, but still super tasty. It was fluffy and flavorful and not TOO garlicky. Love. \n-Ruby chicken. This was somewhat spicy but warming and comforting and flavorful. I was super into this. \n-Chicken biryani. YES. JUST YES. This is so good. So flavorful and lovely and would go super well with raita. \n-Chai. This is next level chai. AND they give free refills! It's comforting (a theme here) and spicy in the best way. It is delightful.\nAll in all, this is a great place and if I lived in London, I'd come here all the time. It's not the BEST Indian food I have ever had, but is ROCK solid and the whole experience is VERY nice. \nPS: The above dishes was a LOT to handle for 2 people. Be warned. No regrets!",

I'm glad i came though, yummy Indian food!\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFOOD:\nLamb Samosas: 4/5, We got this while we were waiting for our table at the bar. It was perfectly seasoned and a really good appetizer. You get three pieces so it's pretty small but definitely tasty!\nHouse Black Dal: 4/5, It was another really good item! Very different dal than what I usually have. Usually I get yellow dal but this one had much more full lentils and slightly thicker. I'm a big fan of lentil soup so I definitely recommend!\nChole Batura: 5/5, This was my favorite meal of the night! The bread that comes alone with it is absolutely delicious, even better than the naan. It was a sizable portion and gave a very fresh feeling. Definitely get this dish!\nChicken Ruby: 4/5, Another very decent dish. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it didn't stand out too much. It tasted very classic, so I would recommend getting it if you like chicken!\nDishoom Chocolate Pudding: 4/5, This had a very very unique taste. I've never had a chili ice cream and it doesn't hit you at first, but the aftertaste is spicy. Although it wasn't 100% my style I would still recommend just because of how different it was.\nNaan: 5/5, I love naan and all the variations of naan here were delicious!\n-------------------------------------------------------\nPRICE:\nLamb Samosas: 4.90 Pounds\nHouse Black Dal: 5.90\nChole Batura: 8.90 Pounds\nChicken Ruby: 8.50 Pounds\nDishoom Chocolate Pudding: 6.90\nNaan: 2.50 Pounds\nCheese Naan: 3.20 Pounds\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSERVICE:\n4/5, It took like 30-45 minutes of waiting outside and another 15 minutes of waiting at the bar to get a table. It was definitely a very popular place, but once we got a table, they were very fast about getting our food to us! \n-------------------------------------------------------\nAMBIANCE:\n5/5, Very nice ambiance, definitely a little more classy but not too fancy. Can't really come in casual clothing, but it doesn't have to be too formal. Very good for a date!\n-------------------------------------------------------\nOVERALL:\nI definitely recommend coming if you're a fan of Indian food or want to go on a nice date!",

Dishoom is beyond any Indian food I have tasted in the U.S. and has elevated my Indian food experience and a spectacular culinary treat. Despite the long queue, staff were very welcoming and friendly. At one point, the host came out to personally chat with us and the hostess even offered hot Indian tea and beverages for the awaiting guests. \nWell known for their breakfast and buzz for their fried eggs and Bacon Naan Roll, we arrived for dinner instead. Our waiter, Ali, was so helpful in explaining the menu, as everything just sounded so inviting and delicious. We ordered a full table, starting with the Bhang Lassi and Mango & Fennel Lassi drinks. Indian food is best eaten with Lassi as it balances the heat and spice from the curry. For the entrees, we tried the House Black Daal, Chicken Ruby (tender chicken in makhani sauce), Sheekh Kabab (grilled lamb) and dipping Raita (minty cucumber yogurt). I would recommend getting two orders of the stonefire Naan or the steamed Basmati Rice for dipping and mopping the rich, silky curry sauces. Ali also brought out 3 house-made dipping sauces, which really brings out the flavor of the meat dishes. \nMouthwatering food and drinks, stellar customer service, clean and charming restaurant decor, all located right in the heart of London. Dishoom is so worth the 13 hour flight from San Diego. Cheers/Chiyars!",

                "description": "One of the best Indian restaurants in London (maybe one of the Indian restaurants in the world), and worth the wait! Don't come here unless you're willing to wait in line for 45-90 minutes, but on the plus side, they have space heaters outside to keep you warm, give you complementary chai, and they have free WiFi. So it could definitely be worse. I came here on a Friday night and waited in line outside for about an hour, and then moved downstairs with a buzzer where I had to wait for another 30 min or so. At least once you went inside and downstairs, you could order a drink and some appetizers, so it wasn't quite as bad. The line felt a little like DisneyWorld where you move to different waiting areas to help pass the time quicker with a change of scenery.\nLAMB SAMOSAS (£4.90) - Delicious samosas, I don't normally like lamb but I liked these a lot. The outside was nice, flaky and light, made with phyllo dough and not heavy. There were 3 of them and they were delicious. I would recommend.\nOKRA FRIES - (£4.20) - These were thin slices of okra cut into fries, and lightly covered with batter and spices. I like both appetizers but I liked these a touch more than the Samosas. It went well with the drinks. Would recommend these, I didn't want the bowl of these to end!\nAU BHAJI (£4.50) - A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered pau bun. The description doesn't really do this dish justice, but it was our favorite one of the bunch. There were 2 fresh, hot, buttered rolls and a bowl of vegetables that were mashed with spices. It doesn't sound that great, but it was so good, hearty, and comforting. Don't miss this one. \nBLACK HOUSE DAAL (£5.90) - I know this is a signature dish of lentils simmered for 24 hours, and it was good - I would definitely eat it again, but it was probably my least favorite of the bunch.\nCHICKEN RUBY (£8.50) - The curry was well done and the chicken was cooked well - spicy, but not too spicy. Definitely worth ordering if you like curry dishes. We ate this with naan and rice, but I'm sure it would be delicious with roti.\nGARLIC NAAN: Fluffy, fresh, and delicious. I'd recommend getting at least one order for the table. I wanted to get the Roti also, but between the naan and rice, we had sufficient carbs for the table.\nDISHOOM CHOCOLATE PUDDING (£6.90) - I loved this dessert a lot, but I like chocolate cake and spicy things, so the combo of a warm chocolate cake and a scoop of chili ice cream was my perfect combination. The chili ice cream is not as odd as you may think - it just has a hint of spiciness. \nOverall, such a fantastic meal at reasonable prices. Quality food, so many options to choose from, and even the long line was made better by being able to go downstairs and get drinks/appetizers, having free chai, and WiFi. I'd come back here on every trip to London and can't wait to have breakfast here one day. Brace yourself for the wait and make sure to add this on your list of places to eat in London.",

Among all the Indian restaurants I have ever tried, this one is just at average level.\nI won't say it's worth your spending life to wait for half or one hour. \nHowever, to be fair, this is one of the best food I had in this London trip so far....considering London is a good food desert, this restaurant to get high score is quite reasonable.",

I've always been a fan of Indian food and thought we had some great options in LA and an occasional visit to an Indian place in Manchester or London, however this is a fresh take on the real deal. Very inventive while still embracing the authentic tastes. I ordered the Mahi Tikka along with Pau Bhaji which was just absolutely perfect. I tried sampling as much as I could without overstuffing myself. Don't skip the Paneer Roll and of course an order of Naan. Everything on the menu looked amazing. I would say its perhaps the best food I've had in London in a long time!",

                "description": "The name Dishoom is the Indian movie equivalent of KAPOW! in superhero comics - the amplified sound (particularly in movies of 70s and 80s) when the fist of the hero connected with the face of the villain. Not sure who the villain is in this case, but the restaurant has certainly connected with the public, and now has five locations.\nStudents of business broadly, and positioning in particular, should find Dishoom as a fascinating case study. Not simply for creating demand that no one knew existed (the Brits are unlikely to tire of the Curry House format anytime soon), but for educating and convincing people that their lives had been incomplete without it!\n Dishoom is more than the sum of its parts. Yes, it is a very competent and affordable restaurant for lunch and dinner, but it is also one which explicitly positioned itself as a breakfast destination, as opposed to treating it as an afterthought to cover the costs for premises.\n For those who don't know, this was done by intelligently leveraging human nostalgia for the past and modeling their (scalable) business after the Irani cafes in Bombay (now Mumbai) popular in the Twentieth century, but whose numbers have dwindled considerably in the last decades. As background, Irani cafes were all day cafes inspired by the European coffee houses, and were places where people from all stratas of life could lounge all day, should they so choose, engaging in activities as diverse from reading the newspaper, writing their literary masterpiece, or just taking a break from the humdrum of the office. In my minds' eye, I can visualize a room large enough to be a banquet hall, decorated with family portraits, ceiling fans blowing air to provide patrons respite from the hot and humid summer day... so you can see, you can cut the romanticism with a knife.\nBut, here's the anomaly: the people who're seated here are basically foodies (pardon the word usage) and Indians, not necessarily mutually exclusive, with almost no one who would remember personally going to the cafes in now Mumbai. Nor would anyone confuse the patrons here for Bob Dylan (hey, he's a Nobel Prize winner now!).  Despite the meticulous set design, there's no slice of old Bombay here - but that's the magic of the positioning, as opposed to serious culinary chops, that no one pays any attention to that.\nEnough backdrop, the food is good (at times: excellent), but uneven with lots of misses in my 3 visits. My favorite menu items from the all day menu include the Masala Prawns, the spicy lamb chops, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Keema Pau (popular menu item at the Irani cafes).  For breakfast, I've liked the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli cheese toast) and Keema Per Eedu (chicken keema, chicken liver, fried eggs, and crisp chips). When it comes to drinks, they have quite a few innovative ones on their menu, e.g. Bhang Lassi (with/without rum) with ginger, almond syrup, yogurt, fennel sprinkles. The one I liked more was the Mango and Fennel Lassi. But, I've yet to like any dessert here, particularly iced things whether in a glass (gola ice) or a stick (kulfi). While I was tempted, I decided not to try the cream, meringue and strawberries dessert (Memsahib's mess). I saw it at a neighboring table and it certainly looked heavy enough to knock one out with a solid Dishoom...",

Is it worth it? Dishoom! YES!\nThanks to fellow Yelper's who made the decision extremely easy for what to order... Priced a bit on the expensive side for the really small portions you get... it might annoy you to find a small little bowl of Okra Fries (£3.70) and Prawn Koliwada (£5.90).. But have a bit of these extremely well seasoned appetizers... and ... DISHOOM! They got it spot on.. Really nice flavor and you'll definitely enjoy it!\nFor entrees... Chicken Ruby is clearly a winner. We saw a few tables order Biryani and Choley Bhatura too; but most of them were hogging on the really delicious (albeit smaller portions) of this dish.. again, priced a bit on the steeper end at £8.20. Roomali Roti's go extremely well.. so definitely recommend that!\nFew things to remember.. they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait! We waited ~50 minutes on a Wed night at 7:20. After we got in, they strategically send you downstairs to their bar where they'd expect you to spend a few more £££'s on drinks.. in about 15 minutes, you'd be taken to your table. For a place already minting money, this was a bit unnecessary in my opinion!\nService wise, no complaints! In fact, the food comes out really quick after placing your order. We got our food within 10 minutes! Definitely a must experience place for the Desi & Videsi crowd ;-)",

But it was totally worth it. \nIt was a cold and blustery day (don't worry, this isn't the start of a Gothic romance), and the waitstaff kindly provided mini cups of steaming hot chai and mint tea to warm us while we waited. Once we got in, my husband and I were seated downstairs at a tiny two seater table. Our waiter helped us make sense of the extensive menu and together, we put together a lovely meal. We had the lamb biryani (best I've ever had) paired with a light yogurt dip to cut the heat. We also has veggie samosas and fried okra. YUM. Everything was super and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food. We washed down our delicious meal with a glass of mango lassi (also terrific). \nIf you have the chance to visit, please do. It's well worth the wait. Oh, and the WC was pretty clean, too.",

Their food is exceptional, the service is outstanding, and if I were local, I would eat here all the time (on one short vacation, we dined here 3 times in 2 days). \nLondon prides itself on its Indian food, but the Indian food I've usually eaten had tastes a little different from what you get in restaurants in the U.S. or India. I've come to think of it as its own category: \"London Indian\" (sort of like \"Indian Chinese\" or \"American Chinese\" food). Dishoom's food is incredibly Mumbai-authentic (from the chai to the the oh-so-delicious chutneys), executed with really high quality ingredients. \nIn particular, I'd recommend the jackfruit biryani (rice casserole with raisins and cooked jackfruit -- a vegetarian alternative to chicken... it looks like chicken but tastes sort of like artichoke hearts). The tikka chicken wrap was amazingly delicious (actually, the balance of flavors wrapped in that thin, papery roti reminded me of mooshu chicken), and my Indian husband declared the bhel puri the best he'd had outside of India. The line for lunch and dinner can get very long (45 minutes for lunch or just over an hour for dinner), so try to come a little early (just before noon for lunch) or make a reservation.",

I definitely recommend ordering a variety of dishes from the menu. Also their traditional Chai is a must-order -- they're bottomless until 5PM!",

My husband is a big fan of Indian food, and once he received multiple recommendations for this place, he begged me to go with him. When we arrived, the line was LONG. I live in a small town without any lines, so having a 1.5+ hour wait was difficult for me. They did serve us complimentary chai tea & ginger milk, which was nice. Once we got to the front of the line, we were sent into the restaurant and directed to the bar downstairs to a separate waiting area. We got drinks--which were great; lots of options--and then when our table was ready, we were brought to have our dinner. The waitress was extremely helpful and gave great advice as to what we should order. We ended up choosing several of her suggestions, and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. The naan, the lamb, the chicken, the vegetables--it was all incredible. In addition to the excellent food, I also want to note that the restaurant was EXTREMELY well-organized. Going from staff member to staff member on our way to ultimately sitting down to dinner, everyone knew exactly what was going on, and they were very professional and respectful. There's a reason this restaurant is so highly reviewed: These people know how to run a business!",

My friend and I stood in line for a half hour, but I came in knowing there'd be a long queue. The staff knew too, and were equipped with complimentary sherry and chai tea for the guests in the queue. We were led downstairs to the bar where we ordered drinks first. My friend got an old fashioned and I had a blended orange drink. We were both very satisfied with our choices! Soon we were led to our table and we ordered a bunch of food- lamb biryani, ruby chicken curry, house black daahl, garlic naan, roti, okra fries with incredible dipping sauce and a side of basmati rice. Oh my god. So good. Everything was absolutely amazing. I wouldn't change a thing the next time we come to Dishoom, the curries were rich and flavorful, the lamb biryani was excellent, the lamb was SO tender, the daahl was the perfect balance between the two. Truly an experience and I can't wait to come back!!",

Once a table is open someone comes down to the bar to bring you back up and get you seated.\nThe food is absolutely delicious. After eating \"traditional food\" for two days I would've killed to have something with spice on it and this place delivered.\nI'm sure everyone's covered how good the food is compared to what else is available in the city.

                "description": "Oooh the chicken ruby dish here has changed the way I think about my chicken in Indian food and curries. \nRecently I'd been finding myself avoiding chicken at Indian restaurants (in America) because of how hard I've been finding the pieces - like solid, blocks of tough meat that became a nuisance to bite into. Even in places that people rave about, I've found chicken to be unfortunately blah after countless times.\nSo I was a little wary to have chicken here, but I was also curious to see how it would compare. The waiter wasn't particularly helpful really, but one of the things he did list was the chicken ruby. So after some indecision, I decided on that and roti (a recommended pair on the menu), and chai tea. \nSo worth the roughly hour-long wait in line (I arrived around 5 pm on a Wednesday). The chicken was tender and broke off easily with fork in one hand. The curry was so complex (it had a good balance of spice and it wasn't too sweet as if simply tomato soup or heavily tomato-based).\nThe roti did pair really well with it, soaking it all up. And it was the perfect amount together, which I find rare! Initially it might look like you don't have enough of one or the other, but no worries, ends up striking a nice balance and being filling.",

It went well with sauce trio they serve along with it. \nMahi tikka - the fish was tender and flavorful. Squeeze of lime + fresh cilantro + the orange sauce of the trio = combined flavors for a really delicious bite. \nBowl of greens - the flavors of chili and lime were absolutely delicious. The veggies were also not overcooked, so the broccoli, snap peas, and spinach all had a nice crunchy texture. Just wish it was a bit less oily. \nA quick comment to solo business travelers:\nWe are not tourists, it's not a family vacation, so a lot of times we revert to solo dining at the bar. As a giant FYI, they still make you wait along with everyone else, which for me was brutal bc I'm battling a cough and we were standing outside in the cold. Thankfully there was hot tea served. Also, their bar is not conducive to dining - only drinks and finger food. \nAs a result, I am sitting at a table that seems to have been set up as an afterthought in the rear corner of the downstairs dining area. Fine by me, just less ideal that the social, energetic experience of sitting at the bar. \nChicken Tikka Masala is UK's national cuisine, so naturally I opted to try the nearest top rated restaurant for this dish. Overall, delicious. Just wasn't too thrilled with the host process.",

We arrived just before 1800 on a Thursday and waited a total of 53 minutes for a table for two. We chatted with fellow travelers and enjoyed the complimentary chai tea we were served in line. Once we were seated, things moved quickly. Our waiter did an outstanding job. After we ordered, he made a few recommendations on how we could round out our meal and he was spot on.  Everything was delicious and easily some of the best Indian food I have had to date. Items were cooked to perfection and I loved the use of fresh herbs with our main entrées. We were able to try the Okra Fries £4.20, Spicy Lamb Chops £11.90, House Black Daal £5.90 (amazing!), Dishoom Chicken Tikka £7.90 and the Lamb Samosas £4.90. Everything here is done to the nines but the House Black Daal is necessary when you visit. The evening was perfect and I was very happy to celebrate my birthday here.

There were very little spices and nothing tasted like the many Indian restaurants I have enjoyed in the past. Of the many dishes we ordered, not one of them was memorable. The portions are tiny, and the prices are pretty ridiculous in my opinion (we paid about 35£/person and we're all very hungry after). If you are looking for real Indian food, skip Dishoom. Dishoom doesn't have the ambiance, tastes, smells, or service that its prices reflect or of a quality Indian restaurant. Pass on Dishoom, London has excellent Indian food elsewhere for half the price that is far better and more filling. \nTLDR; expensive, bland dishes, small portions, average service.",

The queue winds around outside however heat lamps are provided but must be in close proximity to benefit.  The wait ultimately was less than 1h.  Woot! Under promise, over deliver!\nTwo Dishoom employees, who seemed to be focused on our satisfaction, came by frequently to offer complimentary warm chai tea as we waited.  This was a delightful and much needed touch on a cold winter/spring night. \nThe service all around was top notch and highly attentive. \nMy main dish - Chicken Ruby- was incredible; so incredible I toyed with the idea of ordering another round (the overstuffed feeling was the only reason I didn't). The dish displayed a delicate balance of spice, tinge of sweetness, and tender, delicious chicken.\nThe prawn dish was ok, the dipping sauce provided with the plate added the extra needed kick.  I wouldn't order this again if I were to return.\nThe vegetable samosas were forgettable.  Seemed to taste like nothing but fried oil.\nCheese Naan bread- yes! Ten times over yes!  I used the naan bread to mop up the Chicken Ruby however it's so good on its own too.\nPro tip:  do not check nutrition facts of naan bread whilst eating said naan bread.",

                "description": "It wasn't even 5 pm and this place had a line outside already.  Granted, this resto is smack dab in the middle of tourist mecca in London, so you really can't fault it for brimming with tourists. With all the accolades it has received at Yelp, Zagat and TripAdvisor to name a few, a long wait here is inevitable. \nWe got lucky though 'cause we only waited about 45 minutes to get seated (with only 6 couples of in front of us or so it seemed).  Reservations for dinner are only taken for groups of 6 diners or more.  But here's the 411 on the seating process, just in case you think you're close to being seated when you reach the front of the line (you're not): You stand in line outside, and when you get to the front of the line, they may call you in inside and sit on the chair by the hostess podium, or they may just call you in and lead you directly to the bar downstairs to their basement, where they encourage you to get a drink, and where you have to wait some more. We ordered a couple of drinks (a Virgin Bombay Colada for me and a Nimbu Pani for the hubby), and studied the menu while waiting another 20 minutes down there. \nWe were eventually seated just on the other side of the bar area.  This place is tight, so you will definitely be in on the conversation of the people next to you, whether you like it or not.  Here are the items we ordered:\nNaan--a bit disappointing.  It wasn't piping hot when it reached our table.  No blisters on it like it usually has and it wasn't elastic in texture.  More like a flatbread than a traditional naan. We should have sent it back and gotten a hot off the oven one.\nDishoom Calamari--nice flavor, tender, but a little greasy.  A small portion but perfect for two people sharing. \nKacchi Lamb Biryani--good dish, nicely spiced, very tender lamb chunks underneath the rice.  \nKacchi Lamb Chops--ordered and enjoyed by the hubby.  The marinade has penetrated the meat and you get a very flavorful and tender bite. Enough for 1 person.\nRaita--good accompaniment for all the dishes we had and will cool your palate.\nWe did not have dessert.  We were just too full from our dinner.  Service was friendly and good.  When we were standing in line outside the restaurant, a staff member came by with small glasses of Nimbu Pani (essentially a lemonade).  It was a warm day, so it was definitely welcome and refreshing. They're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they don't close down at all in the afternoon.  If you can go in the afternoon, the wait times may be better.  When we were leaving the restaurant, the line was pretty bad.  There must have been over 15 parties in line. As good as their food is, I wouldn't wait in that line.  You're better off trying a mom and pop Indian restaurant that probably has as good, if not better food than this restaurant.",

I literally have no pictures because we are everything before I remembered to take pics. First off they didn't take reservations but leave a pool of tables available for walk ups. While we waited in the queue, the hostess served us piping hot chai or mint tea since it was quite nippy out. Once you make it to the door, they take you down to the bar area so you can continue to wait for your table while having tasty drinks and snacks. The wait wasn't long; just long enough for one proper cocktail. Once at the table, we ordered straight away since we studied the menu while waiting in the queue. Appetizers included spicy corn like chips, veggie samosas and array of naan with dipping sauces. Gone in twenty secs. Main courses where chicken tikka with rice, lamb chops, and a grilled shrimp dish. Accompanied with a bowl of basmati rice, steamed veggies, and of course more naan. No one spoke. All we could do was make\nSounds of delight as we devoured each dish. No one crumb was left. The spices were so flavorful and fresh. The heat factor was definitely present in very dish, but that is why they recommend the yoghurt condiment on the side. It was a swirl wind of flavors; some familiar, but some very foreign and pleasant.  Dishoom satisfies our Indian hankering ten fold!",

Crazy, but the line kept getting longer behind me so I figured it was a good sign. They kept bringing out chai for the people in line too, which was really nice -- plus, I actually got inside into the bar after about 40 minutes, and actually seated maybe 15 after that. They definitely have their system down, which I appreciated. The food and service were all really good. Everything I tried was great, so I don't think you can go wrong with anything, but definitely check out the dishes highlighted on the menu in the little boxes -- I had the pau bhaji and house daal and loved the flavors in both. For main I went with a \"boring\" choice, chicken tikka, but it too was really great, with all of the flavors in perfect combination.",

                "description": "My husband and I were in London for a long-weekend. I don't pretend to be an expert on Indian food at all, but I know good food, and this is it. We even went twice, when we're normally all about exploring new places, especially on vacation. \nThis location always has a crazy line, even earlier in the evening, but they are so kind, and give free amazingly good chai tea and a sweet liquor that I didn't like but my husband did (I think it's a sherry variety). I noticed how they also seem to overestimate how long the line will take, so you are happy to be seated earlier (so they say 1 hour, it's really 45 minutes). \nTo start, the food comes with 3 sauces. One is supposed to be more mild and is green and sweet. I loved it and found it very addictive. Another was more spicy, and my husband monopolized it. I don't remember what the third is, since we both were obsessed with our respective choices of sauce.\nThe garlic naan was addictive - warm and perfectly spiced. The masala prawns are also perfectly cooked and spiced.\nI'm normally not that big of a fan of chicken (I think it's hard to cook well and is either too chewy or too undercooked, and usually not seasoned well). But here, the chicken tikka is perfect - tender, and perfectly seasoned with ginger and a delectable green sauce.\nI also had the chaijito which was very good. Some flavored mojitos are terrible - overly sweet with no complex flavoring. This drink was not like that - it truly was a good mojito with complex chai spices, perhaps the same ones in their hot chai tea, which is also very good.  \nAll around great experience. Apparently it's a chain in London - wish it would come to New York!",

                "description": "By and large, London is known for having subpar food considering its status as a world class city. But the one culinary area they universally nail it is Indian food. Dishoom is a shining example of this. \nI've had my fair share of different Indian food styles. From upscale concepts to all-you-can-eat lunch buffets less than £10. Dishoom sort of does both. Elevated Indian fare that you'll pay something like £7 - £9 for. In a city that easily drain your bank account, it's a welcome respite. \nI had an array of different items from the menu. Many of which are identified in Yelp's review highlights. The black daal is special. The same goes for the the pau bhaji. But the star of the show was the ruby chicken. It belongs in some intersection of chicken tikka masala and a robust tomato stew. With juicy chunks of white meat chicken, it was understandable that everyone within a few tables of mine were ordering it with reckless abandon. Don't miss this if you know what's good for you.\nPaired with this bounty was one of the most enjoyable Negronis I've had in months. Being that gin has a huge footprint in this city, they know their botanical-based libations.\nOne bugger is that you'll definitely have to wait to eat. Apparently the average wait is about 80 minutes. It's totally understandable that you'd rather just eat at Five Guys instead of standing around, but if you exercise patience you'll be rewarded.",

The service is quick but the wait in line is nearly 1.5 hours on a busy evening.\nWe stopped by our 1 day in London because it was close to where we were staying in Mayfair. We waited for about 1.5 hours to be seated, but they did bring us chai and tea while we were in line to keep us occupied. \nSeating inside is cramped if you don't get a booth. The decor is very well done. \nThe portions are smaller then what you get stateside so be prepared to order more then you think you will need. Also, definitely get the gulfi at the end! It was delicious.",

                "description": "Not being a London local, I happened upon this place thanks to Yelp. I came in for lunch on a Sunday and somehow avoid the typically long queue that form outside. I did still have a wait of  about 7-10 minutes in the wind and light rain, but they serve warm chai outside. A few things stuck out for me. \nYou feel like you are entering a 4-5 star hotel or exclusive night club in the way they handle you. There are 2 door people who are outfitted with headsets. They take your name, after which the next 5 people will address you by name in the restaurant. \nOnce you get past the door people, there is a mini reception. They address your party by name and let you know that there is a bar downstairs where you can wait till your table is ready. When you get downstairs, another reception greets your party by name and shows you to the bar. At the bar, the bartender crafts cocktails for you, takes your credit card and hands you a proxy card to take with you to your table. \nThe table was ready in 5 minutes, while we were still sipping our drinks. When we arrived at our table, the host took our proxy card, again addressing our party by name. The food was very good. The service throughout was immaculate. The prices were very reasonable. \nAnother interesting bit -- all of the service staff were from Europe (e.g. Spain, etc...) -- not an Indian in site, but the food was clearly cooked by Indian hands. \nWould definitely come again.",

                "description": "I came to Dishoom on a Saturday night with three friends. This place is crazy busy, and they like to keep a line outside, so we joined the queue and waited. I think we were there by 7:15 or so, and got a table a bit before 9. Most of the wait was outside, until we finally made it into the bar. We ordered some cocktails, which were delicious. The pimms is actually too good, and was too easy to drink so we eventually switched to wine.\nAs we were 4, we decided to order a number of dishes to share. My friends got a few meat dishes (lamb chops, one coconut prawn curry, something with chicken) and we also shared dahl and a paneer curry, as well as rice, cheese naan, and some side salad-y cabbage-y dishes. Everything tasted really good, although it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had. The portions were quite generous I thought, and by the end of the meal I was so full I could barely move. The service here was amazing- all of the staff were friendly, we never felt rushed (even though by 10:30 there was still a huge lineup outside), and our food came quite quickly, which was very welcome after having stood outside for ages. The ambiance is also great, especially when with a fun group. I don't know that I'd come here for a date, or just a one-on-one dinner as it's quite busy and loud, but with our group we had a great time.\nI really enjoyed my evening here, but I don't think I would line up again for over an hour. The entire experience was great, but the food isn't worth a huge wait.",

The drink was so good it's like a mojito but with tequila and it was incredible. The chicken was so good and it was so perfectly cooked it tasted like butter. And the Naan they cooked perfectly there was not too much garlic and it was cooked where it wasn't too bready but still tasted awesome. The one downside is that it is pretty expensive. London overall is expensive but for a students budget it was a lot. It was £7.50 for the drink, £7.50 for the chicken, and £2.90 for the naan- so about 30 American dollars total. But will still come again!!!",

The minced lamb with peas and the toasted buns are good. They really go well together. The children ruby is the best. Usually I like the Indian chicken dishes because of the sauce and not the chicken. Here the chicken really absorbs the sauce and tastes a lot better than the sauce. I also ordered the garlic naan.

It was THAT good.\nIf you're in London, DO NOT MISS DISHOOM. You WILL regret it. To any critics of London's food scene, I say: go to Dishoom because you're wrong.\nLovely ambiance with marble tables and cute lighting, friendly servers, and an interesting mix of clientele. For dinner, my friend and I shared the okra fries, chicken ruby, Masala prawns, black house daal, garlic naan, and Roomala roti. Everything was EXCELLENT. We didn't manage to finish all of our food, but it was INCREDIBLE, and I was very sorry to leave food left over. \nWe couldn't stop talking about it and had to return the next morning to try the legendary bacon naan roll. For breakfast, we split the bacon naan roll, sausage and egg naan roll, Bombay omelette, and we each ordered breakfast lassis. I actually liked the sausage and egg naan roll better than the bacon naan roll, but both were phenomenal and lived up to the hype. The Bombay omelette was average, but hey, there's not much you can do with an omelette. The breakfast lassis (yogurt, banana, and mango topped with oats) were AMAZING.\nI don't know what I can say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said on Yelp.

My husband is not much of a fan, but he was willing to tag along. When we got to the restaurant, there was a line outside (in December--brrr) with an hour wait time quoted, and we decided to wait for a table (at least they serve tea and chai while you're waiting!). Well, the food was phenomenal and well worth freezing our tails off! My husband liked the food, so there's hope for him yet . However, if you are looking for a quiet place to dine, you will want to steer clear.",

I was in the area from a light shopping spree when I had the craving for some serious asian persuasion... My morale compass knew what time it was and I made my way to Dishoom! \nI was seated in the courtyard which was lovely actually.. Cosy and pretty at the same time! \nI had a cold glass of champagne to begin with and then went on to have my meal.... Here's where I lose points people.... I can't remember what I had! Lol \nWell I can't recall the name... But it was sublime! Flavour town, flavour planet .... FLAVOUR EMPIRE!!!!!!soft,juicy,well marinated chicken something!!! I mean I'm seriously reconsidering moving to Asia just so I can bask in flavours like these all day everyday!!! \nI can recommend the garlic naan which was yummy and the chutneys that they gave me were alllllllll delicious! \nOk look I could go on all day about this but I'd rather be eating more of the stuff so I'll leave you with this....

In fact, while waiting outdoors, a staff member provided complimentary hot chai and mint tea for folks on top of turning on the patio heaters which made the wait bearable for everyone.  Once inside, the atmosphere was lively both street and lower levels.  Service was superb from soup-to-nuts as the friendly staff came prepared with a food-allergy (dairy and nut free) friendly menu to keeping our glasses constantly full.  We ordered a variety of items, including Chicken Ruby, Vegetable Samosa, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan; all of which were simply delicious.  The food was cooked and served at the right temperature, the curry was not overly powering, and the spices were hot yet very tasty.  Although entree portions were somewhat modest, we left the restaurant feeling very satisfied.  On our way out, we were further amazed to witness two large crowds waiting in the front of the restaurant despite the darkness and cold weather (one would think Dishoom was a popular nightclub).  No doubt add Dishoom to your list of restaurants to enjoy when in London's Covent Garden.",

I stayed in the cold line and it was sprinkling at one point but I was not going to come all this way from SF to punk out now.

The only complaint that I had was that I didn't have enough room in my stomach to eat everything. It's the kind of place where even the basic side dishes warrant some praise (e.g., bowl of greens). \nThe service was really good and I appreciated that they didn't overseat even though it's clearly a popular place to eat. I'm sure that helps with the service and food for that matter. \nExpect a wait. We first tried to go in the evening, but it would have taken at least 2 hours. I don't care how good the food is supposed to be, but 2 hours is just too long for me to stand outside in the freezing cold. Yes, I might have been able to get inside and wait for your table earlier at the bar, but that still would have been a long time before that happened. We ended up going to lunch instead the following day and there was a 30 minute wait, with a 15-minute wait outside. Much better!",

While waiting, the staff severs a chai tea to everyone in line that would like one. You stand in line for about an hour until you get through the door, but wait there's more! Once you step in you get a buzzer to hold on to, and they will notify you when your table is ready. This will take another 30-45 minutes. While waiting you can grab a drink at the bar and a snack. We started with the Dishoom IPA, a Bollybellini and Far Far. The beer was decent, Bollybellini was interesting and the Far Far was crispy, colorful and lemony. We were finally seated and excited to order. We looked to Yelp reviews for some assistance and already knew what we wanted by the time we were seated. We had the Prawn Koliwada, Chicken Tikka, Black Daal and Garlic Naan. The prawns were very flavorful with a tamarind chutney. Chicken Tikka was bomb, especially with the garlic naan. Black Daal was so rich and full of flavor and also great with the garlic naan. At night it is very low lit but very cool atmosphere. The server was helpful and very attentive and the bathrooms were quite interesting. I recommend this place to all my friends that visit London, I can't wait to go back and try other menu items!",

Our servers took a while to get our drink order and bring us water initially, but once that was sorted things moved very quickly, and they were extremely gracious when some members of our party wanted runnier eggs, replacing the dishes and taking them off the bill, which was almost too kind!\nI got the akuri - lovely soft spiced scrambled eggs with some buttered buns and a grilled tomato.  This was a very simple dish, and a light breakfast, but the eggs were lovely with complex flavors.  If you're really hungry, get a side of some meat.  I got a side of some vanilla yogurt (you could see the vanilla bean flecks in it) with fresh fruit like grapes and mango and berries in it, which was just gorgeous and made a great side dish or brunch sharing plate.  Or just eat it yourself!  My husband loved his Big Bombay (like an Indian-spiced full English) and my sister-in-law said the bacon egg naan was perfect for a hangover.  It looked absolutely glorious so I'll have to get that next time.  In the end everyone thought their food was gorgeous - the only thing I could've wanted was quicker service initially, and less watery fresh orange juice (lots of ice cubes in the glass, felt like a bit of a rip off).  Also the buns that come with the eggs are quite plain - was hoping for something with a little more pizazz.  But all very minor complaints over the course of a generally terrific meal.\nWe also saw a server handing out mugs of chai to people waiting in line outside, so maybe DON'T make a reservation, haha!",

                "description": "Ok, I randomly picked this place because it has high reviews on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. But a lot of Indian restaurants have high ratings in London - so it truly was a random pick.\nThis is why I was shocked that there was a line waiting out the door at 3 pm on a random Saturday!! \nIt's all good though. We decided to wait and were seated within 30 minutes. Which was awesome. The staff was very friendly. I mean - VERY. I have nothing but positive things to say about the people working here.\nHowever, service was a bit slow. We showed up during a shift change and we kinda got lost in the shuffle with our waitress. But that being said, we took a while eating (one of the people dining with us has a condition that requires her to eat slowly) during a very busy time and not once did we feel rushed.\nBut why 3 stars? Well - because honestly I truly don't understand the hype. Yes, the food was good - but it was nothing special beyond a regular Indian restaurant. I think there's a lot of hype about this place and I'm not really sure why. I hear they have an amazing breakfast and a few wonderful and unique dishes, so maybe that's what bumps the rating up to 4 or 5 stars?\nTo me, it was a bit noisy and there were a few very odd dishes on the menu that don't scream \"Indian\" to me. Fried okra? But I guess it's all about what you're into. Everything we had was \"A-OK.\" Yes, I'd go back. But personally, I'd rather go someplace less touristy and less noisy.\nNot good for groups. Not good for children. Not good for romantic dining (since you won't be able to hear your date over the loud 40's music). But a cool experience.\nOh, and prices are pretty reasonable - even with all the hype. Order the chai! \nDishes we ordered:\nMahi-Mahi Tikka \nChicken Briyani\nVegetable Curry\nBlack Dhaal\nNaan\nVegetable Samosas",

I was so hungry and I have always been a fan of Dishoom, so why not try their brekkie menu.\nI ordered the big bombay and house chai. Woaaaaah talk about a big plate of food, a man beast portion to be exact! 4 rashers of streaky charred bacon, akuri - masala scrambled eggs, 2 shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns, and a side of ketchup in a small dish. I managed to eat majority of it, I loved the charred bacon - the slightly bbq, crisp in taste, the pork sausages were ok - nothing special. The akuri was my fave!!! So flavoursome, unique, the blends of spices mixed well and so yum with the buttered pau buns. \nTheir bacon is soured from The Ginger Pig, and it's probably the best I have had!\nThe house chai is definitely bombay style, slight too sweet for my liking, nonetheless perfect for a monday morning. \nAlso they don't take reservations for less than 4, so get there quickly to enjoy the vast array on their menu. if there is 6 or more, do book, they will tell you off if you don't!",

I've tried a lot of different things, but I love their chicken tikka and their garlic naan. Also, their chocolate chai is to die for. Even though you can't get refills on the chocolate chai, if you order it BEFORE 5, you can get free refills of the regular chai, which is amazing. Every time my friends come to visit, I always bring them to Dishoom and they are without a doubt, extremely pleased and satisfied. There is typically a line, but I've found that if you go at around 11:45, there aren't a ton of people and you can just sit there until their lunch starts. Alternatively, my friends and I have gone at around 9:30, and we only have to wait around 40 min or so. I really, really love this restaurant and I would recommend visiting at least once in London!",

There was a short line (midweek day) but they get you in & served @ a good clip. Also, even tho they are busy they don't make you feel rushed. As a light eater I opted for the Chicken Ruby, Garlic Naan & Salted Lassis. Perfect...although disappointing to not be with people to share a variety of all the fabulous choices.

Not the best Indian I've ever had but definitely up there. \nService:  They take great care of you here. We were waiting in the cold outside in line to get in, and the hostess would serve us warm tea while we wait.  The wait time, while long, didn't take longer than they had estimated. The one annoying thing about the service is this one of those places where the server feels the need to \"explain the menu\" to you, which came off like a cheap sales pitch to get us to order pricey appetizers.\nAtmosphere: Very trendy.  This ain't your mama's Indian restaurant.  Great decor inside.\nPrice: Very reasonable for the quality you get.\nLocation: Close to Covent Garden, so pretty convenient for tourists.\nOther Comments:  This is NOT a traditional Indian restaurant with a traditional menu.  They really only have a couple meat curries on the menu and everything else is some sort of creation that has to be exclusive to Dishoom.  It's a nice change of pace if you want to try something new.",

                "description": "Really fantastic Indian restaurant. Before I came to London, 3 different people told me that I absolutely had to go to Dishoom, even if I took none of their other recommendations. The first time, I tried to make reservations on my birthday (a Sunday night in November) for myself and two friends, but I found out that they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. So we prepared ourselves for the long wait and got in the queue around 5:30. The staff was handing out chai and mint tea for those waiting outside. We were outside for around 45 minutes before getting led to the bar downstairs, where we waited for another 20 minutes. After that, our waitress led us upstairs and we were finally seated in the warm, beautifully decorated dining area. I ordered a cup of the house chai right away (the samples really work), and my friends ordered mango lassis, which were refreshingly light compared to other ones I've had. We then ordered a bunch of different dishes to share between the three of us: Vegetable samosas, cheese naan (takes naan to the next level -- try it!!), paneer tikka, chicken ruby, mattar paneer, black dahl, and gunpowder potatoes. It really was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I think the black dahl was my favorite dish because I love lentils and it tasted the most unique. I don't eat meat, but the curry that came with the chicken ruby was fantastic. The chutneys that are served with the samosas are really wonderful -- ask for extra to eat with your rice. \nThe service here is very, very good -- we had 2 different waiters checking in on us but we never felt rushed or annoyed. When I came with a different friend a Monday night, she ordered the Chicken Tikka thinking that it came with curry, but it was just the meat by itself. She asked if it was possible to get Chicken Tikka Masala instead -- and in under a minute, they'd replaced her dish without any hesitation. Everything about Dishoom is wonderful, from the food to the staff to the decor. I've never heard about anyone having a negative experience here. Whether you're in London for months, weeks, or days, definitely put this restaurant on your list.",

I had brought some clients ( a group of 6)  to have dinner and they were all flabbergasted with how good the food was. I have to say that everything that was on the menu was amazing. The service is phenomenal as was the manager helping us get a great table upstairs. It worth every penny you pay. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE IF YOU HAVE A GROUP otherwise you will be waiting for some time outside in the line up sipping on Chai. Thank god I made reservations 2 days previous to my dinner.",

                "description": "I want to tell the owners of Dishoom to open a branch in NYC and I'll gladly run it for them! \nWe've been here 5 times over the course of two years and love the authentic, Bombay street food-style small plates done just right.\n5 star dishes on the menu:\n-- Vegetarian (potato + peas filling) or the lamb kheema samosas - both are excellent and a safe bet.\n-- Okra Fries: crispy, savory, yummy. I dream of them. \n-- Keema Pau - mince lamb meat served with traditional bread called Pau- a little oily, but also spicy - the husband swears by it.\n-- Black House Daal: one of the best we've tried. Buttery and rich without being too overwhelmingly heavy to digest. (sample with white rice)\n4 star dishes: \n--Pau Bhaji: potatoes, tomatoes and other veggies mashed beyond recognition in a red color mixture that is a little fiery, a little tangy. I swear by it.\n-- Prawn Kolidwada: tiny prawns deep fried beyond recognition - what's not to love about pepper shrimp? \n3 star dishes:\n-- Chicken ruby: the eponymous chicken tikka masala rechristened by Dishoom. A little too tomato-y for my liking, wasn't blown away by it. There are better dishes on this menu. \nDesert: I love the mango kulfi here, it's beautifully flavored with cardomom and not too sweet.\nService: Very friendly and efficient most of the times.\nDecor: This is my favorite part. Modeled on the lines of mostly-defunct Irani cafes in Bombay, India, Dishoom stays true to spirit, elevating the retro-vibe to a more upscale level. Expect to see quirky ads and vintage Indian Bollywood posters that are a blast from the past for patrons like us. Nostalgia done right! Even the restroom wash basins are modeled from the ones in India back in the 60s and 70s.   \nTip: Get a reservation if you can. Otherwise expect to wait at least 25-30 minutes anytime of day or evening.",

Their naan rolls are the best way to start the day (I'm torn between bacon and egg vs. sausage and egg, so I tend to switch off between the two each time I visit). For lunch/dinner, their gunpowder potatoes shouldn't be missed, and their raita is phenomenal. Pro tip: skip the chai, make note that their biryani dishes are a bit dry, and be aware that the food is spicier than expected (although this doesn't negatively affect the palate). Great service, too. Let's just say there's a reason Dishoom is rated among the top Indian restaurants in London. :)",

They offered us chai tea during the wait and it wasn't raining, so that was OK. They have an efficient system where they can tell you exactly how much you've been waiting and are very respectful of the order in which you arrived, so it felt like a fair process. \nWe ordered the dahl (house recommendation, £7), a chicken dish (£11) with rice (£2.50), and garlic and cheese naans (£3 each). The dishes were good, but quite spicy, despite being described as mild, and not out of this world - very similar to Indian restaurants in Paris, which are not considered as the best preserved international food in France. The naans were incredible though - we hesitated to order more at the end of our meal, and one week after I'm still longingly thinking about them. Nah, I'm not food-obsessed AT ALL (: \nIs it good? I guess, if you are more of a spice-lover than us. Is it worth queuing up for 1 hour? Don't think so.",

Maybe (I would like to try the curry) but I'm not in any rush. Is it worth it to come here when you see massive queues outside? Hell no!

Maybe I'm just used to the cheap great tasting Indian food in Boston but this restaurant didn't live up to the high hype.  It is a good choice but not a crazy out of this world restaurant which many seem to indicate.  It's my first Indian restaurant in London in 20 years so I have to try a few more.

                "description": "This place definitely knows how to make people wait. My friend and I got there around 6 (which we thought was pretty early) and there was already an hour queue. The thing is, you have to stay in the queue the whole time instead of just leaving your number and coming back. To make the wait better, we were given chai and some dessert liquor. After about 40 minutes, we were taken into the bar and finished waiting there. It honestly didnt feel as long as it was rather it just felt like part of the experience.\nThe inside is simply but well decorated. The staff is very friendly and helpful about explaining the food and how the restaurant works. My friend is indian and so she ordered for both of us. The food came pretty quickly and everything we ordered was delicious. The chicken biryani was probably the best Ive ever had and went perfect with the daal. \nOverall a fabulous meal. The restaurant does not disappoint and I get the hype around it. Highly recommend but pro tip is to head there around an hour and a half before you want to eat.",

Take me back to London please. Britain's food is notoriously well known for being foul, but their Indian is spot-on. No, the food is NOT authentically Indian. It is very fusiony. However, that doesn't mean it's not mind-bogglingly delicious. A spot that you HAVE to try if you're ever in town.",

It was, as you might suspect, a lot for a party of three. But everything was wonderful, so other than portion control I really had no issue with our very large order. \nI especially liked the Matter Paneer! I'm not usually one for vegetarian dishes, but the sauce was rich and flavourful which fit my palate perfectly. The Pau Bhaji was good, but I don't really enjoy having fried bread as a \"bread\" so perhaps if you share my preferences, you could skip that.\nService here was excellent! Our server checked in with us every once in a while, ensuring that we never ran out of water etc. \nMy only gripe would be that it was a little pricey. One garlic naan is 2.50 and when that's converted to SGD, that's around 5 dollars! One naan in Singapore is probably half that price at worst. Oh well!\nAll in all, great food, great service but not so great prices.",

                "description": "I've heard from many people that London has fantastic Indian food, so what better place to start than the most reviewed place on Yelp?\nDishoom has a wait that exceeds one hour for most of the day during peak meal times - be prepared for this by either making reservations or being willing to wait. They are definitely prepped for the amount of people they get each day, though! If you come for dinner, they'll have hot tea for you while you wait in line. Around twenty minutes into the line, they'll take you inside to the bar area where you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait for a table to clear up. Once you have a table, you can go and order all of the food that you want.\nI'm a huge fan of their ruby chicken, garlic naan, and Dishoom chicken tikka. Also, the potatoes that they serve are fantastic. I ordered a drink at the bar - it was a chai-infused apple cider, but it was a bit of a miss for me (and a little on the pricey side £6.50 a bottle).\nOverall, come here if you want some great Indian food in the heart of London - if you can deal with the wait, it'll definitely be worth your while!",

I thought the complementary chai tea while you stood in line was an expert touch, but otherwise, the food was not all that it is hyped up to be. The chicken ruby was a little too sweet. The lamb was delicious. The Dahl was good but the naan was a little too crispy. The lamb samosas were my favorite dish of the evening, but you only get 3 of them...lame. The place was super busy, so I didn't feel like we got a super friendly/helpful waiter. Overall, I would eat here again, but only if I didn't have to wait in line for an hour.

In fact, we dined there three times during our one-week stay in London because we enjoyed it so much. \nEverything that we had (Chicken tikka, lamb, samosa, calamari, etc.) was delicious. I cannot have dairy and it was wonderful that there was a dairy-free menu. For items that were prepared to be dairy free (i.e., no butter used), I appreciated that there were \"allergy\" markers on the food. I can't tell you what a relief it was to eat a meal at a restaurant without being terrified that I would have a reaction.  \nOn each of our 3 visits, everyone we encountered, from the people at the door, to the hostess, to the bartenders, to the wait staff, was friendly and helpful.\nAs others have warned, it does get busy. If you make it there before 5:30pm, there isn't much of a wait.  After that, expect to wait.  One night, we got there about an hour before they closed, and we still had to wait 30 minutes.  I was told that during their busiest time, you can expect to wait at least 2 hours.  It is worth the wait though.",

I live in Los Angeles and just wish they would expand to the US. I dream about going back to London just to eat at Dishoom again cause there is nothing like it. \nI've been to Dishoom 3-4 times. For both breakfast and lunch. The breakfast is amazing with the limitless chai (although not sure this limitless applies to all locations). My favorite is the fruit and yoghurt. Which I don't know how they make their yogurt and have attempted to recreate. (I even bought a yogurt maker to make it and also googled various recipes to try - all to no avail). Their yogurt has the just right amount of sweetness to it with the honey and vanilla. With the fruit I could eat this everyday. The naan rolls (sausage and bacon) are amazing as well. I love the tomato jam in the rolls, that I asked the waiter if they sold the jam and sadly they do not but if they did, I would buy it. \nFor lunch I agree with the other reviews. Bombay Colada. WOW and WOW. Again tried to re-create this drink at home to no avail. Just amazing. I could drink like 10 of these. Also agree the black house daal is one of a kind. Very flavorful. At Shoreditch I got the Lamb Raan Bun which was like a lamb pull apart sandwich. Exceptional. \nOverall Dishoom is just amazing. I think an exceptional restaurant is food taken to another level which makes it unique from others and to their own. Also to the point that you can't just go home and recreate it. You have to go there in order to eat it. Dishoom is both. Their food is unlike other Indian restaurants you have tried and in attempts to recreate it, I've tried and failed. I wish they would release a cookbook as I would be the first to buy it!!",

Greeted at the table, they explained the menu to me and were super helpful. \nAs I was dining, I was asked by 4 separate waiters for a total of 6 times if everything was alright. They gave me 4 chai refills (server name was: Moali and the manager was Sarune). Suffice to say, the service was impeccable. I'd go back for the service alone, but getting on to the food....\nFood\nAs a traveler, dining alone is hard. Especially at an Indian or Chinese restaurant where everything is intended to be shared... Or for people like me who just wants to eat everything! I could just sample a small portion of the menu, and I had the calamari as an appetizer and balsamic rice + prawn curry. \nThe calamari was deep fried and very sweet. I was instantly addicted despite knowing how bad it was for me. Superb. \nThe House Chai was also amazing. I had studied abroad in India and this is the closest I've had to authentic Chai. Not too much sugar, milk and just perfect all around. \nPro tip: there's unlimited refills until 5pm. \nThe prawn curry was the house special and came with generous portions of gigantic shrimps. The curry was rich and flavorful... I could and did drink much of it by itself. \nAnd the balsamic rice... Spectacular. I don't normally comment on rice, perhaps desensitized as I eat it daily. There's something special about the long grain cooked with coconut milk. \nLastly my meal was completely free. On Mondays, at the end of your meal, you'll roll a dice and have a gamble with fate. If you get a 6, your meal is on the house! I had no idea this was the case and thank my travelers luck to be here on a Monday!",

                "description": "There aren't many times when you wake-up (in London), stretch, call your local friend about where to go for breakfast and they say - \"How about this Indian joint?\"\nHuh?\nYeah, my thoughts exactly! I'm all for Lamb Vindaloo kicked up to to a level 10 on the Indian spice scale or a Naan dredged in Butter chicken sauce so deep that you can't tell where the BC begins and the Naan ends! But before 11am? I danno guys...\nAnd then there was Dishoom, Sweet merciful gods of Indian cuisine, what the WHAT!\nSo basically, the geniuses in the kitchen here have taken traditional english breakfast faves, slapped it upside the bread with some Indian spice, and boom - everything is nice. End of story. I didn't think this would be possible, call me a doubting Thomas, but I needed proof, and safe to say I got some.\nTo begin, I opted out of my normal breakfast coffee for a House Chai (or 4) @ £2.50, I was gulping this stuff by the gallon and better than tea, better than coffee, better than freshly squeezed OJ, this made my stomach oh so happy and calm after a few days of adjusting to British fare and a long flight.\nFollowing my chai time, I didn't give my stomach too much of a break and went with the Kejriwal which is two fried eggs on chilli cheese toast. As described in the menu as \"A favourite of the well-to-do Willingdon Club, the first such Bombay institution to admit natives; the dish is reputedly named for the member who kept asking for it. (Not to be confused with Arvind Kejriwal, leader of India's Aam Aadmi - common man's - political party.)\" - £4.90\nHistory lesson aside, this was a beautifully flavourful meal, part normal breakfast that I'm used to and part \"kick-it up a notch, Indian HELLO\" (waves excitedly).\nI was so impressed, and breakfast is a hard meal to impress me with - rest assured I'll be back when I'm in the UK again! \nPro-tip: The Breakkie/Brunch crowd starts to queue up around 10/10:30am so make a reso or get there early\nEatcrest Out!",

That's not to say it's not a tasty place with a fun ambience but I never go here unless guests are in town who request it, or if I so happen to be in the neighbourhood with time to kill. \nIt's a fairly well oiled machine of the queue line w drinks while you wait, to the drinks bar area, to finally being sat and served. Menu changes with some frequency but I would suggest, if available the \nChili Cheese Toast - exactly like it sounds, solid entree choice\nChicken Tikka - a 'classic' dish for the less ambitious and whitewashed, but still yummy \nLamb Raan Bun (except without the bread) - like a shredded lamb on the bone, this was by far the star. So flavorful and filling.\nBlach House Daal (lentils) - It's slight more refined spaghetti-o sauce with lentils. I wouldn't order it\nGarlic Naan - yum, always yum",

                "description": "After looking at the yelp reviews, went there on my second day in London.  There was a line outside and was told a wait of 1 1/2 hrs.  Hmmm,  decided nothing can be worth that wait,  walked around covent Garden and had pretty good food at 'punjab' restaurant.  \nA few days pass and I was walking around the area, saw the line wasn't too big,  decided to take the leap. It was a looong wait, an hour in the cold outside. Finally I was shown in and directed to the bar in the basement cos my table was apparently still not ready. It was a little surprising as I was walking by a bunch of empty tables. The bar area was mostly empty,  it could easily absorb almost everyone standing in the line outside in the cold..  But hey,  that's not my worry..  As I am inside now and it is warm..  Nice. \nFinally I am shown to the table that was empty all the time I was standing at the bar. The menu is unique by basically having a few different choices but mostly just renaming most of the usual Indian restaurant food. By this time I am just excited to be sitting at my table and I go ahead and order the usual chicken and paneer dishes. And now I wait... Well actually, the wait was not long..  Surprisingly it just took them two mins to bring my food..  Part of me was very excited till I started to taste cold chicken tikka, cold romali roti and chicken Ruby which was just a bland tasting butter chicken with dry boneless chicken pieces ... \nSuggestions -  don't make people wait for hours in the cold to make the demand appear to be above capacity. Try and make food at order so it gets to the table not cold like it was waiting to be picked up ten mins ago. \nOverall - like I said earlier,  most of the time, no food Is worth an hour waiting in line, freezing London cold or not. If you are one of those folks reading reviews standing in that line, Take this advice - Go walk over to Talli Joe, a 5 mins walk to Soho and enjoy better food and amazing cocktails.",

                "description": "The ratings for Dishoom are legit as this is probably some of the best modern take on indian food I've ever had.   The only problem about this place is that the wait was pretty horrendous as you have to line up outside, and once you are actually in, the tell you to wait downstairs at the bar for your pager to go off.  Not a problem since the food was worth it.  At least while waiting outside, a waitress served us hot mint water to help us bare the cold weather.   \nHere's what we had:\nBlack House Daal:  This is a very tasty dish if you like beans (if you don't, stay away).  I believe they used lentil in this one.  The flavor is kind of similar to Tikka masala with the starchiness of the slow cooked beans.  This dish is definitely very filling. \nPau Bhaji: Tasty vegetable mash.  I wouldn't say this is a must order but it was definitely solid.   \nPrawn Koliwada: I like they way the spicyness and flavor are really exploding in your mouth.  This were some tasty prawns.  The prawns were small though...\nSpicy Lamb Chops: This dish was good as well but not a must order.  I wish it would have had more of a sear on it, but the flavors were there.\nChicken Ruby: Probably my favorite dish of the night.  The chicken is cooked in a makhani sauce, which is basically Tikka masala with more emphasis on a tomato-cream base.  Mouth watering deliciousness here.\nLamb Boti Kabob: These were good and had a nice marinade of chilli and ginger.\nGarlic Naan: This was good, but you'll probably want to put in 2 orders, unless you ordered as much food as I did for 2 people.  \nDon't miss this place as the flavors here are quite different than what you can find in the States.  \n5 stars.",

Once you're inside the atmosphere is charming and the decor is highly polished while still feeling casual.\nThe food is superb. Be sure to try a grill and the Pav Bhaji. Be careful ordering spicy items if you can't handle spicy as they are truly hot, which is a good thing!\nPrices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food, although the dishes are not especially large. 2 dishes per person seems to work well.",

The only acceptable answer. \nI ate here in May to celebrate a birthday. It was raining, as it so often is in London, but the long line seemed to pass by quickly as we were served different kinds of chai while we waited to be seated. Once inside, the wait at the bar was wonderful and filled with samosas and red wine. \nI had the mattar paneer, black dhal, cheese naan, and chocolate chai. Every single thing was absolutely amazing, especially the black dhal. Dhal is served everywhere, but I have never had dhal like this, it's warm and comforting and exiting all in one and amazing with cheese naan. The chocolate chai is incredible, it's like a spiced hot chocolate tea, and I loved it. \nI loved Dishoom so much that I went for breakfast later that week at their location in Shoreditch, which was also amazing. Highly recommend the masala beans there. I LOVE DISHOOM. I wish there was a word to better express the extent of the deliciousness.",

The bacon naan was good but it didn't wow me as the other two dishes. We also got their house chai tea and cappuccino. I received a refill of the team but wasn't charged for it. Not sure if they offer free refills or if this was an exception. \nTruly a unique dining experience and I'm hopeful someone will open a similar restaurant in New York.

The homemade samosas from my co-workers taste so much better.\nChicken Ruby - Tasted like it was made with canned tomato sauce.\nLamb Biryani - Again lamb was tough and not tender. Almost chalky, which again makes me think \"not fresh\". I cook with lamb very often and it's not difficult to get it tender. Rice had great flavor though.\nGarlic Naan - Very good\nMango Kulfi - Very good\nThe Line - As I finished my meal I counted the number of empty seats upstairs and downstairs when I went to the restroom...the number of empty seats exceeded the number of people standing in line, which was about 20 people. So why the line? To create false sense of exclusivity or popularity? Or are there simply not enough staff to handle a full restaurant?\nOverall, I say it's okay but not worth an 1+ hour wait in line.",

Most of the reviews on Yelp probably already explain it all but to reiterate, I am very satisfied with my time there. \nI came by on my way to the airport so I was by myself but the food is definitely prepared in a way for sharing. I would love to go back with a group and try a bunch more things. \nThe staff was very accommodating to me, the put my luggage in the back room which was amazing. It took up way too much room anyways. \nThere was a line but it goes quick and it really is worth it. They send you down to the bar first and then when a table is ready they seat you. I didn't try any of the drinks this time around but they looked great. I definitely want to come back and experience Dishoom again :)",

The decor is stylish, modern, and trendy, unlike any other Indian restaurant I've been to back in California. \nThe service was great, everyone was friendly and food came out promptly. \nWhat we ordered:\nChai tea: as good as everyone says!\nKeema pau: sooo good. Get it!\nBlack daahl: nothing impressive...I didn't prefer it\nChicken Ruby: bursting with flavor! My favorite dish.\nGarlic naan: perfectly toasted and light, with clumps of fresh garlic.

                "description": "I can only postulate the kitsch of eating indian food in the heart of london and the assumption that a long line must mean great food has brought this place unwarranted attention.  The wait in line is about 45 min. as they refused to take a reservation from me when I passed by the restaurant earlier in the afternoon.  The other people in line (whether London natives or tourists, I don't know) and of course the two hosts at the door raved about the place and assured me that the wait would be worth it.\nFirst: this is NOT authentic indian food, north, south, east, west, or heart of india, pakistan, bangladesh, Afghanistan, what have you.  It is FUSION.  For those who already knew that, i'm just stating the obvious then.  For those who didn't, this is fusion, pan-indian, and likely not what you will find if you visited any of the above countries.  \nSecond: the food is spicy.  I like spicy food, but it seemed to me that the vast majority of their dishes were spicy and there was not much variation.  Even the okra fries!\nThird: The kacchi lamb dish (cubes of dry lamb under a mound of rice) is by far the driest piece of rubbish I have ever tasted in my life.  I had to cut it up into little tiny pieces, douse it in their black daal before I could even eat the thing.  Utterly horrible.  I'm also not quite sure what the hype is over this black daal.  Not amused.\nLast: To end on a good note, service is very good as they are attentive and helpful.  In a city that makes you bleed money, this place is actually relatively affordable.  But overall, not worth the wait, not even for 45 seconds.",

Food is just fine--over-spiced and lacking subtlety or variety of flavor but made with fresh ingredients. A request for \"extra yogurt on side\" got me a vat of the stuff. Chai spice is VERY PRESENT but fails to complement the tea, masking it instead. The food may have the right components, but the soul necessary to combine them properly isn't there. The ambiance is Corporate Chain inside a Mall of America. Staff was pleasant!",

                "description": "I had heard great things about Dishoom, and made up my mind to visit the next time I was in London! My first attempt was on a Sunday at 2PM, and even then was told that the wait would be 1.5 hours!! I decided I would put my name down, but then was super confused when the greeters immediately ushered me downstairs and to the bar -- apparently, you have to wait for your spot either at the bar or right outside the restaurant aka I couldn't go and shop or do anything while I waited.... No thank you! \nI tried again the next day around 12:30PM for lunch and this time was pleasantly surprised when I immediately got a table (I was eating alone so that's probably part of the reason!). I usually don't mind eating alone but this time felt really uncomfortable for the first 8-10 minutes when I was clearly waiting to order but none of the 5 waiters in the area bothered stopping by.\nEventually I got the waitress' attention and she suggested that I try the chicken ruby (aka butter chicken) with garlic naan, which is exactly what I did! The garlic naan was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Just the right amount of crispy, still soft, and the garlic flavor was perfect. The chicken was spicy (which I love) but wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped -- I wish it were a bit creamier, but the meat was sumptuous and overall quite a good meal.\nOne thing to note: for a 5'4\" girl, the food portions were perfect! However, it can be a bit pricy for the amount that you get, especially the chai latte which was microscopic! Still delicious, just a heads up to order more naan or another dish if you're very hungry!!",

They tell me to go downstairs to the bar and have a drink b/c it looks like it'll be another 20 minutes.  Fine, I oblige.   I order drinks and they tell me my table is ready.  Low and behold it was the table that freed up and sat empty for 15-20 minutes while they get me to order drinks at the bar. Whatever\nThat aside, the food was delicious.

Eerily prompt.  60 seconds prompt. We ordered, and suddenly there were amazingly delicious greens at our table.\nEven the bar was well-considered; We enjoyed a fantastic whiskey cocktail that I still think about and smile. \nWe also had a chicken tikka that the draft of this review describes as \"Best tikka ever.\"\nThis was one of the happiest meals we've ever enjoyed.

I was almost sure I would be let down because this was just too much hype, but boy Dishoom delivers. To start off, there is always a wait, we tried thrice, at three different times and there was a wait each time. We waited for about 30 minutes, the line moved quickly. We waited at the bar for 10 minutes and their cocktails are pretty amazing, we had the chili martini, pimms and an old fashioned and everything was great. A friend tried the sweet and salty nimbu soda (lemon soda) which was so authentic, just like the ones we used to have as kids and they even let us adjust the salt to sweet ratio! \nWe ordered a lot of food and nothing disappointed. For starters we had chilli cheese toast, vada pau, bhel puri and paneer tikka. The paneer tikka and Vada pau were exceptionally good ! Chilli cheese toast is a childhood favorite so that was my personal favorite. For the main course we had the black dal, a couple of chicken biryanis and the Chana Batura, the dal and Batura were lip smacking good. Can't fault the food in this place, it's really tasty. We were too stuffed to the dessert or have coffee and chai. If only they were not so crowded all the time we would have had a few more meals here. I especially like the sound of their breakfast menu. Until next time Dishoom,it's time to open one in NYC !! \nThe service was lovely. Attentive and very polite even though they were handling such huge crowds.",

A friend and I had to wait in line for 45 minutes on a Monday night when I was in London. During the wait, they handed out some hot water with mint as it was chilly and raining in London that night.\nAs soon as we were seated, they took our orders. The food here is served tapas style (small plates that can be shared amongst your party). \n1) Chicken Ruby - It is very similar to chicken tikka masala. It has a delicious, creamy tomato-based sauce that is very flavorful. Hands down, one of the best dish Indian dishes I've had in my life.\n2) Black House Daal - Although this dish was flavorful, it didn't stand out to me as much, probably because it was overshadowed by the other dishes we ordered.\n3) Vegetable biryani - I think the biryani could have used some more flavor. I personally didn't think there was anything special about this dish. I would assume their lamb biryani is tastier, and I would definitely order that instead when I come back. \n4) Mattar Paneer - The tomato-sauce base is very similar to the Chicken Ruby's, but with panner and vegetables instead of chicken. My friend is a vegetarian and really enjoyed this dish; highly recommended for the vegetarians.\n5) Garlic Naan - The naan is crispy on the edges and chewy, soft, and buttery on the inside, just the way I like my naan. They definitely does not skimp out on the garlic flavor of the naan. It is delicious! I would book a flight to London today just for this if I could.\n6) House Chai - The perfect balance of sugar, spice, and everything nice in one hot drink, perfect for a chilly London evening.\nI would definitely come back to Dishoom when I visit London again.",

After 30 minutes in line (6:30 pm on a Thursday), we got a table. \nBetween the two of us, we shared the Paneer Tikka, Gunpowder potatoes, Black House Daal, Paneer roll, and Mahi Tikka. Unfortunately, none of the dishes stood out in terms of flavor profile. Good, but not memorable. I expected the dark and deep flavors of the Black House Daal to mesmerize me, but it was served room temperature and more porridge-y. The Mahi in the Mahi Tikka was tender, but didn't contrast with anything, let alone the yogurt it was served with. I did get a lot of the charred, smoky flavor in the Paneer Tikka, but then again that was it. The Gunpowder potatoes were also disappointing. I didn't get the aroma from seeds or herbs at all. \nI really really wanted to fall in love with this restaurant. I think it must be the hype as well as the way all the dishes are described on the menu that makes you have higher expectations. Dishoom was just ok. I wouldn't return for the price.",

Chicken was light on sauce which I like, but intensely flavored, well seasoned and best of all cooked perfectly juicy.  Garlic naan was buttery, hot, and almost crispy - I liked the three dipping sauces that range from salty to sweet to barely spicy.  The rice came in a good sized bowl, and although plain was essential for accompanying the strong flavors.\nI passed on dessert but got a Virgin Bombay Colada - a nice play on a Piña Colada but it was green (perhaps from mint) with a nice topping of fennel seeds and other spices for effect.  Not bad!  Note that still water is charged by the bottle.",

The food is amazing, and really that's all that really matters. For dinner I had the lamb awadhi biryani and its so rare to actually get a proper biryani anywhere.Roomali roti is another thing you can't get outside India very much, and their version is fantastic. \nBut I actually really loved the breakfast. The kejriwal, chilli cheese toast with eggs was amazing. Also bun maska and chai in proper chai glasses. What more could you want? \nThe lines do get seriously absurdly long. We arrived right at 5 and had no wait. And for breakfast since we had a group of over 6 we were able to make a reservation.\nIt really is worth the hype.",

The cocktails were fabulous, and so is the decoration (those mirrors!!), the staff was lovely and pudding was quite wonderful, but the rest could simply have been better. \nIt was mainly lacking the balance and complexity of flavour I was expecting from such a high reputation restaurant. \n...

Just keep in mind Indian cuisine is insanely varied with very different style depending on the regions, Dishoom takes you to the old Irani Cafes of Bombay!! Everything about it takes you there - obviously the food and the smell but also the beautiful decor and the insane attention to detail! Staff has always been more than friendly. It's often very busy and requires queue but lovely touch as the staff offers you complimentary chai or mint tea whilst you wait. \nLet's start with a quick review of the breakfast menu - unfortunately for my liking breakfast menu at the weekend is only served until 11.45am... I mean seriously? That's not right! I tried to go couple times and failed! Successfully got there once at the weekend. However, I am lucky enough to work in media industry which means I have the privilege to take clients out and a Dishoom Breakfast is always a success! Love the bacon & egg naan bread - simple, basic but excellent. The Mango Lassi is to die for!! Absolutely delicious, not technically on the breakfast menu but it's not a problem for them. \nBefore moving on to the lunch/dinner menu I do want to mention the cocktails! Oh my! Their Bombay Colada & the Edwina's affair are to die for! Amazing flavoursome twist to classics! \nFinally, the food... The Chicken Ruby is an absolute must. The Okra fries are genius. The sauces dishes are amazing to dip with your garlic or cheese naan! But even the less saucy dishes are cooked to perfection. Slight disappointment with the paneer roll to be honest. It was good but not extraordinary. I think it's more something to have on the go so perhaps doesn't work so well at a sit down dinner. I don't know, the flavours were there but just wasn't really working for me. Finally the puddings! That chocolate fondant with the chilli ice cream is great! Wobbles & melts in your plate and then your mouth, amazing combination with the ice cream. Otherwise you cannot go wrong with the kulfi on a stick!",

Also the dishoom IPA was a great beer - the best I've which was brewed exclusively for a restaurant.  \nIf you're going to go, know there is usually a queue. We tried to go early around 5 and still had to wait around 30 minutes for a table of 2.

We ate until we had crossed the line marked \"full\" and we had no regrets. My favourite choice was the spicy lamb chops: great flavour, not overpowering, and as tender as you like. The black house daal was also well-liked.\nI ordered the house chai and later found out that I could have unlimited refills!

We'd heard a lot about how good the Indian food in London is and we were eager to try it for real. \nFor tipples (acting British now lol), we got a pitcher of the Bombay Pimm's which was quite refreshing. \nFor appetizers, we got a Keema Pau (spiced minced lamb and peas served with a toasted buttered pau bun). The keema was out of this world and tasted very similar to what it would back home. What joy in every bite!\nFor the main course we went with the Chicken Ruby (recommended a lot on the other reviews) and the Haleem because it sounded delicious going by the description. \nThe chicken ruby is a very tangy take on a traditional chicken makhani and the roomali roti is the perfect vehicle for scooping up the gravy. Slurp.\nWe were so engrossed in eating that we forgot about the Haleem (a slow-cooked dish with lamb, wheat, barley, lentils and spices) which arrived a few minutes later. The Haleem which came with a side order of naan and extra condiments like fried onions,  chillies and lemon had a very good consistency and a rustic flavor that makes us drool every time we think about it.\nFor dessert, our friends recommended the Memsahib's Mess (fresh cream with crushed meringue, strawberries, rose syrup and a rose petal preserve known as gulkand) which we demolished despite being full to the brim.\nEasily one of the most memorable Indian meals that we've had outside of India. Too bad it's not a stone's throw away :(",

My friend and I came here at 8am in the morning and found it empty for once (the line is SO LONG for dinner). \nI love the decor in here. It's chic, spacious, open and comfortable. Wafts of yummy smells also surround you as you sit waiting to order and eat. After looking at the menu, we had a hard time deciding so we decided to share the naan egg roll (around 5 pounds) and the granola with yogurt and fruit (5.60 pounds I think). Both were really good, especially the naan egg roll. This place is definitely underrated for breakfast!\nThe naan had that perfect chewy, doughy consistency and the two fried eggs were still slightly runny. The tomato spread, cream cheese and sweet chutney perfectly complemented each other. The portion is cut into two pieces, and perfect for one person. The granola with yogurt was a little bit too sweet for our tastes, but it was still really good with vanilla yogurt, honey, fresh fruits (melon, pineapple, grapes, blueberries) and the contrasting texture of crunchy granola.\nWe also ordered coffees (2.50 pounds for an iced Americano or latte). My Americano was probably the best coffee I've had since coming to England and so, so worth it. \nI definitely recommend this place for a quality breakfast at a reasonable price!!",

                "description": "DISHOOM DISHOOM! Is this the sound of a Bollywood punch?  Or perhaps as the menu suggested, the sound of the food zooming to your table? I tried to figure it out and after eating there, I personally think this is the sound of the flavours exploding in your mouth (Bollywood flavour punch in the mouth?)\nThe dish that had the punch was the famous house black daal, which was really delicious and full of exciting tastes. Nothing else I tried was quite so exciting, but the rightly popular pau bhaji was also a delicious mix of flavours and I loved it too. I have never had pau bhaji before and wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a lovely saucy vegetable mix packed with yumminess that you can eat with garlic naan or whatever bread you prefer. I also really enjoyed the chilli cheese toast, which was such a fun thing to order. Perhaps if I went back I might be able to continue the search for more dishoom flavour! :)\nNow to less flavoursome dishes. The kacchi lamb biryani was just okay and had not much meat in it, so I wouldn't recommend it. The haleem was better but after a few bites got a bit boring. The masala chai and mango lassi were okay, but I have had better lassi and I don't believe I've ever found a place outside of the subcontinent that can make masala chai the same way. \nSurprisingly, I did enjoy the interestingly spelled Thums Up soda. Thums Up is the Indian Coca-Cola and tastes as if you left a can of coke next to a sack of cardamom, but in a surprisingly good way. The logo is a hand giving the thumbs up sign, and I really enjoyed the spelling after seeing that. The pistachio kulfi was a good way to end the meal, it wasn't the best I've had but was rich and sweet and hit the spot.\nAs people have said, there is a long wait to get in. I went around 6 and ended up outside in the rain for 45 minutes. Dishoom was kind enough to lend us an umbrella and also to pass out masala chai cups to people in line. I did notice though that after 8:30 on a weekday, there was no line at all, so if you don't want to stand in line, perhaps come around then instead and miss the early rush. \nDishoom I notice, also has dates for people who are fasting during Ramadan if you ask for them, and has a special Eid menu coming up which notes that all chicken and lamb are always halal at Dishoom. I really like how considerate they are and look forward to going back again sometime! Their holi celebration also looked amazing on the website and I hope to go next year. They also have something special called a lamb raan bun, which you can only get at the Shoreditch branch, so I will definitely be checking that out!",

                "description": "So before I go too far with this review, and before you stop reading it (as presumably you're aghast at only 3 stars), bear with me.\nI hail from a part of Sydney with one of the highest concentrations of Indian population & restaurants in the country. Subsequently, I'm used to very good Indian food, from all regions of India. And when I say very good, I mean excellent.\nRight, now that that's out of the way...\nI trust Yelpers implicitly. I've had so many fantastic experiences by following Yelp reviews wherever I travel. Subsequently, I'm a little curious as to how high a rating Dishoom got. Don't get me wrong - it was all good. There was nothing bad about the meal I had. It's just that there was nothing stunning about the food I had. Maybe my expectations were too high as I had to wait almost an hour to get in. Maybe I'm just used to a different style of Indian food (maybe the food in Sydney was adjusted to local tastes?). Maybe I just got there on a not so good night? Or maybe my taste buds were just off?...\nRegardless, if you're after a good feed, this place will give it to you. It was definitely satisfying. But then, balancing that with the price and the wait, maybe there's somewhere else you could go, for better food, less coin, and less of a wait?",

Only problem is they require you to wait in line the entire time. You can't leave and come back after putting your name down. We were quoted an hour and a half wait but made it in after an hour. While you wait in line they provide you drinks outside! \nEverything we ordered was fantastic. The okra fries were well seasoned and really crunchy. I'm not a fan of okra but these changed my mind. We also ordered the lamb chops , garlic naan, prawn Moilee   And phau  bhaji. Enjoyed every dish equally. Make sure to come here!!!",

While still great, I think the first experience was transcendental, so this one loses a star for not quite matching up. \nGood points:\n- It's a fun, attractive, interesting restaurant, with lots to catch the eye.\n- Food is good quality and tasty.\n- The chai tea is beautifully done.\n- The fire toast was simple but tasty.\n- It's very good value! The bacon naan was £5.20, I think.\nLess good points (note that these are all in comparison to King's Cross - so are me being picky rather than very unhappy):\n- The staff seemed very rushed and harried - we didn't really get a smile out of them and felt a little under pressure. The King's Cross branch had much friendlier staff.\n- I was a bit underwhelmed by my bacon and egg naan - I think my expectations had been built up too much. But in particular, I was annoyed that there were green onions cooked into my egg, because I hate them, and this wasn't on the menu. In addition, my egg wasn't runny. \n- It's not as interesting a space as King's Cross, despite the details.\nI'm DEFINITELY going back to Dishoom, but probably for lunch or dinner, and either trying out the Shoreditch one or going back to King's Cross.",

I always get the vegetable samosas as a starter - they are crispy and come with three great chutneys (the mint chutney being my favorite). When ordering a main dish one thing to note is that few of Dishoom's items are curry-based, meaning that they are just meat options. If you want something with a curry Mattar Paneer or the Chicken Ruby. I'm a huge fan of the chicken ruby - it's the perfect mix of spicy flavorful and goes well with the Romali Roti. I've also had Lamb Boti Kabobs and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka - both are great but again they just come with meat so I don't recommend ordering a naan or rice with it. This restaurant is usually quite crowded during prime lunch and dinner time but the wait was never terribly long for me. \nOverall: one of my favorites in London, amazing Indian food, cool ambiance",

It is worth it?\nAbsolutely.\nI've been here over a dozen times and have never been disappointed. From the Gunpowder Potatoes with lime zest, to Okra Fries, to any of the curries...Dishoom is amaze-balls. The environs are well-appointed. Kind of a \"dark wood and eclectic trappings from the East India Company thing\". The waitstaff is prompt, high professional, and handles the chaos with aplomb. The prices are a tad on the high-side for curry, but reasonable. The beer - several of which are made expressly for Dishoom - is YUM.\nSo the only thing is \"the thing\". You're gonna have to deal with the wait, and crowds, and noise.\nOr are you? In the years I've been going to Dishoom it's added three more locations. I haven't been to all of them, but I can tell you ones I have been to are way less crowded than St. Martin's Lane.\nSo go have a night in any of the others, and leave the chaos for those not in the know. You'll have a spectacular thing.",

We LOVED every morsel and didn't want dinner to end. I told my mom that I would consider staying an extra day in London just so I could eat here again!!!",

Every single employee we encountered was cheerful and welcoming, the drinks were delicious, the food was out of this world (the prawn moilee and the black house daal were especially incredible).... but the service was the icing on the cake. Our waiter, Gabri, was fantastic. Friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and gave great suggestions for food. All around one of the best experiences on our recent trip to London!",

And yet here I am giving an Indian restaurant 5 stars so it's not just a good Indian restaurant it's an amazing one, one that can make me forget what my overtly racist taste buds want me to eat.\nI went ham with the ordering so here's what we got:\nVegetable Somosas- started off with a classic and it was a great start. Very standard no doubt but seasoned very well and fried perfectly. No complaints but also no unique twist on it.\nPau Bhaji- now things are getting interesting- \"a bowl of mashed vegetables\" is the description; what an understatement. Basically a vegetable tomato paste that was flat out delicious and the perfect dip for bread.\nOkra Fries- and now we hit the jackpot. Fried okra that I swear was seasoned so much you would think it would be way too much but it worked perfectly. A punch of flavor in your mouth for sure, but an amazing one.\nAwadhi Lamb- extremely tender and flavorful. Sauced like crazy but I wanted much more.\nGarlic Naan- I mean it's Naan and bread is always gonna be delicious.\nPSA- Ordered a second helping of Okra fries-they were that good.\nIt's on the lists of best restaurants in London and for good reason. The lines can be brutal but either show up away from peak hours or suck it up because those okra fries are worth every second waiting in that cold raining nightmare of a city :D",

                "description": "Amazing Indian food!! Much better than anything I've had in New York or Boston. Firstly, Dishoom is a \"new bombay style\" Indian restaurant. I don't know exactly what this means but it is hip and trendy inside, not a mom and pop Indian place. However, despite this, the food tastes authentic and the clientele was about 50% Indian. \nWe went here on a Friday night and it was so packed. First, we waited outside for about an hour. However, they kept bringing us brandy and hot chai tea so we didn't mind so much since we were having a great time drinking. Then, we were escorted to the bar area to wait where we ordered drinks and could have ordered appetizers if we wanted. And lastly, we were escorted to our table. Waited about 1 hr 45 mins in total. However, this was probably the most enjoyable long wait I have ever had for a table. Dishoom is organized and everything is electronic. Everyone knew my name and exactly how long I had waited for a table. It was quite a pleasant experience. \nI can't remember the names of the drinks we had but they were delicious. I also especially loved the hot spiced chai tea we had when we waited. Would definitely recommend ordering the chai tea. To eat, we had the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black daal. I don't even like dark meat chicken but I loved the chicken ruby! It is very similar to chicken tikka masala but it has a unique flavor and I think is event better. The black daal was incredible and so buttery and filled with flavor. The food came out extremely quickly so even though we waited a long time for the table, we were eating within 10 minutes of sitting down. For dessert, we had some type of mango granola pudding that was also incredible. \nDefinitely, definitely visit here. It is a unique experience you can't get anywhere else!",

We we're told 30 minutes until we'd get inside to the bar, where we can order a drink and wait another 10-15 min till being seated. We decided to wait and thank god we did. We waited 15 minutes outside before going in, got to the bar to order a drink and within less than 5 minutes were given a table! I suppose they overestimate waiting time to avoid complaining customers, understandable.\nFood - absolutely delicious and I'm not a huge Indian cuisine consumer. We ordered the Ruby Chicken, Black Daal, Chicken Tikka, Basmati Rice, Pau Bhaji, Lamb Boti Kabab and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and very flavourful.\nService - waiter was extremely helpful in suggesting different plates and the right amount. Also helped with understanding the flavours of each dish. \nDrinks - ordered the chilli martini which was sweet and delicious! \nToo stuffed for dessert, but based on the entrees I can predict its nothing short of amazing as well.

Unanimously voted worth waiting outside in line for an hour in the cold (sweetened by cups of chai and lemonade on the house - but don't worry, you can reserve tables too). \nGimlet was the best I ever had. Bombay colada was fresh and heavenly. Calamari, black daal, and garlic naan were phenomenal. Also had chicken tikka and lamb biryani that were amazing. Our only regret was not ordering a side of basmati rice to spoon the remaining black daal and tikka sauce over. \nService was very fast and attentive. Prices extremely reasonable. \nThe decor. Don't even get me started! Modern chic brasserie with awesome vintage Indian film posters and pictures/ads. Cool lighting and fans spinning above head. Feels like a jump back to a modernized, chic, Bombay British colonial place.",

The smell of Indian spices instantly hitting you, and instantly making you hungry!\nThe suggestion here is simple, get loads of starters and small plates to share, and then go for a main.\nSome of my favourites are-\nLamb Samosa\nChilli cheese toast\nVada Pau\nCalamari\nChicken Tikka\nMasala Prawns\nStick some Nann bread on, a portion or rice and you are well on your way.\nControversial dessert-the Kulfi on a stick-bascially an ice lolly/ice cream, but its a great finish to the meal and a bit different!\nThere is no point in writing any more, Dishoom is a must, you will have heard of it, people will recommend it and it's well worth a visit!\nWriting about it is making me crave it again!",

The prawn moilee was by far the best dish we had. It was truly amazing! The chicken tikka was a distant second for me and the sheekh kabab was skippable. My spouse shared many other dishes with the others in our party and had the same sentiments at the end of the meal. \nThe ingredients seemed fresh and of high quality, but especially for the price-point, we were sadly overall underwhelmed by the food.

For some reason I'd been under the impression food in the UK wouldn't be very good, but Dishoom took that notion and threw it out the window.\nFirstly: don't be scared by the line. It moves quickly, and according to my London friend who has come here before, they grossly overestimate the time you'll spend queuing up to get in to the restaurant. Plus, they give you free fizzy lemonade while you wait. \nThe food is exceptional and the service is quite good, too. We got a variety of plates: crispy, spicy okra fries (how have I not had these before?!), yummy garlic naan, tangy chicken tikka, paneer tikka, and the perfectly dressed bowl of greens. You know a restaurant is good when you're savoring every bite of the simply dressed greens. Anyhow, between two ladies, we thought we might have enough food to bring home for leftovers, but after a taxing day of tourist-ing, we happily ate everything in front of us. Consequently, my recommendation is to get a whole bunch of plates and share the food among your party. You'll want to sample everything you see, anyway!\nI got the salted caramel khulfee for dessert, which is basically like a salted caramel ice cream pop. It was yummy, and I didn't share it.\nCome here! I wish we had Indian food this good and inexpensive where I live.",

A hearty, wholesome and incredibly delicious and fresh option for indian cuisine, I've never been disappointed and usually find myself too full to finish what I've ordered in my sheer excitement over the menu (but that's nothing new)\nI haven't been before dinner service, but I hear breakfast and brunch is done exceedingly well here and the restaurant works well for any social setting; a date, a relaxed social with friends and on a business level. \nRemember - sharing is caring (& you can order that little bit more!) \nC.x",

                "description": "We visited Dishoom in Shoreditch shortly after a few games of ping pong in nearby Bounce. The two make for a great combination!\nAlthough the entrance to the restaurant is situated on a Shoreditch backstreet, the decorative interior and ambience makes it feel like you're stepping into a different world. The lights are dimmed, giving a dark and moody atmosphere, even during late afternoon. But not in a gothic way - it has the persona of an imperial Bombay cafe.  There is an outdoor terrace for the warmer summer evenings - however it is not possible to request a booking here - and the centre of the restaurant has a wide open square space fronted by the bar.\nThe service was excellent and the food was creative and delicate at a reasonable price. The menu allows you to order small plates or a main meal. The grilled lamb kebab and chicken ruby tasted amazing and there was a choice of Indian beers and IPAs.\nAs can be expected for a restaurant such as this, there was a 40 minute wait for a table. Dishoom keeps back most of their tables for walk-ins. But at least there wasn't a queue halfway down the street - Dishoom allows you to sit at the bar with an electronic bleeper that lets you know when your table is ready.\nWould definitely visit again and try some more dishes.",

We went around 7pm a Sunday night on a recent trip to the Covent Garden location, and waited a little over an hour for a table. Do not be deterred by the line outside! The hostesses offer you chai tea and a delicious lime drink while waiting in line, and allow you to wait in the bar area and grab cocktails/appetizers before your table is ready. The restaurant also just smells delicious - the whiff of spices you get as you enter the restaurant is a clear indication that your meal will be transcendent.\nWe ordered the calamari and vegetable samosas as bar appetizers while we waited for our table. Both were delicious, very nicely flavored! For dinner, we ordered the prawn moilee, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, paneer tikka, and each of the naan varieties. We also threw in a black house daal, on recommendation from our fantastic waiter Gabri. My personal standouts were the prawn moilee and lamb chops - both perfectly cooked and just oozed with flavorful goodness.\nThe general atmosphere was what impressed me most about Dishoom. The food and drink are extremely reasonably priced, especially considering how high quality they are. The hostesses and wait staff have service down to an art - a busy dining environment could very easily be hectic, but they go above and beyond. Thank you to Gabri and the whole Dishoom team for a supremely special and memorable meal!",

This place is a huge disappointment! They need to change their chef or teach him how to cook Chicken Tikka Masala(Ruby). It tasted of uncooked tomatoes and the spices were not throughly cooked.The next dish we tried was a biryani and God help us.

The first time I came for dinner on a Friday night, and the wait time for our party of 3 was around 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. After we finished (around 8 pm, I'm guessing), the line was HUGE so I'd recommend getting here earlier rather than later. \nThe second time (today) we - a party of 9 - came for lunch and the wait time was just around 15 minutes. I know Dishoom recommends ordering \"family style\" but all of us ordered our own dishes and shared for tastes. I opted for the Chicken Tikka with a side of Garlic Naan, and might I say that I REALLY enjoyed it. The portion size was perfect for me (maybe even a little too much) and I finished all of what I ordered. The spice level was just right, too, especially when paired with the naan. Everyone else in our party also really enjoyed their meal, and we all left happy, satisfied, and in (slight) food comas. \nThe environment here is pretty awesome too. It seems really modern and the decor is on point. The staff is also amazing and definitely contributed to my great experience here both times. The minus one star is only because I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food to begin with, but I'm pretty sure this is as good as it gets - or it's the best I've had, at least.",

We were in London for 7 days over Christmas, and Dishoom decided to close on the 2 days that we were available to venture out to shop and eat :(  so we had to purposely go out of our way on our last day in London, and squeeze in a light lunch, right before our afternoon tea time (which was a total waste of money...anyway, that's a different story and review!).  Yes, the wait sucked, but it wasn't horrible.  The lady with the iPad was very friendly, and informed us right from the start that the wait would be an hour long.  I think the actual time was maybe 40 minutes?  At the very least, we didn't have to wait in the rain (since we all know how fickle London weather can be...).  Plus, the heater was on and there was unlimited Chai being served while we waited. And I don't even like Chai!  I hate cinnamon and I avoid Chai like the plague.  But I gave it a try since they were handing them out, and I was cold.  And boy was I glad I tried it...it hit just the right spot in the freezing weather, and I went back for 4 more glasses.  If it weren't because we had afternoon tea afterwards, I would've gotten a Chai for takeaway at the end of our meal. \nOn to the food...it was only my husband and I, so we couldn't order too much food / carb knowing that we were having afternoon tea within a couple hours.  We had lamb samosas, roti, chicken ruby, and chicken tikka (a dry dish, but the meat was cooked perfectly and so tender).  And all were delicious!  I especially loved the sauce in the chicken ruby, it went perfectly with the roti.  For next time, I definitely want to re-order the chicken ruby, but also try the biryani and rice.  And can't forget the Chai......mmmmm.",

                "description": "We went here for a late lunch around (1pm) on a Monday and were seated immediately. Every other day we walked passed Dishoom, there was a line out the door. The hostess told us that they only take reservations for dinner if the party is more than 6 people. Furthermore, the entire staff was extreme pleasant and helpful.\nThe atmosphere of Dishoom is exactly what I would expect for a Bombay style cafe in London. The decor creates the feeling of a small cafe from an exotic land. The downstairs area has extra tables and a bar.\n \nWe started with the House Black Daal (~5 £) and garlic naan (~2 £). The garlic naan was only two halves, which is slightly less than we expected, but the House Black Daal was amazing. It is a cream lentil based sauce that could honestly be a soup and a meal by itself. The spices were perfectly balanced to offer flavor, but was mild enough for even the most spice-adverse individuals. We also split an order of Okra Fries (~4 £). These were good and crispy, but nothing compared to the House Black Daal.\nFor our meals, I got the Biryani Awadhi Lamb (~10  £). The server suggested also getting an order of Raita (~2 £), a yogurt dish similar to Tzatziki sauce, to act as a palate cleanser to reduce the amount of heat from the Awadhi Lamb. The Awadhi Lamb is a bowl of rice, onions, other toppings, and tender lamb. The lamb actually pulled apart similar with just my fork. As someone that loves food in sauces, I used the remaining House Black Daal and poured it over the rice. The Raita was definitely a nice touch, as the Awadhi Lamb had a subtle spice that got hotter in my mouth as I continued to eat. \nMy friend ordered the Chicken Rubi (~10  £) and a side of Roti bread (~2  £). Her chicken was extremely moist and tender and was smothered in a bowl of ruby red curry sauce. I didn't have much, but she was thoroughly pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone that like Butter Chicken or Chicken Tikka Malasa.\nI was already stuffed so for dessert I only ordered the Chocolate Chai Tea (~3 £). It tasted like a lightly sweetened hot chocolate with the subtle spice of chai tea. The topping was similar to an extremely light frothy steamed milked with cinnamon sprinkled on top. Definitely a must get on an colder day. \nMy friend ordered the Pineapple and Black Pepper Crumble (~5  £). It is served on this little wooden tray with the vanilla sauce on the side. I thought it was going to be overly sweet from the look of it, but I was surprised by its subtle sweetness that allowed the perfectly ripe pineapple to provide the flavor. \nOverall, Dishoom offer great indian food for reasonable prices. With it located near the center of London, its a great option for anyone. Also, on Mondays they play this \"game\" when you get your bill. You roll a die and if it lands on 6 your bill is covered by the restaurant! Just another incentive if the amazing food was not enough.",

We began with calamari, garlic naan and black daal which was simmered perfectly. Next, we ordered the spicy lamb chops and they were cooked to perfection. I sill have the taste of the Masala prawns in my mouth and I certainly do not mind. Paneer tikka was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. This is my new London spot for indian! The portions of the naan and roti are quite small so you may need a few orders depending on varying level of hunger. Well worth a try!",

The service was excellent, ambiance was great (the bar downstairs is perfect for drinks and dining), and most importantly the food was incredible! (Note: I probably butchered some spellings in this review- too busy to fact check).\nFirst, we waited 1 hour at 9pm on Saturday night. If you're not prepared to wait for good food in a major city, then don't-- but don't blame the restaurant!\nWe ordered the lamb kebabs, chicken ruby, house black dahl, garlic naan bread, raita, and the mahi curry. It was all excellent, we'd order it all again. The okra fries were just ok- way too salty for our tastes though the dips were nice.The portions are fairly small, so order plenty of dishes and share nibbles amongst the table. Also they don't custom prepare dishes in terms of spice, so my wife found some dishes uncomfortably spicy, but it's Indian after all so can't complain about that. \nFor drinks their house IPA is excellent and my wife really enjoyed the Bolly-Bellini.",

The wait staff was awesome helping us sift through the menu and making the right choices. EVERYTHING we had was delicious. The garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka, lamb...it was all perfect.

From the tables and chairs, to the wall decor and bar setup, entering this restaurant is as if you had entered a time capsule back to early twentieth century India. The menu is presented tapas style, and every dish I tired I thoroughly enjoyed! We started with the masala prawns (very large, exquisitely seasoned prawns!) and the lamb samosas (very light filo with tender pieces of lamb). Next we shared the Awadhi Lamb (again, a wonderful seasoned biryani dish) and ordered a side of Roomali Roti (this was our only disappointment, since the roti seemed a bit tough). The Dishoom Chicken Tikka Roll was also  very flavorful, and enough to share for 2! For dessert, try the Pineapple and Black Pepper Crumble - not too sweet and a perfect end to the meal.  The waiter was attentive, and service flawless. I only wish I lived in London to sample more of their menu! This is a restaurant you want to keep coming back to for its sheer uniqueness and top notch service!",

                "description": "Hands-down, the BEST food we've ever had in London! We liked it so much that we went back 2 nights in a row. Here's our breakdown:\nSERVICE: SO great! We waited in line outside, about 45 minutes each night and both nights were impressed with the service. The hostess came around while we were in line outside with different drinks for all of us patiently waiting. We got mint tea, sherry, and chai tea. Everyone we interacted with was super nice and gave great recommendations for the food. The servers and hostesses just seemed very gracious in our waiting in line and were all very kind in demeanor. \nFOOD: Freakin' delicious! Actual flavor CAN be found in London! Here's what we tried over our 2 nights here:\n-Far Far: light and yummy snack chips that are fun and colorful and went great with the 3 sauces they bring to the table!\n-Chili Cheese Toast: a nice twist to regular toast with a little kick of spice mixed in with cheese. Very tasty!\n-Okra Fries: We had never tried okra and these were delicious all nice and fried\n-Pau Bhaji: tasty vegetable mash good to be swapped up with bread, but our least favorite dish.\n-Keema Pau: VERY good lamp/pea mashup also served with bread that comes so full of flavor your mouth is just in awe, but then you squirt some lemon on it and BOOM; you can't even believe it's better.\n-Murgh Malai: Super tender and flavorful chicken!!\n-Dishoom Chicken Tikka: another very tender and flavorful chicken in a happy mix of spices\n-Gunpowder Potatoes: good and a large amount we couldn't even finish it. Great white sauce that is served with them go well with pretty much anything else you order as well.\n-Spicy Lamb Chops: Very tender and delicious and accented marvelously by pomegranates. So good it almost tasted like beef!\n-Masala Prawns: Such delicious and plump shrimp in great flavor and comes even more to life with lime too.\n-Garlic Naan: Good solid naan; can't go wrong.\n-Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: Good but a little weird because it has chili in the chocolate but not terrible. I personally wouldn't order it again. Chocolate is very moist and rich.\n-Pistachio Kulfi: One of the best ice cream popsicles I've ever had. It's like super creamy condensed milk with a light pistachio flavor; perfect!\nAll in all, come here and stuff your face. Will be our #1 spot to go to when in London!",

                "description": "Everything about this place is a resounding yes, from the moment we started lining up out front to the last bite of dessert.\nWe arrived at 6pm and there was already a 1hr wait. However this was overestimated for us since a few tables before us left.  The wait starts outside where we were served water and house chai as we waited in line.  After 25min, we were given a buzzer and was told we could continue our wait at the bar downstairs.  I ordered a mango Lassi as we waited another 15 for our table.  Highly recommend the mango lassi.\nOnce we sat down, we ordered the pau bhaji for apps; black house daal, ruby chicken, chicken biryani, and Naan for entrees; and finished with the pistachio kulfi and gola ice for dessert.  \nPau Bhaji - seasoned mashed veggies with two buttered buns.  I know what you're thinking, that mashed veggies sound a lot like gerber's baby food, but this was on a whole nother spectrum.  It's all spiced up and tastes like dense curry that's spreadable on the buns.  Delicious - it reminds me of the the street food of Mumbai, except I wasn't afraid of getting food poisoning this time around.\nRuby Chicken -  think chicken tikki masala or murgh makhani, it's the red based curry with grilled chicken chunks.  Everyone raves about this dish and for good reason, it was the clear winner of our table too; silky smooth sauce with perfectly tender chicken.  I wish we ordered this twice.\nBlack House Daal - lentils and/or beans that are boiled overnight, it's a cream like dish with soft lentils/beans (although I think Dishoom only used lentils).  We could have skipped this.  I was lured in by other reviews, but for us, it tasted like beans cooked in butter and we wished we ordered something else. \nChicken Biryani - seasoned rice dish that is normally cooked in a clay pot, it's like the fried rice of Indian food.  We loved this dish as well, the chicken was succulent and the we didn't have to order a side rice since there was plenty in this dish.  We dipped the chicken in our remaining ruby sauce and ate the rice with our other plates.\nPistachio Kulfi - creamy frozen yogurt that is magical.  Leave room for one of these!\nKala Khatta Gola Ice - this is a really bizarre frozen ice dessert.  It's a snowcone with the weirdest syrup you'll ever have.  I really enjoyed it because it reminds me of salted plum drinks my mom used to make me, so if that doesn't sound appetizing, I would avoid it.  My fiancee thought it was WAY too salty, but I grew up with the flavors and highly enjoyed it.   It's salty, sour, tangy, and peppery.  \nOverall we are incredibly satisfied we made this our Indian place to go to in London.  The wait was worth it!",

                "description": "Dishoom is a tribute to Hindi movies made in the Mumbai (Bombay) film industry also known as Bollywood. Dishoom is actually the sound effect one heard during the fight scenes in old Bollywood films when the good 'uns and the baddies used to punch each other to oblivion (or until the very competent police finally arrived).\nWe were booked at Dishoom for NYE dinner by my wife's uncle and aunt. We were told that on any other day you need to queue up (even upto 45 minutes), just to get in and then you wait again to be seated at a table (another 45 minutes, possibly).\nGiven the occasion, there was a set menu, one each for vegetarians and meat eaters. The menu I've uploaded is the meat one.\nOn arrival we were given a glass of complementary prosecco each. Starters were based on traditional Bombay street food. We had pav bhaji (spicy-tangy potato based curry  with buns), the meat version with mince lamb, paneer tikka, fried okras and grilled prawns.\nThe mains consisted of chicken biryani, vegetable biryani as the rice dishes. These appeared to be dum biryanis. The dum pukht method of cooking biryanis is one in which the rice and meat/vegetable are layered with each other in a pot and slow cooked. Before cooking, however, the pot is tightly sealed in order to retain the aromas.\nIn addition to the biryanis, we also had naan breads and rumali rotis. Rumal, in hindi means a very thin handkerchief. Rumali rotis are made that thin and it takes a lot of skill to make these by hand.\nWe also had dal makhanis (black gram cooked in a creamy sauce) and malai koftas (deep fried vegetable-cheese balls in a creamy sauce).\nOh, before I forget, we also had tandoori grilled lamb on the bone.\nAll the mains were very, very well prepared and presented, but the chicken biryani, I felt lacked that spicy grunt, which one expects in a dum biryani.\nFor dessert we had what they called a Gujju chocolate mousse. Gujju is the friendly slag term we Indians use for Gujaratis, who, by the way make some amazing sweets and desserts. The mousse, however was a big disappointment as it didn't feel very gujju.\nWe also had masala chai (traditional north indian tea with ginger, cardamom and spices, with a hint of sugar). The chai was fantastic!\nI am allergic to things that swim. Fish, prawns, mussels, shell fish, you name it. Since some of the dishes on the meat menu were fish based the restaurant offered me a veggie menu and very kindly told me they won't charge extra for any meat dishes I may want to order from the set menu, especially given that the set menu was priced around £50 per person. This, I felt was a great gesture on their part.\nHowever only 4 stars this time as the chicken biryani did not feel up to scratch and the chocolate mousse didn't feel very Gujju at all.\nI enjoyed the experience of dining at Dishoom and thoroughly recommend it.\nAs with everywhere else, I hope they maintain their quality of cooking and levels of service.",

                "description": "I have fallen in love with Dishoom. They might have exploded in number of stores, and it may look a little too popular indeed, but the design and decor is very beautiful - and so are the foods. It's both beautiful and delicious. Very delicious actually. I can't say anything bad actually.\nThe house chai was extremely rich, intense and tasty - oh, and it is bottomless too. My breakfast lassi was freshly prepared with a cold and creamy consistency. Spot on.\nFinally my house granola was delicious also. The housemade granola was crunchy and buttery, while the vanilla yoghurt tasted good too. Fresh fruit was actually - and always surprisingly - fresh and sweet.\nI can't wait to come back. Both for other breakfasts, but also to try the lunch and dinner.",

I think this restaurant is so overrated. Not because it's bad, but because it tastes pretty much like any other fairly good Indian restaurant but with slightly bumped up prices and long lines outside. \nI didn't find that this restaurant offered anything particularly spectacular or different, which makes me wonder why it has become such a sought-after restaurant. The service is fine, the food is fine, the decor is fine, but that's just it, fine.",

Forget the heavy handed kormas, curries and oily naans etc. Dishoom does Indian food justice and does it damned good! \nI've been here for both breakfast and dinner, and they're among some of the best you can get in London. If you can book in advance, DO IT, because the queues here can get ridiculously long with several hour waits if you're really that keen. \nBut is it worth it? Yes. £5/6 for an absolutely incredible bacon or naan roll? £2.50 for bottomless chai? Brunch sorted for under £10, and get a stamp on a loyalty card giving you free brunch after only 5 stamps!\nDinner wise? Go with a bunch of mates and just order everything on the menu, you won't be disappointed. Personal favourites are the pau buns - so soft and buttery! \nDefinitely a highlight of the London dining scene for me, and has even converted some of my curry hating friends to the light!",

Falling arse over tit about dishoom. \nThe food is pretty good, admittedly, I can't fault it, there are better Indians in London (lots) and cheaper, but you're not here for the food, you're here for the decor (be honest with yourself on this one if you're currently disagreeing) which is brilliant, really well thought out, and the place has a great ambiance, if you were to walk in, get a table and eat, it would be 4 stars straight away. Even a half hour wait at the bar would be fine. But who the fuck are you kidding when you're expected the queue outside to get in to the bar to wait 2 HOURS for a table. Are they having a fucking laugh? \nThere are seemingly a lot of idiots willing to do this. \nThere are far too many good restaurants in London to justify that wait ever. Let alone at 5pm on a Sunday. \nOn top of this the bar is pretty poor, the cocktails are all done on theme, and most favour throwing in overpowering flavours for the sake of sounding exotic. Classics are neglected, the negroni was pretty lacklustre and pointlessly on some different teir of cocktails that you pour yourself (thanks, my own bottle!) if you're going to make people wait in your bar for 2 hours, make it a decent bar.",

We wanted to have Indian the night before, but we were a party of 9 and when we got there, there was a line that spun around the front windows.  So we opted out that evening.  So glad that we made it back.\nThe cocktails were expertly crafted and perfectly blended.  The bartenders downstairs struck up a convo and asked what were we looking for to satisfy our palate and sip on while we waited for our table.  The drinks were excellent and definitely went well with dinner also.\nThe Black Daal- I believe this was the special, but it had a wonderful taste.  The black lentils were simmered and seasoned extremely well.  You can taste every spice blended into the daal.  \nKacchi Lamb- This rice dice is enough for one and will satisfy your hunger.  But why order one when you can order many.  Large chunks of tender lamb meat, tasted very good, spiced well, and layered with rice on top.  Very well executed.\nLamb Boti Kabab-  Tender pieces of lamb, grilled, garlicky and gingery, but not overwhelming.  Served with a couple of wedges of limes that when topped, it definitely brought out the taste of the meat.  It was so well seasoned that even in the center of the bite, you can taste the seasonings.\nChicken Ruby- Tasty curry with dark meat chicken, slight sweetness to it that went well as a dipper for the naan.  Or I mean...the soaker...Soaked up all the goodness with the naan.\nRaita- The yogurt sauce was served plentiful.  Good consistency and a good balance for every plate.\nNaan- Warm, chewy and great for dipping!\nCan't say enough good things about Dishoom.  It definitely enhances every aspect of your mouth and it was so delicious, we practically cleaned up every plate with the last piece of naan.  Wish there was a Dishoom back at home...I'd be a frequent flyer.",

                "description": "Definitely one of the more unique Indian restaurants I've been to. London obviously has it's fair share of great Indian places, but this one had something that stood out. The dishes were a lot less sauce-y than more typical Indian restaurants I've been to. \nThe standout on the menu for me was the Dishoom calamari, which was absolutely amazing. Black house daal and the chicken berry brittania biryani were good as well. The garlic naan was a bit butterier than I would have preferred, but that's just a personal preference. \nThe restaurant is obviously very popular and we went waited for about 45-60 minutes for a table on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm. No complaints though-it was worth the wait.",

We tried the one in Covent Garden this time and again the food was great. We got biryani and vada pav, both tasting authentic. The pickled mirchi which came with the chana was outstanding.

The black dahl is a MUST as are the gunpowder potatoes.\nI hear the cocktails are great, though haven't tried them myself.\nIf you like coke and want something similar you wont find anywhere else in London then buy a thumbs up. Think masala cola...???...\nThe only reason that this place doesn't get 5* is the disappointing lack of vegetarian mains. I really wanted to give Dishoom  5* but there just aren't that many options. \nThe veggy mains I've tried didn't rock my world. The Tikka Panneer was dry and rubbery. Very sad. Ah well, if you stay away from that it's all delicious! \nI would certainly recommend Dishoom to a friend. A really great, interesting and not too expensive place to eat.

Not only is food from out of this world, the service is incredible. I had this establishment on my list of places to visit, but could never circumvent the never ending line in front of the door, sometimes with people waiting in the rain around the corner, just for a chance to dine at Dishroom. This time, I stumbled upon it while walking through Covent Garden and - there was no line. No line means no-brainer. I had to get in. Still a 30 min wait, which was made quite pleasurable with their underground bar. 15 mins in and my table was ready. Oh boy...what a feast, and what a party in my mind and soul. Lamb samosas and to start are a great way to ease you into what's coming. Their roasted veggie spread on a pretzel bun - are simply incredible. That might be the very best appetizer I have ever had. Amazing. Of course, I didn't stop there, Lamb kabob, black daal, basmati rice, garlic naan, and dish room chicken tikka blew me away. The perfect blend of tastes unlike any other i've experienced. \nStaff - best service I've seen in London. Tickles my friendly, sunny American expectations that everyone should smile all the time and make you feel welcome and valued.\nHats down to Dishroom.",

It became clear quickly that it is a very popular spot in London, with over an hour wait for a table. Good sign then, if people are lining up out the door, it must be good. The hostess offered chai tea to us while we stood outside freezing, which was a nice touch. The inside is casual and cozy but vibrant as well. I went with friends who have been before, so I basically tried everything they ordered in a family style sort of set up. The food definitely exceeded my expectations, it was delicious! I tried several things, from vegetable samosas to chicken tikka, and I was pleasantly surprised with it all. I didn't think I would be one for Indian food, considering the heavy emphasis on spices, but it was all very flavorful. It might not be my first choice in cuisine for London, but it was certainly enjoyable no less.",

As an Indian person I was skeptical, but I'm so happy I went. The food was delicious, with some really unique twists such as blueberry biryani, and overall we really enjoyed our meal.\nOne of the best parts was the plates, each of which are unique with the story of an immigrant from South Asia and their perspective on living in London in the 20th century.

This place gets extremely packed and will get a crazy lane if you go too late, so we made sure to get there by 5:30pm and got seated quickly. \nI think we pretty much ordered the whole menu since it was like a tapas style where the dishes come out pretty small but packed with so much flavor. I think I may have just about every veggie dish on the menu plus the calamari and they did not disappoint. The mango lassi was also very good. My tummy definitely left the place pretty satisfied, that's for sure. \nOur waiter and the service there was great and I will definitely come back if I'm ever in London again!",

For a table of two, they told us the wait was going to be an hour but we were starving so we ended up eating elsewhere. Definitely make reservations people! \nWe then decided to come here for breakfast Tuesday morning before we left for the airport and boy was that such a great idea!! No lines, service was quick, waitresses were very sweet and accommodating. The interior was very warm and welcoming and the pictures on the wall gave off a Bollywood feel. Our cups of House Chai was never empty. Yes - they have bottomless chai and it was the best chai I've ever tasted. Onto the food..\n- Bacon Naan Roll 5.20£ : my goodness, the naan was so good, the bacon was smokey and delicious, and I was just addicted to their chili tomato jam they put in the roll. Can I bring a jar of it home? \n- Big Bombay (akuri, char-striped smoked streaky bacon from The Ginger Pig, peppery Shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled field mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns) 11.50£: it was essentially a little bit of everything from the cooked breakfast menu. Everything on the plate was so delectable. We finished the whole plate and didn't even leave a single drop of sauce on the plate. \nFantastic prices, bottomless chai, outstanding service. I wish I had come here sooner! If I am back in London, I will definitely be stopping by here again.  My mouth is watering just writing about this review. Highly recommended!!",

We ordered the chicken ruby, chicken tikka, bowl of greens, daal, and naan on the side, washed down with Kingfisher (not a beer commonly seen in AZ). Everything was incredibly flavorful and delicious. The chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly. We both left this meal telling each other we could eat it every day.\nWait staff was attentive and pleasant, and the atmosphere was modern and gorgeous. Definitely a must try.",

I knew I had to try it when there was a line to get in every time I walked past all throughout the weekend, even at off hours like 3pm Saturday. \nMust-orders:\n- ruby chicken\n- pau bhaji\n- roomali roti\nBut my boyfriend and I tried at least 7-10 different menu items in the two times we ate there and all of them were great. The dishes run just a tad sweeter than your typical Indian fare (at least in NYC), but nothing is one-note or overdone, just super flavorful. Plus on Mondays they let you roll the dice at the end of your meal to get everything for FREE! We didn't win, but a couple of tables around us did - such a cool idea! \nThe establishment is also crazy well run with seemingly everyone on staff in constant communication with each other via headsets. When the line is especially long outside, they bring out cups of hot tea to tide you over. The wait time estimate includes the last 15-20 minutes which are spent inside at the cozy bar downstairs, where you can get started on drinks. \nFor the quality of food, atmosphere, and service, I expected higher prices. I've recommended it to everyone since coming back to the States.",

How many breakfast dishes can I order and not waste too much food, I wonder, as I read the menu from top to bottom, and learned quite a bit, actually.\nThe last time I was in Mumbai (Bombay) I had a wonderful dish for breakfast, and here it was on the menu at Dishoom: Kejriwal- Imagine slices of bread covered in herbal/mustard cheese topped with a poached egg, the softness of the bread soaking up the egg yolk, the fat from the cheese, the rich taste of mustard, all of it swirling in your mouth and on your palate...so comforting, so unique.\nNeedless to say, this meal led to another the next afternoon, where we sat downstairs near a heaving bar. \nAnother amazing meal, the two of us just short of stuffed to the max.\nWanna try something really strange, and strangely tasty?\nKala Khatta Gola Ice\nAll I can say is what an amazing melange of tastes in one rather simple appearing dish, it's just chipped ice with a few blueberries, right?\nOh hella no, order it and find out!\n5+ stars!\nAs our former Governor Arnold said~ I'll be back!\nEnjoy!",

After not being able to get in the night before, we made a reservation and got a table to following day.\nI guess the problem is that we went to India last year and so our expectations may have increased quite a bit for Indian food. We started with the samosas, and frankly they could have come from absolutely anywhere. The thing that improved them was the chutneys.\nThe tamarind chutney in particular took me right back to my time in India. I was also pleased to see that the naan we order arrived in the exact same manner, style and taste as we had in India. But what is with all those people ordering it without butter? Seriously people - it'll be much better with!!\nWe had both the paneer and the chicken tikka. I preferred the paneer but it was a little under seasoned for me - but the texture showed that it was super fresh. The chicken tikka... Well I could tell it had been made properly - no red food dye in sight. But it was a bit bland - I needed to spice all of it up with the chutneys.\nI'd come back to Dishoom, as I've read enough solid reviews to make me think that we just ordered badly.

We tried to go at 5.30pm on a Wednesday, before a movie premiere, but were told there was a half an hour wait. We were told then too that you can make reservations up until 6pm so we decided to leave it and come back the next day, ahead of yet another movie premiere, with a reservation.\nSo the next day we turned up at 5pm and the place was busy but not full. Since it was so early for dinner, we just had a few things. We shared some lamb samosas, and I had paneer tikka, and my husband had chicken tikka. We also shared a garlic naan.\nThe samosas had a good taste, and went well with the lovely chutneys, but judging by the slight softness and the speed, they were not fried to order.\nMy paneer tikka was fine, but the paneer was a bit bland and the spice paste just didn't really stick to it well so it was mainly plain paneer. I love paneer so it wasn't a total lost cause, but it took a fair bit of the chili chutney to make it tasty. The bread was the highlight, fresh and just like we had in India. We spent most of our time watching the man making the bread at the tandoor, as we were sat next to it.\nI didn't have any of the chicken tikka, as it was thigh meat and had skin - just not my thing.\nIt was pretty expensive for what we had - it came to around £30, with our drinks (a Limca and a Thums Up). I think I'll try it again, but I'm not running back.",

At that time, the line wasn't so insane, so we waited about 30 mins outside and about 30 or so minutes at the bar once we got inside before getting seated. The drinks are awesome, the food is awesome, the service is awesome. The place definitely lives up to its hype, I just wish they took reservations for parties under 6 people! Definitely going back here tho !",

The aesthetics are lovely, you feel unrushed without the service suffering, and while the portions LOOK small they are deceivingly filling and full of flavor. I would highly recommend this restaurant (at perhaps a less busy hour) but nonetheless recommend it, as it was wonderful from food, to ambiance, to service.",

                "description": "I love it. I just love it. Anyone who knows me knows that I love it and I can't even put my finger on why? Especially because this review is solely focusing on their breakfast offerings. \nOf all the Dishoom locations this is probably the one with the least ambience and decor and for that reason you're usually more likely to get a table. Top tip: Even though you can't book in the evening unless you have 6+ in your party, you can in the morning so book your breakfast table to avoid a wait or disappointment! \nThey do breakfast cocktails but do not start serving these until 11am so if you're looking to get started early - make sure you head in around this time. \nI have gone through pretty much everything on their breakfast menu by now and I have to say that the bacon naan with egg is still a winner. Those fluffy naan breads with the chutney inside just transforms the traditional bacon sarnie. I'm usually of the opinion that if it's not broke don't fix it but I'm so glad they fixed it. It's beautiful. \nThe big bombay is their take on a 'full English' and it's massive. Home made beans or peoples take on beans is one of my pet peeves in trendy breakfast spots but the beans here are absolutely delicious and I have no idea what it is they have done to the eggs but again - taste sensation. \nI wont go through everything on the menu as that would be boring. The only thing I'd say is personally I really dislike their porridge and would avoid that but then, I've seen other people loving it so it depends on your personal taste. Personally, I'm not a fan of the coffee there either so usually opt for the freshly squeezed \nIf you ask for a loyalty card you can get a free bacon naan after you've had breakfast there five times. Well worth it!",

We walked in and got a table right away (we got there about 5:30pm on a Tuesday though). The decor of the restaurant was very cool. Our waitress was amazing. She was very helpful with the menu. They even have a color coated dairy free menu to help make decisions if you have any food allergies or preferences.\nThe food was so good! We enjoyed every bit of it and the price was good too. We spend 30£ total and were both perfectly full. I definitely recommend checking this place out.",

Was it worth it? Absolutely! Not only was it worth it but we came back a few days later for a late lunch and a shorter 40 minute wait. \nThere was amazing and their specialty cocktails, all of which we tried, were unbelievable. And, it's not very expensive. Good food, good drinks, what more can we ask for? Service was attentive and they brought around mint and chai tea while we were waiting outside. \nWe tried Indian at a few other London restaurants and they did not stack up to Dishoom. If you like gimlets try their specialty gimlet! Best I've ever had. Celery bitters is the secret ingredient. \nYou will not be disappointed and you'll be glad you waited.",

There is always a queue but it is certainly worth the wait.\nI'm sad they don't have the Rajma Frankie on the menu more (or maybe they'll rotate it back on) but the food here is always flavorful and delicious. The dal makhni is by far in my top 2 dals I've had ever had - second only to a place in Jaipur. Dishoom has some of the best roomali roti hands down. Whether you have it with your frankie or with another menu item, you can't miss out. I'm personally a fan of the dal (mentioned earlier), the frankies, pau bhaji, the chai and the kulfis. Every time I'm in London, I look forward to going to Dishoom (and will go out of my way to do so). \nThe service here is always great and they do their best to get you seated as quickly as possible. I love the modern but also classic Bollywood decor, which gives this place great personality. If you live in London and you haven't been to Dishoom, what have you been doing?",

Make a reso to avoid the long line. We didn't have a reso and arrived with an hour and half wait... No one left with this long line so we figured it must be good. TOTALLY WORTH IT! it was cold out and the hostess brought out chai teas for ppl in line, I thought that was a nice touch.

This was very convenient and excellent service! As for the food, it was very good, but it was not significantly better then some other places I tried in chicago. We ordered lamb samosas (good - comes with 4 pieces), house black daal (highly recommend), garlic naan (too burnt), Kachi lamb (very good), chicken ruby (good), mango lassi (okay - I probably wouldn't get it again because it was a bit bland), mint tea (I would not recommend because there were not enough mint leaves or did not steep long enough. It lacked a lot of flavor) and strawberry desert (very good if you like cream and strawberries. It was not very sweet, so it was perfect! ). Overall, the restaurant was a very good experience!",

I got the chicken ruby, which was tender and spicy, but not overly so. The sauce was delicious and I dipped my garlic naan in it after I was done with the chicken. The naan was soft, but may be too thin for some people. \nOur waiter was friendly and attentive. He shared some stories with us, which would usually be annoying but he was just a genuinely nice guy.

                "description": "We went twice in 14 hours because this place is BOMB AF.  \nEverything about the restaurant is really charming, from the design to the plating, and even the bathrooms.  I don't think that the food is overpriced like a lot of people are saying, the quality is really nice and they are in the heart of London and in London, everything is expensive.  \nMy favorite thing to get is the mahi tikka.  Fish is perfectly cooked and moist and tender and flaky and i dont even know what else to say you just gotta try it.\nRuby chicken is also awesome with just the right amount of spice and the sauce is great for tipping your naan or roti into.  \nIf you're looking for great drinks, Dishoom has them too.  They have a lot of original cocktail recipes, but if you're not into alcoholic drinks, their wide selection of lassis are great too.  My personal favorite is the rose lassi.\nThe lines can be long but the wait is worth it.  Just go in the afternoon on a weekday and there should be no wait.",

Yes, you sometimes have to wait in line to wait in line, but the service is attentive and quick ... even when quoted a wait time of an hour and 20 minutes. The time flies by with a drink in your hand and an appetizer to munch on. Not to mention the decor gives you plenty of eye candy. \nNow for the food, mouth-gasms galore. The Ruby Chicken, House Black Daal, and Chicken Biryani were to die for. All absolutely perfect. If you don't know what to order, just listen to the wait staff. Although, let's be real. I already knew exactly what I wanted. Nothing better to do while waiting in line than to Yelp-stalk food. I need help.",

The queue beat me. I arrived and we had a 45 minute wait.\nLuckily the brought out chai and mint teas and we probably only queued about 30 mins until we were seated at the bar to wait for a little bit longer.\nWe ordered lovely cocktails and were soon taken to our table.\nOur waiter Joseph was really lovely, helpful and attentive. \nDishoom is all about sharing dishes so we ordered keema pau, chicken ruby, black Dahl, lamb kebab, roti and rice. It was all delicious, plentiful and wonderfully flavoured. \nWe all tucked in and thoroughly enjoyed our delicious dishes.\nWe treated ourselves to sharing a gooey chocolate dessert which came with a scoop of chilli vanilla ice cream. A wonderful, naughty end to the meal. \nWe paid about £22 each for dinner and a cocktail each, which is really good value for a great meal in London. And our waiter even took our friends mocks ail when he noticed she hadn't drunk it cos she didn't really like the taste, which is fab service.\nGet yourself to Dishoom pronto. Don't be put off by the queue... It's worth it!",

Simple but classy, western but with a tinge of Indian food scent in the air, it was the right balance of ethnic and sophisticated. \nThe fourteen of us ordered three plates of each of chicken tikka, grilled prawns, veggie curry and a few other things. Everything was simple but solidly done. I particularly liked the chicken tikka masala and the grilled prawns. The former was just perfectly spicy to fit my taste, and the latter was flavourful despite the simplicity of seasoning. \nFor drinks, I got chai then black coffee for desserts. Apparently, the chai here is highly recommended; I liked it but not being a chai expert, didn't really see what was so stand out about it. \nFinally, the staff was friendly overall and prompt in service.\nMake sure you book in advance if you're more than a party of six. If not, I heard you need to walk in, so leave time for some extensive queues.",

We arrived around 1:30 PM, and the hostess told us it would be about a 40 minute wait. She suggested that we wait at the bar. We both ordered drinks and some samosas. The Bollybellini. Was. AMAZING. So were the samoas!! \nAfter raving about how good the drinks were, we finally got seated. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, the Chef's special (it was shrimp in curry), rice, and naan. Everything was so delicious and filling- worth every penny! My friend had never had Indian food either, so this was a great first experience for her!\nThe staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the interior of the restaurant was just gorgeous.

I was looking a place at to eat, and this was the first one that popped up and read the reviews (which were positive) and decided to go there. When we first got there, the place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated. We were told that the wait time was going to be 25 minutes, to us that was fine. They told us that we were Able to wait downstairs at the bar. 10 minutes later, we got a table. The server was super nice and understanding. She explained everything to us perfectly. \nFor starters, we got lamb samosas, which comes two per portion. Super delicious and flavorful! Then we ordered the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and steamed rice. The portions itself was perfect for two people! The food was super good, delicious and flavorful!!! YOu can taste everything in the chicken ruby! Really recommend it!",

                "description": "When it comes to Indian food, I doubt if you will find a city outside of India that does it as well as London. \nDishoom takes the cake for perhaps the best Indian food you can have in London. Move over Roti Chai, see ta later Masala Zone. I have a new favourite and it's called Dishoom (the word Dishoom is the sound of a gun shot in Hindi).\nThis place doesn't do reservations for parties of less than 6 people. And unfortunately, it is not only popular but in a high profile location, so there are always lines outside. Weeknights, you can expect to wait an hour during peak dining hours. Weekends is likely worse. But it is worth the wait! \nSo, what to eat? Here are my faves so far, although I haven't tried everything on the menu yet. \n- Masala Prawns\n- Rajmah Chawal (a must!)\n- Daal (also a must!)\n- Rumali Roti (again, a must!)\n- Chicken Biryani\n- Chicken Curry\nSo take my advice. Don't fret the long line. Just go here and if you are like most, you will think it was worth the wait. I certainly did.",

The workers are very nice, we waited about 20 min and they ushered us in to the downstairs bar area to wait outside the cold. They also served some warm chai while we were waiting in line. \nOn to the food. \nMost everything was pretty good, although portions a little on the small side. We had to order two extra dishes to be satisfied. \nFor starters we got the calamari and fried okra. The fried okra was very good, not too slimy with a nice crunch. Calamari was OK, it had a slightly sweet taste which I didn't care for.\nMy favorite was the chicken ruby (not sure of the name). It's the only chicken curry on the menu. Flavorful with moist chicken chunks. \nWe also got two of the grilled chicken dishes and the spicy lamb chops. The lamb had a good kick of flavor and not gamey, however for the price you only get three little chops.\nThe one thing I did not like was the must touted black dal. It tasted like re fried beans. Same texture and almost same flavor but with an Indian spice kick. \nOverall it was a good experience, the service was nice and food in general was good.",

The husband and I shared okra fries and calamari with sauces and -- YUMM! Just the right amount of spice and so good! Then we shared the Ruby Chicken - I guess there is a God because it's the only way this dish could exist, and Lamb Boti Kabab with rice and a good helping of Roomali Roti to soak it all up with. Didn't try dessert because we wanted those spices to last forever. And the service? Right from the door it was perfection -- our waiter --OH HEY THERE ALI! - was hands down the best we've ever had -- great food guidance, amazing attention, and a quick discussion about the world political mess - what more can you ask for?

I feel like everything in the UK is 10x more prettier and hipster than America lol.\nWe were seated within 5-10 minutes on a busy day on the main floor (there's a floor downstairs with the bathroom and very dim lighting, it's pretty awesome). We were given menus and these sauces that came in cute metal buckets. \nI forgot what I had ordered, but I remember that the chicken ruby, garlic naan, samosas, and basically everything was DELICIOUS. \nThey were all pounding with flavor and I can still taste those spices lingering in my mouth!

You can't book (unless for 6+ people) so we got there before 6pm to try and beat the dinner rush a little later.\nWe were told the wait would be about 45mins but I think it was more like half an hour. They brought out complimentary hot chai to drink too.\nOnce at the front of the queue we were then able to go down to the bar. We ordered cocktails and just before they were brought over to us, our buzzer went off to say our table was ready. A waitress carried our drinks upstairs for us, which was a nice touch.\nThe staff are brilliant. Our waiter for the evening was Joseph and I can't speak highly enough of him. He was friendly, polite and attentive without standing over us.\nWe eventually chose our dishes between the four of us - keema, paneer, chicken ruby, lamb tandoori, black dhal, rice and roti. They were good size portions and I love this way of eating as you get a bit of everything. The only problem is I wanted to eat ALL the food! \nThere were some amazing flavours of great spices without it being overpowering, there was also no nasty burn!\nWe then had a chocolate pudding with chilli ice cream to share as we were too full for dessert but couldn't resist it. It was rich and gooey and they ice cream was different. It was creamy vanilla with a delayed little kick of chilli at the end. Very nice and went well with the chocolate.\nThree of us had the Bolly Bellini cocktail, which was delicious. At £7.50 it's pretty standard pricing for London but it was one of the best I've had anywhere. A must get!\nOne of my friends had a virgin cocktail and she ended up not drinking much of it. Joseph, the waiter, spotted this and asked her if she'd like something else instead and when she didn't he took her drink off the bill. Great service!\nI'll definitely be returning, even if I have to queue!",

                "description": "This is a very busy Indian restaurant that has efficiently streamlined their waiting-customer process. When I arrived on a weekend around 7PM (peak hour), there was a wait that they said would take 45 minutes. I decided to wait (table for 2) and they gave me one of those buzzers. I waited for 10 minutes and one of the hosts said there was room for me at the bar downstairs. I happily went down to the bar and sat down for another 10 minutes until the buzzer rang. Since I'm from the US and didn't have any cellular phone service, I was happy to use their free wifi (no password needed). If you're coming here in a group, do your best to make a reservation.\nOur server was attentive and the food was good. I'd say that this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to (not just in the UK) based on food quality and atmosphere. You feel like you should be dressed up (at least business casual) at this joint.\nI don't remember everything we ordered, but it included the house black daal (must-order), a chicken dish, garlic naan, roti, and mango lassi. Everything was pretty delicious and I don't think you can go wrong with whatever appeals to you on the menu. The only drawback about this place is the price. I guess they're popular enough to demand the amount they charge, but dang it costs like $6 USD for one piece of naan. If the naan wasn't so expensive I would for sure give this place 4 stars. Each person who wants naan/roti should get their own order because 1 order will not be enough for more than 1 person.\nSo, I'm happy I tried some Indian food in London (since there's a large population) and this would be the place I recommend for fancy, quality Bombay food.",

                "description": "So,  I don't know if I didn't get a taste of some of the magic mushrooms other reviews did in order to take this place so highly, but overall I found Dishoom to be pretty disappointing. \nUpon entering, the decor is nice and funky. Like someone else mentioned,  it's got a cool speakeasy vibe going on. I was really excited, but let down by the service from the beginning. Despite being pretty busy,  we were seated fairly quickly (probably only 15 minutes wait after being told 25-30), but that's when things just took a downturn. The guy who seemed to be in charge of seating seemed pretty disappointed when we said we hadn't ordered any drinks while waiting in the area by the bar, and then after he plonked us at a table, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to notice us and give us menus. \nBut, I tried my best not to let it bother me, as I was excited for their \"Haleem\" dish, which was touted as so special and flavorful. \nFrom their online menu: \"for 8 hours we let the wheat, lamb and lentils simmer with precise quantities of coriander, turmeric, cumin and many other aromatic spices. Then the ingredients are pounded to intertwine and infuse the spices, release the flavour, and create a thick, smooth texture, almost a savoury porridge.\" My partner ordered the haleem and when I tasted it, I really expected a total flavor explosion in my mouth. Instead, I got an underwhelming mouth of mush. I didn't have a problem with the texture, as it was as described, but I was really expecting more punch and more depth to a dish that was allegedly cooked down for 8 hours with spices. Just...okay. This chef's special, btw, came at a lovely premium of £16.50. Yes, you heard me right. £16.50. For a child's sized portion of porridge. \nFor a drink, I treated myself to the Bombay Pimm's, which was basically just ginger beer in a highball glass with some bits and bobs thrown in the bottom. Waste of £7.50.\nI also ordered the chicken ruby, which many people here totally raved about, but I also found it devoid of any depth of flavor. It was just any old tomato based sauce to me, and I was let down. Average tasting, but nice to soak up with the naan, which was delicious. \nAlso disappointing, was dessert. A pineapple and black pepper crumble. I was excited for the combo, but when I dug in, found that all I'd really been served was a ramekin of dense, sugary flour crumble with the tiniest layer of unripe pineapple at the very bottom (bleh). I needed to drown it in the provided custard sauce in order to provide any moisture. Also, didn't even taste the slightest hint of black pepper.\n \nReally, aside from the annoying service, Dishoom was nothing awful, but definitely underwhelming. Mediocre food and mediocre service, so no, not a very good value at all. I feel as though I could have gotten better, cheaper Indian food somewhere else in London where the staff would have paid a bit more attention.  \nAt the end of the night, I could tell someone at Dishoom knew deep down they'd screwed up, because the owner came over with discount vouchers to placate us. However, given what I think of Dishoom, the option of $10 off a $40 meal at a completely different location isn't exactly very gracious, in my books. Right now, I certainly wouldn't rush to go back (certainly not to the Covent Garden location), but maybe one night if feeling a little tipsy, I'd give Dishoom another try. \n.",

                "description": "First of all, Dishoom had me at the name. We came to celebrate after getting engaged (!!!). We had initially tried to stop by for dinner on a weeknight around 9pm and the wait was 2 hours. I love me some Indian food but when a girl's hungry she can't wait that long for food. I'm glad we came back 'cause a late lunch at Dishoom was perfect, and we didn't have to wait! \nThis has gotta be one of the swankiest Indian restaurants I've ever seen. Love the old Bollywood movie posters and vintage humorous ads on the walls. The mirrors above the kitchen are sexy. Even the bathrooms were decorated expertly.\nThe food. Now, when I'm in London I always eat Indian food cause Indian food in America just doesn't compare. Dishoom is definitely one of the best Indian restaurants I've eaten at in London, and quite possibly the world - outside of my mama's kitchen, and of course, the Motherland. We had a terribly difficult time picking what we wanted to eat because everything sounded good. The pau bhaji was delicious. For something that is so simple, the chefs at Dishoom managed to elevate it into a spicy, sour, exciting appetizer. For entrees we ordered the Chicken Ruby and the Kacchi Lamb biriyani. The Chicken Ruby, Dishoom's version of tikka masala, was finger-lickingly divine, especially with a perfectly made roomali roti. The sauce was well seasoned and had just the right amount of butter. The Kacchi lamb biriyani (made Hyderabadi style) was on point. My Hyderabadi fiancé (!) verified its authenticity. The lamb was tender and moist and the rice was delicately flavored. You must get raita with biriyani, and this raita did not disappoint. \nOur server was very friendly and sweet. Prices are very reasonable for a London restaurant. When we left, full and happy, we saw a line of about 25-30 people waiting to enter for happy hour.  Overall, Dishoom deserves to take all my stars. The next time in London, I'll definitely be back.",

We got the Black House Daal (lentils), Chicken Ruby, Spicy Lamb Chops, a garlic and a plain naan - 3 of us. Each dish was so flavorful, rich and served hot! (which I love). The Chicken Ruby (4 pieces) is the second best chicken I have ever eaten - so tender and juicy. The Spicy Lamb Chops (3 pieces) with pomegranate was so good we ordered a second 2/3's into our meal. I would definitely give Dishoom 5-stars if it weren't for the wait.\nFor the foreigners (Americans) who dine here: (since the host said 75% of the people who eat here are foreigners)\n- the wait is long! the host said the shortest wait times are before 5:30pm\n- there is free wifi in line and in the restaurant\n- the hosts are friendly and pass out free House Chai to the line\n- reservations are only permitted for parties of 6+\n- the waits are just as long at other Dishoom locations (we checked out the King's Cross location the day before and the wait was just as long)\n- but inside, the service and ambiance are great",

I have been to the Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and can definitely say that the food is fantastic (the drinks are as well!) and the service is always good.I honestly haven't had a meal there I didn't like, and I always waddle away satisfied and hating myself for finishing a meal fit for 3 people. I will say that if you have a chance to book a table, do so. While I have been and immediately gotten a table, there have been times when, since it's London, they say it will be a two-hour wait (although, when they said that we only ended up waiting for 30-45 minutes). Sometimes there's a line out the door and down the street, but it's definitely worth the wait!",

Everything at this place including the tables and chairs, remind me of some cafe in Colaba, Mumbai. \nAbsolutely Indian. The house Chai was fantastic. I don't think I have had Indian Chai like that any where else in London. \nAs Dishoom made me nostalgic, I thought I'd get adventurous and ordered some very Mumbai-ish stuff. Vada pav! Can you believe it? Vada pav is India's answer to Burger. And I used to hog lots of them from the street side vendor near my office in Mumbai. And I have to admit that Dishoom has made it only better. They served it with some chillies and chilli powder. And it is not for those who don't eat spicy food, it is authentically hot! Specifically made for the Indian tongue. Great combination with the Chai. \nI also tried the Pav Baji and I couldn't believe it. This has got to be someone from Mumbai cooking. Loved every bit of it. \nBut I wasn't done yet. I wanted to try out their Naan and some curries. But Dishoom is not a traditional curry house. It is a cafe and they openly admit that it is a cafe, so they have more snacks and chat and grills and frankies than traditional meals and curries. \nI went for the Matter Paneer and Garlic Naan. Wow! Flavour rich! It made me believe that I was in India.  \nBut after all that spice rich flavours in my mouth I was still yearning for more. I chose Cinnamon Ice cream for dessert and yet again I drifted away in my fantasy Mumbai. \nEverything was served in less than 10 minutes. And I was extremely pleased. This is heaven for Indian food lovers and those who have a connection with Mumbai.",

                "description": "Proudly writing my first review for London. I had no idea Yelp would be so useful in finding the perfect dinner place in London. \nVisited this place on a Saturday night after seeing the Yelp reviews. Place was crowded and we waited about 20 mins. But absolutely no complaints, had a great time. This place has kitchen open till 11 pm which is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting London. Of course, greater London has several hundred Indian places that are probably even better than Indian food in India,  I am sure you can find individual dishes better than this place in small restaurants scattered around London, but this place offers a sweet combination of Bollywood, upscale atmosphere and tasty Indian food. So I would definitely recommend going here at least once while you are in London.\nWe tried the Pav bhaji, Roomali roti (Yes, they have roomali roti! -  which is certainly a rare sight in the US, Black daal, cheese toast and Kulfi. The black daal, as other reviews say, was really very nice. I really liked the Pav bhaji too, it was pretty close to what I have had on Bombay streets (buttery, tart and spicy). The roomali was very nice, and it was also fun to see the roti maker flipping the rotis through the glass window in the kitchen. I would rate the Kulfi the least, although it was well placed in an Indian style glass on a stick, it seemed the frozen lot and not fresh. I would probably go for the gujju style chocolate mouse instead. The cream cheese toast was average. They also have some chaat (Bhel puri etc.) on the menu. They have a full bar downstairs, but no draught beers. Doesn't matter much as being carb heavy doesn't go with the already carb heavy Indian cuisine. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the music and food, even the lamb and chicken dishes. People were sprawling, and not just Indians - it was good mix of people, mostly young. \nVery refreshing to see an Indian restaurant proudly portraying Indian art, bollywood memorabilia and celebrating Indian culture. I especially loved the ambiance. Well decorated, flattering lighting and some amazing Bollywood memorabilia from 70s and 80s. Great for a date night as well.",

The service is very good and the food is delicious. I definitely recommend getting lamb as it is very well cooked. The prices are a bit high and can quickly stack up if you order many dishes and you may be tempted because some of them are quite small, but it is not generally worth it, if not the best deal. Definitely worth a try.",

They were serving free small drinks to those waiting in line, which is very nice. All the staff were pleasant. On to the food--My husband and I are curry lovers, and their curry is definitely one of the best we've ever had. Even the rice was spectacular--how does one even make Basmati rice spectacular??? I don't know, but they sure did. I was looking at starters and desserts, but all we had to eat was that one curry and we were so stuffed and satisfied. I will also note, I have Celiac Disease and the wait staff was very well informed and kind when dealing with me and my needs. There are plenty of gluten free options on the menu. I didn't get sick at all, which means their kitchen did what was necessary to keep my food safe during preparation. Overall, a great experience.",

                "description": "I discovered Dishoom while searching the internet for exceptional Indian food in London during a recent trip. The details -- from the rotary ceiling fans to the steel cups to the pervasive aroma -- all intend to transport you to the Persian-style cafes of Bombay, India. As a side note, the menu is really well-done; you can almost sense the passion in flowery descriptions of the exotic offerings. Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly hungry unfortunately so we only ordered a few dishes. The Awadhi Lamb Biryani, a fragrant rice preparation, was decent but didn't blow me away. The meat was fairly soft and had strong taste, but the dish was slightly dry overall so I would order yogurt-based Raita on the side. The Mattar Paneer was fantastic, with spongy morsels of cheese soaked in a tangy tomato-and-pea sauce. The signature Black House Daal was the best course we tried by far and boasted a strong sourness that was counter-intuitive but added to the rich flavor. Get an order of Roomali Roti, a soft and stretchy flatbread, to soak up all the broth and spices.",

The line to get it is out the door despite there being plenty of other restaurants around.\nMy wait was an hour and a half. The waiters do come out and serve Indian tea which is great while standing out on a chilly night. Once you are called in they direct you to the downstairs bar for an additional 10 minute wait. \nFor the food, I ordered: \nVada Pai as an appetizer. It came in a nice warm toasted bun. This potato sandwich was tasty. Had the right amount of spices and flavor. Its small enough to eat on your own or cut in half and share.\nLamb kabab was not good at all. The lamb was greatly lacking in flavor and was severely over cooked. It was tough and practically inedible. \nChicken Ruby was delicious!  The chicken was very tender and marinated perfectly. I ate this with naan and a roomali roll. \nAll in all the place is great, food is good and prices are very reasonable. Worth the wait if theres a line to get in. Will definitely visit on my next trip to London.",

This really is one of my favourite places to go for breakkie in London! Served until 11am, the selection of classic breakfast favourites with a twist really hit the spot and come at a very reasonable price! My favourite is the sausage naan with a bottomless chai, coming to less than £10, but there is also the deliciously sticky porridge and a selection of eggs spiced to perfection! \nFor lunch or dinner I'm less keen on Dishoom. The distinctive flavours of the breakfast are not repeated across the main meals menu, and for the price id rather save some money and sacrifice the dining 'experience' and head to my local curry house for generous portions that really hit the spot! \nAt the mention of experience, that's really what you're choosing when you decide to go to Dishoom. Decked out with spine tingly accuracy like a British Raj club house, you'll be greeted by wafts of incense and carafes of water in tin cups. Where I find Dishoom disappointing, though, is that this experience is not always continues by the staff. Service is often slow (and strangely more so the quieter it is!) and mostly served by a hipster with a 'too cool for this' attitude, which somewhat dulls the excitement of going to one of London's current favourite food venues! \nMy advice for those of you thinking of going to Dishoom? \nGo for breakfast, but only if you don't have to rush to be somewhere before lunch- and you'll love it!",

At 10am on weekdays you'll see couples brunching, singles with or without laptops (free wifi btw, which they call 'chaifi' hahaha), it's all very relaxed, the restaurant feels airy and bright, and why hello there, BOTTOMLESS CHAI FROM 8AM - 5PM (MONDAY TO THURSDAY)! Breakfast at dishoom is truly underrated. And ultimately, the food's just better when it's less busy.\nFor breakfast, get the egg naan roll. 4 out of 5 times it's done perfect - gooey, runny yolk, and who knew cream cheese went with fried eggs? The magic really is the fresh herbs and tartness of the tomato chili jam thing, it's addictive. And of course, fluffy yet dense naan with just the right amount of chew. That and a cup of chai.. best way to start the day.\nLunch and dinner, where do I begin?\nOkra fries - crispy, deep fried veggies, what's not to like?\nPau bahji - veg could've had more flavour but the bread's a buttered, fluffy cloud!\nSkate cheeks - ah, are my favourite! So so juicy, tender and that tamarind!!!\nMahi Tikka - so moistttt and super tasty\nNaan's better than the roti (just personal preference really)\nFeel like I've tried more dishes but I guess they weren't as memorable. Overall, I really like Dishoom (both here and Shoreditch) but it's definitely anglicised indian fare, so don't expect anything super punchy! Oh and try the kulfi! It really is just frozen condensed milk but the consistency sure it satisfying!\nAlso, having been to this branch and the one in Shoreditch multiple times, somehow the food is always slightly better here, but the ambience / decor in Shoreditch really takes the cake.",

Service was on point with the whole team asking and providing for your dining needs. Iced water, napkins, more condiments clean toilets? Check, check, check. Eclectic old school Indian photo or product with packaging to keep you interested? Check!! \nReally enjoyed the ambiance.\nNow to the food. Ordered the Chicken Ruby and Bryani, lamb Samosas for appetizer.\nPortions were small but the food overall was good. Not spectacular as you would expect from the reviews, but just good, even at the spicy level. \nWhat makes this place special is everything else. Great place to hang with friends, drink and be merry. Definitely passes the would I eat here again test. Bring friends, this is a must try.",

And people watching we did (I'll get back to this in a second). The bar makes beautiful drinks and we had many. The menu is just mesmerizing. It's like an old colonial restaurant's menu in Bombay India. So tantalizing you want to order everything.\nWe started with an almost sweet and sour fried calamari. Wow was it good. I could have ordered two more of these puppies and called it a day.\nWe had their specialty of the house which is called black house daal and is a curried lentil dish that is out of this world. Ordered with garlic naan it is scrumptious.\nA chicken salad and a few more beers and this was a lunch to remember.\nThe atmosphere is charming! Not taking itself to seriously it has great old school colonial art, writings on the walls that is humorous and very Indian.\nI went downstairs where the kitchen and yet another bar is. Charming is all I can say.\nThe service is top notch, but that brings me back to the people watching; so our young attractive waitress was taking such good care of us, but then this super good looking guy comes in and takes a seat right next to us. This young man turned every females head in the entire restaurant. My wife (who is old enough to be this boys mother) lost her breath. Our waitress was so gaga'ed by this \"HUNK\" she was worthless from that point on. I'm not going to lower this five star review due to some primal instinct. That's not fair to Dishoom. \nThis was a culinary high point of our trip to England. We are so happy we ate here.\nBTW, he was gorgeous!",

As for lunch if you like indian food, you are going to love Dishoom.\nThe House Chai is a cardamom flavored milky tea and it's amazing, as is the Chai Chocolate, both of which you can have with dipping toast.\nWhenever i pass by and i don't have time to sit in I always get a chocolate chai for takeaway :)",

I've been to Dishoom for dinner, which is great. but for the purpose of this review - let's talk breakfast! \nThere's three across London (Covent Garden, Shoreditch and Kings X), I went to the one in Kings Cross branch. The building itself is beautiful and one of the largest in London. In what used to be a transit shed, the restaurant has been built to include cobble floor from the original stables with exposed wrought iron beams and high ceilings. Black and white photos and memorabilia adorn the walls much the style of its now trademark style.\nThe breakfast food is outrageously good but there was only ever one dish for me - the bacon naan roll. I'd heard great things about it and it did not disappoint! The bacon was spot on for me - I like my bacon erring on the rubbery side but with a slight crisp  - and the naan was soft, fluffy yet slightly charred. All this coupled with the sweet and tangy chilli jam made me one very happy customer! Other dishes on the menu include akuri - spicy scrambled eggs and kerjriwal - fried eggs on chilli toast. Both, i'm told, are delicious but nothing comes close to that bacon naan!",

It's a decadent mixture of chicken mince, delightfully spiced, accompanied by chicken livers and topped with two runny eggs and crunchy potato sticks. My usual approach is to squeeze in a bit of lime juice, then put a yolk and a few healthy spoonfuls into a pau bun. The dish is really flavorful, and the spices leave you mouth tingling. A swig of house chai will confoundingly heighten the spice for a second before cooling the fires and preparing you for your next bite. It borders on too much food, so rich, but is clearly my new crush. \nOh, and by the way, the husband and three kids also come along but it's more about me than them. Booking for breakfast makes seating for a family of five a breeze. My kids (ages 3, 7, 9) are well fed from selections like Fire Toast (thick, hearty slices of lightly charred toast and interesting jams), Bun Maska (a fluffy bun, split and buttered, served with chai), house porridge (never-ending portion and flavored of banana and dates), house granola and fruit and yogurt. My husband's tried the Big Bombay and the Bacon Roll on naan. \nI'm just enamored with Dishoom and now working up the courage to wait in line one evening for dinner.",

                "description": "I haven't (yet) embraced the idea of queuing outside for 45mins for a burger & chips, but I'm happy to queue up for Dishoom for some reason. Okay, actually for three reasons: 1) they give you free boozy chai outside, 2) once in, you wait in the cool little bar downstairs, and 3) the food is good. Okay fine, it's *mostly* the free bourbon-spiked chai!\nWhen it comes to Indian restaurants, if a place can make me forget my 'it's no mum's cooking!' feelings and come back for more, then I figure it's doing something right. Dishoom with its bustling Bombay teahouse feel is definitely doing so. From the low hanging glass lamps (like wiring was an afterthought), old family photos on the walls and vintage medicines and toiletries on display in the loos, everything invites you in for a closer look.\nFood-wise everyone will have their faves, but I've found the bhel has a great kick, pau bhaji is yum (though I like mine with more onion on top) and the house black daal is worth a try. Need to go again with some non-veggies to try more meat dishes I think but skip the lamb boti kabab (other grills yet to be investigated), and get a side of okra fries no matter what else you're having.\nDrinks-wise there's a nostalgia hit for me from getting chai in authentic glass cups, and seeing Limca on the menu (basically it's their 7UP - my sis and I got addicted to this on a childhood trip to India!). Fusion cocktails work with differing degrees of success - wasn't much chai in the chaijito but the bombay pimms was better. Still working on trying them all.\nThe overall package is a hit for me anyway. Decent value dishes too, though the whole small-plate-sharing thing always means you end up ordering loads! Though it always seems to get finished off somehow... :)",

                "description": "This was my family's first food destination in London, and thankfully so.  The wait wasn't terribly long, but surprising considering we got there shortly after dinner opened (~35 minutes wait).  Luckily you get to order appetizers and drinks in their bar downstairs in the meantime.  The lamb samosas were quite good to start out with, but only a teaser to what was ahead for our meal.\nWe eventually got situated at our table and were greeted with friendly service.  The waiter recommended the Murgh Malai, Chicken Tikka (spicy), and I believe the Chicken Ruby.  The first two dishes themselves are only grilled meat, which is what we ordered, and so he recommended to order (what most reviews here are raving about) the Black House Daal. We followed his recommendations and also ordered garlic naan on the side. The food didn't take terribly long considering how busy they were, and we tried it out.\nHands down, this was the best taste out of ALL the restaurants my family went to, spanning the food in Paris, Venice, Rome, and Prague.  The blend of aromatic spices in the daal, perfectly tender and juicy grilled chicken (both the Murgh Malai and Tikka were good, but I would recommend the Tikka for flavor), and the perfect pinch of cilantro, red onion, and tomato? medley all led to a superb tasting meal.  The only gripe was the cost - the single meat portions are a bit small, so we ended up ordering 3 portions for the 2 of us, and altogether everything cost 43£!  It was a bit of a surprise, but I guess it is London after all.  You can get by with a 10-15£ order per person but we were just too hungry at the time.  Other than that one minor drawback, this should hands-down be your #1 destination for food during your stay in London.",

I really didn't understand what 'Indian street food' is and how this is any different than other Indian places I've been.\nWell it is. I've brought multiple people whenever they are visiting from the US. I think it was best when my best friend, claims to be a staunch hater of Indian food, agreed to eat there and proclaimed she could find items she liked. Ca ching.\nOrdering: House Black Daal is a MUST. So buttery, so smooth. I dream about this.\nI really enjoy the murgh malai. Very tender chicken. Note it might come out pink but it is cooked through (don't be scared).  Definitely add one or two orders of the garlic naan.\nOther food dishes (just not as awesome) include pau bhaji (spicy). Chicken berry britannia (unique with the cranberries) and chicken ruby.\nThere is always a queue as they don't accept evening reservations for groups under 6. The staff working the door are friendly and they bring you hot chai while you wait. You may also find yourself singing 'warm kitty' in queue.\nContinuing on service, each time I have gone all servers have had a smile on their face and been very helpful. But my favorite is Sapna. Beautiful, friendly, helpful with ordering - she is a gem at Dishoom. \nEnjoy your meal. You won't regret it.",

                "description": "I understand some folks may think this place is a bit too polished or caters too much for the Anglo-Saxon pallet, but who cares if it's freakin' great? On a recent business trip to London I visited this place twice and would be going there for lunch right now if I wasn't 5,000 miles away. =(\nThe Dishoom Chicken Tika was superb in both its tenderness and spiciness. If you like Chicken Tikka Masala then you can do no better by ordering the Chicken Ruby. The spicy richness of this curry dish was sublime, and far more complex than most Indian joints reach for. Two thumbs up in my book. \nNot to be left out is the House Black Dal, which being from Texas, reminded me of meatless chili. But I mean that in the best way possible. It was fantastic and I could not get enough of it. Their roti was fine, however the naan was by far not the best I've ever had. That said, I didn't come to Dishoom for bread. The decor of the place is pretty classy and if there's a line, which there will be on most evenings it seems, don't be afraid of it. Just wait it out as the food comes quickly and the line moves rather swiftly. In summary, Dishoom = Boom, goes the dynamite.",

Granted, my wife and I arrived on a Saturday evening at about 5:30, but still. \nThen again, the wait itself wasn't too awful. The line serpentined in front of the entrance and a lovely host greeted each party individually explaining the wait time (a MAX of 1 hour 10 minutes--which turned out to be a bit short of the actual wait) and asking if we had any questions. They also offered free lattes for anyone waiting.\nThe total wait time involves three stages: wait outside, wait just inside the entrance, and wait downstairs at the bar. I don't know if this was making me more apprehensive or alleviating the wait time by creating a sense of \"we're moving along now!\"\nThe food itself was great, albeit on the smaller side for dishes that should be shared. We ordered the chicken tikka (great chicken, though does NOT come with any sauce or curry), the Black House Daal (which offered some great moisture to the chicken), naan, rice, and vegetables. No issues with the food other than the fact that the waiter seemed surprised by what we were ordering. Not sure why.",

Our waiter was friendly and kindly recommended some dishes for us to share.\nWe ordered some naan and a few curries to share, including the house black daal which was quite dark and rich.\nI ordered the House Chai, and also redeemed my free mango lassi as it was my first visit. Felt so full (but happy) towards the end :p\nOn my second visit, me and my friend dropped in for brunch. I tried the chocolate chai this time, which was very warming and comforting after coming in from the cold outside.\nI finally tried the much talked about bacon naan roll which had chilli tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs. Warm and freshly made, though I would have preferred more of a kick from the chilli (me and my love for spiciness...) \nWe also ordered the Akuri - spicy scrambled eggs, which is an Irani staple. A lovely blend of spices - I may actually try this at home sometime and add some excitement to my scrambled eggs, ha.\nOverall I enjoyed the food, and also the ambience of the place. A wide variety of small dishes to share and centrally located close to Covent Garden/Leicester Square station.\nFull blog post here: \ndancing-in-high-heels.bl…",

We decided on ordering a whole bunch of different things and sharing it all and I highly recommend doing this so you can try as much as you possibly can. Some favorites I really enjoyed were the Dishoom Calamari, Masala Prawns, House Black Daal, & Chicken Tikka were all great.

Maybe it was dehydration from walking around all day, but nothing was better than mango lassi at that particular moment. Smooth, creamy, dare I say... mangoey? \nWe tried a number of dishes, but the stand out was most certainly the grilled lamb chops. The flavor was on point - perfectly grilled and topped off with pomegranate seeds. The naan was warm and fluffy and the coleslaw served as a perfect cool down when necessary. I wouldn't have changed anything we ordered, except perhaps add on a tandoori chicken because I got major food envy looking at the table next to ours. \nI'd recommend making a reservation if possible, but if you end up waiting, you have to queue up outside.

But even calling a month ahead only got us a reservation at 18:00!\nNevertheless, I digress. \nWe were seated in the dark lower level. Nice low lighting for an intimate dinner but it made for difficult reading of the menu. We managed to order a wide selection of food which was all delicious. Highlights were the tender lambchops, calamari, gunpowder potatoes, cheese toasts and the briyanis. The chutneys were also very good. \nThe service felt pushy. They told us they needed our table back in 2 hours which was fine but the meal felt very rushed. They had us in and out in less than an hour. We ordered some samosas which arrived while we were still placing our order since it was being relayed wirelessly back to the kitchen.  Really? They couldn't wait until the waitress left our table to start bringing food out? I also felt the waitress was trying to suggestively upsell us along the way - would you like a lassi? Maybe a saucier dish to go with your meal? A trip to the loo also meant being accosted by staff and being herded in the right direction rather than being politely asked if I needed help.  I relayed this all back to the manager via email who was apologetic about the experience.\nI really enjoyed the food but the experience was not relaxing as the service was too in your face. The Shoreditch branch does a much better job in the delicate balancing act of turning tables and delivering a good service experience. The food serves 4 stars but the service really brings it down to 3.",

I don't know that I care. These are mandatory for a first time order.\nThe decor is neatly upscale and the staff was courteous to me as a solo diner in line with what one would expect based on the decor and the prices.\nThere is only one significant downside to Dishoom: if it ever was a secret, the secret is out. Expect to wait. At 10:45pm on a Friday night for a solo diner I still waited 15 minutes. I walked by a few times and saw lines out the door.

                "description": "This place's high rating makes me think only tourists with terrified palates use Yelp in London. Dishoom looks trendy, but the food is flavorless. The waiter recommended the prawn Koliwada starter. It was heavy and flavorless. Lamb Awadhi biryani had literally no flavor. The kachumber was an insult to the name; instead of finely chopped cukes, tomatos, and onions with some spice and lemon, it was literally a bowl of giant pieces of unseasoned raw red onion with a few bits of tomato and cucumber thrown in. Inedible and gross. The signature prawn moilee curry was just OK, but given that it tasted a bit like something, it was the standout of the meal. All this, and the prices are quite high. Twenty pounds a head for lunch will buy you lovely Indian food at about a thousand places in London.",

We finally organised a work dinner (score!) one night and I wasn't feeling too great but still dragged myself there.  I'm so glad I went even and fought through it.  Definitely worth it.  Now, the people I went to dinner with are Dishoom regulars and seemed to know what to order.\nThey recommend having about 2 dishes per person.  It's like Indian tapas and it's meant to be shared.  We all threw out a few things from each and most of it was really good.\nChili Cheese Toast - This was good but nothing too spectacular.  \nKeema Pau - This was good - order extra bread because what they give you isn't enough.\nVada Pau - Much better than the Keema one!  Yum!\nChicken Tikka - So good!  The seasoning was great and it was so juicy and tender.\nPaneer Tikka - This was good but would've preferred another order of the Chicken Tikka instead!\nMasala Prawns - Definitely one of the best dishes.  It packed a good spicy punch.  \nLamb Biryani - This was good but nothing fantastic\nHouse Black Daal - Definitely the top dish for me.  \nI didn't see the bill but thinking you'd probably spend more here than your average place. The atmosphere is cool, not too uptight but nice and relaxed at the same time.",

Food hit the mark however service was a little off. We ordered the chicken and pomegranate salad but it was nicer delivered to the table. We had to remind them that it didn't come so that they could take it off the check. We ordered the rajma chawal for our kids so it came out first. When they delivered our food, they brought out a second rajma chawal which we didn't ask for. They took it back. \nA good concept of Indian street food in a refined setting. They take reservations until 6pm only.",

The entrees are meant to be shared. The restaurant has a nice clean casual ambiance on the first floor and a more intimate dining experience downstairs.\nWe visited Dishoom on two different occasions and both visits were exceptional.  We tried the following: Lamb Boti Kebab, Spicy Lamb Chops, Chicken Malai, Chicken Tikka Roll, Seekh Kebab and Keema Pau.  Each dish has its own unique, distinct taste and made an excellent marriage between the food and wine.\nOn our second visit, the owner selected our table for the \"Rules of the Matka\" which means if you roll the dice and get a 6 then they will cover your tab. So of course, the dice rolls and we leave with a wonderful meal on the house!  \nThe owner and service staff were all great and made our last day in London memorable.",

One of my missions in my London life is to find a source for excellent lentils (why is that so hard?!), and Dishoom's black lentils are by far my favorite so far. Thick, rich, creamy, spicy. And only £4.95/order. I could happily sit down with a pot of that and some naan and gorge myself any day of the week.\nThey also have a breakfast/brunch service, which I have yet to try. I suspect that when I persuade them to serve their lentils with poached eggs, they'll never be able to keep me away...\nOverall, a great place for Indian dinner in the heart of Shoreditch. You should go there, it's worth it.",

I wonder if the place would be as busy if it was raining and people didn't want get wet.\nOne great thing is that while lining up, they do provide you with hot drinks.  Some hot appetizers would've been nice too.. That way we're not starving for 1.5 hrs.  My husband had to go buy some food to tie him over lol.\nOnce inside the food smells intoxicating and all you want to do is eat everything.  Maybe that's they're plan... Make you wait so long that their food is amazing no matter what! But I doubt it... The food was pretty amazing.  Definitely get the naan and grilled fish and gravy!

We went to the Covent Garden location in a cold November evening, and had to stand outside to wait for a table.  While standing out in the cold, the staff brought out hot chai teas for all of us, which was already a wonderful touch.  The queue moved rather quickly, so we were seated in about 30 minutes.  The decor inside was quite cool, with Aalto pendant lamps and all.\nThe food was good.  Definitely no complaints, but there was nothing I could remember that was amazing.  Yeah.",

I was disappointed in the small size of the Mango Lasi and the naan bread. One of the things a I love about naan in the UK is that it normally comes in a huge piece. The naan served here is about the size of a normal tortilla cut in half. \nThe seating was good and the service was also good. We go here right at 6pm and we were so lucky we only had to wait 40 minutes. When we left the queue was down the block. \nWe had the vegetable curry paneer, the chicken tikka , and the chicken ruby. All of these dishes were superb, and the flavors were great. We also had garlic naan as well as the house slaw. Make sure to order a side of rice for the table as the curry can be spicy. We were excited to eat here and were glad we waited.",

                "description": "Entrance:\nArrived around 8pm on a Saturday without a reservation. We were told the wait would be around an hour, but as there was no space at the bar downstairs yet, we had to queue outside. There wasn't any option to leave our name and return later either. \nThis was by far the most entertaining queue I'd been in. First, they brought out hot milk tea for all of us. Then, the guy at the door asked us if we wanted to see some magic. He did a few tricks (found a card we picked, made a lighter disappear - this was particularly amusing as the lighter fell out of his sleeve a moment later) and while far from the best, his personality combined with the tricks made it very entertaining. \nShortly after, we were let into the bar area. \nBar:\nManaged to get some stools at the corner so we were comfy. There isn't much space at the bar area so I can see why they were full. Tried the dishoom ipa and thoroughly enjoyed it. We also ordered lamb samosas and calamari. The samosas were excellent but pricey for the portion (2 pieces for 4.2 pounds). \nFood:\nWe ordered the Murgh Malai Chicken, Roomali Roti, Black Daal, Chicken Berry Brittania Biryani, and Raita. This order was just nice for 2 people (we actually doubled up on this as there were 4 of us).\nEverything was amazing! My one complaint might sound a bit weird but it's that the carb:protein ratio in the biryani felt a bit skewed towards protein. It might be because we added an additional chicken dish as well but it just felt like the dish as a whole was getting overpowered by the meat. I solved the problem for myself by giving some extra chicken to one of my friends. And I imagine for most people this won't really be a cause for complaint.\nService:\nPrompt, attentive, friendly. And this covers everyone from the door to the bar to the table. Loved our server in particular. He was incredibly high energy.\nDessert:\nI had the Mango Kulfi and tried a bite of the chocolate mousse. Tasty but nothing special. A slight let down given the high quality of the mains.\nOverall:\nLoved it! Already looking forward to the next visit. As I'm writing all this, I'm not even sure myself why I'm not giving it a 5. It just seemed to fall short somewhere (though I'm not sure where), but this is definitely at the top end of a 4 for me. (I really need yelp to be out of 10...)",

I came here for brunch (I don't normally like burnch on Saturday because it means I have to get out of bed) with some out of town friends because I thought they should try brunch with a difference. We had a full English with a twist - it was all spiced with Indian inspired flavours. The eggs had a massals spicing and tasted divine, the sausage was locally sourced but obviously coated and cooked with some incredibly fragrant and aromatic spice mixture and even the beans came with a chilli twist. \nYes it was expensive, £11.50. But it was worth it. And instead of a mimosa, I sampled a Dishoom breakfast cocktail - orange and grapferuit juices with a splash of Ophir gin, which is oriental in flavour and again fills your palette with the most incredible rush of floral flavours. \nYes please!",

                "description": "My friend took me to Dishoom in London calling it a restaurant which would hit very close to India. The reviews amongst Londoners I met prior to the meal were something along the lines of \"Best Indian restaurant\", \"Daal is to kill for\", etc., So with absurdly high expectations, we hit the restaurant at around 9:30 PM. Waited for 10 minutes and managed to get a spot at the bar with a further estimated wait time of 15 minutes for the actual table. At the bar, we ordered Okra fries and Samosa. \nSamosa - Tasted pretty much like Trader Joes frozen samosas heated up. \nOkra fries - Underwhelmed. No crispness to it. Favors didn't stand out either. \nAfter around 10 minutes of wait time, we got our table. I was willing to let go of the samosa and okra fries and give Dishoom a second chance. We ordered Vada Pav, Bhel Puri, Daal, Bread and Biryani.\nVada Pav - Good. Not a home run, but good. \nBhel Puri - Disaster. Where are my chutneys?! Why am I eating this bland puffed rice? I mixed in the chutneys from the Samosa to save the day. \nDaal - Really really good. They got their signature dish right.\nBiryani - I guess it was Kachi Biryani. Please don't tell me this is Dum. If I am trying to guess the biryani types, you know the biryani is in trouble. All I can say was it was some sort of curry rice. \nOutside of India, the restaurants worthy of mention are Himalaya in Houston, Texas, Vij in Vancouver, Canada, Rasika/Bombay Club in Washington DC, Indian Accent in New York. Dishoom is nowhere close. If I was in London, I would be visiting it yea, but not recommending it as the next best thing outside India.",

For 7 of us, we ordered quite a bit of food and drink, and ended up paying about 19 quid per person.\nSome of the dishes we ordered:\nkeema pau and vada pau - definitely preferred the keema of the two\npaneer and mango salad - fresh with a nice kick to it, one of my favorites\nhouse black daal - tasted great with the naan and roti\nchicken berry britannia (biryani) - much spicier than expected, but still good\nlamb boti kabab - a little dry for my taste\nmurgh malai - very tender, my favorite grill item\nAnd loads of naan, roti, and rice.

Also had some chai tea, which was nice but doesn't compare to the real stuff (if you've been to India).\nI'd always heard that Dishoom was \"affordable\" but I honestly thought it was quite pricey considering I got 5 little pieces of lamb kabab - however it was tasty.

If I visited Dishoom in the earlier part of my trip, I would've been a regular throughout my entire stay(I went twice during my last two days in London). Absolutely fantastic service, delicious food(the garlic naan and the black daal...!!! Incredible.) a wonderful staff. At first I thought they were just treating me well since I was a solo diner, but no--this service was beautifully delivered in a non-transactional way to all guests in the dining room. Dishoom, you deserve the utmost applause--fantastic service and a fantastically consistent product!",

We were recommended Dishoom by many locals and had also heard of the amazing breakfast here as well (we'll try that next time.) We came for dinner and I am happy to say that this meal will go down in the Top 3 I have ever had in my life. To compare, a few days before we went to the MOST rated Indian restaurant on Yelp in London, Tayyabs. These places really don't even compare, Tayyabs felt like the Applebee's version of Indian compared to Dishoom. Yes, Tayyabs food was very good, but the service was terrible and the menu is fairly simple in regards to variety in dishes and we were all having flashbacks to Thursday nights at Applebee's in the style of service and menu.\nDishoom creates a unique experience from the start and the food is an incredible fusion of retro bombay in the imperial times. If that makes sense, or if it doesn't, just go here and you won't be disappoainted.",

A couple quick notes: \n (1) I've never been to Bombay & have no real idea what a Bombay Café is, but I do know Dishoom had a great vibe/atmosphere going\n (2) When it comes to Indian food I'm one of those, \"let's try the tikka masala\" people. Sad but true.\nSitting down, my server was patient with me and made some great recommendations:\n - Sheekh Lamb - really enjoyed this\n - Dhaba Chicken - nothing I would have ever ordered, but I was glad he threw the special at me - very good\n - Naan - only negative was the Naan wasn't warm when it got to me, but they did have a couple 12 tops clogging things up.\nUltimately, this is 3.5 restaurant, but the service rounded it up for me. Worth coming in if you're in the neighborhood. Not sure I'd make a special trip to come here.",

Showed up at the place and hostess informed me that a wait can be up to 50 minutes for 2 people. However if there's space at the bar, we can sit there first. The hostess was friendly and efficient and made you feel welcomed.\nSo we waited about 20-30 minutes and we were able to get a table on the ground floor. We ordered the kebab, lamb chops, chicken curry, garlic naan, and rice to share. The wait staff was average, did their job and had no issues. \nThe food were delicious and I would try other dishes the next time I visit! Would certainly visit again, however if I had to wait outside for 1+ hours in the cold, I wouldn't. Try to visit during non-peak hours.",

                "description": "Best Indian food of my life. I don't even know where to start, but whatever, here I go. \nFound this place online and saw that it had really, really good reviews so I was intrigued. At first I tried to make a reservation on OpenTable but it was booked solid for the next WEEK so I took matters into my own hands and power walked to the place at 5:45pm on a Sunday. Even then, there was about a 20-person line out the door -- but it moved fast. \nAfter about 15 minutes in line, we got seats at the bar and I ordered a Bombay Colada, my sister ordered a virgin one, and my mom ordered a Gin Fizz. Prices were reasonable but on the expensive side -- BUTTT they were well worth their prices which is very rare. I watched the bartender as he made our drinks, and I kid you not, it was like watching a skilled artisan making artisanal goods. I was very impressed, and this was even before I had tasted my drink. It was AMAZING. So amazing that I didn't even care that there was practically zero alcohol content; it was all about the flavors. It was like the rum was just there to sweeten the drink. (I had a sip of my sister's virgin version and while it was good, it was lacking a little something-something, i.e. cane sugar via rum.)\nJust as we were finishing our drinks, as if it were clockwork, our table was ready. (SIDE NOTE: I haven't talked at all about the decor, but it was pretty great too. Super cozy and warm, but also quirky and modern with lots to look at. The main dining area is on the first floor where there is an open kitchen you can peak in to watch your food being prepared, and then the bar and additional seating is downstairs in the basement -- which one would think would be a bit more second-class, but it was NOT. In fact, I was kind of hoping for a table downstairs instead of upstairs because it just seemed so cozy and everyone looked so jolly.)\nAnyway, back to the food. Once we were seated at our table, we were greeted by our lovely server Praveen (sp?) who was friendly and welcoming, and extremely helpful in walking us through the menu. We ended up ordering vegetable samosas, Pau Bhaji, the house Chicken Tikka, Rajma-Chawal, house Black Daal, Roomali Roti, and some good ole garlic naan. Now I am going to spare you from my pathetic descriptions of these foods I can barely pronouce, but I will tell you this, everything was DELICIOUS. Everything. There was not one thing we ordered (we shared everything) that I did not like. Everything was the perfect amount of spicy, and all the flavors were rich and tasty. I'm Pavlov dogging right now just thinking about it. Ugh. I want to go back. Also, the food came out very quickly, and more or less all at once, which was awesome because I was starving.\nWe ate a shit ton of food, and were certainly full, but the thought of skipping out on desert after enjoying every SINGLE thing we had ordered just seemed ludicrous. We did not want to miss out. Each of us got a Chai tea, and then we split a bowl of cinnamon ice cream (sooo rich and creamy) and a pistachio Kulfi -- I had no idea what the latter was, and still don't fully..., but it was so delicious/rich/creamy/yum. Kind of like a cross between ice cream and a popsicle (it comes on a stick). Idk.\nIn conclusion, best indian food of my life. I miss it so much. And I will CERTAINLY be back each and every time I am in the UK. Will probably make a reservation next time though. \nPS, prices are very reasonable/affordable, staff is extremely hospitable, and the place is just not pretentious at all. Wide range of customers and EVERYONE seemed to be a happy camper/enjoying their dining experience.",

                "description": "I have to confess to being bemused by the great fanfare that accompanies Dishoom. I hadn't heard of it, but love Indian food so was more than happy to give it a try for a dinner with a couple of friends. We pitched up at 7pm, were told that there was an hour wait. Happily I'd had an afternoon snack, so didn't mind waiting but it seems to me that if you're going to make people queue for an hour then you'd better make damn sure there's something worthy of that wait at the other end. \nWe didn't get to sit down and order until about 830pm, with nothing but a small glass of chai tea (which I confess, tasted like it had been made from PG Tips) to sustain us in the interim. On the plus side, our waiter was attentive and helpful once we were seated, making recommendations about what to order, almost all of which we took. \nBetween three of us, we had the Pau Bhaji, which set the tone for the rest of the food, being of a mushy consistency albeit quite tasty with the plain rolls with which it was served. We also ordered the Prawn Koliwada, which turned out to be the tastiest dish of the evening in my opinion. they didn't live up to the waiter's description of them as spicy, but they were very well seasoned, and delicious, with a decent number of prawns for a side dish served in a central London eaterie. The vegetable biryani was fine, comparable to what one might get in a decent local take out. the black dahl was surprisingly stingy with the lentils and had a taste that was slightly reminiscent of Heinz tomato soup (I kid you not). \nThe biggest shocker (apart from the roti we ordered which came as a wafer thin bread that was impossible to scoop and eat with - I've eaten my fair share of roti and never seen anything like that) was Dishoom's Covent Garden Chef's Special, the Haleem, a 'revered dish that journeyed from Arabia to Hyderabad in the 19th century, and was there elevated to art form'. It was described on the menu as l lamb, cracked wheat, barley and lentils cooked for hours then pounded and served with a sesame onion seed naan and a garnish of green chillies, fresh ginger, fried onions and mint. \nWhat we got was greying mush that I have subsequently described to people (with no small degree of accuracy) as reminiscent of the nutrient goop that people have to eat in post-apocalyptic societies. It didn't really taste of much, particularly without the garnishes, and it was difficult to tell whether any animals were harmed in the making of this dish (if they were, it was an unworthy sacrifice). \nto top it off, the Bombay Pimms (\"The classic English quencher gone native with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, citrus and coriander. Fiery ginger beer, not \nlemonade\") I ordered tasted only of ginger beer, and not the fiery kind. \nPleasant service and an exotic twist on the passing vogue for vintage interiors in no way make up for the crushing disappointment I experienced here. It's only the (slightly too noisy) ambience and the fact that the food wasn't bad so much as 'blah' that makes this a 2 rather than 1 star review. This is typical of the trend for taking cheap, tasty street food, prettifying it beyond all recognition (usually jettisoning taste at the same time) and then charging a bundle (the lamb goop was £16!) for the privilege. \nthanks, but no thanks - I'll be sticking to the bustling environs of Tooting or Southall in future.",

The dining experience here definitely beats the kitschy, 1980's living room atmosphere I'm used to with mom-and-pop Indian joints back home. Service was totally fine as well.\nThe food though. Ultimately, for me it doesn't matter how cool a restaurant looks if the food isn't up to snuff. I stopped in for lunch one day after reading all of the reviews. I just don't.. get it. We got the chicken tikka, the lamb with rice, and some garlic naan. It was tasty, don't get me wrong, but really not life-changing in my mind. It made me a little depressed to shell out the Central London premium when the bill came, knowing that there are better and cheaper alternatives in East London.\nNot a hater, but not exactly a fan either. I just found it to be wildly overrated. To each his own, I guess.",

I have been around Indian/Pakistani restaurants my entire life and feel that although not the most traditional food, Dishoom does a good job of gaining respect in its own way. The dishes are well thought out and executed with care. I have a habit of trying multiple things to try so we ordered: vegetable samosas, pau bhaji, lamb chops, ruby chicken, lamb biryani, naan, garlic naan, rumali roti, chai, fresh lemonade, green tea, mango lassi, khoya kulfi, mango kulfi, and the guju chocolate dessert. \nOverall:\nA must try if you are into Indian/Pakistan cuisine to give you a unique experience.",

By the time we left an hour later the restaurant was full and a solid line outside. Good service with attentive staff & willing to share open insights into menu. Nothing we ordered was disappointing. Okra fries. Lamb samosas. Wanted to try their version of chickentikka but one member of our party wasn't keen on spicy dishes & the waitress was able to help us head this off. Murgh malai & masala prawns were splendid, the char on the prawns particularly excellent. But stand out was the Ruby Chicken, a curry with melt in your mouth chicken. I also treated myself to one of their cocktails, the Bombay Pimms & can heartily recommend. £25 a head seemed reasonable for the range of dishes.

                "description": "Busy place on a Friday evening in a bustling neighborhood. Saw the great Yelp reviews and stopped in for arguably my fav ethnic cuisine. First impression is that it's a bit more Westernized (and full of white people) than the places I usually frequent. Open mind nonetheless!\nAll I can say is the veggie samosas are among the best I've encountered. Flaky, potato-y, peppery, hearty, and perfectly spiced. Wow. Pairs like a champ with the tamarind chutney. And def go for the veggie version -- the lamb simply doesn't work as well.\nOrdered the chefs special Haleem, which arrived at the table surprisingly quickly. Creamy lentil base offered some contrast with the spice-rich additions, yet the depth simply wasn't there. And I found the plain naan a superior match to the included poppy-onion naan. Solid, yet unremarkable overall. And certainly not worth £16.50.\nGoing with 3* here since 3.5 isn't available and I suspect this place is overrated. Based on my limited (read: singular) experience, I'd venture elsewhere for truly great Indian cuisine. But if you're in the area, pop in for an order or two of veggie simosas: you won't be disappointed.",

Excellent, flavorful meals on both occasions, ample portions.  For dinner, I started off with a Mumbai-style pau bhaji, a vegetable curry (bhaji) with a toasted, buttered piece of bread (pau).  This was followed by a main course of 5 dishes: Dishoom 'slaw, a creamy kachumber salad with cabbage, cucumbers, onions and  tomato; house black daal; a South Indian chicken curry, Chicken Ruby (Ruby Murray = Cockney rhyming slang for curry); one Roomali Roti, paper-thin roti bread; and steamed Basmati rice.  It was more than I could handle, but I somehow put it all away.  To top it off, I ordered the chocolate chai.",

                "description": "Bear out the wait! It's never as long as they say, and worth it for the free chai (dirty if you are lucky). If there is a place in Central London I like to eat in more, I haven't found it. Having loved and lived in Mumbaj it makes me nostalgic for lunch and dinner dates in Cafe Britannia and other Parsi cafés. \nIf you or members of your group aren't used to eating Indian food, this is a great introduction with something for everyone. I've brought family, friends, and dates. Kick it off with a cocktail, all are good, but I especially recommend an off the menu item called the 'Dhoble' (Dub-lay; named after Mumbai's infamous Polic Commissioner)- just ask them to ask the bar staff.\nI'm a big fan of the pau bhaji/bhel/vada pau for starters. Highly recommend the Biryani or Bhoti kabobs for mains. No order will be complete without the house Black Daal (my Keralan GF adores it). Remember it's easier and cheaper to share- most dishes can serve two. Mop it all up with a roomali roti (handkerchief roti- ask to see them make it, it's epic).\nTruthfully dessert isn't as strong as the rest. Go for the kulfi on a stick. Chai is too small a portion in my opinion, coffee is fine but not done in traditional pulled fashion. Just grab cocktail 2 or 3 instead :)\nI'd be surprised if it comes to more than £30pp :)",

                "description": "It took two attempts before we could grab a table. Dishoom does not accept reservations unless for parties of 6 or more. Your best bet is to arrive before 6pm to get a table, otherwise, it is an average of an hour for a table. There is a small bar section downstairs while you wait for a table. The vibe here is full of energy! \nPimms lemonade and lukosowa cocktail was the poison of the evening -- they were very refreshing for the spicy food that was to come. For London, the price on the cocktail was rather reasonable.\nFor the food, we decided to do a tasting sample. Be sure you ask for the heat index, we didn't and got ourselves into a pinch half way through dinner. The dome oven was broken, so that was a bummer. Most dishes are appetizer size, so you'll need about 2- 3 dishes per person. But, don't let the waiter influence your decision, order as you go along.\nGarlic Naan: crispy and packed with garlic, you almost don't taste the bread. It's a garlic lover's dream come true!\nBhel: we were a little surprised by this rice cracker dish which has the texture of rice crispy cereal providing for a neat texture. Don't be fooled by the berries, you'll gonna need that sweetness once the heat hits - it gets you at the back of your throat.\nChicken Berry Biryani: curry chicken, slow cooked, served over rice and a full serving. This was a great medium heat dish.\nVada Pau: spiced potato and chutney in a bun. Two buns per order. One bit per bun. \nDhaba Chicken: curry chicken that was a bit too spicy, a rather small serving.\nMago & Fennel Lassi: cold refreshing drink to help cool your mouth.  This is yogurt based. \nHalf way through the meal, my mouth was on fire.  Another waitress saw me starting to swell up as I tried in vain to wave cool air into my mouth. He brought over Raita, a cool cucumber yogurt sauce, on the house. It was a really nice gesture and did the trick. Shortly after, the house manager came by and asked if we needed any more bread, also on the house.  I was too embarrassed to say yes - however, very appreciative of their service.",

The place has never disappointed me in terms of food and quality of service. The dishes are not so big in size of portion but the value is definitely high. You pay for a well-designed space with some random decorations scattered around. They are not exactly compatible but the composition do make the restaurant look interesting and comfortable.\nI can make a personal recommendation on the bacon rolls. The pork belly is smooth and glistering and cooked so well that it literally melts in my mouth. However, with the pork belly being on the heavy side, the dish is just the right size so I won't get too full. That leaves a wiggle room for dessert and another chance to leaf through the menu. There's this one particular dessert that can make you shiver from the goodness - the Pineapple and Black Pepper crumble. It does sound weird but one should try it before judging it.\nStaff are always buzzing around and will come up always at the right time when you're ready to order up.",

If you can stomach the 40 minute outside wait followed by another 20 minutes inside then you're ready to find out. Right from the start when they serve complimentary chai and sherry to those waiting in line, all the way through the snacks and cocktails in the waiting bar downstairs Dishoom does its best to minimize the one negative thing it has going for it which is it's insane and totally warranted popularity (you may have to flag the waitress down in the bar though, if there's one obvious thing to improve its that they should hire a second waitress, I could see quite a few people frustratedly trying to get her attention even tho she was working her butt off, there were just too many people down there).  The fried squid was far more delicious and had a spicy depth that belied the  calamari-like appearance. The ruby chicken is a little standard but very good version of chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan sopped up the spicy hot juices bringing just a glimmer of sweat to my brow. The black daal was maybe a tad dryer than I would have liked but again full of deep flavours. The paneer tikka was amongst the best I've ever had, made better by a topical spice that gave the cheese a nice saltiness. The veg up sell was totally boring however but not enough to lose a star. The highlight was the lamb chops which compared to another famous Indian lamp chop from Tayyabs comes out the winner. Finally the plain kulfi pop dessert was an amazing light and fragrant way to end the meal along with another cup of their amazing chai (which unlike many is actually really spicy)\nWell worth the hype!",

We were turned away at the door for it being \"too late\" despite the restaurant being open until 11pm. We could have even ordered take out but the door man told us to go eat somewhere else. There were 2 couples in line in front of us, it's not like we brought an army of people to feed. We went to Punjab down the street and they were very accommodating.",

The downstairs area reminded me of a German beer cellar and will come into its own in winter, I am sure (a bit dark for my liking when outdoors is treated to a rare ray of sunshine).\nDishoom is the perfect place for a quick bite to eat and perfectly located for pre-theatre dinner, etc. We were all quite intrigued by the breakfast menu which starts at 8am  excellent idea!\nI am a big fan of tapas-style menus as I can never make up my mind and love the idea of tasting many different flavours. The portions are quite generous and the hardest decision will be when to stop ordering. We were lucky to be introduced to the head chef and learnt a bit more about the menu which is a collection of favourite dishes from different regions in India  apparently there is no other place where you'd find a similar variety.\nWe sampled a Bombay take on Pimms  a particular hit with fans of ginger beer!",

Came in around midday on a Friday with a friend, fearing we'd hit the midday lunch rush, but luckily for us the place was practically empty, and we were seated right away!\nApart from that, the locale is lovely, and when presented with the menu, both of us had the hardest time choosing what we would be eating as there were so many dishes that looked equally (read: very) appealing (always a good sign)! In the end, we settled on their house black daal and the paneer roll, both of which were delicious! Had we had more time on our hands, I would have loved to try some of their desserts - the group seated next to us tried them, and they all looked very good (not to mention how good their cocktails looked- also absolutely must try them next time!). \nGiven the number of Indian restaurants in London, and the admittedly varying quality of said restaurants, finding a centrally-located, well-priced, and excellent Indian like Dishoom is something of a miracle! I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",

Alas, of course, reservations were filled up a week ahead of time, so we decided to endure the queuing b/c it's worth it. And is it worth it. Just come with the right mindset. We went on a Saturday night around 7pm and ended up waiting 2 hours (knowingly). But they make the waiting experience as best as possible: offer chai tea and sherry samples outside, there are heat lamps to keep you warm, and once you're inside, you're sent to the bar to continue the wait but with drinks and nibbles in hand. If you're coming with good company, you don't really notice the wait. Once seated at our table, we had excellent service and of course, don't have to reiterate, the food is to die for. We were literally silent for about 10 minutes while everyone scarfed their food down. My mom always says that the chef's best compliment is silence. ;) Have been told this place is great for breakfast, so will have to do that sometime soon!",

Food came quickly, though service was a bit slow, and the restaurant is super packed (people kept bumping into my chair). Came here around 6:30pm on a Wed night. \nCalamari - Very tasty but small portions. The seasoning was fantastic.\nChicken Berry Biryani - Oooo that spice! Amazing biryani though nothing special when compared to other biryani's i've had. Pretty spicy, be warned. \nMango and Paneer salad - The dressing was great. Very refreshing and worth getting tp balance out the heavier dishes. \nDaal - DELICIOUS. Can you taste the butter? Mmmm. I couldn't stop picking at this even when I was way past stuffed.\nNaan - Standard\nThe waiters will try to push food on to you. We were prepared to order three things and the waiters kept telling us it was not enough. Um. Trust me. We had so much food left over, we felt guilty... and we were stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable. Start out with three dishes (maybe 2 mains and a starter for two) and build on that if you want. \nAll the above, plus a mango lassi (Seems thinner and more watered down than most places. Not sure if I like that.) and chai (fantastic chai! though they only give you a tiny tiny cup... not a fan), was 20 quid per person. \nAgain, not crazy expensive, but not cheap for Indian food either.",

I can't really fault the food - but it's not incredible, it's just a well honed menu that's cooked well...but it isn't ground breaking or any different to any other Indian restaurant around London really. I think it's mainly because this is a well decorated chain, that's the appeal.   We've had a few instances here where they haven't been able to adjust the menu even a little to suit our vegetarian friends - which is a shame as it wasn't difficult, then they kicked up a fuss about us, made us feel as though we were really demanding too much - so that's why I'm not giving it four stars.",

                "description": "I've done it - completed the Dishoom triumvirate. \nThis one is probably the most popular branch of the most popular old-Bombay-style restaurant in London. Right on Upper St Martin's next to Jamie's Italian, there's no hiding from the crowds and that keeps the line outside for weekend brunch consistently long. For us (four people), the wait was about 25 minutes. We were given a buzzer and invited to wait downstairs for a table, though other parties were made to wait outside - not sure why the separation. \nThere is a whole science to the service at Dishoom, designed so the customers never go ANYWHERE unescorted. We were radioed into the restaurant by two hostesses, and then had to check in with the indoor hostess, who directed us downstairs to someone else who showed us where to wait. A fifth staffer brought us to our table, and finally we met the sixth and final staffer, our server. Service is always friendly and they certainly had one of the lowest staff-to-guests ratios I've seen of late. There are tons of staffers buzzing to and fro, one guy in the kitchen who just slaps out chapatis onto the stone oven, and one extremely tall dude whose job seemed to be walking around being extremely tall and good-looking. The only complaint was that we had to prompt for refills on our \"bottomless\" Chai - servers twice took away our empty glasses without offering refills. At Dishoom Shoreditch they always offer refills, so it sucks to have to be aggressive about the \"bottomless\" part here.\nAnyway, the food - as everyone and their mother have written - is stellar. Enhanced by a charming atmosphere with hanging lights, wooden tables and a general buzz in the air, this is a great place for a weekend catch-up brunch. The naan rolls were generously sized and freshly prepared, while the kerjiwal is greasy, cheesy, spiced, runny-yolk goodness. I liked how the toast didn't get soggy in the time it took to eat the dish. Be prepared for a bit of chaos, but it all goes down easy with the great food, warm service and fun dining room.",

                "description": "Dishoom was our \"big dinner out\" place when I studied abroad in London, and I still fantasize about their black daal, which is the best I've ever had--and I've been to India! Their chicken tikka is tender and juicy, and the roomali roti (literally \"handkerchief bread\" for its thinness) is awesome for mopping up their curries. It's also a good place to get food that's more representative of Maharashtrian/Gujarati-style Indian cuisine, which is sorely lacking stateside. My dining companion, on one occasion, found the pau bhaji to be sort of overcooked, but I enjoyed it. We need more West Indian restaurants in the US!\nThey don't take dinner reservations (something that seems to be common amongst trendier restaurants in London--I guess to up the hype?) so it can be a wait, but they have a nice bar downstairs and they seat really quickly. I also like the 1960s Bombay kitsch of the decorations--plus they serve Limca in the bottle! What else could you ask for?",

They have a gluten-free menu and plenty of vegetarian options, although next time I go I'll take some more meaty friends and get the haleem, which always looks so good.\nEven if there's a wait, it's well worth it; I've been here pre-theatre and it's always worthwhile.

It was so delicious! \nThe rice was not weighed down by sauces or fillings but rather, it was light and fluffy, mixed with the perfect amount of spices. It was on the spicy side but not flaming hot. Chicken was juicy and the right quantity. I do wish, however, that there were real berries in the dish; the \"berry\" was just cranberries/craisins. Still, the sweetness of the cranberries balanced the spicyness of the chicken and rice. \nMy friends also ordered the Biryani and Dhaba Chicken Curry (£7.50) with naans (£1.70-1.90 each). \nI don't like the traditional yellow, coconuty-tasting, Indian curries but the Dhaba Chicken was a pleasant red curry and was not heavy at all! I wish it came with naan or rice already; instead, the meal kind of forces you to pay to have it on the side. \nAttentive service (compulsory tip) and classy place with downstairs seating for more formal gatherings or bigger groups. \nDefinitely trendy and classy restaurant to bring coworkers, clients or friends visiting from out-of-town (:",

Started out with an hour and a half queue in the cold, which could easy have ruined an evening out. However the wait flew by thanks to the rounds of free warm tea and chocolate-bourbon chai. The hostesses were friendly and accommodating and before we knew it we were waiting inside at the bar. The cocktails are great. I had the Bombay Bellini, consisting of raspberries, lychees, rose & prosecco. Seriously delicious. Like if I had one wish it would be for one of those to appear magically in my hand whenever I was hot and looking to cool down, or just at all times. When we were seated the waitress walked us through the menu. The food is tapas style, several small plats ranging from £2-£8. My boyfriend and I split veggie samosas, paneer tikka (jesus christ that paneer), a lamb rice dish, garlic naan and this fantastic black daal. Everything was incredible, the best Indian food of my life. I was floored by how flavorful (and cheap!) everything was. There was plenty of food for the two of us and our bill rounded up to a lovely £56,81.\nSo yeah the food is to die for and the cocktails are delicious, but what really put my visit to Dishoom over the top was the service. Every single staff member was so genuine and friendly, with out being over the top. Attentive and warm, with plenty of helpful information regarding the menu items. When I mentioned to the manager how impressed I was she bought us a round of drinks! Like what?? What is this magical place of delicious affordable wonderment?\nIt's Dishoom. That's what it is. 5/5 all the way.",

                "description": "I came here for dinner after spending a somewhat rainy day seeing the sights in Westminster and spending a little time avoiding said rain at the National Gallery. Living right next to the neighborhood for curry in NYC (dubbed 'Curry Hill' as a result), I wanted to check out how curry in the UK would compare. Getting a seat was easy enough, but unless it was a bad day, do not sit downstairs unless absolutely forced to. There's no natural lighting (which is depressing at 6 PM), but whatever was going on in the bathroom was infecting the aroma of the entire room. I don't like dining in places that smell like dank urine. After struggling to breathe for a few minutes, my girlfriend and I were able to get a seat upstairs. Much better, but a mark off for having a bar downstairs that smells worst than most dives.\nThe food itself was alright, although I wasn't blown away, particularly at London prices. The lamb kebob was very flavorful, but the portions were a bit small (a recurrent theme with the dishes here). The dhaba chicken curry was good as well - the curry sauce was definitely more tomato-based (or vegetable-based) than the curries I'm used to, but it didn't leave much variety for the palette.\nService was pretty standard for Britain, so all in all, it was an experience that came in a bit under expectations. Even with ordering an appetizer (I forget right off which one we ordered), the bill came out to 40 pounds - which is pretty damn expensive given the rather small amount of food we ordered. Considering I can score top-notch curry + rice for under $20 in the U.S., I'd give the upper hand to the neighborhood shops that are right across the block.",

It's just been really great.\nDrink:\nHouse Chai - this has been one of the best chai I've had in a while. No need to explain, you should just get this.\nFresh Mint Tea - comes in a pot and has mint notes that seem to satisfy you immediately as you take deep breathes through the nose. Good subtle flavors for your morning wake me up.\nFood:\nBombay Omelette - Pretty straight forward dish, omelette with a hint of spice together with onion and tomatoes. The side of vine tomatoes that are grilled are a very nice add when having the omelette and bread together. \nFresh Fruit and Yoghurt - This is a surprisingly good dish. Simply put together with yoghurt and various fruits like raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and honeydew. The vanilla beans are visible on the yoghurt and add the great vanilla flavor along with the tart and sweet fruits.\nBacon Naan Roll - ummmmm bacon... can't go wrong. That chili tomato jam with cream cheese is a nice combination. It's pretty sweet, but goes well with the salty, savory bacon wrapped up in the naan bread.\nWould love to come here for their dinner service, but so far has not gone wrong during breakfast.",

What self-respecting Indian restaurant serves Mediterranean/Italian fare? Man was I wrong. Hip or not, dishoom has amazing Indian food. Don't believe me? Eye up the clientele. The best way to figure out whether an Indian place is legit is to find older Indian patrons. If they are satisfied, then you sure as hell don't have any excuse not to be. Dishoom was bursting with Indians, and large portion of them were older :)\nFor our food we ordered the Ruby Chicken, Kacchi Lamb Biryani with a side of Raita, and Roomali Roti. The Ruby Chicken was amazing. Perfectly complex, seasoned, and spicy. The biryani had prize pieces of Lamb. I am so used to getting sub par meat in Biryani, but the meat here was excellent. The raita was hands down the best I have ever had...creamy, thick, and cool. I only ordered one Roomli roti, but I honestly wish my own family could make roti as good as this one. All in all a wonderful meal and I can not wait to head back.",

The sauces are the stars and really bring it all together. Eggs perfectly cooked with the yolk still runny. The sausage however is just one small chipolata which is a bit of a downer but anything larger probably wouldn't work. Prices are reasonable for what you get. (Visit - 26/02/2015 Breakfast)",

                "description": "Ah,  Dishoom. How I have been waiting to eat your delectable creations. Finally, I had my chance.\nUpon walking up to Dishoom, my husband and I noticed a ridiculously long line. Unfortunately for groups less than six people, reservations are not possible - get here early and prepare to wait in line (a long time if you're unfortunate) to get inside. Those wishing the battle the wait can either go downstairs to the tiny bar and enjoy refreshments or be served complimentary goodies (like masala chai) while waiting in line outside for which I applaud them. Very good manners, Dishoom. Well played.\nOur line was supposed to be an hour long but as luck would have it, we waited less than 20 some minutes and were escorted inside to our table. \nThe inside of Dishoom looks like what tea houses and cafes looked like in Bombay before they all started to disappear. Having gone to India in February, I was feeling nostalgic looking at all of the old Hindi film posters and black and white photographs. We were greeted immediately by our sever who asked us if we had ever eaten at Dishoom before. She guided us through the menu and suggested how we order - Dishoom is a small plates type of restaurant. It's best to order several items per person and share them. Dishes come out as soon as they're ready, so be prepared to receive items piping hot and in a random order. \nThe cocktail list was interesting. Instead of ordering wine, we started with a Jack Daniels and Coke (for the husband) and a Bollybellini (for me). Opting to avoid our usual extravaganza of paneer dishes while eating out at an Indian restaurant, we ordered the pau bhaji, the house black daal, bowl of greens, rice, rajma frankie and gunowder potatoes. Everything was excellent - I don't need to go into the particularities of each dish. All I'll say is next time, I'll order a paneer dish, skip the greens and daal (although it's famous, I've had better. The pau bhaji was absolutely excellent (you can taste the butter) but more bread should be served with such a big portion. We each also sampled more cocktails - Edwina's Affair (or Edwina's something) and the Bombay Pimms and skipped dessert - we were far too stuffed to order more food, although we considered it more than once.\nDinner was pricey but worth it. Service was friendly and attentive. Everything was sparkling clean and the restaurant itself appears to run like a well-oiled machine. Downstairs in the bathroom, behind glass cases are very vintage looking Indian medicines to cure all sorts of remedies - a very interesting and thought-provoking display for those who have visited India. \nWe will most definitely be back!",

Their signature chicken curry dish is absolutely amazing, I have go give them that, but I found their other dishes subpar. My boyfriend ordered a paneer curry dish that lacked in flavor and spice, was not even comparable to the taste of the chicken curry that I ordered.\nWait is often incredibly long, and it is crowded and loud in the restaurant. Maybe I just went on an off day this time, but I was not as impressed with it and believe that there are other more authentic indian restaurants with less wait and hype in the area.",

I had been wanting to check it out since my last business trip when two separate co-workers had tried it and came back with positive reviews. Our party of four had to wait a little over an hour to get in, but the time went by quickly. The hostesses that managed the line were very friendly, and I loved the chai and mint tea they brought out to the line to keep us warm.\nMy favorites of the night were the fried skate cheeks and okra from the appetizer/small plates menu as well as the lamb biryani and chicken ruby (curry) from the main entrees menu. Heck, everything was delicious though; I really doubt that you can go wrong with your ordering here.\nWe rounded out the evening with sulfis all around for dessert. The pistachio sulfi was absolutely marvelous; you've got to try it!\nAnyway, I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in London. So, so good!",

I think when you stand in line for food you are often let down as you expect so much from standing in line. People who have had to stand in line to eat here may give this place less points.

I ordered chili bread(?) appetizer, ruby chicken, basmati rice, and garlic naan. My main, rice and naan actually came out before my starter, which was a little surprising, but worked out fine as I dipped the bread in the ruby sauce. Chili bread was tasty, but really nothing to get excited about. Rice was very good and cooked to perfection. Garlic naan was good, but a little thick around the edges. \nI like a little bit of heat with my Indian food (usually a vindaloo guy), but the waiter warned me that non of their dishes were overtly spicy hot.  The ruby chicken was supposed to be one of the spicer dishes available. It had great flavor and was very tender, but was missing the heat I really wanted. They did serve some little sauces which included a pepper one, that did help a bit. I have found in general the British are a little tame when it comes to adding heat, so I'm sure this is partially why there is nothing \"hot\" on the menu. \nPrices are a little much for the portion sizes. \nHigh quality food, lacking heat, but tasty.",

That many people can't be wrong and in good groupthink fashion I went with the crowds and after my experience I was happy I did. \nThe staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Indian cuisine was unfamiliar to us so the server gave us a thorough rundown of the menu. In the end we left it up to our server and we were rewarded with a flurry of tastes and spices. Yes, this is bold and dangerous at an Indian restaurant. However, the food was colorful, flavorful, aromatic, and some dishes, not all, were spicy. The cheese naan can and should be dipped in just about any of the sauces accompanied by the food. \nOrder a kingfisher beer which compliments the spicy food. \nDon't be afraid to use your hands! \nFor dessert they offer these ice cream Popsicles in a variety of flavors. Do get one.",

And wonderful if you don't want to smell like curry after your meal.\nI once dined at Dishoom twice in a week, that's how good this Bombay-inspired eatery is. Situated in Covent Garden, it's super central and good for groups up to six but beyond that be prepared to split up.\nNot to be missed: pau bhaji and the lamb biryani (make sure to pair with raita!)\nI'm hoping someday soon to join the Bombay Breakfast Club (yup, Dishoom's open in the morning!)

I came here for lunch and was really looking forward to trying some Indian curry. There is also a breakfast menu here that looked really good and one of my regrets was not being able to try that.\nI came without a reservation on a Monday and there was a slight wait, but was able to get seated within 10 minutes. I ordered the Chicken Ruby with steamed Basmati rice. By far the best curry I have ever had and went well with the rice (I should have ordered naan too!). To my surprise, when I got my bill, I found out they had an event on Mondays where you roll a die and if you get a certain number, your meal is free! However, my luck wasn't great that day...whole meal came out to about £11. I would recommend this place to anyone exploring London and looking for good Indian food!",

                "description": "We came here based on the Yelp reviews. Being a friday evening, there was a large crowd gathered outside which is always a good sign. We didn't have reservations and we were told the wait would be an hour. However, it ended up being far shorter (maybe 30 min?) and time passed by quickly as we made small talk with other customers. They serve complimentary drink samplers which are delicious while you wait for your table.\nThe place is extremely clean and the decor is modern eclectic, lighting is a bit too focused, like spotlights on you, rather than ambiance lighting. it gets pretty loud in the rooms but not annoyingly so. Service is very good though the busy night left the hosts a bit frantic. \nWe started with the Far Far, a crispy appetizer with spicy sauces. Delicious and my favorite dish. A crispy treat with a nice spicy kick to it. Next came the Bada Pau, a potato mash on dinner bun, which I enjoyed as well though my wife didn't. The potato was well prepared though my wife felt that it wasn't nothing special. The Spicy Lamb Chops followed. This was the most disappointing dish for us both. The meat was overcooked which made it dry and a bit too fatty. I understand that the fat is likely left on to keep the meat moist but they still missed the mark on this one. The Black Daal, a lentil based dish, was my wife's favorite. She enjoyed the perfect creamy consistency and felt that it was seasoned perfectly. She felt that it was perfectly paired up with the Garlic Naan. On the other hand, I felt that it was lacking in flavor and was a bit too watery. The Roti was a bit too rubbery and lacking the toasted softness that is typical of a good roti. \nAll in all, I was left disappointed while my wife was a bit less so but commented that she would return to explore the menu more.",

The house black daal (£4.90) was soul-warming, thick and mildly spiced, the ultimate comfort food. It was perfect scooped up with chewy roomali roti (£1.90) and naan (£1.90), both freshly baked. I think the thicker naan held the daal better than the roti, though both were delicious. I couldn't stop eating it, even on a scorching hot day! The naan and roti were also great with the chutneys on the table. I'd accept the cold London winters if I could eat this every day. \nDessert was just meh. If a dessert is more expensive than my entree, it better be amazing, and the pineapple & black pepper crumble (£5.20) wasn't. That's not to say it was awful -- it wasn't too sweet and I could taste the black pepper in the topping. It paired well with the cinnamon ice cream, but after a heavy meal, I would have preferred just the ice cream, or one of the kulfis.\nThe atmosphere was certainly unique. Loved the Bombay cafe decor. I never felt rushed, although I've heard the waits for dinner get quite long!",

I must say, that this place is very hit or miss, to get a table!   Always busy during peak times, so make reservations, or roll the dice like we did!   \nThe food is awesome -- the service, not as much!   Maybe they just get busy.   I was here a few times and the service wasn't all the great -- 5 tables occupied and 10 waiters standing around doing nothing.   Not even to refill a water glass.   Oh well.\nThe food saves it here -- its fresh and really awesome!   Not be missed:  the House Black Daal -- totally rocking.   The chicken was awesome as well, so get that.   Take some time looking over the menu -- its extensive -- but worth it -- everything we ordered was good.\nIf you've ever wanted to know what Bombay was like with the British influence, come here.   You'll get the idea quickly!",

Unfortunately, our service was a bit spotty -- our server completely forgot to get us water or chutneys.  \nThere was a queue outside to be seated, complete with magic tricks and drinks.

Any company that engages with their customers well and makes you feel like part of the family has two thumbs up from me! They're really friendly and always up for a tweet or two, and if you're lucky you might get an invite for some free chai!\nThe food was mouth-watering...in fact my mouth is watering right now as I think back to the Pau Bhaji and Chicken Tikka dishes - mmmmmm. Their naan's are made to perfection; soft with a slight crisp and no need to chew for 10 mins before you can move on to the next bite!\nThe Tipples (cocktails) are genius! I had a Bhang lassi and if you're of the Indian kind you'll just have had a Scooby \"huuuuh\" moment. It's lassi with a generous amount of Rum and garnished with mukwaas! Delish!\nI cannot wait to their breakfast menu one of these days and i'll definitely be visiting again....this month in fact!",

A nice touch that made the wait easier to bear. \nAfter about 50 minutes we were seated. The whole process was very well organized and everyone was very friendly both during the wait and during dinner, often checking to see how we were doing. \nHighly recommend even if you have to wait.",

Also ordered the Dishoom branded IPA and it was disappointing so don't go there.\nLost a point to my taste because of too much butter on the butter naan (I know...

While you are awaiting,  you can hang out at the bar downstairs where they have Indian inspired cocktails.\nMy friend ordered the Boybam Pina Colada which was okay. It just tasted heavily of coconut milk and some 'Indian' spices. That being said, the atmosphere was lovely, the decor is very classy and the lighting makes for a great vibe. \nWe ordered the samosas to start which were £4.00 a portion. Not. Worth. It. They are the packaged kind that you can get at any Sainsbury's or Tescos so avoid them if you can. The papadoms are delicious as is the naan bread. The curry is mediocre. Nothing you can't / won't get at a local Indian delivery place. \nIn summation, go for the vibe but not the flavour.",

The decor makes you feel like you are in an early-1900's cafe in Bombay, so refreshing compared to other standard Indian restaurants.\nWe ordered a range of things to share. I am a big fan of okra fries, house black dhaal, grilled paneer, and the masala prawns. The garlic naan is also a must. I was surprised to see that they did not have peshwari naan. The only dish that I wasn't impressed with was the vegetarian briyani. It was mediocre and had nothing special.\nThe prices were extremely reasonable and my sisters and I agreed that this spot is really one of the best Indian spots we've been to in London.",

We were impressed by the staff's efficiency in getting us seated and their communication with one another. The menu looked divine and I ordered the black daal and naan, while my friends ordered vegetable samosas, chicken ruby and a potato dish. The food arrived promptly and everything tasted absolutely fantastic. I've had daal in several places before but the daal at dishoom was some of the best I've ever had. We finished off the meal with mango kulfi, a rich, creamy mango Popsicle which was the perfect finale to a great meal. Prices are good for the quality of the food and the restaurant has a lovely ambience.",

The staff was very nice and the food was great, though I've had better naan at other locations.  Then naan was good, though it was a tad too crispy for my own taste as I prefer it fluffier, but that's no deal breaker.  They also had Kingfisher beer, which is easily the best Indian beer around. The place is small and dark but has a nice atmosphere and if you have to wait to be seated, you'll get hooked up with spiked chai which definitely makes the wait a lot more pleasant.\nI would certainly put Dishoom down on my list of places to check out if looking for Indian food while in London.",

The best description of this cocktail can be found directly on Dishoom's website:  \ndishoom.com/2012/05/clas…\n.\n(Yes, I'm aware of the laziness inherent to my decision NOT to describe the cocktail)\nAs for the cuisine, this is a refreshing departure from curries loaded in oils and fat or rice dishes buried in a pile of butter.  Rather, you will find a celebration of grilled meats spiced to perfection, proper preparations of biryani loaded with flavor from spices and your accompanying meat of choice, and delightfully soft naan (the one area where I do enjoy a rather unhealthy coat of butter).  \nOverall, I think Dishoom served some solid cuisine in a chic space and adds welcoming dashes of great service and splendid drinks.

After hearing that I MUST try the Indian food in London, I thought Dishoom would be my best bet. It totally was. There was a wait when we arrived around 8 pm but we were seated within 30 minutes or so. \nI wanna say the menu is set up kinda like a tapas style..which can make it expensive. We ordered a pitcher of Bombay Pimm's to start and it was delicious! We ordered some naan and veggie samosas for apps, definitely recommend both. I ordered the chicken tikka and devoured each bite, especially with that fabulous yogurt sauce. I wish it was in the states so I could enjoy it whenever I wanted!",

The wait was long as they don't accept reservations after 6pm for parties of less than six. We had about 25 mins of waiting outside, which wasn't too bad because of the friendly staff and people, and were served tea often. Then we had another 30 mins of waiting at their downstairs bar, before collecting our buzzer. The drinks and appetizers were excellent. Do NOT miss the Kolawadi Prawns - trust me, I know Indian food. They are spicy, but not crazily so. For the main course, we had the following all excellent, all 5-star dishes: the Ruby Chicken (not for those that love very spicy Indian food and like all their Indian meals to be mad spicy), the chicken biryani, rumali rotis, black daal, and a pistachio kulfi (on a thin, pointy stick, just like in India!) for dessert.

Soft shell crab in a curry sauce was nice though a bit too salty - with some roti it went well. Chicken tikka was succulent, fresh and juicy - definitely worth a try. And dessert (chocolate mousse) was heavenly. Thing is - you mix it with the frozen yogurt yourself and a yogurt is so much healthier than heavy cream!\nWe left the place satisfied, but not disgustingly full when you down heaps of oily curries and thick naan - but more like 'happy inside' and feeling good about ourselves.\nThe atmosphere in this place is quite cool - sort of old school bollywood meets urban. It has dimmed light and nice music. Perfect!\nThe service was good and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back!",

                "description": "The place is mobbed, not surprising given the Covent Garden location and inside it's working at full tilt with a slightly frenetic atmosphere.\nThe food is Indian Street food but with West End London prices but quite reasonable really and pretty straightforward. Definitely Indian rather than the more Bangladeshi style that is quite common in London (both are good in my book).\nWe could only get a 6pm table and already the place was packed . It's a bit of a production line but we were seated right away and service was quick and efficient. Drinks came quickly. We ordered our food (being told that everything would come as soon as it was ready) and it all arrived within about 10 minutes.\nI like the design with the vintage Indian posters dotted around and the low lighting. Josh sticks mixed with spices as the aroma that hits you when you enter.\nThe Bhel (isn't this normally called Bhelpuri?) delicious snack food of crispy rice, herbs and spices which came first was great.\nWe also sampled the Okra fries and calamari. Both pretty good, fairly standard calamari.\nThe lamb biryani was good but not the best I have had (a bit one dimensional and I prefer versions with super tender lamb) but the murgh malai (marinated chicken thighs) was great. The house black daal (signature dish) was rich and creamy. Naan bread was average.\nSo very enjoyable meal overall, we didn't make it to deserts being pretty full at this point. \nOverall 4 stars for the food, service, ambience and pricing combination.",

                "description": "Yay! I'm a fan. I think this phrase pretty much sums up my experience at Dishoom the other night. To be honest, I didn't expect much from a restaurant in this location, where usually only restaurants exist that cater to tourists who are afraid to try anything beyond their comfort zone.   \nIn fact, the restauran would somehow be not misplaced on my (imaginary) list of places-that-are-too-corporate-and-thus-loose-out-on-authenticity...however...despite the quite standardised service and the corporate look, I was feeling well-taken care of, attended to by the waiting staff and showered with delicious Indian food.  \nSpeaking of the food: I loved it that we were able to order tapas-like food that was tiered up on the table on what I would like to call a table-ladder. We ordered a wide assortment of dishes and the dishes I remember most vividly were the vegetable samosas, the buttered-bread with creamed vegetable-sauce and the char-grilled vegetables...yummy!\nHaving said all this: I still prefer the kinds of restaurant that don't need an entire marketing team to thrive (but will excel simply because of word-of-mouth propaganda). Nevertheless, like I said I was pleasantly surprised by Dishoom and will definitely be back when I have visitors that don't want to go out to the dodgy (yet really authentic) places, but prefer a restaurant with clean toilets, non-greasy tables and efficient service.",

This was my happy experience at Dishoom - we went for a big group meal and all responsibility of choice was relinquished from myself, so I simply got to eat and eat. And man, did we eat!\nI don't think there was a single dish that we had that I didn't enjoy. The dishes were full of flavour, rich, freshly cooked and plentiful. I particularly enjoyed the lamb kebabs - they were really nicely cooked and delicious with the sauces that came with the meals. I also tried a coconut milk based drink, which I can't quite remember the name of, and it was utterly delicious. It also happened to be the perfect accompaniment to the spicy samosas - they were the hottest thing that we had and were perfect too. Not crazy spicy but plenty of kick!\nOur service wasn't overly special, as there was a little confusion over drink orders and such, but I couldn't fault the food and the happy feeling my stomach was filled with as we came to the end of our food. The host was really friendly and the vibe of the restaurant was very pleasant, simple striking décor, and no intrusive music - it was perfect for chatting and giggling away. All in all a great experience and delicious food!",

No reservations are required so get there early to avoid disappointment!!!! I can categorically say that this place will be full to bursting from the off... \nDishoom advertises itself as a street cafe, which are, having done my wiki research, apparently (and sadly if this restaurant is anything to go by) a dying breed. \nThe menu is simple and varied enough without being overloaded with choice. The dishes that come are small, but don't be deceived, we only ordered a small dish and main each and were stuffed and barely touched dessert! \nThere is an open kitchen, try and nab one of the popular booths in the bright and airy room upstairs, serving dishes such as chilli cheese toast and fish tikka, and main dishes including salads, roomali roti wraps and grilled kebabs.\nWe were spoilt for choice with hot cumin laden lamb chops, a juicy mince meat keema pau spread on buttery bap, delicate flaky fish fingers which are perfect with the fragrant mint sauce, a hot! hot! byriani, and my favourite (and their signature dish) the melt in the mouth chicken tikka.. just beautiful. \nWe were absolutely gutted when they accidentally sent us some prawns and then immediately took them about. The looked big and fat and juicy and the smell of coriander and lime.. Mmmmmmm... oh well.. next time!!! \nService was a bit haphazard, as you'd expect on a dry-run with frazzled nerves in the run up to an overdue opening. But it was smiley and our waitress and greeter were lovely and chatty and amazing knowledgeable and helpful. \nThe only supremely petty criticism I would have, and this is purely my own taste I should pint out, is that I wasn't a fan of the black tarka daal; which tasted more like Heinz mulligatawny, whereas I like my daal almost a warming slushy oniony, garlicky soup. And the chocolate fondant didn't sit so well with the rest of the menu, we all had ideas about how to make it more authentic; chilli said one, NO, cardamom said I. The waiter said that they were thinking of making it a chocolate and pistachio brownie.. mmm, that will go perfectly with the cinnamon (and nutmeg??) ice-cream served alongside, which was just divine and I'm not especially a fan of ice-cream - it's not a real dessert to me, more of a fob-off. The gola ices were also lovely, the mango and ginger a perfect palate cleanser. \nUnfortunately we didn't try the chai or the cocktails, we were just too full of food and drink to even contemplate it, I'm leaving that for a revisit. \nThey won't be waiting too long... like I said there's 50% off the first week AND they open for breakfast. oh woe is my wallet!",

This cute café/brasserie serves up fabulous food. \nBut the Pau Bhaji, with it's creamy veggie mash and buttered fluffy bread was the star of the evening. Some seriously classy curry!\nFor it's location I was suprised at just how authentic the cuisine was; I mean, plonked in the middle of Leicester Square area you'd expect it to be another Punjab. You'd be mistaken. This is a slice of Whitechapel, snuggled into a classy surrounding, with leather booths, a really helpful hostess and brass finishing. Totally a Thumbs Up from me.",

                "description": "When my friend told me we were getting Indian food for lunch, I was expecting a lot of sauce-based curry dishes, but boy was I wrong, since that apparently is not what a \"Bombay cafe\" typically serves (as I learned later from my waiter).\nI thought the food overall was very good.  We ordered 2 \"Small Plates\", an item from the \"Grills\" section, and 2 orders of naan for 2 people, and it was a good/sufficient amount of food.  The \"Grills\" section, though a little pricier, isn't meant to be an entree by itself, since it is rather small.  All of the items on the menu are meant to be shared.\nReview of items:\n- Dishoom Calamari \"with zesty lime and chili\".  I thought this was really unique.  It tasted like Fruit Loops, which is a cereal from the States.\n- Keema Pau - \"spice minced lamb with hot buttered bread\".  This reminded me of a 'sloppy joe', which may also be something unique to America.  What I'm trying to imply is that the presentation seemed simple/cheap, but the taste was really good.\n- Dishoom Chicken Tikka (grill item) - this item was labeled as \"spicy\" on the menu, which I doubted would be true, given that I was in London, and people generally don't seem tolerant of spice/flavor, however it did pack a decent amount of spice to it. \nThe service here was great, but I also came here on a weekday for lunch when it wasn't too busy.  I loved the cutesy clean diner decor with Bollywood posters everywhere.\nP.S.  I apologize for all of the American-centric comments written above.",

                "description": "It started off promising: I arrived just before the lines started to form and was seated right away. The server asked if it was my first time and if I had any allergies; I said I was vegetarian. She then went through and marked all the vegetarian options on the menu for me, which I didn't find necessary; I can read. But, it was a nice gesture, unless it was because she assumed I was illiterate for some reason. I ordered the okra fries as a starter. It came very quickly. It was a bit overcooked and some pieces were too stringy to chew. Then I waited a long, long time for her to come back and take the rest of my order. I debated just leaving, but the ambiance was nice and I was hungry. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wave her down but she was always rushing past. After at least 10 or 15 minutes I finally got her attention and ordered the veggie curry and basmati rice. The rice was beautiful, long-grained. It's possible I have never had proper basmati rice before. Five stars if I was just rating the rice. The curry was good, but I thought of the microwave veggie curry meals I would get from Trader Joe's, which cost 20% the price and are about 90% as satisfying. After my meal, I walked out of the restaurant past a line of maybe 20 people outside and vaguely considered myself lucky to have been seated without a wait. I also wondered why they hadn't been better about checking in on me, to get me out of there faster and clear out a table, but whatever.\nAnd also, as another reviewer pointed out, only two types of curry?! In London?!?",

Of particular note, we positively devoured the lamb biryani, fried okra, and black dahl.  Additionally, on the whole, the staff is friendly and attentive.  \nOne caveat regarding service: I found that the waitstaff tended to underestimate the amount of food that came with each order, often suggesting that each person get more than one dish.  While the food is certainly tasty enough to warrant getting a sampling, I've found that the lamb biryani and two pieces of nan is enough for two satisfying meals.",

The mango lassi was one of the best!! I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered the chicken ruby curry and got rice and an order of the roti... The husband ordered the murgh malai. Both dishes were really really good. We also ordered the cheese naan which the hubby finished all before the entree got to the table.

                "description": "Glad we got a chance to grab lunch here before our trip to London was over. Our group ordered a lot of food and they were all pretty good. \nThe chai tea was interesting but good. It was mildy sweet and tasted like it had ginger in it.\nThe lamb samosas could use a little bit more flavor but I enjoyed it.\nThe fried calamari was nice and crispy and had a sweet and spicy flavor to it. \nThe chicken curry was spicy but rich in flavor. I love Indian curry so it's a dish I would def order again.\nI'm not sure of the exact name of the dish but I think it's called the chicken tikka. Love the crispy texture of the skin on the cubed pieces of chicken. It was flavored nicely and was pretty juicy. I think it's probably my favorite dish of the bunch.\nThe spicy lamb kabob was seasoned well but I think it was a bit dry.\nThe sheekh lamb could use a bit more flavor and was a little dry as well but I didn't mind it. My boyfriend liked it.\nThe chef's convent garden was my my least favorite dish! I don't think anyone in my group enjoyed it either. It was actually a dip which didn't have any particular flavor to it. I probably only took one bite.\nThe chicken pomegranate salad was nice and refreshing. Love the pomegranate seeds which gave the salad a fresh nice crunch.\nThe ambience was enjoyable and our group had a nice time here. Glad we were able to try Indian food in London!",

As we arrived around 6:30 (trying to beat the crowd, ha! who were we kidding) -- there was a wait. It was a cold afternoon, and we had to wait outside as it was too full inside. Service was fantastic, and they bring you delicious piping hot chai to keep you nice and comfy while waiting. Lovely touch. As much as I love London, I find their service to be generally spotty at most restaurants. However, Dishoom was on point. We had servers constantly checking in on us. Always so attentive. It was wonderful. The food in itself was fantastic. I cannot even describe how delicious it was. My only regret is that we did not go back during our 10 day stay in London. If there was one meal worth repeating, it was certainly at Dishoom. Do not miss!",

The staff are all very very friendly, willing to answer any questions and offer recommendations (even if the answer is, \"everything is good!\"). As a vegetarian, I don't have as much choice as I would in another Indian restaurant, but the choices I do have are all very delicious. The samosas and chilli toast are great starters, and their calamari is a little sweet as a twist. I've had the House Daal and also the paneer dish. As i said, both great, but I'd struggle to keep going back to find something new to try. However, their chocolate chai is also REALLY yum if you like chocolate and cinnamon. =) I'd recommend it to try!",

Food was great and while the service started out slow (took a bit to place our order which caused some stress given we had theatre tickets) once we placed the order the food came fast. \nThe chili potatoes (or something like that) and naan were my favorites. Also the squid starter. But there wasn't a bad thing we had. Great location for theatre tickets as well. They don't take reservations for small parties but we had no problem getting a table about 6:00pm on a weeknight prior to the theatre.",

Have to say that i was not disappointed.  when we arrived, the hostess said it was a 45 minute wait, which actually turned out to be a 10 minute wait.  We ordered the Soft Shell Crab Special, Chicken Ruby, and House Black Daal.  The Soft Shell Crab Special was definetly a delicious surprise.  I haven't come across anything like it here in the states.  The Chickey Ruby was fantastic as well.  I expected the chicken to be dry and tasteless, but it was totally the opposite.  Definetly get the House Black Daal.  Great little side dish with tons of flavor and perfect for dipping your naan or just by itself.  \nTwo things you need to get when you're there - Chai and the Kulfi on a stick.  The Chai is spicy, hot and perfect for a cold London night.  The Kulfi tasted like creamy condensed milk on a stick.  Awesomely sweet and a great way to end our dinner.\nWe kind of over ordered for two people, but it was worth it.  The next time i'm in London, i'm going to stop by.  Maybe try the Spicy Lamp Chops.\nService: Fantastic.  Our waitress from Berkeley was very attentive and always came back to check on us and ask if we needed anything else.",

Dishes like Chicken Biryani and Chicken Ruby were well balanced and simply \"Brilliant\" as they would say in London!  Great samosas, chutney and raita as well!. Very easy to get to from the Tube station at Leicester Square.  There was a wait/queue outside that took about an hour on a Saturday night at 9:30pm, but it was worth it!!!  The staff was very nice and offered my pregnant wife to wait seated inside but we declined since we felt fine.  The host/hostess staff brought out chai tea and some mint hot water thing for everyone outside in queue, which was nice.  I never want to eat indian food in the US again! until next time...

I've never been to a restaurant where they already have a dairy-free menu prepared.  The food which could be altered were starred and the food that couldn't were highlighted.  \nThe food itself was pretty good.  I'm not usually one for eating at places which serve Indian-type food, as my parents cook some of the best curries.  Ever.  I have to say if they ever go on holiday and I'm craving some Indian food, this is where I'm coming.  \nOh, and did I mention how delicious the cocktails were?!

Highlights were the fried okra chips, the greens and the mango ice lollies. Please note that they don't serve the customary curries, this is Bombay street cuisine. All in all, this is not worth your time or money; you'll be much happier with any of the decent Indian restaurants around Euston Station at a much cheaper price, though you won't get the same atmosphere.",

We sat down at the bar and ordered a glass of champagne, an east india gimlet and a chaijito, all three delicious! We ordered the calamari and the far far which were served along with three types of chutneys. The calamari is probably one of the best I ever had, the far far was ok - I would spend my calories on bhel puri instead.\nWe were seated for dinner (which was right in front of the door so the cold wind would come in often), and ordered the haleem, two sides of the greens and the house daal along with a Bollybellini. All are highly recommended. We also ordered a chai and the monsoon Malabar coffee, which were amazing. These accompanied the guju chocolate dessert, which I would say to give a miss. Service was amazing and we had a great time all in all. Great night!!",

                "description": "We were visiting the UK from the US and with me being British I couldn't leave without having at least one Indian meal. I found this restaurant through reviews on Tripadvisor and on our last night in London cancelled a very pricy high end restaurant to go here instead, and it was a fantastic decision! The restaurant is right off Leicester Square, so really quite convenient. We went early, around 6:30pm, and there was already a queue outside, and of course we chose the windy, rainy, cold night :-) Not to worry, we decided to \"suffer\" as the restaurant was already packed, so this was a good sign, and the people in the queue were all meeting from work, so it made me feel better that it was not all tourists. \nThey keep the system very organized, so take your name outside, and continually keep brining out drink samples for you to keep you happy and interested, a very nice touch, and then when there is room in the bar downstairs, they move you from the queue to the bar. After 25 mins we were going to the downstairs bar, and at the door downstairs the hostess greeted us by our name, again really nice and just high class giving it all the touches diners like. We ordered a drink and an appetizer and by the time we had finished our buzzer was flashing to let us know our table was ready, but again, this restaurant is so well run, the hostess beat us to it by coming to us to take us to our table. We didn't have to settle our bill downstairs, they transfer it to your dining room table, again a nice touch.\nOur server, Lucie, was friendly, professional and knew the menu inside out. She kindly explained the menu to us and then asked if we wanted a few minutes to look it over, which we did. We ordered a lot, as we wanted to try a bunch of stuff - vegetable samosas - we had these in the bar downstairs. The pastry was perfectly crispy and the inside was nicely spiced. Really, really nice. At the table we ordered spicy lamb chops - nicely cooked, three small chops on the plate that were very well presented and tasted gorgeous. Lots of meat on them. Perfect size. Black House Daal - Mmmmmmmm perfect creamy texture and perfect flavourings. So good. Chicken Ruby - OMG! Creamy, lightly spiced, lots of big chucks of chicken. Perfect! Haleem is their signature dish but my husband and I didn't really like this one. It wasn't horrible, just didn't stand up to everything else on the table. Side of greens - the vegetables were steamed and chilli and lime juice sprinkled over. Very, very tasty and fresh. Also, of course, and order of garlic naan. Like I said, we ordered a lot, and we were glad we did. Wish we had been in a position to be able to take home all the leftovers, because at breakfast the next day I was certainly thinking about it again. \nThe service in this restaurant in fantastic. Lucie never stopped running around and was on top of everything. All other servers were also helping on all other tables and not just their own. The manager was busting her butt too running around and was visiting every table to make sure everything was ok. We were staying at the Cavendish Hotel down the road on Jermyn St, and they need to take some lessons from this restaurant on service!!! Absolutely outstanding from the queue at the front door to leaving without our leftovers :-( Wish we had gone earlier in the week as we would have loved to have gone again, even if just for breakfast or lunch. \nThe ambience is lively, the pictures on the walls seem to all be of old Bombay, either ad's, actresses, films etc., and the lighting is trendy and awesome and fits the space well. \nDon't miss this restaurant and take the time to wait in the queue outside, it is SO worth it.",

And living in Toronto, I've had my share of Indian cuisine. \nWe got the lamb samosa to start (which literally came within 5 seconds), it was spicy and flavourful. After waiting for 10 mins for a beer and water and then 40 min for food, we started to wonder what happened. So it turns out our waitress (an american accentred girl) has forgotten to put in our order. As a result, we got a round of drinks for free. I had the thumbs up flip, it was a really good whiskey mixed drink, I wanted to learn how to make it myself, very delicious.\nWhen our food finally came (50 min after we ordered the first time), it was worth the wait. We got the special, soft-shell crab curry stew with indian style potatoes and garlic nan. The curry had a very complex yet tasty flavour, nothing like what I'm used to. The soft-shell crab was unique as well, crunchy and mushy at the same time. \nIf you are ever in the Covert Garden or Leichester Square area, this is a great spot I think for Indian food. The decor and environment is hip but the food is pretty traditional and delicious. And even just coming for the thumbs up flip cocktail is worth it. \nLondon is an amazing city, I miss it already.",

We tried the Bombay Pimms which was a really interesting take on normal Pimms, definitely not something I would have chosen but I enjoyed it nonetheless! We were then provided with lots of different small plates, including a bhel salad and skate cheeks which were really really lovely! Kheema Pau, a mince lamb dish with bread, was also tasty, though I think the skate cheeks were the hit of our group!\nNeedless to say I think I'll be coming back here to try more of what this lovely Bombay Cafe has to offer.",

It's smoother, lighter and much more complex in flavour than a regular pina colada. \nMy two favourite dishes are the Murgh Chicken (grilled chicken thigh) and the Black Daal - both are to die for. I'm not usually a chicken thigh kind of gal, but I'd choose this thigh over a piece of chicken breast any day. Although the Chilli Cheese Toast came highly recommended, I didn't think it was much more than plain old cheese on toast with a few chillies... something I can do myself at home.\nAnd of course you must not leave without trying one of the Kulfi Sticks.

                "description": "Dishoom is the sound a Bollywood film hero makes when he lands a good punch. How cool is that? The restaurant (although they call themselves a Bombay café) is pretty cool as well. Consisting of two floors, it's routinely packed to the afters on Friday and Saturday nights. Even for a  table for 3 at 6pm, the wait was 30mins so if going make sure to make a reservation or leave a margin for waiting. A quick pre-theatre meal this is not.\nI've been wanting to go for ages since one of my Indian friends had raved about the dal and biriyani. So I grabbed him and another of my brown brethren and the three of us headed off to Dishoom for dinner.\nAs noted above, we had a wait so off to the downstairs bar we went. Dishoom doesn't have an extensive cocktail list (although I imagine any of the standard drinks would be provided upon request if you so asked) but it does have several classics rejuvenated with a Desi twist. I opted for the Chaijito which as the name suggests is a Chai infused mojito. I was a bit doubtful of a lime and chai tea flavour mix but I have to say it was spectacular. The clean crisp flavours of the lime just barely sweetened with sugar refreshed the palatte while the chai added a playful note without any of the cloudy and cloying after taste you get in a chai tea latte. My friends' Bollywood Bellini and some form of punch were also good but I would stick with my choice as being the best.\nAfter about 20-25 minutes we were seated in a cosy table upstairs. Naturally, we ordered the house dal (a black lentil dal rather than the traditional red or orange) and a lamb biriyani with masala prawns for a starter. The prawns were good in their own right however could have used more masala to truly be masala prawn. The dal was delicious with a sharp bite and a deeper burn from the chillies used. The biriyani was tasty but nothing on what my mom makes (and since she made it a few days ago it had to contend with my recent taste memory). \nThe garlic naan was sorely disappointed and looked more like a garlic topped Ryvita cracker than any real attempt at a naan. I hope ours was just an anomaly as a good naan is an essential pillar of a good Indian restaurant.\nOverall, it's a bit expensive but a fun and tasty experience. Keep in mind this is more grilled type of Indian cooking rather than an abundance of curries (going North rather than South) but overall a good time. Definitely worked a treat as a pre-night out classy spot!\nI really want to go back for breakfast and get a bacon naan roll!",

Have had a number of appetizers and entrees including the Tikas, Curry and few other entrees both meat and vegetarian. \nWould have given 5 stars but the only negative was that this place was crowded! I definitely suggest making a reservation otherwise you could go downstairs while waiting & grab a drink at the downstairs bar.",

Instead we got:\n* Far far\nThe sauces were good, but the waitress asked us in such a way that it sounded like it was free. Not so nice when we got the bill and discovered otherwise, but it wasn't a big deal.\n* Garlic and Cheese Naan\nWhile tasty and crispy, the garlic naan was too hard. The cheese naan was also tasty, but was super filling and just made it seem like a grilled sandwich pancake. We probably should've ordered the classic instead.\n* Chole Chawal\nThis was really nice. It came with diced red onion and a really nice sauce. Big fan of this one.\n* Prawn and Pomelo Salad\nFresh veggies and prawn, but while not overcooked really, parts of the prawns were a bit charcoaled. The salad was good except that there was a bit too much dressing on it.\n* Paneer Tikka\nNice and firm. Fresh veggies used too without overcooking.\n* Cinnamon Ice Cream\nGreat stuff! Had a great flavour and it was creamy but not too much, so it was still nice and light.\nThe only big downside for us was how noisy it was. I kept having to shout for my partner to hear me over all the noise.\nThe service was good, and the food is not expensive.",

The hostess, waiters, and staff are truly interested and dedicated to their customers and recognize them for repeated service.\nAmbiance and decor - provides the perfect backdrop that compliments the food and service\nMediocre:\nNaan - although traditional and well executed, a little too dense for my taste\nLong lines - unless dining early for breakfast, or before 5 PM for dinner, there is a long line (20 minutes or longer) - However, they serve hot chai while waiting that compensates for the inconvenience\nPineapple crumble - would have preferred more pineapple and less crumble - just my preference - however, other restaurants in London (non Indian) have also served crumble with these proportions of fruit/crumble. This may reflect a regional food preparation rather than a execution flaw.\nFor any Indian food afficiando, eating at Dishoom is a must!",

                "description": "There's something very egalitarian about chain restaurants. They simply don't care who you are and aren't at all bothered about trying to impress you specifically. No bookings, you turn up, wait your turn, and get the same service as everyone else. In his excellent review in the Guardian, Jay Rayner recounts how he had to stand outside in the queue with the rest of the rabble too, slightly discombobulating I've no doubt, for a man used to a certain level of recognition. After a late afternoon meeting over wine (the best sort of meeting) me and my two guests thought about staying in the rarified atmosphere of the Ivy Club but in the interests of investigative research joined Mr Rayner and other food luminaries by queuing at Dishoom. \nDishoom has been referred to (mainly by the PR team) as a Bombay style cafe. An egalitarian, open all hours canteen serving taxi drivers, students, writers and lawyers (according to their puff anyway)...None of those stereotypes were notably present on the night, predominantly, our fellow diners were more the middle class braying London types you traditionally find clogging up the greener parts of zone 2.\nThere's got to be a book written for this. 'Food Branding 2.0 - lessons for the post Pizza Express generation'. Like the equally insipid Jamie's Italian next door, and 'gourmet, authentic Mexican fine dining experience' (more PR bullshit) Cantina Laredo next door to that, the team behind Dishoom seem to have swallowed the whole volume, hook, (press) line and sinker. It's somewhat sinister having all three of them next to each other. It's the kind of line-up better suited to touting for passing trade outside a Croydon multiplex rather than prime real estate in the centre of London. \nThe food is casual, safe and generic Indian (at risk of insulting a large country). It doesn't seem to come from anywhere specific, and certainly didn't bear any relation to what (admittedly little) I know of the hot, spicy street food of the region. For a coastal city, you'd expect fish to feature heavily, the best they could do was a 'Dill Salmon (that well known Indian fish) Tikka'. Our starters included Bombay Sausages, a student dinner party staple of the future fusing chipolatas, onion and curry paste, Chilli Cheese (on) Toast, pleasant but utterly underwhelming, and a dish called Keema Pau, minced lamb in a ragu style sauce served alongside a muffin.  These came with fridge fresh pickle pots and a highlight, perfectly chilled Meantime Union beer. \nOur main courses were similarly pedestrian. The Chicken Biryani was nicely presented in a clay pot with a pastry seal but arrived dry, beautifully but subtly fragranced and lacking in a core ingredient. \"Do they serve the chicken on the side?\" questioned the Drama Queen, apparently not, it was just hiding (very well) in the rice. The taste was as subtle and shy as a thirteen year old at a school disco, it felt like nothing more than an accompaniment. The Spicy Lamb Chops came with some semblance of taste and some of the vim and zing you'd expect from a decent kitchen. Beautifully cooked, tender and juicy, they were the one high point for me. The final plate, a Lamb Boti Kebab was dry again and chewier than expected.  \nThere's a niche in the market for a chain Indian, and Dishoom gives a good argument for filling it. For anyone who's ventured within a mile of Tayyabs or Lahore in the East End, or been to some of the great curry houses of Birmingham, Southall or Bradford you're going to be left wanting. That being said, if you're stuck in theatreland with kids or random relatives who \"don't usually like that spicy foreign stuff\", you could do worse. And if that isn't damning with faint praise, I don't know what is.",

As it was our last night in London, we figured we should try some Indian food, and were thrilled with Dishoom said the kitchen was still open.\nWe all started with a Bombay Pimm's, which was an Indian inspired version of the classic Pimm's Cup; it was infused with ginger and very delicious, an excellent start to the meal!\nOur waiter was very patient and answered our questions, and once we ordered, the food came out fast!  We had samosas and some of the most amazing calamari ever, it came with a spicy/sweet sauce and was just melt in your mouth good!\nOf course we had some Naan bread, we opted for garlic and it was outstanding, we had to get a second order.  For our main dish we shared the Lamb Biryani, I had never had Biryani before, and now I am hooked!  The lamb chunks were so tender and flavorful, they melted in your mouth and the seasoned rice complimented it perfectly.  It was a bit spicy, but we got a side of cucumber raita to put on top, and the combination was amazing!  This was my sister's first time ever eating Indian food and now she is hooked!  I thought the prices were quite reasonable and the portions were big!  The inside decor is very modern, and overall it made for a wonderful final meal in London!",

We came in hungry - and left with warm happy stomachs.  \nThe chicken tikka is what really stood out in its awesomeness. The chicken was nice and moist, and sooooo full of flavo(u)r. Order this with naan or garlic naan - and you are (almost) set. \nI say \"almost\" as the portion sizes are such that the customer is enabled to order a variety of different dishes without \"overeating\".  (Next time I'll consider ordering two of these and 2xnaan).\nThe calamari was also an excellent dish - a small bowl of very lightly breaded calamari. It was a nice change from what I'm used to - as the calamari isn't completely covered in batter and fried. This is certainly worth a try for a change of pace. \nThe final dish was the real kicker... (by kicker - i mean it kicked us in the ass!). Lamb curry (I think it was listed as Lamb Biryani on this menu). We ordered this with rice as it came with just the main curry, and wow - they kicked it up a nice notch. A fairly spicy dish with not quite as much flavor as the chicken tikka - at least worth a shot for the super hot lovers, but I would have liked a \"fuller\" flavo(u)r. \nAside from the food, the service was excellent (especially considering the crowds vs the # of servers), and the atmosphere was cool. It was nice that it was relatively casual for a cool London restaurant spot. I can see us going back for sure.",

Get this thing if you make it in time for breakfast. It's a naan bread, rolled into a taco, with two fried eggs (slightly runny) and a mysterious (but amazing) red sauce. The flavours are spectacular.\nThe chai is great for sipping and I only wanted more. That tiny glass of chai is only  enough to get you through 1/2 the newspaper. lol.\n#Vegetarian review",

We didn't make a reservation at night and it was an estimated 45min wait, but were seated sooner. It would be a good idea to make reservations for dinner I think.",

                "description": "Ever since I discovered Dishoom earlier this year, I've become an ardent fan. \nWhat strikes me as the most charming and defining feature of \"Dishoom\" was the concept that it pays homage to, that of, Irani cafes in mid-20th century Bombay. \"Dishoom\" opened its doors in July 2010. Adorned with sepia toned portraiture and popular imagery from the 50s and 60s against the backdrop of powder blue walls, it is obvious that much thought and effort has gone into the decor and cultural referencing. \nI admit to this bias but given the plethora of Pakistani restaurants in London that serve food exactly how I would enjoy it back home, I rarely venture to Indian restaurants. However, Dishoom has changed that for me. During multiple visits I have enjoyed the simple, clean flavors and moderately spiced food.  The stellar item on the menu is, undoubtedly, the chai. It's traditional milky tea with a lingering aftertaste of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and a hint of ginger. Amongst the starters/small plates the pau bhaji, calamari, vada pau and bhel stand out. I also enjoy the grilled items accompanied with velvety roomali roti or cheese nans. \nThey also serve delicious breakfast. I have tried the Bombay Omelette and the Bombay Breakfast Bake, both of which were excellent especially the latter.   \nDishoom is one of the rare restaurants where most items on the menu are standouts and rarely disappoint. It's also good value for money, especially give the central location.",

Other gems are the biryanis (I've had chicken and lamb) especially when accompanied by a side of raita. Save room for dessert as their kulfis on a stick are light and delicious.",

Our waiter seemed to embrace the challenge of picking out appropriate dishes for first time Indian food eaters, and he did an excellent job overall. I'd say the prices were fair, I just wish we hadn't ordered quite so much food. It felt like a shame to let so much go to waste.",

Oh no, no.\nAt 8.30am the place was practically empty, but with beautiful big windows and a loads of light, it was inviting from the word go.\nI started with black coffee and freshly squeezed OJ, complimented with a side of bacon naan roll.\nThe naan, freshly made on site, housed beautiful smoked backed bacon and was served with homemade chili jam. Good lord. It was divine. The combination just worked and the portion was just enough to leave me full. None of the greasy, 'what have I just eaten' guilt you normally get when you eat something hot for breakfast.\nI'm taking a friend back in a few weeks to have EXACTLY the same thing, and will be trying to do lunch or dinner asap. I hear the curry is die to for.",

Get down here early if you have party of less than 6, as you can't book a table for smaller group. We arrived at 6pm with a waiting time of 1 hour 20 minutes (wow!). Anywho, since this is our second attempt we agreed to wait and was let in to the bar downstairs.  Nice decoration and interesting cocktail and non alcohol list. I tried the rose and cardamom lassi n it is soooo good. We were offered a table at 7pm and was led to our table. Ordered few curry dishes, chicken ruby, cheese naan, garlic naan, briyani (chicken) and spicy lamb. All good especially the chicken ruby!! Tender n juicy.  Lamb in the hand was not good, as it was hard and dry (tip: need to review that recipe). Guzu mousse was my dessert but pieces of salt shaving on my mousse?? That's a bit unnecessary... and disturbed my palate. :) Oh well this restaurant definitely worth a try! Come early and enjoy the wait.",

I waited for a little bit, but essentially gave up because I didn't want to waste my time in London in line at a restaurant.  I went back on Friday around the same time, another long wait. I left again, but came back around 9pm... There was about an hour wait, but ended up only being about 45 minutes which wasn't terrible.  Definitely moves faster at night.  \nThe food was tasty, for London standards, and the ambiance was nice; however, I may be spoiled since I'm from New York... In New York I can get great Indian food ordering from Seamless, so I'm definitely biased.  Was it worth the wait? Not really, but if you have time to kill, definitely check it out, if for nothing more than the surrounding neighborhood which is great.  \nAnd really nice of them to bring out drinks while you wait (mostly lemonade).",

                "description": "Had an OK experience here. Went in a group of six on a Thursday night with a reservation; good thing, too, because the place was packed. We sat in the basement/\"bottom floor\" in a kind of alcove. \nWe wanted to get grilled vegetables and fried calamari as starters, but the waiter said these items (which ARE labeled as \"starters\" in the menu) come out with all the other entrees. This system didn't really bother me but I just found it odd. For my main I got the murgh malai chicken. It was alright. I tried some sauces on my chicken; this was a bad move. Some of these table sauces were damn spicy. Not a refreshing, nasal-pasage-clearing spicy, just a prickly, why-is-this-sauce-like-this? unnecessary spicy. That kind of ruined the meal for me. The grilled veggies and calamari were fine but nothing to rave about.\nEveryone else seemed to like their dishes but nobody was like, \"Oh, man, this is so good, you've gotta try some!\" \nThe server was fine but there were times I wished he availed himself to our table a bit more tenaciously. Prices are quite good, all main dishes under or around GBP 10. The decor and ambience were very nice, lots of Indian ephemera and dim lighting. I should note the gents' bathroom: it has huge urinals and an odd soap dispenser. \nOverall a slightly below average experience. I can see that most people really like this place so I would give it another shot, but if I'm picking out a restaurant this wouldn't be my top pick. Be your own judge, however, because sooner or later you're gonna have to stop listening to me and start making your own choices. And that soap dispenser was pretty weird, so maybe go just to check it out.",

                "description": "Amazing food! We had a bit of a wait, but there is a nice bar area to order drinks and small plates. Service at the bar was excellent- bartenders were very attentive. The biggest problem arose once we were seated. Our waiter was incredibly absent and negligent. When we asked for things... Like water... He didn't bring it, and every time he walked by, he didn't even check in to see if we needed anything. The only thing that saved our experience was another waiter, who really picked up where our waiter left off. The other waiter managed to handle all his tables, and bring us water, take our wine order, and check in regularly to see if we needed anything. \nAt the end of the meal, I was more than happy to tip, but I strongly felt the tip belonged to the other waiter- not ours. Our waiter did nothing, he clearly had other tables he favored. I used to be a waitress in the service industry, and my belief is no one is entitled to a tip, you must earn it. So, I did not leave the \"optional service charge\" on my bill, and I instead gave the tip to the waiter who actually took care of our table.\nI was out the door of the restaurant, when our assigned waiter chased us down to confront us as to why we didn't leave the \"optional\" tip. I was shocked, and he followed up with the manager would like to know. I should have asked to speak to the manager, or just emphasized that the tip was OPTIONAL.... But instead I went through the reasons I did not leave a tip for him, and why I gave the tip to the person who actually took care of our us. I was just in such shock- I have never been chased out of a restaurant and interrogated as to why I did not leave a tip.  That waiter spent more time chasing me out, than he did at our table the whole night.\nI highly recommend this restaurant for the food, and if you get seated in a section with a good server, you will have a 5 star experience!",

What I think makes this Mumbai-inspired chain successful is that it's a subtle cross between East and West. The menu has all the classics you'd expect at your local deli; biryani, curries, kofta, naans etc. but the menu is designed to suit Western palates.\nI think it's a tad too pricey given the quantities but the  flavour and refinement make it worth the money. However, if you're looking for homely, comforting food, it's probably not the right place. The restaurant has a sophisticated and cosmopolitan vibe to it. \nIf you go there in 5+ groups you'll get better value if you order different dishes everyone can eat from, tapas-style.",

I first visited for brunch, when I was looking for something other than the typical American breakfast items, and the concept of an Irani Cafe in old Bombay did sound intriguing.  \nI really like the design and the whole concept of the restaurant, and it does seem that you are teleported back to the hay day of Bombay Cafes.  My friend complained about the noise level but I thought that added to the ambience of the place, being a bustling and busy roadside joint.\nNow the food - usually I am a bit skeptical of places that try to be hip and claim to sell authentic traditional food at the same time, but I think Dishoom did a pretty good job.  We have tried almost everything on the menus and all of them were good. Although here are the dishes I will order every time: any of the grills really, they were all well executed but I especially enjoyed the succulent spicy lamb chops; the masala prawns ; the chicken berry biryani; the okra fries; and the mattar paneer for vegetarians.  The naans are also pretty good.  I also like the kulfis and the chais, lovely! Recommend the brunch menus as well - as I said, a nice alternative to the normal brunch fare.  The Covent Garden location is good for bringing visitors, a lot of them request Indian food and Dishoom is a good option.  Service is also very efficient for such a busy place.

Not the finest food, nor the most striking ambiance, and not even exceptional service... but a flawless balance of the above that set it apart from all the rest.\nAlthough it was a bit of a slow start (is 1800 hours early for dinner in the UK?), servers seemed to be a challenge to flag down.  Once we snagged one, however, cocktails and dishes came fast and furious with a rapid pace that kept up with my appetite.\nEach dish after another was more and more delicious.  Particular favorites for me were the lamb biryani with raita, the chicken curry, and the garlic naan that I couldn't get enough of.  I can't quite put my finger on how British Indian food differs from Indian food in India - higher quality ingredients or a different spice combination, perhaps.  Whatever it is, it works superbly.\nWithout a doubt, I'd come back again.  At roughly £20 a head, I wouldn't consider this a cheap meal, but considering it included a drink and walking out feeling stuffed to the gills, I call it a right fair value.",

                "description": "Hmmm... well there were certainly loads of pros to Dishoom, mainly the delicious, spicy, fresh, and utterly fantastic food. But outside of the steaming hot plates of goodness that came quickly and seemingly endlessly, I wasn't overly impressed. \nSure, with a sterile atmosphere like this you have the benefit of not reeking of curry when you leave. Your eyes won't burn, you won't be pushed around by storm trooper servers, and you won't feel rushed out of your seat by the next group of people who have been standing over you drooling for over an hour... (You *know* who I'm talking about.) Consequently though, you'll feel like you're eating Indian food in veritable Cheesecake Factory atmosphere. The whole urban industrial feel just didn't correspond with the cuisine.\nThe service also seemed a bit off. Our group of 12 was split over two four-person booths, as apparently they don't take bookings. (In fact, we were probably lucky to get a table for all of us, full stop.) Our table never received water though we asked multiple times. A few lassies went missing. Though we ordered two of everything, the orders seemed to be confused over the two tables. \nI can't fault the delicious food -- it really was stunning. But the rest of the experience didn't dishoooooom me away.",

                "description": "In Manchester we often forget there are other cities in the country capable of producing excellent Indian food. We swan around like we're Lord of the Manor, thinking our curries of the mile are as authentic and mindblowing as pizza in New York, burritos in San Francisco, Scouse in Liverpool.\nHey. Scouse is important. It's a culinary behemoth!\nAnyway, sometimes we really need taking down a peg or two, and Dishoom really knocked me into shape. First of all, it was different. All clean, shiny surfaces; metallic minimalism... you couldn't call it traditional if you tried, certainly a far cry from the linen tablecloths and chintzy decor I'm used to in Rusholme. Then, the dishes, and I have to tell you - this is the way to eat Indian food. Forget getting your own specific dish, you want a multitude of plates in the middle of the table and you want to mix and match. Tapas-style sharing is what I like best when it comes to dining, and this was perfect.\nIt's not for the faint of tastebud, as some of the dishes pack a punch - the samosas are spicy, the utterly scrumptious fish fingers are tingly, but there's plenty of raita to cool things down and if that's not enough, soothe your senses with a lassi... rum optional, wink. The paneer salad is all kinds of lush and Lizzie is so right about that Pau Bhaji, very simple but effective? Mightily so. I was one of her very happy campers that evening and I can attest to the fact that we heartily ploughed our way through this divine dish.\nThey even do breakfasts with an Indian twist, with lots of delicious spiced pastries, and I'd walk back to London if it meant sampling that delicious-sounding chai hot chocolate. This is definitely a place to take somebody to impress, and I'll certainly be recommending it to my London friends. I'll also be warning them that they don't take reservations, so my tip is to get there nice and early!",

When leaving there was a queue and this is a large restaurant on two levels. Bear in mind if going downstairs you won't get mobile signal. Now back to the food and service. Service was good but I found it strange that they don't sell coke or Pepsi. Now they sell the Indian brands such and Thumbs up and Limca and also normal lemonade so why miss out the other. Very odd. Also they serve some great chutneys but nothing to go with them at the start which is also stranger as what are you supposed to do with them till your food arrives. But end of the day it's all about the food which was excellent and I will be going again. It's not spicy but extremely tasty. Took a little time to get out of the kitchen but not too bad. The portions are average but the grills are what you would expect as a starter portion  not a main course but I still think good value. Highly recommend this place. But might be worth booking prior to avoid waiting in a queue.",

Apart from sounding like a village on the east coast of Scotland (try saying it in your very best Sean Connery accent....see!!), Dishoon is a rather upmarket, trendified Indian serving tapas style dishes of amazing quality and fantastic taste.\nA number of us piled in here for some grub after an arduous day of arse-sitting-on and brain filling-upped-ness....very tiring don't you know! To be treated to some rather fookin tasty grub, ranging from old favorites to some pretty unique dishes (all amazing). Being a large group we were spread out over two booths, a bit of a tight fit but good for group bonding.....\nDishes were brought at a steady pace, drinks were kept a flowing and service in general was prompt, polite and well...good. Price?? Well, ok its maybe a bit on the high end, but given the area and the quality of the food, then its little wonder its a tad n the high end.\nVerdict then? Great grub, great service and a great way to have a culinary affair on the city you love.....Look out for Jeremy Kyle: He cheated on me with anther city...Glasgow spills Chris's sordid culinary secrets...booo, hiss!!!!",

The mango lassi here is very authentic (unlike the bright artificial orange-colored ones that you usually find in Indian restaurants), and they use whole roasted fennel rather than the powder, so the flavor is really enhanced. Everything we had here was wonderful except the Roti, which was very dry and didn't add to the meal. Perhaps if we had ordered it with curry it would have tasted better. We ended the meal with chocolate chai, and were very happy campers indeed! The decor also is very cute and apparently inspired by Parsi-owned cafes in Mumbai. Service was top notch with incredibly friendly and informative waiters! Will definitely be back soon!",

Not to worry, they brought me out an extra main course just for me - and I chose the lamb boti kebab - which was superb!\nSpices are used very well to flavor the food - which did not rely of heavy sauces or too much salt to be tasty.  One of the better Indian meals I have ever had that wasn't homecooked.\nNote:  If you are not for spice - this is not for you.  Lots of yoghurt and lassi was needed by the non-chili-lovers at our tables.  But, if you are for spice - this is amazing!\nFinally, the mango kulfi was amazing.",

I didn't know what I was talking about, clearly influenced by things I *might* have read in inaccurate magazines. Besides, people (me) who haven't been there in ten years have no business making assumptions. This trip changed my perception of London completely (from meh to love), and food was part of that. All thanks to Dishoom.\nMy business partners wanted to take me someplace a little more authentic, off the Mayfair scene and into another neighborhood. I was so game. If nothing else, it returned the Mission/SoMa favor when they were in town a few months ago.\nI knew Dishoom and I were going to get along splendidly upon walking in and seeing one of the most beautiful clocks ever taking a iconic spot in the decor. Right above the kitchen, it's striking, and I want it. If my SF loft ever materializes, the Dishoom clock is going to be a featured part of the decor.\nWhich means I'll have to go back to get it, which would be no problem at all. The four of us split some outstanding dishes:\n- Grilled chicken that became part of delicious roti rolls that rivaled my favorites at Kasa (\nyelp.com/biz/kasa-indian…\n)\n- Stunningly good lobster straight out of the shell \n- Black daal that complemented the above perfectly\n- Fresh mangoes with vanilla yogurt. Can't. Ever. Get. Enough.\nEverything was washed down with a DG&T (gin, tonic and a few drops of Indian ginseng). Score.\nOnly the veggie biryani underwhelmed. It could have used more veggies, less rice.\nFrom clocks to eats to drinks, it was a wonderful dinner out. My bad London, my bad. This SF foodie has never so loved being wrong.",

It's clear that a lot of attention has been taken regarding the decoration, I truly liked that.\n The food was very good as well.
