Second to that was the yam croquettes. Also wouldnt kick the  prawn d dumplings  or garlic prawn eggrolls out of bed.\nWe also tried the seafood noodle soup which was a generous portion. Would have liked more depth of flavor in the broth but it was good.\nA nice little spot in Chinatown for anyone looking for dim sum. I'd go again!",

So delicious and tender and not your Indian style of curry. The bao, steamed bbq pork buns, were a little too much thickened sauce and not enough pork, but very tasty. Luck of the draw. We had a pork shrimp and scallion with coriander dumpling that was delicious. We finished with egg custard tarts that were warm, light, and flaky wonders. \nThe menu has a lot of variety. A lot of Asian patrons on our floor were eating beautiful greens and a congee or two that looked great.\nThe restaurant has rooms up three stories of the building. They have a lift as well as stairs. Service was very good. The gentleman who served us was very pleasant and checked on us. Excellent food and great prices for theatre-adjacent Chinatown!",

I couldn't compare the size, taste and price with other Chinese restaurant in London coz this is the first Chinese dim sim restaurant we visited.\nThe deep fired taro cake so crispy and tasty.\nThe sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf pretty wet (mushy) but still tasty.\nThe shrimp dumping just mediocre.\nOverall, the dim sims were good but not great.

I'm hoping that next time I'm in London I'll have a chance to try their dim sum. On a regular night it's not too busy, and their staff is very quick. But you have to understand that you're going to an authentic Chinese place, the service is not going to be super friendly. \nSince it was cold all the nights I visited, I kept ordering different versions of their rice noodle soup. And that's the best thing about this place, you can kind of create your own dish with all the broth flavors and noodle options that they give you. The one night that I ordered to-go the waiter was rude and lied to me, telling me that they didn't give out to-go chopsticks when a few nights before I was given a set of chopsticks with my leftovers. I didn't let that bother me, even though it was a to-go (takeaway) order, they warmed it up well that I was still able to enjoy hot soup back at my hotel. This place is good, the service is what it is, I would ignore it for good Chinese food.",

I had to wait forever, then they gave my table away, then I had to wait 15-20 more minutes for another table. At least the food was delicious. The beef in the beef noodle soup was absolutely sensational and the pork bun was sweet and perfectly soft. Another thing I didn't like was the lack of hot chili oil on the table, you had to ask for it just to receive a tiny portion. The food was great and would go back on a normal day. Maybe the service will be better under those circumstances.",

                "description": "AT LAST. A five-star dim sum place. I was beginning to wonder if they existed after being in Seattle so long. (No offense, Sea-Town, I got nothin' but love for ya, baby.)\nA local friend of ours recommended Joy King Lau and he did not lead us wrong. I had planned on going to Yuatcha, but its format of serving dim sum sounded... un dim sum-like.\nI wanted a huge variety of well-executed dishes to choose from. Price, location, or the level of service made no difference to me. \nOutside their door, I read the stickers plastered all over the window, 'Best of this' and 'Best of that.' Upon entry inside, the door is opened for us. And... and... they SMILED at us. \nWhat kind of dim sum parallel universe have I fallen into?? I touch my chest and legs to make sure I'm not dead. \nWe are the first people in the restaurant, and promptly served Oolong tea. The menu is so expansive, I forgot what I read by the time I got to the end of the menu. You'll want to write your choices down; trust me.\n- Rice noodle roll filled with shrimp covered in fried bean curd sheet. PERFECT.\n- Roast duck with bok choy served over rice. Standard dish and solid here\n- Tong Choi - stir fried greens in garlic. They did an awesome job of cooking these; they weren't slimy from overcooking and had the right amount of salt and broth\n- Curry octopus: the octopus are so teeny and adorable you may feel bad about eating them. But then you take a bite of the tender body and all bets are off\n- Sticky glutinous rice - my date loves this dish. Sticky rice steamed in leaves; I don't think he counts it as dim sum unless he orders this. What was DIFFERENT about this one was the filling. Huge chunks of meats are inside! One inch+ chunks of pork, fat cuts of Chinese sausages (not the teensy eensy cubes) \nDishes are cleared quickly, without feeling like they're rushing you. Teacups are continuously topped off, and all around, the service was far above what I'm used to.\nAll these dishes were under 38.00 GBP. Wicked deal plus the quality (and service!) means I'll be heading back here.",

Most dim sum restaurants had lines but we were seated almost immediately at Joy King Lau. The restaurant is multi-storied and we were directed to the second floor upon entering.\nMenus were already at our tables when we sat down. You'll see two menus - the dim sum one is laminated and has pictures of all the dim sum they serve, making it really easy to order. If you wanted other Chinese food, you could also refer to the full menu. \nMy friend and I ended up getting thai style chicken feet (cold), shu mai, dough stick cheung fun (jar luen), yam croquette, char siu croquette, and preserved egg and pork congee. The food came shortly after we ordered, and they were delicious and in my opinion, closer to HK standards compared to other dim sum I've had. The yam croquette and char siu croquette are fried dim sum but they were not greasy at all. The shu mai and jar luen were flavorful!\nOverall, Joy King Lau is a fantastic place for delicious dim sum. Everything came out to be under Â£15 per person too, which makes it pretty affordable. I highly recommend getting your dim sum fix here!",

Very thin steamed pancakes, good amount of skin and meat along with traditional garnish. We also had cashew chicken (a bit bland but with tender chunks of chix) and Sichuan Green Beans (quite good). Very limited in their alcohol selection but not unusual for a Chinese restaurant. We had Tsing Tao beer (icy cold).

It was packed for lunch, but they got me in pretty quickly due to the size of the restaurant.  All of the food looked and tasted excellent.  I ordered a duck noodle soup.  The duck was excellent.  They didn't remove the bones or cartilage, so don't order if you can't handle that.  The beef brisket soup was quite good as well.  They had a large dim sum collection which was extremely popular with the other diners.  For an authentic China Town lunch this is a great place.",

Went today and it was quite good.  The stand out was a fried garlic and prawn spring roll.   While these are often rather generic this one stood out, primarily because of the garlic.  I ordered the other standbys (Prawn/Pork dumpling, char siu bun and prawn cheung fen); all were good, not greasy and hot.  The only thing I didn't love were Shanghai dumplings but it was just an opinion, they were well prepared and interesting.  Overall, a good option for dim sum.",

I walked in about 5 minutes before they were going to stop serving dim sum and I was able to get a few items. I tried the shu mai, bbq pork bun, beef meatballs, and black bean pork ribs.\nThis was some of the best dim sum I've ever had, and for about 15 pounds.

The two staples of dimsum, har gao and shu mai, are amazing and made with the freshest ingredients. The har gao had \"real shrimp\" taste, not like the frozen shrimp used in the states. The shu mai was completely different (a much better different) than anything I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was made with pork but it was perfectly flavored and had great elasticity (many people don't get what I mean by that). But the most breathtaking item on the menu had to be the DEEP FRIED CUSTARD BUNS. These custard buns went from 0-100 real quick in the fryer. The outside layer was a beautiful golden brown and it was the perfect toasted crunchiness achievable on a bun. \nDefinitely making the trip back here when I visit London again!",

Joy King Lau was the most authentic tasting Chinese dim sum out of the three restaurants, and the best, in my opinion. I've eaten a lot of dim sum in my lifetime all over California, and this place is a solid \"I would take my family to eat here if they visited London\" recommendation. The cost to eat here for 2 people was less than half of what I paid at Yauatcha. I will be coming back to Joy King Lau, but never returning to the other place.\nRecommended:\n- Har Gau (steamed shrimp dumpling). Delicious flavor, fresh-tasting shrimp\n- Pan fried turnip cake. Nicely fried with crispy edges. Very little Chinese sausage in it though.\n- Beef rice sheet rolls",

They do decent dim sum that is better than a lot of Chinatown, but still not the best. Where Joy King Lau really shines is the cooked noodles/rice dishes they do, which have a great fresh flavour, aren't too oily and are good sized portions for the price. \nWe came here as a large group and booked a table which was a pleasant surprise in itself, and were pleased with not only how quickly the food came, but how polite the service is. Friendly waiters are not generally the main aim for when you go to Chinatown, but it's good to know that it isn't entirely gone from the restaurants here! \nI'll definitely be coming back here as the food is pretty good and cheap, plus the service + reservations means extra high points from me.

For some reason, I felt that it was lacking flavor to it and it was true for all the dishes that I had. \nWe had two different waiters that waited on us. The older gentleman was very nice and polite and helpful when ordering food , but the older lady that was there at the same time tends to ignore you. I've asked her for extra rice and salt and was ignored and she never brought it to the table. Weird. Be aware that they automatically include the service charge. Sneaky \nWe ordered a Chinese watercress cooked with shrimp paste which was above average , it lacks a little salt in it which I probably wouldn't have mind if I could have gotten my waiter to bring me some salt. Per the waiter's recommendation, we ordered a tofu with seafood plate which had a decent serving with a lot of seafood in it. \nThe food was a little cold. I don't know why. It's not freezing cold but just luke warm. I prefer my food to be hot , straight off from the wok. Maybe it sat on the dummy waiter for a while before the brought it to the table.",

I almost never get to that, so I when I do, it's always super exciting.\nWe got to Joy King Lau through Yelp reviews. Here are the points worth noting for other lovers of the genre:\n1. Get there on time minus 10 minutes. They start letting people in at ~11:50.\n2. There are no dim sum carts. You get a special menu and order from that. The menu includes most of the solid favorites. \n3. The crowd in this restaurant is mostly Asian, but not only.\n4. Prices are average. For 2 semi-hungry people we paid Â£37, 10% service is included here. \n5. Food taste is okay. It's not bad and it's nothing you'll remember later/think to come back for. \nPersonally I would have wanted to have a better tasting meal at Dim Sum. Apparently there are 2 other good spots in London's Chinatown area: Wan Chai and Beijing Dumpling that are similar as well.",

                "description": "If you're looking for the best(!) and freshest(!) Dim Sum in Soho - look no further! Joy King Lau on Leicester Street (adjacent to Lisle Street) offers a fairly large menu of steamed & fried dim sum, including some more exotic varieties - and a selection of cheung fun, of course.\nJust returned from London, where I always have dim sum several times during my stays. So far, I mostly frequented the Wan Chai Corner (on Gerrard Street) for its broad selection and solid quality, or Beijing Dumpling (on Lisle Street) for its absolutely freshly made dumplings. The two I will still recommend strongly - but Joy King Lau is different. All the dim sum are made freshly and have a better (firmer, more al dente usually) bite to them than those of the competition. Also, they're about 15% cheaper in comparison to the other Soho establishments, which also makes this restaurant great value! The regular dim sum are just UKP 2.80 per dish.\nThree times I had lunch at Joy King Lau in early to mid-August of 2015 - three times I chose 5 or 6 different dim sum each. This might seem too much for the average single traveler, but I wanted to sample as many different dim sum from this place as possible, having read some rave reviews on the Internet (the reviews here are mixed, which I don't quite understand). Expect 3 or 4 dim sum per person for a tummy-filling meal. They made only 1 mistake, as they served me the regular salty fried squid instead of the squid cakes I had ordered.\nThe atmosphere is quite typical for a Soho Chinese. It's always rush-rush-rush - this is no place to linger with friends for a party, or with a large family on a get-together. OTOH, for a quick lunch or early dinner with a friend or wife, it's great. You can always hang out for chit chat at one of the many pubs in the neighborhood (there's a good Fuller's pub a stone's throw away on the same street). Having said that, the waiters *never* forced the bill on me after I'd finished my meals - I had to ask for it!\nThe fact that Joy King Lau is also a small(!) restaurant tends to add to the atmosphere of slight chaos and rush.\nWhat's less typical is that the service is very attentive - they're always around to fill up your cup of Chinese tea (which you'll get automatically once you've been seated - so pay attention if you don't want tea!). Sometimes too attentive - there are so many waiters and waitresses around it can happen that one hands you the menu, then turns away, then another one steps up to ask for your order - 30 seconds after you've been seated! It may sound like pushiness - but it is not. The waiters just don't pay attention to what the others are doing.\nIf a little chaos does not deter you, the traveler looking for first class dim sum, then you shouldn't hesitate and include Joy King Lau in your Soho roster of Chinese joints. See the photos for the variety of steamed and fried dim sum I had (not a fan of cheung fun, so I can't comment on those). Particularly recommendable are: the pork & prawn dumplings with Chinese mushroom, the fried skin of chicken filled with four delicacies (just called \"Chicken with Four Kinds\" on the menu!), the beef with spring onion and ginger, the spicy beef tripe (not quite so spicy, actually - it's made with ginger), the siu mai (a standard dim sum, but of higher quality here than elsewhere!) and the chicken with Chinese dumpling (Warning: the chicken here is on the bones!). But ALL of the 17 ones I had were of superior to excellent quality.\nThe bill includes a \"mandatory\" 10% service charge. With 6 dim sum + chinese tea + service I ended up with a UKP 20-21 bill. Very reasonable considering the quality.\nDim sum can be ordered up until 5 p.m. (17.00), which is customary in Soho.\nAlmost all of the other guests during my three visits to Joy King Lau were Asian - I always consider that a good sign. Make sure that when you want to have lunch there with 3 or even 2 people that you show up at 12 noon when they open on weekdays, because the small restaurant will fill up quickly.\nPlease have a look at my photos, which also includes snapshots of the menus.",

Lots of Cantonese speakers around and the in-laws felt like they were back in Hong Kong.\nWe had jasmine tea for the table and washed the utensils as you would do in Hong Kong. My wife ordered a good variety of dishes, both fried and steamed, for the table to share. The food came out fast and all was as expected. They did the basics well: I liked the prawn dumplings.\nWe were all satisfied with the lunch and I recommend it as a reliable destination if you are looking to have a meal in Chinatown.",

The room is a little more spacious here however and the staff extremely attentive. Ensuring items get to your table in as few visits as possible. There were only 2 main visits to our table and we had all 8 dishes we'd ordered.\nNothing was stand out delicious, and whilst the chicken's feet were very nice and meaty, the sauce left me disappointed. And this was a case for quite a few dishes. Portion wise fantastic, but taste wise, extremely lacking. However this this instance you can normally expect the chilli oil to save the day, and save it indeed. It was excellent.\nSo I have no quibbles recommending this place if you're after good value dim sum. However just don't expect anything to surprise or tantalise your tastebuds. This place has a large number of regulars so they must be doing something right in terms of consistency, but sometimes that is at a price and for my it was the lack of that any one unique dish that you absolutely must go back for.",

                "description": "I've lived in London for 3.5 years now and have never eaten in Chinatown.  Yelp suggested this restaurant and I made a booking.  My friend and I, nevertheless, were impressed.  We weren't really hungry and therefore shared a quarter crispy duck from the appetizers with plum sauce and pancakes with a side of bean sprout noodles and it was the perfect amount of food.  The duck was delectable and the noodles were perfect - it had just enough grease without feeling too heavy.  The final price was alarmingly cheap.  Even though we didn't order much, it did fill us and we didn't even finish all of the duck.  The service was good, although we had a bit of a wait for the table, even though we had a booking.  By the way, this place gets jam-packed, so I do recommend reserving a table, particularly before 8 PM because the queue was out the door when we left.  I would definitely come back!",

Then menu was pretty extensive, but we restrained ourselves and ordered har kow, char siu cheung fun, sticky rice, spare ribs, and stuffed tofu skins. \nWe found the prawns in the har kow to be fresh with a nice crisp to them and the cheung fun was really similar to what we have experienced in other restaurants. The sticky rice was not too gloopy and was prett flavorful. \nThe service was friendly and prompt. We were seated and able to pay our bill without difficulty. We were seated in the back of the main level and the air conditioner was almost too cold, which just made us drink more hot tea to warm up.  We may consider coming back if we were in the area again.",

We can always go to New World, but let's at least have a look from the outside...ok?\nA: Mmm...if you really want to...but...\nIn any case, as you might have guessed, we ended up having dim sum at Joy King Lau and believe it or not but even A ended up liking the food very much:\nA: Yummy...their food is really tasty! And even the chicken feet, which are my ultimate test for a place, are delicious!\nSo, even though I'm yet another Caucasian reviewing this place, I was accompanied by two very picky Taiwanese friends and they both have approved of this place! \nBy the way, as for ordering dim sum, I particularly liked the BBQ pork buns, the sticky rice in lotus leaves, the tarot croquette and the meatballs. As for dessert, I can highly recommend the taro-tapioca soup (aka Cold Yum Pudding)...that was absolutely delicious!",

Same delicious food, same brusque and business-like service, and shockingly... Cantonese-speaking staff.\nI was particularly impressed with the perfect consistency and crispiness of the luo buo gao. Their do miu ended up being just the tops of the more mature plants - I draw this conclusion from the fact that there were no stems, and the leaves were much heartier (yet still tender) than the veggies I'm used to.\nPass on their Shanghai xiao long bao. Whilst they're satisfying and have the right taste, -none- of the dumplings that came out in our steamer tray had the 'soup' part of 'soup dumplings' going on. Disappointing.\nAs far as the food goes, Joy King Lau probably ranks at the top of my list for London dim sum. There's still plenty to explore, but I'd be totally willing to come back here for another round.",

We are back from a trip to Asia missing it, and I am from asian background, but being served defrosted poor quality dim sum when you crave and dream about yummy original ones is really frustrating!! \nWe ordered classic things, such as Har gao, Xiaolongpao, cheung fun... really bad sorry. Nothing tasted like original homemade. The cheung fun was made of three poorly defrosted old prawns stuck into an insipid dough sheet. It was not even cut into pieces, did not even have the onion, and the prawns inside were disgusting. The har gao strongly felt like a poor quality ready made from the freezer with weird dodgy mushy shrimp, and the appaling xiaolongpao was made of a disgusting dough, if I don't mention the inside! Please bring Din tai fung here! Aside those, we also had vegetable dumplings, with veg inside tasting almost like they were not good to eat anymore...\nI understand it can be difficult to manage offering such a huge choice of dim sum on the menu, so that not everything can be homemade and fresh, but I am shocked that none of the things we ordered seemed homemade. Especially coming to standard choices.\nOn top of that, staff is really cold and not welcoming like it can be the case in some asian restaurants, but still if only they were serving good food!",

It is a decent restaurant, unlike noisy Hung's (opened all night).  \nWe ordered the beef congee and beef brisket noodles.  Food arrived promptly and piping hot. The beef was well cooked and still tender, a sign of good quality cooking as it is very easy to overcook beef in congee and noodles. \nService was pleasant and friendly and although we were the only customers and it was closing time, we didn't feel rushed. \nI've docked one star on account of the MSG in the food, the effects of which were felt later.  But then all Chinese food served in restaurants have some MSG.",

After reading some of the other reviews some of the criticisms are justified so in recognition of that, perhaps 4 is more conservatively just - that said some of the criticisms are the very paragon of asinine ignorance (mainly those complaining about yum cha only being served until 4.30).\nIve been eating at this place for almost 20 years (since i was around 15). So it's fair to say it has a special place in my heart. That said i wouldnt have kept coming back if the food was sh*te. Not that it's always mind-blowing, but it is consistently tasty, well prepared and of an authentic high standard. Also due to it's location in chinatown the prices are competitive. Over the years i have brought hundreds of friends here, all of whom have been converted to adopting it as their regular yum cha place in central.\nThese days i mainly go here for yum cha (dim sum). I truly believe that along with Yi Ban (docklands) and Lotus (Canary Wharf) it is one of the best \"dim sum\" places in London - head and shoulders above the overpriced and often underwhelming and sometimes rubbish Royal China, or Phoenix Palace.\nBy way of exemplifying the caliber of this joint - a close friend of mine, whose old man who owns a couple of chinese restaurants in Chinatown, eats here with his family.",

                "description": "Finally came here for dim sum. It is one of those multi-floor monstrosities that Chinatowns are known for. Where the guy at the bottom (at primetime on a weekend) manages the queue via his cohorts upstairs on walkie talkies. From there, they send you to a floor and tell you a table number.\nYou get to your designated floor, and flag down a waitress running around who then barks at you (in a way oh so familar and even sort of cherished part of Chinese customer service at places like this) to just wait. Who cares about the table number, they never asked for ours. We waiting another several minutes at our floor level (always feeling in the way between the staircase and the women's loo), then when a table finally left, were seated. I think you have to be a little bit assertive (like, stand visibly in the hall), or they might forget about you. \nThere aren't any rolling carts or pieces of paper to write your dim sum order on... you just order like at a standard restaurant. The menus appear in both Chinese characters and an English 'translation', i.e. 'roast pork bun' or 'shrimp lasagne' and you just have to sort of guess to figure out what you want if you know it by romanized Chinese (i.e. Char Siu Bao). \nThat said, the Char Siu Bao were good, as were the 'mixed croquettes', and the 'egg custard tarts'. Once we ordered, the service was prompt and really, really solid. Tons of food for two ended up around Â£28.\nOh, also, we were pretty sure they added on a service charge without telling us. Sneaky. Easy to do since the bills are in Chinese.",

I can't really compare this to other dim sum places in London, for some reason this is the only place I've been too but from what others have told me it's really authentic \"chinese\" dim sum (I don't know that either since I've never been to China).\nI can't really be helpful to tell you what to order either as I don't know the names of most of the food I ate but the shrimp dumplings were divine and they have this kind of noodle \"lasagne\" that is out of this world.  We had the shrimp one and one with some fried bread in the middle and really really I could have eaten 3 of those it was so tasty.  So I can't be really helpful to you here except that you can take my word that it's delicious and you need to try it yourself!!! ;)\nOnly down side I can think of is this place on the weekend gets really crowded and not only is it a hard time for the host to get people to form a line outside (their entrance are is very small), you constantly need to remind him where you are in the line because people are constantly ignoring the line and just walking in trying to get a table (clearly I'd say there's a reason people are waiting in line but that's just my logic).

Instead, the sauce added a nice counterbalance to the blandness of the noodles, while the pork flavor still came through. \nThe prawn and pork dumplings and seafood dumplings were also nice, as were the minced pork and mushroom dumplings. The last of these looked really pretty repulsive sitting in the basket, with the mushroom sitting like a lump on top of a ball of pork, but the flavor more than compensated for the crazy appearance.\nMy favorites, though, were the char siu bao and the veggie dumplings. The roasted pork flavor was not too overwhelmingly sweet (as can often happen), and there was the perfect amount of pork in the bun. The veggie dumplings were so subtle and so nice - I'm not even sure what every vegetable was in there because we wolfed them down so quickly. \nThe service bordered on surly, but wasn't bad - the dishes came quickly, the tea pot was always full, and the check arrived right when we wanted it - so I can handle a little surly in exchange for this kind of dim sum!",

The place has a very interesting appearance on the inside, merging both Traditional Chinese ornaments and general setting with very modern yet simple furniture, giving it a very laid back feel about it. \nThe service is terrific the waiters are all highly experienced, I know, because for the past twenty years I've seen the same waiters in different restaurants all over the West End. The food is Amazing, however it does help if you get to know the staff or you do know a little about Chinese food because they are not scared to make things that are not actually written in the menu. \nI was once told that this is the restaurant that the majority of the London Chinese community go to when dining , and many of the other restaurants in the City especially China town are filled with tourists or those who don't really know the cuisine too well. \nThe food comes in reasonable time and the portions are generous, Joy King Lau is a perfect spot for group dining, with tables that can fit two families on. On many occasion have I been a part of a banquet here, where the entire floor is booked for our Tai Chi group, the waiters seem to double in their attentiveness.\nFinally something many people ask... the price range! Now despite being a fan of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant (two things which are most important to me in any resaurant) and the friendly staff. I also like the fact that two families of five can eat there for slightly over a hundred pounds, which comes to just over ten pounds per head which is not bad for a restaurant dubbed \"The place of choice for the London Chinese\" \n  \n  All in all I give it top marks Joy King Lau ? certainly As Good As It Gets",

We also ordered a chicken in a spicy chili sauce, steamed dumplings, and veggie soft noodles. I would get all but the noodles again.
