5,"Let's be real here...London...and noodles?? Yeah alright, let's go.
+ probably one of the nicest staffs I came across in the city
+ it's like a low-grade Panda Express with their set up
+ Shit was bangin' and delicious
+ Had the sweet/spicy chili chicken, oh shit it was delicious but...
+ Had an authentic feel to it
- sweet/spicy chili chicken was spicy affffffff
I sat outside and had a couple people walk by and ask questions about it...in turn, I told them it was amazing and they went inside...so I wasn't the only customer that was happy at that moment.",1
5,"Who goes to London and has Chinese food? Me of course. I've been to London a few times and I don't always want to have fish & chips with mushy peas, I decided to come to this place for dinner to stuff my face with Chinese noodles.
The place is located in a place that has lots of foot traffic, the restaurant itself is not that big, there will be a lot of people outside waiting for seating so one of the girls comes out and gives out menus so you already know what you want, when you've decided what you want, she'll take down the order and at the same time try to find you a table.
So now you come to your table, your finish ordering and they get to work, they're fast with the orders, I ordered some noodles with roast pork I believe and also some dumplings I believe, I have to say, the taste is amazing, full of taste, you can taste the spices, the meat and the consistency, delicious!
If you're in London and want noodles, yes, this is it, beware, it gets full but be patient because at the end of the wait you will be rewarded with a bowl of noodles that is big and plenty with great flavors all around.",1
5,"My family and I visited London for a few days and were looking for a nice noodle place we could visit for lunch. We were in the Covent Garden Area and were looking for somewhere close and saw Lanzhou Noodle Bar through Yelp. The reviews seem pretty mixed in that some people don't recommend because of the service, but our experience was wholly positive.
We were seated very quickly downstairs which was nice for us because it seemed cooler than the upstairs area. We ordered two water bottles straight ahead and sat with the menus to decide for a little bit. My mom ended up getting the fried noodles (G1 on the menu Dao Xia Mian), and my dad and I ordered the mixed beef noodle soup (G21 with Dao Xiao Mian). I wouldn't recommend the G21 if you're not good with intestines and stuff, but if you like it then I highly recommend it! We also got the pork and chive dumplings which was so great !All the food was really delicious and super filling! Could've ordered less probably since we came for lunch, but did not regret ordering! Everything was also very cheap and it's 10% off if you pay with cash! 
A must try if you're in the area!! Go try!! 
(Side note: not sure how this compares to actual Chinese hand pulled noodles because my family is Korean, but the hand pulled noodles were delicious to us! )",1
5,"This place is so unassuming and very easy to pass by because it looks like a bad Chinese buffet, like the ones you see on the main strip in Chinatown. But actually it's probably one of the best places to get a decent bowl of noodles in all of London, not least because they pull and slice the noodles by hand. 
The menu is actually quite vast but I would skip the rice dishes and just pick a noodle dish. You can't go wrong with lanzhou beef in either la mian (hand pulled) or dao xiao (knife cut.) get it with a soup and you're golden. It's like being in China. 
The service is FAST because the chefs never stop. Literally almost the second you order, the food will arrive. Turnover is quick but there's no pressure to eat quickly. You'll probably want to dash though because the place is small and not very relaxing. 
£8.5 is about reasonable for central London. My previous favourite (Bao Inn 人民公社）increased their price to £11.5. Needless to say... We're no longer on speaking terms. 
Check it out if you're nearby. Better than most places in Chinatown.",1
3,"It's a small and cramped little hole in the wall, the noodles are hand made a few feet from where you will be seated. The noodles are fresh, the service is efficient, and there was a huge line out the door waiting for a seat.
The food itself was rather mediocre, nothing crazy different then other handmade noodle shops I tried in Vancouver.
It was worth a bite, especially if you're in the mood for chewy noodles.",-1
2,"Don't get me wrong, I love noodles. I love all types of noodles. If I had to choose between noodles and rice, I don't hesitant to pick noodles.
So I came here thinking I'll have the best noodles ever. This wasn't the case. This is your hole in the wall type of establishment, it's small, crowded, loud busy. Your tables are pushed close to each other - it reminds me of Asia in many ways. In terms of the food, it wasn't all that great. It was just okay. I suppose the noodles were satisfying but I don't really care enough to come back. If the food was better, the ambiance wouldn't bother me as much. Usually, if it's a busy, crowded establishment, I would expect stellar food but this is not the case.
Why is it so crowded? Not really sure why, maybe people like this type of atmosphere or they are satisfied with the mediocrity of the food? 
This place may have a lot of reviews and hyped all over the internet but I don't believe it.",-1
2,"Worst meal of my trip.
We ordered two chicken noodle soups and a sweet and sour noodle with tofu. The soup was a big mistake. The chicken was flavorless and had a rubbery consistency. The  tofu noodle dish was just ok, and it took FOREVER to come. In fact, we were about to get the check and just leave when it finally came.
I really don't recommend dining in due to the small size of the restaurant and the slow service. Don't recommend for takeaway either.",-1
4,"Tiny place with great noodles! We stopped here after traveling for over 12 hours and beef noodle soup was the perfect comfort food that I needed after our journey. 
I've had lots of hand-pulled noodles but the texture of the ones here is definitely near / at the top of my list. The soup was good as well, but the noodle texture is what really stood out. One star off for service / experience - we shared a table with another couple and, when I asked about the super-thin noodles (you can ask for different thin-ness of noodles), the waitress told me that the regular was just fine (which, how did she know that? I'm into super thin noodles so I felt somewhat miffed...) Luckily the noodles did turn out to be good, hence the four stars, but I'm pretty sure I would've loved the super thin ones too. 
Skip the other food - we also had an eggplant appetizer and curry chicken and they were both meh. Just get noodles!",1
4,"A good place for a reasonably priced meal in the expensive city! I had a sudden craving for noodles and was content to find this place where they have hand made noodles! I got the handmade noodles with roasted duck. The bowl was just enough to be satisfied. The broth was pretty light but still really flavorful. I happily slurped up my noodles as they were really chewy, just how I liked them. The duck was okay. It was good but nothing amazing. 
Surprisingly, I didn't get super thirsty like I usually do after eating at a Chinese restaurant. Definitely a plus!",1
5,"Went at about 6:30 on a busy Saturday night.  Despite only having a few seats, I was seated in less than 5 minutes.  Food came out in less than 5 more.  They key is they have an employee passing out menus and taking orders while you wait outside.  I ordered the Dan Dan noodle soup.  Excellent!",1
2,"I came here craving for Chinese hand pulled noodle soup after reading decent reviews. I was really let down by both the service and the food.
First of all, the servers rushed me in to sit down and then gave me almost no time to even look at the menu before approaching me for my order. I later ordered a chicken dan dan noodle, which was not as described at all. The dan dan noodle broth was watery and plain, when the authentic version of it should be thick, rich and peanut-y. I had to add a lot of hot sauce to make it more flavourful. The noodles were the biggest disappointment as they gave me soggy rice noodles, when I was under the impression that it should've been a thicker hand-pulled noodle. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing on the menu. Overall I was disappointed.",-1
5,Legit noodles here that are made by hand. Small but worth the food. Expect good food and nothing else.  Recommended !!!!,1
5,"After a week in Italy, I didn't know how much I would miss eating vegetables until I found myself shoveling bok choi into my mouth from the delicious vegetable la-mian soup. They make the hand pulled noodles on the spot. While I can't guarantee that the broth was vegetarian, it was very flavorful and the noodles were just perfection!
My boyfriend, deciding to maintain a veggie-free diet, ate the fujian special mix peanut sauce on la-mian noodles and the flavor was just through the roof. So delicious and so cheap! Perfect little spot to go to if you're looking for cheap eats in Convent Garden.",1
3,"The food is okay but not great. Had langzhou or xi'an noodle in a few US cities and this is at most  average.
The space is very small and underground. They had to move the tables to squeeze me in and I sat super close to many other people. The person eating facing me in the tiny table made a lot of noise eating. The table was greasy. With many people packed in the tiny space I felt difficult to eat.
No idea why so many people come to eat...",-1
4,"Hard working people literally pounding away at your hand made noodles as you wait. They have downstairs seating so don't get discouraged if you don't see any seats.
Extensive menu! Go for the noodles. It's giant.",1
5,Hand pulled noodles made in front of you. This tastes like Hong Kong. The broth is delicious. Servings are quite large. I wish I had more space in my belly to eat. Seating is super small and is usually crowded.,1
4,"When I was walking around, I was wondering if they had pho around here in London. The closest pho place was too far from me so I found this place on yelp. There's definitely a huge difference between Chinese noodles and pho but this place makes it taste similar to pho. The broth was pretty good and the noodles are thick, just the way I like it, also my soup had a good amount of chicken as well. 
Thankfully though it was just me eating inside there and I say that because it's really small and tight there, it's not a type of place you go to with a group of friends.",1
4,"Cheap but authentic Chinese hand pulled or knife cut noodles. I doubt you'll find a more real experience anywhere else in London.
First, everyone working here is Chinese from the little lady barking seating instructions at the entrance to the cooks eating their own wares while pumping out dishes in no time.
I think it was the comedian Russell Peters who joked you get your food within seconds of ordering at a Chinese restaurant. Here, the joke plays it in real life as it is comical how quickly your orders go from kitchen to table. I had one arm out of he sleeve of my coat when our entire four person order was in front of us.
We had the beef noodle soup (knife cut noodles) and the stir fry char siu noodles (knife cut). We also had their spicy Chinese cabbage (which was just kimchi lol) and the potato shears dish. Had a few egg rolls for good measure but they were only ok.
Everything here is quick, cheap, and is legitimately Chinese comfort food. Our parents thought it lacked quality flavor though and the broth and ingredients are definitely on the cheaper side. But where else in all of London will you find good knife cut noodles for less than 7 pounds? 
They accept card and your whole party must be there to be seated. Cramped tiny space so be prepared to be elbow to elbow with your neighbor. 
Water is an additional charge.",1
4,"You may easily miss this hole in the wall but you would be sorry. With a large menu that has something to please everyone, you will surely find something worth eating here.
Space is limited but I managed to get a shared table in the back with a friend. We both got noodle soups - your choice of noodles with proteins either dry or in a soup. The fried pork chops were flavourful in a clear broth. It came with Chinese greens and herbs. My friend enjoyed her choice of braised beef noodle. Simple and delicious!
We also shared the red oil wonton. Wontons were cooked perfectly in a spicy and tangy sauce with garlic and chilli oil. I would order this again.
Cheap and cheerful is what it's all about here.",1
5,Delicious noodles and dumplings. We went for the dry noodles with minced beef and fried noodles with sliced pork.,1
5,"I was desperately craving noodle soup after spending 3 days in London eating the typical british fare (fish and chips, curries, etc). I need something asian and tasty so I decided to come here. I was not disappointed! 
I ordered the beef noodle soup with the thinner noodles. They have both types here, thicker knife cut noodles and the thin ones and they are both hand pulled. You can also order them with or without soup. I also decided to add a pickled egg to mine.
To me, the broth really makes the soup and it was really flavorful without being salty. I also didn't taste any msg in the soup, it tasted homemade. The beef was also very tender and tasted amazing with some of the chili sauce provided at the table.
I was traveling only for a couple days in London so I decided to pay the extra 15% to use my credit card versus paying with cash. 
Note: this is a small, hole in the wall type place so you might need to share a table.",1
2,"Hand made noodles, prepared and cooked with the worst quality ingredients imaginable. The food is stored in a Panda Express-like display at the entrance, which was pretty off putting. We came expecting fresh, traditional Chinese food. Upon entering were seated on the lower floor, a tiny cramped space with a few tables pushed so closely together that you bump elbows with other patrons around you. The walls are painted neon yellow, and there are no windows. Not one to be scared off by a diver interior, I was still hopeful, and happy to find plenty of vegan options on the menu. 
I got a Stir Fried Vegetable Noodle, which was disgusting. It tasted like cheap two day old Chow Mien. The noodles were overcooked and rubbery, tasting only of soy sauce, and the vegetables were soaked in oil. My boyfriend got a beef noodle dish that was equally inedible. We shared the Vinegar Cauliflower, which had good flavors but was nothing special. I have no idea how this place is so highly rated. Perhaps my standards are too high, having had great authentic food in China and the US. However, the lack of quality and flavor in our food here leaves me to strongly suggest dining elsewhere. I give two stars only because the food was dirt cheap-£18 for three large portions (which we barely touched, but still). Avoid.",-1
5,"Lanzhou Noodle Bar? More like mama's home cooked noodle bar.
I've come here maybe ten times now and every single time there is a different combination of food that I am ingesting. From lamb kabobs to spring rolls to dumplings to beef soup to egg & tomato cuts  - lanzhou is awesome.
And perhaps most people's least favorite parts is one of my favorites - getting to squeeze in with your compadres at tables made for 8 seating 6 different parties ordering at different times just slurping the noods into your mouth.
Hats off to you Lanzhou for bringing a bit of light into a gloomy city.",1
5,"I have ascended to Valhalla. I have glimpsed what lies beyond this realm of mortal men.
And it's all thanks to Lanzhou Noodle Bar.
~ Atmosphere:
Tiny, dingy, and extremely chaotic. They only have a few long tables that they pile everyone on so get comfy because you'll be squashed up next to complete strangers. Getting out of the restaurant is a nightmare as well since the place to pay at is right by the tiny entrance way where loads of people are coming in and out. Basically, this restaurant is as close as you'll get to actually being in China.
~ Customer Service:
They were really quick and efficient. The food came out at the speed of light. Not friendly, but they get you what you need.
~ Food:
Terrific. Can't say enough good things about it. I recommend you skip ordering the non-noodles though, to be honest. In addition to our noodles we got a plate of steamed pork dumplings and spicy wontons. Both of those dishes were OK, but my partner and I both came out of the experience wishing we just ordered another plate of those glorious noodles instead.
TIP: Order 'Dao Xiao' noodles aka knife-shaved noodles. The texture is out of this world and the springy texture from the noodle being freshly made is a perfect 10/10. I've had knife-shaved noodles a million times before but never had it as fresh as this.
---
If you can get over the dingy atmosphere and the fact that you're eating right next to strangers communal-style, you'll reach food nirvana like I have. Trust me - this place ROCKS!",1
3,This is located close to Chinatown and has 4 tables in the entire establishment. Be warned that seating is very limited! I tried the hand-pulled dan-dan noodles and some duck and both dishes were just OK. I know London isn't well known for its Chinatown like some other big cities but you are definitely not missing much if you skip this place.,-1
4,"Sometimes the best meals are completely spontaneous. Experiencing the moody, unpleasant British weather was inevitable, so when a torrentuous downpour suddenly began, we ducked underneath an awning to shelter from the rain. We spotted a growing line a few doors down that piqued our interest. Although the exterior of the restaurant makes it look like a takeaway place, think of it as the middle ground between takeaway and eating in. This place is a total dive: the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, the service is close to nonexistent, and the cramped elbow-to-elbow communal seating probably violates the fire code.
But I'd be lying if I said the handmade noodles didn't make all of that worth it. Trust me, I'm from San Francisco, a world-renowned hub for authentic Chinese food.
An employee stands outside next to the line to take orders so the kitchen can start working on them before you're even seated. That way, your food will practically be ready for you once a spot frees up for you inside. This unassumingly authentic hole-in-the-wall serves delicious hand pulled noodles (seriously, you can see them being made right in front of you) in broth for lower-than-London prices.",1
4,"Right in the heart of Leicester Square, Lanzhou is a clutch venue for lunch or dinner. The interior is cramped with minimal seating upstairs with a similarly tight downstairs dining room. Prepare to dine with tables pushed together and almost overlapping. It's claustrophobic but seems to add some authenticity to the experience.
Wife and I both did dao xiao mian (hand cut noodle) soup with stewed beef. The food came out fairly quickly and the flavors were excellent with huge portions. Service was quick and efficient. 
Overall, this was a great hidden gem to grab some cheaper, filling food.",1
5,"Ignore the takeaway in front of the restaurant.  Asked to be seated inside or downstairs where the food is great and authentic.
You have a choice of pulled Noodles (very thin - angel hair pasta sized to thick - udon sized) or cut Noodles - thicker and chewier that pulled Noodles.  You can choose the to have the Noodles served as part of s soup or dry.  The soup or dry Noodles can be served vegetarian, seafood or various types  of meat including Char Su Pork, Stewed Beef, Chicken Dan Dan etc....
I had the Cold Stewed Beef with very thin pulled Noodles.  This dish was wonderful. The soup was a delicious chili infused broth that had a pleasant tang, hint if spiciness with just the right degree of umami.
I also had the Braised Tofu dish - highly recommended.
A hidden gem near Covent Garden, London.",1
3,"This little restaurant is right outside of Chinatown, and I came here in search of knife shaved noodles. I got the half beef half tendon noodles for takeaway. They separate the noodles and soup so the noodles don't get soggy. The menu for noodles is very big as they are known for their noodles. The portions are pretty big, and prices are okay. The beef was very soft, and the tendon was chewy. I would've like some more spice or flavor in the soup. They also skimped on the vegetables and only gave me a little. The noodles were not authentic knife cut noodles, but they were still good. Lanzhou is an okay noodle place, good for when you're hungry and passing through the area.",-1
4,"We came here on back to back nights...it's that good. Even with the cramped communal seating in the small space, food was enjoyable. 
I prefer the Dao Xiao noodles (knife cut) over the La Mein (hand pulled) noodles, thicker chewy texture. I also prefer stewed beef over sliced (Chunky cut, both are lean).
Lamb skewers are cumin flavored and excellent. My husband liked their wonton soup, handmade and meaty.
(Written by husband)",1
2,"This place is not worth it people!!! I've had my fair share of Chinese noodles...and this place was so-so. I didn't have the knife noodles but this place's soup was so unimpressive even if the knife noodles were good I wouldn't go back. Lanzhou is renowned for their noodles. This place uses the name to lure you in. The inside serves a mix of different Chinese foods. You're also allowed to customize your noodles. Hint that it isn't authentic!! If I had seen the menu first, I wouldn't have gone in.
My husband and I shared a bowl of beef tendon hand pulled noodles. Soup lacked depth. The chili on the side was good and the saving grace. I ended up dumping two tablespoons into my bowl. I also had two lamb skewers. It was pretty good. I almost wanted to order more. All it was missing was the good ratio of fat. Their skewers were all meat. That's not a bad thing but it's definitely better with the pieces of fat in between. 
The lady taking our order was so distracted by the girl next to us who wanted to change her order last minute that she failed to put down our order of roast duck and bbq pork. We had to ask someone to follow up. The guy we asked was the same one I saw watching horse races on his phone... He then proceeded to tell me they don't have roast duck so I said 烧鸭 (roast duck in chinese) and he goes oh yes ok. That's when we found out she missed our order. So we order and wait... The bbq pork was so dry I  had to spit it out. My husband was super disappointed by the food coloring. It's supposed to be red but we were disturbed how it wasn't just the outside, the red had died random spots on the inside, likely from when they were slicing. If you normally have this, it's red on the outside only... no transference of dye people... The roast duck came drenched in a sauce... 
I'm pretty sure they were trying to serve the duck cantonese style because it was a 烧味 (A style of roast/bbq meat)... It was not accurate!!! Both were too sweet. Especially the bbq pork. 
Friendly reminder Hong Kong, located in the south of china, was a British colony. These roast meats are very common in HK. Also, Lanzhou is not in the south... 
I was disappointed this place was true to no region...
Everyone was pretty nice except the guy who helped us at the cashier. Didn't ring me up stared at me. So I thought the number on the register was what I owed (28.10 pounds). This fool rang me up (22.50) while I was grabbing my money. So when I gave him 30 he gave me  5 back and waited for me to give him change or exact instead. Really?",-1
5,"As a study abroad student in London for the summer, I was craving noodles and found this place close to my school! Have been here twice and ordered different dishes; both were delicious and worth the buy. Service was good too; right when you walk in the door, they'll ask you how many people are in your party and seat you right away (given that space is available). 
I recommend trying the knife-cut noodles, which are hand-shaven when you order. You can watch them cut your noodles. The beef noodle soup was very good--the broth was not too heavy and there is a good amount of both veggies and beef in it. Well-priced, about 7-8 pounds for a pretty big serving! 
Will be back again for the remainder of my stay in London! 
*NOTE*: Cash only if your order is under 20 pounds. I believe you can pay with card if it is under 20 pounds, but there is an added fee, so bring cash!",1
5,"YUM! I've been craving real asian noodles and this delivered. My boyfriend and I got pork la mien noodles and it was perfect on a cold and dreary London day. The broth had a lot of flavor and the pork was amazing. The place is tiny and cramped and we shared a table with two other parties but we were so hungry it didn't matter!
It was such a busy time that everything was rushed but the food tasted great so I'm not complaining!",1
4,"locals and tourists alike, we seem to have the hots for this place. it's a tight squeeze, but the staff do a profound job making sure their customers find seating quick! food was good, no complaints. price was reasonable, too. great location in proximity to the rest of china town, london. i ordered their spicy beef noodle. that was a popular dish. their battered 
shrimp sauté was a recommendation from our waiter.. my friend and i liked that too.",1
2,"This place definitely does not live up to the hype. 
Maybe it's because I've had a lot of good Chinese food back in the states and in China, but this really did not satisfy my craving for Chinese.
There is very little seating here, so you basically have to share a table with a bunch of strangers. It feels very tight and crowded. Not very pleasant.
The actual dishes are not well prepared and feel like they came out of a Panda Express. The stir fried meat is dry, but the bok Choy we got was nice, but you can't really mess up bokchoy. 
The only I can really consider worth trying here are their noodles, and that's only because they handpull them. The actual noodles are quite nice. They're bouncy and have a good texture, but the broths that complement them are waaay too rich. The first few bites are great, but I couldn't even finish my bowl because of how much fat was in it.
And if it was hard to take in the food, imagine what it was like to get rid of it. Let's just say, I was in the bathroom for half an hour after this.
Anyways, disregarding that, I would not come back to this place, there MUST be a better Chinese place out here in London. Please fellow yelpers direct me to it.",-1
5,"Simple, Cheap and tasty Asian food. 
The noodles prepared at the order are nothing less than excellent. Just writing the review makes me crave for the noodle soup...",1
5,My fiancé and I came here about 3 times during our week in London. The beef noodle soup is delicious. I'm a sucker for any restaurant that has freshly made noodles!,1
5,"This place is off the hook! Oh boy I am not even from London and this place is the best for dinner. Who knew? I usually eat Chinese food at home but when you are on the go you have to find a quick Chinese place to eat. I really like their beef noodle it's better than what I have in the city of Cupertino. The ingredients they use are of good quality, you don't just taste the food you taste the homestyle feeling of eating in Shanghai or Beijing. The staff that served me is real friendly! A nice lady knew what I wanted from my observations of other local and non local people in the restaurant. The best Chinese food in London 
Drawback: it can get real noisy here. If you are not from London this place can be real loud during the high season. If you are a tourist and you need to ride public transport here commute at your own time.",1
5,This is the real deal beef noodle soup spot.  Located in London's Chinatown district.  Walked in the restaurant and nobody speaks English.  They just look at you and smile.  That's when you know the food is going to be authentic and amazing!   My beef noodle soup was spicy and the broth was just right.  Check this place out if you're ever in London.,1
3,"Tourist here from Toronto! Went here with my gf and her family, ratings is 4 stars. Unfortunately, Overrated even for a cheap eats place. Food quality, average - noodles were okay, soup base was too sweet. Tasted like instant noodles. Ambiance is average, but expected for a cheap eats place. Dining experience, average for a Chinatown. Upside, orders came quick. Downside, service was limited, didn't even serve water. We had to ask. The restaurant charged an auto 10% service charge and gave VERY minimal service. Would contemplate going back!",-1
3,"Went here after seeing all the reviews on yelp and reading about it on timeout. Good food at a great price. Only concern is with cleanliness.
Very tiny restaurant with limited seating. We were a group of 4 and it was quite crammed at the table. We were seated in the basement which looked dingy but that was okay, we were here for the food not the ambiance. We each got a bowl of la-mien noodles which were quite good but broth was too salty. Service was what was expected for a cheap-eat Chinese restaurant. I ordered the sliced beef noodles and they brought out the wrong order but was still tasty (picture attached). Cleanliness is concerning which is why I'm rating it 3 stars; we asked for water and it was very obvious that our water came in styrofoam cups that have been washed with hot water and reused.",-1
2,"After a long day of traveling yesterday, we ventured out for some good food this afternoon. After seeing reviews for places in the area, we decided to give Lanzhou Noodle Bar a go. It's a tiny restaurant that's run quite efficiently. We browsed through the menu during our 10 minute wait, and were seated quickly. Hungry and excited, I started to dig into my food only to be terribly disappointed. I ordered a chicken curry plate with steamed white rice; the chicken pieces had a strange texture so I started to take a closer look...
RAW/UNDERCOOKED chicken... Are you kidding me? People can get really sick! I stopped eating immediately. Before leaving, I pointed out that the chicken was raw/undercooked and the employee rolled her eyes as she grabbed my plate to re-cook the dish (I'm assuming). But I told her it's fine and that we were on our way out. We paid for our meals, crossed our fingers hoping I don't fall ill and no one else does either.",-1
5,"This is one of the only spots open early in Chinatown! They open at 10am and it was the perfect brunch meal after I picked up discounted tickets for a musical.
The hand shaved beef noodles were amazing! The broth was very soothing and it had the right amount of bok choy. Meat was tender and the texture of the noodles were perfect - chewy and tasty. 
Bring cash or they will charge a bit extra for using card.",1
1,"This place is extremely dirty and crammed. The food is really low quality- it's cheap, but still very, very gross food, even at that price. I am confused by how it has good reviews. Would never go back here.",-1
4,"It's a bit of a dive, but it feels very authentic. The waitstaff bantering in Chinese, sitting elbow to elbow with strangers, and the rhythmic slap as they hand pull the noodles. Like others have mentioned, this is not the place to go on a romantic date but rather for a generous homemade bowl of noodles. The hand cut noodles which I ordered took longer and most of the other patrons looked to be ordering the la mian which came out almost instantaneously, so that might have been the move.",1
5,"Was deciding what to eat after landing in UK. Found this store on Yelp and thought of giving it a try to see the quality of asian food in London. 
The food did not disapoint: had a sliced beef lanzhou soup noodle. The broth was clear but flavorful. Ordered lamb and squid sticks to go with the noodles. Overall the food has a very authentic taste. Service is fast and food is very reasonably priced.",1
5,Very tasty and delicious lanzhou noodle soup. The soup is super good! Clear and tasteful. Noodle are real hand pull very chewy!,1
2,"Based on authenticity, it's really below average.. I mean the food is fine but if you are looking for a great noodle soup dish, don't go.
The waitress are weird and they just stand there pushing you to order and watching you eat. Anyway I'm not gonna go again.",-1
4,"Big fan of hand pulled noodles. The first time I walked by I was kinda skeptical due to their hygiene score (a few months ago). However, on a subsequent visit they have improved their score so I decided to give it a go. It was a Friday night and this place was bustling at 11pm, from the drunk/clubbing crowd. There was a line and it was a short 5 minute wait as they quickly turned around the tables.
You'll be dining communal style (we're kinda used to it) and sharing a table with other people. This place is pretty fast and you can see them make the noodles in front of  you. I ordered the beef stew hand pulled noodles. It arrived in a matter of minutes and was sooooo good. Be sure to put plenty of that hot sauce in your soup for the best experience. I shared a table with two girls that barely ate their appetizers. They clearly ordered too much (3 appetizers and two soups). Don't do what they did... Total waste. Most of the people eating here are locals and I was the only tourist (or so I thought). It is near Leicester Square which has a bunch of tourists but not too many of them appreciate the fine art of hand pulled noodles. 
Soooooo good.",1
1,We stopped here for lunch after reading decent reviews and it was cheap. The service was terrible and the food wasn't that great. They took my order then came back and said they were all out (this was in the middle of lunch). I tried asking questions about other menu items where I was given little response and pushed quite vigorously to place a new order. I'm not even sure what chicken dish I ended up with. I ate it because I paid for it but I definitely didn't love it.,-1
2,"Found this restaurant on Yelp.  Disappointed.  It's literally a hole in the wall with limited seating.  We got seated in the basement.   Food was praised on Yelp but we found I mediocre at best!   Just barely tolerable.  Thought food would be good and authentic due to the China staff, but I thought wrong!   This place is a pass.",-1
5,"I didn't know the name of the venue until I found it on yelp since this place is so authentic that they only have chinese letters on their sign. (Not kidding)
Let me be straight: The venue is small as f*ck, not cozy and overall poorly designed. 
BUT
The food is simply AMAZING: You can watch live how your noodles are prepared by the chef, who must be some kind of martial master, because damn son: He his beating up this noodle dough like a pro. 
The food comes really quick (because of the mentioned martial art master) and is delicious. Our group had different soups and stir fries and all of them were well seasoned and fresh. The price is a joke for London and that quality. Will return as soon as I am back to London.",1
5,"Such a good spot to satisfy a noodle craving! Don't expect much from the service but it's quick, the ingredients are fresh and everything is delicious. You really can't go wrong with the price.",1
5,"London! My favorite city in the world just keeps getting better and better. Hidden in the bustling streets between Covent Garden and Leister Square you will find this tiny restaurant that will absolutely blow your tastebuds to another dimension.
Look for a long line of (mostly) youngsters eye-eating  the menu as they wait in the sidewalk for a table. Busy servers will take your order as you stand and once a table is ready and you are seated, your food will follow within a minute (or less).    
Noodles of all size and shapes, boiled, souped or fried, generous pork dumplings, all sizzling  from being super fresh made. 
The Dao Xiao Mian noodles are SUPERB, tender moist and chewy with a subtle almost sweet taste. I had them fried with roasted duck, and served with a good heap of hot oil with chili peppers. Seated in a small table along side a very friendly couple (who found the place and were visiting for the third time in two days), this was a trip to the exotic in the middle of the eclectic. 
Just found another excuse to return to London, if you are in this touristy area of London, don't fall for the chains or the ""best British fish in chips"" find this place, get in line and enjoy.
You are welcome.",1
4,"Awesome place to come to, pretty authentic Chinese food. Space is a bit small inside but definitely saw why the hype! 
Ordered a Dan Dan soup noodle, pan fried steak noodle, and the hot spicy shredded potato salad. Would come back again",1
3,"This tiny restaurant is reasonably priced for anyone looking for a fast and simple Chinese dish.  Nothing fancy here and the flavors are decent with no frills or fancy dining space.  The street level seating area is very limited just as tight as the basement level quarters where patrons are squeezed together so as to maximize the tiny space.  Though the service is a bit rushed, staff members get the job done and rather swiftly.  The food choices to select from isn't bad as my family and I ordered lunch items--house fried rice, roast pork and roast duck with steamed rice.  Again nothing to marvel, but they did the trick with satisfying hunger, especially in the winter cold in London.",-1
5,"I've had this placed bookmarked to try for donkeys years and I am kicking myself that it took so long to get here. Who doesn't like delicious cheap eats?
The specialty here is hand pulled noodles. They have a guy making them as you come in and they are delicious. You can completely tell when you slurp them up that they are freshly made. 
We asked our waitress to recommend some dishes. We shared a beef la mian soup which was super tasty. We also ordered an aubergine and potato stir-fry which was delicious. You never get potato in Cantonese cooking so this was a nice treat. We also ordered the chill chicken which came with Sichuan peppercorns. This was also very good. 
The meal came to £23.50 for 2 which is a total bargain!  You pay at the cash register but please leave the wait staff a tip. They were on top of things and you could tell, working very hard. 
This isn't a place to linger and the tables are communal and crowded. The staff speak basic English so break out your rusty Chinese if you can. But that's part of the fun. Loads of Chinese people eating here too which is never a bad thing.",1
3,"Beef noodle soup should be a signature dish in such place. The soup should be very delicious and strong with meaty taste. Noop. The noodles should still have the fresh starchy powder smell on it. Noop. The noodle should be chewy but not soft. Noop. 
Overall I am disappointed. 
Salty soup, skinny beef and overcooked soft noodles in a bowl is all I got. Sorry, no good news. May be I am too harsh since I am from CA where good authentic Chinese food is like the rain here in London!
Come to San Francisco bay area and read my reviews, you will find out how a real good bowl of beef noodle soup is! Price is 10 % lower.",-1
4,This is a nice find in tourists zone. Authentic and hand pulled noodle place. The dumplings are good as well. I had the beef and tripe noodle soup which is a nice combo of spicy and sour although not very spicy for my taste.,1
5,"Seating ishard to come by during busy hours, and it feels like if there was a fire, we'd all be screwed, BUT the food is amazing. We were craving some noodles/ramen, so I found this place and we were skeptical at first from the outside, but once we got our food, it was awesome. The homemade noodles were super tasty and it was the first time since I've moved to Europe I got to taste some delicious chinese food. The dimsum here were also super tasty and honestly, I wanted to go back here for lunch every single day we were in London, but my boyfriend got tired of it.",1
4,Legit Chinese hand drawn noodles with no frills. Quick in and out in a cramped spot. You'll have to share tables with other parties.,1
4,"West end emergency --- 40 minutes before showtime, and I am on an empty stomach.  Mayday, mayday!  Fortunately, Yelp was just a click away.
This is the perfect hole-in-the-wall for a quick pre-show meal.  There is a wide variety of noodles, soup or dry, to be had, for less than 10 pounds.  Food is served quickly, and waiters seem to expect you to eat quickly.  
I ordered the dao-shao (knife cut) noodles and was very impressed by the consistency of the noodle.  The best noodles are a bit chewy (Taiwanese describes this as being ""Q""), which is only possible when the noodle is made fresh and made well.  The noodle here was definitely ""Q.""
A couple of cautionary notes: 
- Being a hole-in-the-wall, you are expected to share tables with strangers.  
- Waitresses will try to upsell.  Check the menu before ordering anything.  The noodles may be cheap, but not all dishes are cheap.",1
5,"When I discovered that there was a gem of a handmade noodle place by Covent Gardens, I was more than excited to try. This place is located right outside the Leicester Square tube stop. As soon as I walked inside, they greeted me in Mandarin and asked how many people I had with me.
We sat down at a long wooden table next to a trio of Chinese college students working on a mound of amazing-looking noodles.
We were given menus, and I (having done my Yelp homework) knew to go for the handmade noodles and not any of the typical Chinese fare. Also because I'm obsessed with handmade noodles.
After asking the guy next to me what he was eating, I ordered the same: stir-fried knife-cut beef noodles. We also ordered the ji dan jiu cai he zi (egg and leek ""pancake"") to share. My plate came, gloriously heaped with noodles. I reached for the clay pot full of hot chili flakes in oil, dumped a copious amount on my noodles, and dug in.
The cramped noodle bar, with its communal tables, fluorescent lighting, and cooks making noodles two feet away from where you're sitting reminded me a lot of noodle shops I went to while in Hangzhou, China.
The food was no frills, authentic Chinese at its best. And even better? You can get a massive portion of noodles for under £7.
100% recommend if you're in London and looking for quick, cheap, tasty, authentic bite.",1
4,"place is tiny.   cumen lamb is excellent.   very surprisdd by how tender it is.    flavor is excellent.
girls say the noodles are very good as well.
huge portions",1
4,"This was a pleasant surprise for us. The Lanzhou noodle bar in London Chinatown beats the Lanzhou noodle in San Francisco bay area! One star off for bathroom afcility and always have to share table due to space limitations. We found the noodle and the BBQ kabobs to be so good that we came here three times during our 6-days stay, only wished we found it sooner! 
 
We found this hole-in-the-walls place by chance, and noticed the online review was decent so decided to give it a try. Service was average and I saw people complaining the waiter/waitress tried to rush customers. We didn't mind it since we wanted a quick eats place. But I can see why some people may be offended.",1
5,"Literally in love with this place. My go to is to get vegetable la mian with veggie broth instead of pork. 
Whether it's lunch time or 2 am this is the place to go, but this is not a first date place...
Unless you have an adventurous date. 
You're going to have to share a table with strangers and be comfortable without having personal space.",1
3,"This place is not in the heart of Chinatown. Decent place but not the friendliest. Tried to ask some questions about the menu and was not given real answers. Not entirely sure if she understood what I was asking. Still unsure of what I actually ordered too! Asked for a stir fried noodle dish and got a soup meal. It was good but a little bland. Also got a stir fry chicken dish it was similar to a sweet and sour but not 100% sure and it too was bland. Service is very quick! If I came with a regular that loves this place to show me the ropes, I am sure it would have been a much better experience!",-1
4,"I spent the last 2 months in East Africa and I've been thinking about all of the food that I want to eat as soon as possible. Noodles was definitely on that list and this was my first meal in London, thanks to the positive Yelp reviews. It's a simple noodle shop where the front has the cooks making the noodles and in the back, there are some communal tables. Overall, the place could fit probably 10 people and you would be sharing tables. But I was seated right away when I entered. Ordered the cha siu noodle soup and my order took less than 5 minutes to arrive. Maybe even less than 2 minutes. It was REALLY fast and delicious and definitely satisfied the craving.",1
5,Very small noodle bar with very great food (freshly hand-made noodles and good broth) and low prices. The service may be a little bit quick and disinterested and since there aren't many places where to sit you may end up at the table with strangers but if your focus is having great noodles this is restaurant is perfect.,1
4,"Yummy and inexpensive, best to take to go since the dine in space is very small. But the staff was friendly and helpful, food was pretty good",1
3,"Service was efficient and prompt. This place is super small, so be ready to share a table with other people for maximum efficiency.
Char siew dao xiao mian (BBQ pork knife-cut noodles)
BBQ pork was extremely tough and over-boiled. With how overcooked it was, it might have been the previous day's leftovers. The knife-cut noodles were too inconsistent. Usually, knife-cut noodles are good because of the little inconsistencies in thickness, and therefore, texture, but these were too widely ranging. Most of the pieces were too thin, which made it like eating little bits of noodles the thickness of dumpling skins. The remaining pieces were extremely thick, which made for lots of QQ, but also just too doughy. I would normally always recommend the knife-cut noodles over pulled noodles, but I say go with the pulled noodles here.
Stewed beef la mian (pulled noodles)
Beef was very tender and tasted marinated, noodles were good. Broth was good. Stick with this one.
Cash only.
7.50GBP for soup with pulled noodles. 7.90GBP for soup with knife-cut noodles. Most dishes can also be customized to be a dry noodle or stir-fry noodle dish.",-1
4,"Delicious!!! I ordered the La mian wonton soup and it was very good. We went here for dinner two out of our three nights in London. It was slightly uncomfortable as the location is quite small and you will likely share a table with strangers. No biggie, however i noticed the other girls at our table received their food long before we got our despite arriving and ordering much earlier.",1
5,"I don't think I've had better noodles in my life before. The hand-made noodles were perfection and the broth was better than anything I could've imagined - not too salty, not bland... just right. Achieving that balance is harder than it often seems. I ordered the sliced beef noodle and it was absolutely delightful. The restaurant itself is certainly crowded; arriving with a big group might be a bit problematic if you want to sit down. Fortunately for me, I went alone and ended up making friends with the stranger seated next to me at the bar.",1
4,Wanted noodles. This hole in the wall has knife peel noodles! Super fresh and very tasty. We ordered beef noodle soup. Wonton in chili oil. Mapo tofu and bokchoy with fresh garlic sauce. Everything so good!,1
3,"Thought they serve vermicelli noodles but no longer on menu. Gluten free option is only rice plates or meat dishes.
Ordered zha jiang mian, niu rou mian & roasted duck rice plate. Not much flavor with the zha jiang mian, niu rou mian had good flavored broth and small portion of duck with the rice plate. Quick service as they want quick turnover. Try to give tip to waitress but she refused and said come back if we like the food and service.",-1
5,"As a vegan, I'm usually not very impressed with lanzhou noodles, but the bok choi and la mian were fantastic. Came at around 6pm. Place was buzzing and customer service was great! Would totally come again.",1
4,"Came here for dinner after yelping this place.  I dont remember the exact name but I had the peanut sauce dry la mian noodles £7.50.  The dish arrived rather quickly after we ordered. I was hoping that it would come with some bok choi or some veggies but the bowl only came with the noodles on top of the peanut sauce.  You have to mix it together before you eat.  
Peanut sauce on noodles was quite tasty.  Rich flavour, almost but not quite overwhelming in flavour.  I almost wished I ordered a noodle soup instead due to the richness.
Definitely a no frills kind of place and you might have to share a table with strangers.  Best pay with cash!",1
4,This place is busy and crowded. Food are reasonably priced and they offer the option of additional meat and/or noodles. I definitely recommend the hand pull noodles.,1
3,"One of the few places in London offering late night quick bites. The food is okay, the limited menu still offers a good number of combinations. I appreciate that they have chili oil at every table, though the place is small and definitely more geared towards carry outs. Overall, worth checking out, especially for the hand pulled noodles.",-1
5,"Open late which is wonderful and strangely rare in this city. The other attendees were chinese ex pats which is a good sign i think.  Food was wonderful and just the right thing after a long, late international flight.",1
5,"Oh my gosh! The Chinese food here is SO good! The handcut noodles were amazing. Also, super cheap. Great Local London spot!",1
5,"Awesome food and relative to general London Chinese food this is superbly awesome with great price!
Love the broth in this cold weather!",1
2,"Good for late night noodles, lousy, lousy service.  Rude staff.  Food wise, it's decent, especially for a late night meal, but on a global scale, it's certainly not the best noodle place ever.  It's good for where you are.  I've also dealt with rude service on a global scale, and this place was right up there with the worst.  If you're coming for the food, then stop by, but my rating reflects an overall experience.",-1
4,"I found this place on Yelp and wanted to give this place a try because I was craving Chinese food. I was in Paris a couple days ago before I tried this place and I was really craving a bowl of noodle soup right when I got to London! 
They have an extensive menu and the price is reasonable considering the conversion rate of pounds to USD. 7-8£ for a bowl of noodle is probably the most reasonably priced meal I had in London. 
There was a line when I went around 6pm on a Friday. But we got seated within 5-10 minutes. They are pretty efficient because you can order while you are in line so by the time you get seated, you only have to wait for another 5 minutes until you get your food.
I got the noodle soup with roasted duck and vegetables. Their handmade noodles taste amazing! They have this hot chili sauce that you have to add to your noodle! It adds so much flavor and a kick to it. If I am ever back in London, I'll definitely come back and eat here.
This place is in Leicester Square and there's always things happening around here at night so it's a good place to eat before you go out for the night!",1
5,"I went here when I went on vacation and even after returning to the states, I miss this place so so bad. I'm a big noodle soup girl and this place really hit the spot. I think my beef noodle plate was around 8 pounds, and the broth was salty and savory (just the way I like it)! They gave a good amount of noodles and beef and veggies. It is really busy here and crowded and cramped so it's best to just eat and leave.",1
1,"Takeout noodles tasted like plastic, fish and meat terrible. I do not suggest taking the take out food.",-1
4,"this is a very busy small place..it is fun watching the noodles being made..it is jammed and crammed. ..
I've had several dishes here, and been happy..but I really like the fried pork  dumplings...
they have 5£, lunch specials but we didn't try them..next time..",1
4,"Finally made my way to Lanzhou Noodle Bar for some fresh hand pulled noodle soup. It's what they well known for yet I can't help but feel sad when I see tourists or people unfamiliar with the cuisine going for a cheap container of their pre cooked buffet section.  Take the hint and order the freshly made hand pulled noodles instead.
The place felt like I entered a nursery with their bright colour walls of yellow, red and green and laminated printout of the food. 
Staff were efficient and quick but without the friendliness, which is very typical of a Chinese restaurant. With that in mind and the small canteen style restaurant, condiments on the table, short plastic and wooden stools, it was very reminiscent of canteens in Hong Kong and China.
House special vermicelli 
Oh my beautiful zingy garlicky vinegary salad of thinly sliced cucumbers, carrots, coriander, vermicelli and the novelty of frankfurters too. It was so refreshing, loved the crunchy texture and marinated perfectly. The frankfurters actually worked well adding some meaty sweetest to the dish, to balance out the sourness.
Chicken sour spicy la-mian noodles. 
I didn't expect the broth to be so umami and flavoursome. It had depth and a nice balance sourness as well as a good punch of spice from the chilli without being numbing. The noodles was full of bounce and generous, made long so it provided a really satisfying bite. The wood ear fungus gave a crunch to it and this was contrasted with the softer tofu. The chicken was a bit dry but that was the only compliant I have
Stewed beef Dao Xiao Mian (chopped noodles) in soup. 
The broth was delicious and complex, once again full of flavour and depth. Sadly the noodles weren't as satisfying for me being short and doughy. It felt I spent more time chewing on the noodles than the enjoying the broth with it. Next time I might have it with the La Mian as the beef was spot on being incredibly tender and fragrant, with strong notes of the sweet soy braising marinating sauce. Nice addition of pak choi for a refreshing green taste and crunch.
Steamed pork and chive dumplings 
These were poorly made. The dough was too thick and chewy masking all the flavours of the meatball and the broth inside it. The meatball itself was nice and sweet, well marinated and juicy.
Fish ball BBQ skewer and lamb BBQ skewer 
These were lovely and fragrant. It had a nice kick to it from the spice. The lamb was meaty and lean which was nice compared to all the fatty ones we've had. Fish balls were soft and bouncy with good umami flavours. It was great not to have a minimum order on them too like most places that sell skewers.
Chive and egg pie
This was very moreish. I love the doughy thin pastry, pan fried for a little bit of crisp around the edges. It was a bit greasy too but that kept it moist. Inside was a delicious filling of peppery chives mixed with silky eggs.
I left so satisfied with Lanzhou Noodle Bar. For just £6.50 for each of the noodle soups it makes me question why a simple miso ramen can cost double that. It's cool how you can see the noodles made in the open preparation kitchen by the chef and the skilled involved. Menu is actually quite extensive covering mostly northern Chinese food so if you're hungry you can always add it along to your noodle as a side like what we did. Looks like I will be back soon.",1
4,"Everywhere I go, I like to visit the Chinese district or Chinatowns as its sometimes called. Most places in London are HK cuisines, with a sprinkling of northern Chinese cuisines. Lanzhou falls squarely in mainland/northern chinese cuisine. It's hand pulled noodles are freshly made and the sauce is super yum. There are all kinds of choices for everyone. I was excited to see that they served garlic and pepper marinated cucumbers, which is my favorite appetizer of all time. They don't serve water which is fine if you're getting a soup with noodles. 
The restaurant is cramped, yes, but it feels pretty authentic that way. The crampness reminded me of many of the street restaurants I have been to in Asia and honestly, whenever I am in Asia, I prefer street food over fancy restaurants because it tastes way better. Lanzhou is also one of the rare places that take card (yay!).",1
1,"This place is far far far from acceptable...Food is bad, service is worse, toilet is awful...got nothing good to say about it...",-1
4,"I'm still not sure how we ended up eating here on a Sunday afternoon, but what I will say is that I was actually really impressed with the noodles that this place offers. They are made fresh  and super tasty (that's only if you are planning to be seated with a menu + order from the left side of the noodle menu). 
For a brief moment sitting outside at the only table on the pavement and with one of  the chefs munching away on is own dinner next to us, I felt as if we could have been in Beijing. 
This noodle bar is right opposite Leister Square station, so not the most atmospheric place in the world, but definitely worth the experience.",1
2,"Hectic place and rude service. 
The noodles are not bad but the flavor is way off from what you would get in China. Below expectation.",-1
1,"I wanted so badly to love this place as I had seen it show up on many lists for London's best cheap eats. 
Yes, it's cheap for ~6.90 for a bowl of noodles in Soho. 
Best? Far from it! The bowl is packed with so much MSG (flavour enhancers, you'll know it's jammed with the bad stuff after you go running to find a drink after dining here!), fatty cuts of meat (stewed beef is the recommendation and 80% of it is fat) and I counted one slither of bok choy (yes, one!). Most of the bowl is filled with broth that's way too oily to drink. The handcut noodles are impressive and lives up to the hype. If you're not a fan of MSG and really oily/fatty food, I'm afraid I couldn't recommend Lanzhou Noodle Bar. 
Service is inattentive and poor. The minute you put down your chopsticks, there's already a table standing next to you waiting for you to dash out ASAP. I understand that seat space is tiny and cramped, but it'd be nice not having to climb over bodies to exit the restaurant. 
You'd be better off paying an extra £5 and grabbing a bowl of ramen nearby. Can I suggest Kanada-Ya? They have rad ramen and it's a consistent five stars from me.",-1
4,Lovely noodles place with tailor hand made noodles..spicy sour soup with the variety of topping. Signature dish is beef stew noodles with spicy soup. Little restaurant with huge crowd of Chinese customers. If you like chinese ramen..this is the place you should visit.,1
4,"After a month of gallivanting around Europe, my cravings for Chinese food were at an all-time high. Found this place on Yelp and was super excited to finally get a taste of the homeland. This noodle joint is a tiny hole in the wall, super casual with cramped seating, but it wasn't anything I didn't already expect. 
My boyfriend and I ordered the stir fried hot and sour beef la mian (hand pulled noodles), as well as the pork sparerib dao xiao mian (hand cut noodles) in soup. Food came quickly within ten minutes and was super fresh. The hand pulled noodles were definitely the preferred style between the two as they were more al dente and retained a light bounce. I normally really like dao xiao mian, but I found that since they were in soup, they ended up getting overly doughy/overdone quicker than I anticipated. The pork sparerib was crisp and well executed, and the hot and sour beef had a nice level of acidity and spice. 
Overall, a quick cheap eat that hits the spot. Just bear in mind that it's definitely a no frills type of establishment.",1
3,"I'm still a fan of this place but the honeymoon period is over, sadly. The noodles are still fantastic and the service will always bring me back to the quality of service in China. 
I'm taking two star off of my original review because while the noodles are fresh and amazing, their other dishes are less desirable. I ordered the Mu-er cold dish as it's one of my favourite things to have in China. As I was digging into it, we saw not one, but 2 very long strands of hair. 
They were nice enough to make me a new one, but I was rather put off from the initial dish already and probably nothing could have actually made the situation better. 
In hindsight: Go for the noodles. Maybe try the lamb skewers. But stay away from the cold dishes.",-1
2,"The food was amazing but I don't care how good you are - you need to treat your customers with respect.
I was shouted at several times just for trying to get a picture of the noodle making. Then they told us off for not being finished even though we'd barely been there 10mins and were sitting uncomfortably at the bar, so not even prime real estate. 
Then they tried to add on a charge to pay by card without warning in advance so had to trek off to go get cash and come back. There's no warning of this charge also when you're queuing for a table - which is when you're most easily able to pop off to get some cash.
Yup, damn good noodles but somehow was left with a bitter taste in my mouth from the p**s poor service.",-1
5,"Overall Score: 5
Service/Ambiance Rating: 4
Food Rating: 5
Tip: They accept credit card! (Unlike what the Yelp page says)
Being Asian, I always find it nostalgic to eat Asian cuisine while I'm on holiday; the cheaper the better too. 
There's a huge array of food at this spot and, being a lover of noodles, there wasn't enough space in my stomach for all the dishes I had my eyes on. 
P.S. I actually went here twice during my stay and the beef noodle soup wasn't as good as the ground beef noodle (G19, if I remember correctly) but I have lower standards when it comes to cheap, Asian food.",1
4,"Freaking delicious noodles!!! I got the sour and spicy chicken and shrimp noodles, and the flavor was amazing. No MSG either because I drank most of the soup and didn't feel terribly thirsty after. 4 stars because the service left something to be desired.",1
5,Another cheap yummy noodle place. I got the spiced beef ma mian (thin yellow noodle) for $7.5. Flavorful and hearty for especially the winter. Service was good and efficient.,1
1,"I just moved to London and was craving some good Chinese food. Initially I was really excited to have found this place but the customer service has always been awful. I thought I could just deal with it because the food is decent but yesterday was a new low.
My flatmate and I both ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup. The only difference is that she wanted the thin noodles and I wanted the thicker noodles. We also ordered pig ears with cucumber and some fried dumplings. When they brought the noodles my flatmate's order was correct but mine was wrong. Instead of a noodle soup they gave me greasy fried noodles. I wasn't upset at all, I used to work as a waitress and I totally understand that mistakes can be made. I informed the waitress that it wasn't what I had ordered. She started yelling the name of the order at me and insisted it was what I ordered. She eventually took the plate of noodles and carried it around the restaurant looking for the waitress I had ordered with. In a bit the waitress who brought my noodles and the waitress who I ordered with came to speak to me together and insisted that I had ordered the fried noodles. I told them over and over again I had ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup, not fried noodles. I'd eaten at this restaurant at least 5 times at this point and I always order the same thing so I know I didn't order incorrectly. At this point they started to yell and roll their eyes at me. When they turned around and started going up the stairs the waitress I ordered with began to talk badly about me and scream profanities in Chinese as she walked up the stairs. I don't think she realized I speak Chinese because I have a perfect American accent. 
At this point my flatmate and I were kind of upset that she had rudely screamed about me in another language just 2 feet away from our table. I was debating whether or not to leave or go but I really didn't want to start any drama so I decided to wait and see if she would bring me the correct order. She came back really quickly (maybe 2 minutes tops) with a bowl of noodle soup. I was so relieved when I first saw it because I thought the drama would be over. When I looked down I was really confused because the broth was extremely dark and the noodles were brown as well. I realized that what the restaurant had done was pour hot water over the fried noodles to make it into ""noodle soup."" It was really gross. I turned to her and asked her if they had just poured hot water over the fried noodles. She looked at me and said no that's just beef broth. Beef broth is not that dark. I pointed to my flatmate's bowl (which is the same exact order as mine) and I said that her broth was clear. I also said I had eaten here many times before and I know what the soup and noodles are supposed to look like. She continued to lie to me and insisted that they had used beef broth for my soup and that's why it was a darker color. At this point I realized arguing was futile. I told her my flatmate and I were going to leave but I would still pay for her soup and the appetizer we ordered (even though we had barely touched them.) When we got to the cashier he didn't charge us for my soup but he tried to charge us for the dumplings that we never received. I didn't even really care about the money, I was just upset with the consistent lies and scheming. I told him we had never received them and asked him to take it off the bill. He eventually did after arguing with us and the total for food we barely touched was 18£. I paid that and even tipped too.
The food in this restaurant is decent but the service is not. The lack of honesty and integrity in the dining staff is very disturbing. They were willing to feed me anything just to save some money and to avoid correcting their mistake.",-1
2,"A small hole in the wall Chinese restaurant serving up handmade noodles! I stopped by after class with a friend and shared a sliced beef la mian, spring rolls, and fried pork and chive dumplings. The noodles were delicious as everyone else have pointed out, though I feel they skimp on the toppings. Put some of the spicy sauce in it and elevate the soup to another level! My friend loved the spring rolls and I loved the dumplings. They reminded me of home, with a thicker, homemade skin holding a juicy pork and chive filling. 
The reason for the low rating is for their service. The servers never had a smile on our face and all faced the door instead of at the customers inside the restaurant, making it quite difficult to catch their attention for anything. There was also one server that was picking at his ear very intently for about 5 minutes which makes me question the cleanliness of this place haha. Definitely doing takeaway next time!",-1
4,Yummy! Fresh made noodle soup is the best! The rice plates are comforting but not great.  Asian food is comfort food! The place is small so best to take away.,1
4,"It's not the most comfortable, or easiest to figure out, but if you're a bit prepared and feeling brave, the Noodle Bar is a good choice for a cheap, tasty dinner!
We each had the fried noodles, thick ones. I had char siu and my husband had the sliced beef. Mine had a lovely flavour but was a bit fatty. The beef though was really tender and tasty.
Sure, there was probably too much noodle for the amount of meat/veg, but neither of us could finish it anyway! The noodles had a nice bite and flavour. I really liked the dumplings we had on the side.
I was a bit put off by the hygiene rating, but with the location in central London next to a tube station, it's not a surprise, really, that they had a rodent problem. I assume it was all sorted since they were reopened, and I didn't notice anything disgusting, or get sick, so, a win!
There's no phone reception at all if you sit in the basement.",1
5,"A little late on the check in and review but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that this was one of my most memorable meals in London. The mixed beef was the thick wavy noodles was the greatest. Only wish I had enough room to try the cut noodles too (I ordered ""wrong"" but it was still phenomenal)
Also this is a divey hole in the wall and the staff will not offer much hospitality. You're welcome to come and eat what you like and they will offer little guidance. You'll have to deal with it and enjoy the crap out of the food. 
Ps My spring roll looked boring and average but how the heck was it so great? Fresh out of the fryer...that's how
Pps make sure you try some of the spicy sauce with the fried garlic
Ppps when you think you're too full...drizzle some of the black vinegar (you'll think it's soy sauce but it's not) onto whatever you're eating.  That should cut the fat just enough and if you like vinegar like me, it just takes you to another world of flavors.",1
5,"Easily the best value of food I've found in the area and the noodle soup is stunning with enormous portions. 
The menu is overwhelming, but just get a noodle soup, preferably one with a star next to it on the menu, this denotes their specialties. They are also very happy to explain the whole menu when asked.
I get the dao xiao mian stewed beef soup and it's enough for two meals. Incredibly fragrant with freshly handcut noodles.
Yes, as some other reviews mention, you'll likely be jammed at a table next to strangers. But it's part of the charm and sometimes you can have a nice conversation. And with most meals around 8 pounds and no service charge, I can't complain about the tight quarters.",1
5,"Anyone from China missing the taste of home? 
Lo & Behold ... Noodle Bar. 
From the outside it looks like a place to avoid - it has food on display that looks cheap and stuck in a microwave ready to eat, but if you actually pop your head in they have a series of Chinese mainland chefs (I am not sure where - next time I have to ask) whipping out the dough for the noodles, and my god the beef noodle soup is so so good! 
Particularly if you are out on a cold winters day and looking for something filling. There are good side dishes too if you are interested. I would name them but I feel I only know the Chinese names so it might not be helpful",1
5,"The place is very small but super friendly service. Party of 9 got to have a whole table to ourselves instead share with strangers. Total 3 small tables inside or two. We ordered beef and pork noodles and two order of dumplings and fried rice. Everything tastes great. Dumplings did take a long time to come., Other than that everything was great.",1
5,"Very quickly, big and super flavored portions, I ate the steamed meat noodle soup. My friend ate a noodle with fried chicken and mushroom, super taste too.",1
5,"Hand pulled noodles? I had to try once. Even if it meant ruining my michael kor sneakers and my new leather bag in the pouring rain with a too small umbrella that ended up breaking lol. 
This place was so hard to find (even though it was right in front of the subway exist -_-, hey, cut me some slack, i had no internet service so no directions! not even an address, just the name of the restaurant lol). Why is this place not in Chinatown? I assumed it was in chinatown but apparently not. 
Okay so the front of the restaurant are for those uneducated americans who like americanized chinese food or those that actually know its americanized chinese food and still like it. Then in the back is the authentic where the noodles are made. They were pretty good, good enough where i ate them twice while i was in london. It was cheap, cash only i think (if i remember correctly) ....but they can't compare to the price and noodles you can get in taiwan. But still pretty darn good. My one problem is i hate sharing tables, and here, you have to share tables -_- ugh, i know its traditional chinese style but no, just no lol. Oh, and the staff do speak english and mandarin. 
Overall, if your chinese, go for the taiwanese noodle, they are def worth getting. Not quite as cheap or as flavorful as in taiwan, but still pretty darn good. I def will be back.",1
3,"Pros: 
Serves decent La Mian (pulled Noodles). Should try the Dan Dan Mian (peanut sauce noodles) and the signature spicy noodles. If you fancy something light, try the Duck La Mian noodles :)
Good quick meal place. 
Cons:
Place is really small. Not advisable for large groups
Price: Friendly",-1
2,"I'm surprised by the overwhelming number of positive reviews because I find the food average at best. 
I ordered their duck noodle soup and it was disappointing, really. The noodle soup lacks flavor and for £7.90 there's only five pieces of duck and most of the portions are more bones than meat. 
Nothing special about the place, the food, or the service. 
I would not recommend and will not be going back.",-1
5,"First thing's first. This place is worth going to. 
No matter what anyone says, it holds the potential for GIANT platters of tender and chewy and perfect perfect perfect noodles prepared in all the ways you could possibly want them to be prepared. It is damn good. 
It is, however, imperfect. 
For starters, it would be quite easy to mistake this place for your average cheap Chinese takeout place, order some pre-prepared sesame chicken and be on your way. 
Do not let the giant piles of pre-made greasy late-night food, distract you. 
YOU ARE HERE FOR THE NOODLES. 
I would highly recommend the stewed beef noodle soup. 
Or, the stewed beef noodles in any way it is offered. 
They are so expert and perfectly prepared, my mouth is watering thinking about them. 
Be warned, this place is intense. 
It is perma-crowded and filled with locals and tourists alike. 
Be prepared to elbow your way in and push to be seated and allowed to stay in your seat. 
My friend was here a few weeks ago and didn't eat as quickly as her companions. They were asked to sit outside while waiting for my friend to finish. They, of course, refused and everything was fine, but this place is not for the meek.
If you know what to order and aren't intimidated by the giant crowd and unfriendly waitstaff, this is the place for cheap and authentic DELICIOUS noodles.",1
4,"I saw this place from the instagram as rated to be a decent cheap place to eat. I walked in around 10 am. as early the restaurant is open and ordered Sliced Beef La Mien Noodle. The food is cheap, delicious, and there's a plenty of other lunch choices to choose. Good one.",1
5,"This place has legit noodles, and they keep it going late too.  I stopped here after midnight after consuming a number of pints of beer, I was surprised that it was pretty empty.  They took my order of beef noodle soup and by the time I came up from the WC it was ready for me.  The noodles were fresh, the soup was well balanced, the beef was nicely done, but you would expect the signature noodle to be on point from a place called the noodle bar.
I was really surprised that the lamb skewers came out amazing, the lamb was seasoned very well, good amount of cumin to pretty out the lambyness.  I have walked by this place before and after and there is always a line here.  But a line of Chinese people all the time means this place is legit.",1
5,"This place is fantastic! Noodles were freshly made, prices reasonable, and service was fast. I am so glad we found this place; I'm pretty picky when it comes to noodles, and this spot completed exceeded my London Chinese expectations.
Don't expect to be coddled or catered to; this is a quick turnover spot with brisk service. (Honestly, at a Chinese place, that's a sign of authenticity.)",1
5,"The food is one hundred percent authentic and just soooooo good! The waitresses can't even speak proper English, that's how Chinese the restaurant is. All the noodles are handmade and taste like heaven. It's the best dinner I had in a long time - would recommend it to anyone!",1
5,Legit hand pulled noodles. You can't get this anywhere else! The lamb skewers are also v good. Only downside is it's cash only.,1
4,"Very authentic Chinese, only problem I had was that the menu is quite having an English mother tongue, but food was delicious!",1
5,"The noodles are hand-pulled in front of your eyes, and they are so very delicious. The meat in your noodle soup isn't going to be a eye-opener, but the noodles really make up for it. The soupy pork dumplings are great, too!
This is the best drunken food place - they're open until 5am on Saturday nights, for god's sake!",1
4,No frills noodle bar in the heart of Leicester Square. It's right outside the tube station entrance. Its a very casual place. The dining room is not huge. Expect to share a table with strangers or sit at the bar table staring at the wall. The service was decent. Most of the servers speak Mandarin. The server kept speaking to me in Mandarin even though I kept telling him I didn't speak Mandarin and didn't understand a word he was saying. I had to point to get my order in. I had the roast duck noodle soup and salt & pepper shrimp. Both were excellent. They make the noodles fresh and by hand right on the spot. I would go back.,1
4,"it looks like a cheap Chinese take-out joint from the window with the kitchen up front and piles of pre-prepared noodles and fried meats.  BUT, don't let looks be deceiving.  It's not fine food, for sure, but it is far more than a cheap takeaway.  Check out the menu on the left as you walk in, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  They have a plethora of fantastic Cantonese favourites made-to-order, and you can fill up for next to nothing at all on foods that aren't even pre-prepared or even fried!
If you're a tourist in the area or just walk by this storefront all the time with pre-commissioned thoughts on the place, give this a shot just once and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
The tables turn over fast, so don't fear a wait.",1
3,"I thought this place was fine.  I love Chinese food and thought I would love this place based on the reviews.  I had the fried noodles with seafood, and it was a little on the bland side.  I was somewhat disappointed because I'd walked a mile in the rain to get there!  In any event, it was ok and felt relatively authentic, but not even close to the best Chinese food that I've had.  On the positive side, the noodles were fresh and had a good texture.",-1
4,Sliced beef noodle soup and stewed beef noodle soup are just delish! I still think of this little hole in the wall place.,1
4,"The ultimate hole in the wall. From the outside this place looks dingy, to say the least. On top of that, it is located right by Leicester Square Station and so ordinarily I wouldn't even think about entering an establishment here; most of them are tailored to tourists. And in fact, the first look at Noodle Bar confirmed my worst nightmares: brightly-coloured sweet & sour chicken in the counter and other shiny dishes that many people think if as the epitome of Chinese cuisine. 
However, for a while now I had followed the reviews on this place and I was especially enticed when ""Asian-food experts"" such as Yee Gan, Rob H, Katie B and Rachel Z gave this place such good ratings. By coincidence I ran into Rachel Z an hour before our visit at Noodle Bar and she was so kind to write down (in Chinese characters) the things that we should order. And that made everything so easy!
When we got to the place the waiter led us downstairs and all of the sudden we were transported away from touristy Leicester Square into what could easily be a noodle bar in Hong Kong or Shanghai; not the least to judge by the fact that we were the only white folks. Having said that, don't expect anything glamorous. People come here to eat and not to socialise. They go about their business and leave. And that's exactly how the waiting staff treated us and there's as well. No kind smile, no niceties or pleasantries exchanged - only boom bang here's your food. Luckily we had the written instructions from Rachel Z (see picture uploaded) and so at least the ordering was done in a breeze. 
What we got was the following: one order of very garlicky marinates cucumber as a starter (delicious) and each of us then had a variation of the noodle soup: 1) had-pulled noodles with cooked beef, 2) sliced noodles with cooked beef & 3) sliced noodles with stewed beef belly. Next time I will go for the hand-pulled noodles with the stewed beef belly. 
All in all it was a great treat. I loved the whole experience and the food was very good as well. Will definitely be back!
PS: Go easy on the chili oil that's offered as a condiment on the side. It's quite potent!",1
5,"So happy to eat at this place again.
I honestly love the noodle soup here 100 times more than any Japanese ramen place I tried (and waited 2 hours for). Ramen is so out, time to discover la mian folks!",1
2,After seeing it had good reviews we decided to check it out for some late night snacks. This was so much worse than Panda Express. I feel sick to my stomach this was so gross. Don't come here,-1
5,Dan-dan? More like dan-dank!! I would go back to London just for a bowl of these hot stretched noodles. Place is a little small but food is fast and they stay open late so definitely worth it. Oh and the menu is not English so just get the dan-dan soup and pan fried dumplings and be sure to use that dank ass spicy chili bean oil on there. (Soup contains peanuts),1
3,"The Vegetable Pork Wanton La Mien was very good. The noodles were freshly cut, and the texture was nice and chewy. The wantons were mediocre. My family and I were seated in the basement, which was very cramped. The walls were painted yellow, and it wasn't a pleasant environment. A waiter and waitress rudely treated another woman who was about to eat there but decided to leave due to the poor customer service.",-1
5,"I ordered take away from this restaurant and if you are looking for inexpensive, authentic northern, western and Cantonese Chinese cuisine in this touristy area then look no further! I ordered so much and they were delicious! I had cumin lambs on a skewer, the freshness is insane and the flavor will take you on a day dream trip to western China! Their Lanzhou noodles, however was not my favorite, but it's not their fault because Lanzhou noodles are very salty in general and I never really liked them. Make sure to order from the pictures on their wall- not their menu because the items on the wall have no English but they are much more authentic and much better bang for your buck!",1
5,"This bowl of noodles was just what I needed after a long day of walking around town. They stretch the noodles right in front of you!! so you know it's fresh, not to mention delicious.
Huge plus: right outside the tube stop, and great price for such a large serving!",1
5,"Visiting London for the first time, and having English food all week, it was time to eat some authentic Chinese noodles.  Lanzhou Noodle Bar is as authentic as it gets.  You are greeted (more like reeled in), given a seat (sharing only pls., if you want to stay in the ground floor) and given a menu and some hot tea.  On the way in, I noticed the chef/cook making hand made noodles.  Right there, I knew we were in the right place.  I ordered the Beef Noodle (regular. like spaghetti) and my wife ordered the Roast Duck noodle.  And for good measure, a Pork Rice topping of some sort.  Well, after the noodles, we didn't have space for the rice and pork, so take away we did. Now on to the noodles, they were aldente, you can feel the gluten break as you chew on the noodles, the broth/soup was seasoned just right (I dont do spicy but, heck if you need spice, they have the real spicy oil -'La yiou', sprinkle to your hearts delight!).  And much as it wouldn't be anything special in China or most parts of Asia, it was extremely special in London, where it hit the spot and all my weary muscles were soothed away.",1
4,"Probably one of my favorite food stop so far! Lanzhou Noodle Bar Is a tiny little Chinese restaurant tucked away on the outskirts of china town and is across from the Angus steak restaurant, If you're in town STOP BY! Just keep an eye out for the restaurant with bold orange letters that says noodle bar. ( I spent over 40 mins looking for a place that said ""Lanzhou"" but it was in Chinese -_-) Noodles made right in front of you BY ORDER. And my God is the broth flavorful. It's a little hectic and cramped but it's definitely worth it!",1
3,"Being in London, I just had to have a meal in Chinatown. I've been living in Copenhagen for 4 months and have been craving a hot bowl of soup noodles. It was too easily accessible in New York City. For about 6-7 pounds, you get a huge portion of hand pulled noodles and a topping. if you want an extra topping, it was an extra pound. (no pun intended) It was quite chilly the day I was there so this bowl of noodles was excellent.
** I asked if the door could be closed because it was cold, and the lady said ""no because we are cooking"" Well then... 
Anyways, back to my noodles. I doused it with 2 spoons of chili (my favorite) and it was delicious! I ordered the wonton noodles with an extra topping of vegetables. Perfect combination in my opinion. My friend had the char siu with beef. She didn't think it was good, the char siu wasn't tender and was lacking flavour and the beef tasted old as if it was not eaten for a while and left sitting. 
You get 3 stars for the great portion size, for satisfying my chinese food craving and for having a clean bathroom (well it was clean when I went).",-1
5,"There was no hype or social provoking on Twitter that urged me to to try this place. Just seeing a steady flow of satiated customers going in and out every time I went for my predictable Pret nearby, was satisfaction enough.
For tourists it must be a such a tough case of pot luck when picking your Peking delights if you don't know where to go or what to order when you get there. 
Panic not and pick a winner. 
You don't have to settle for lousy, if you settle down in Lanzhou. 
You'll be served promptly and if you have to queue when you arrive, you can order whilst you wait outside. What indeed awaits inside are big fat flat noodles that slap and splash you in the chops with hot broth as you slurp from the wide rimmed bowl bringing comfort nourishment that is utterly reviving. Man alive, these noodles are good.
It's always packed with students, young families and local office workers, loud old ladies on old lady dates cackling away around you. It's a vibrant place; it has the feel of a 'caff' like-cafe but with chopsticks. There is black vinegar in ketchup bottles. They even serve green tea in Styrofoam cups to add to that effect. 
I normally shy away from eateries in Chinatown who's preprepared foods lay out displayed in rows of bain maries; tedious steaming trays of sweet-and-sour chicken or irk inducing oily chow mein. That's totally fine if you like the Anglicised version of things, but behind the off-putting buffet in the window is the theatre of hand pulled noodles being stretched out, thwacked and spun with pure skill. 
So if you're stretched for time, either at lunch or pre-show; show up here, grab a bowl of something hot fresh and delicious and be on your way. 
They'll be glad to have you out quickly. Have you not seen the queue forming outside?",1
3,"Huge Portion and one of more economical options in Central London! Especially if you had enough of dry bread and craving hot soupy noodles in the cold season. 
Food - 3/5
Decor - 2/5 
Service - 3/5
Value - 4/5
Space - 3/5
Their noodle bowl is huge for 7 pounds! You will not need to order anything else. However, although it is flavorful, it is definitely on the salty side. What I noticed is in general the food in London is much saltier than say NYC or Boston. The noodle itself has pretty good texture (chewy and just-right).The interior / decor is mediocre at best but the store is nice and warm in the winter next to a few boiling pots where the chefs are kneading dough which then turns into strands of noodles after twisting here and there (like magic) and cooking them next to you behind the clear half-height plastic wall. I'd skipped the unpopular / small plates on the menu because they are most likely left in the fridge for far too long and tasted bland. 
Service fee is waived as there is no water or any other accommodation besides bringing the noodle out to us. We offered to tip anyways but they refused to take money without providing the standard service.",-1
1,one of the worst noodle dishes I have ever eaten!! tastes like rubber honestly I don't recommend eating chinese food in this area. I guess in the UK theres no exposure to quality food but yeah...gross af,-1
5,"SO GOOD!
I've always loved noodles, and I get especially excited when I go to restaurants where they hand make their noodles. At Lanzhou Noodle Bar, you can see them tossing and hand pulling their noodles, which is both 1) a sign of quality, and 2) endlessly amusing.
It was pretty cold when I was in London, and their beef noodle soup absolutely hit the spot. It was tasty, delicious, filling, well-priced, and reminded me of home. :)
Seating is not so great--I sat at a long, slim table against a wall beside a friend and a stranger, but I still really enjoyed the meal. Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a great, quick lunch in London!",1
4,"This place is authentic to the core. Except the location. It would make more sense if it was in China Town, but I'm not complaining.
My wife and I showed up to the tiny storefront and it was pretty crowded. They said they had a table for two downstairs, so we walked by the guy making the noodles (super cool) and down into the basement.
There were no empty tables. But there was a table for 4 with only three people it. They grabbed a stool, sat it next to the table, and told us that was where we were going to sit. Cool! And kind of crazy--the other people at our table only spoke Chinese. But that was actually kind of nice because then my wife and I could talk and feel like it was our own private conversation still.
We ordered some fried noodles ( I don't remember how to smell the name). It was 7.50 pound each, which was reasonable. The food came out fast, and was really good. There was some chili sauce at each table which was tasty, and all in all it was a really fun experience with really good food. I'd go back.",1
4,"This place is 4 stars for these reasons:
1. Open really late
2. Very cheap
3. Very fast service
4. Huge portions - couldn't finish half my bowl
5. The noodles are super fresh and soft
This place is not 5 stars for these reasons:
1. They were out of the duck which was what I was looking forward to
2. The wontons were okay, overall should've had another meat in my soup
3. Hard to understand and didn't understand my questions
4. Tiny place - has only 3 tables, which are communal
All in all, I would definitely come back to this place (but early enough so they don't run out of duck). The patrons are super friendly and some even say they travel far and wide just for these noodles! Must try!",1
3,"I wanted to eat a big hot noodle soup and choose this noodle bar. But when I entered I was proposed the ""meal deal"" : 5£ for 2 choices of meat + noodles or rice.
So that's what I took. And don't get me wrong, it was a very generous portion ! But the flavours were too intense and it was overwhelming. 
Later I saw a girl eating a big bowl of noodle soup : Damn I should have stick to my plan.
Next time ?
Oh, and the place is really small, so go there for a quick lunch or take away.",-1
4,"Mixed feelings about this place. 
Service: Got a takeaway, but the guy at the door was pretty good at telling us which dish to order and we could order through him, then pay at the till. He spoke Mandarin to me, spoke Mandarin back to him. All fine and dandy.
Disgusting fact: No wonder they were shut down by health authorities in 2014. They had a mice infestation. But just today while I waited for my takeaway outside the door, I saw the chef start cooking squid. He had a huge tub of it (like those washing tubs) and he dropped some on the floor. Yes you guessed it, he picked it up from the floor and threw it into the wok.
Taste: Yes, their noodles are made fresh. Yes their broth is really good with lots of flavour. I ordered the beef brisket (most people on yelp seems to have done that) as it was recommended by the guy at the door and I though there was a lot of noodles, there was enough beef that I was happy. They only gave me 2 pieces of veg though and I really wanted more of that.
Price: £6.50 for beef brisket hand pulled noodles. Not bad for the price. I was confused why so many people think this is cheap though. This is pretty standard price for China Town lunch meals.",1
5,"Amazing food and service. I ordered the Sliced Pork Noodle Soup for takeout. Didn't have to wait too long, but during the wait, it was great watching the hand drawn noodles get made. I will definitely be coming back and eating in the restaurant next time. Even though I had takeout, the noodle soup was still delicious when I got home half an hour later and combined the soup with the dry ingredients.",1
1,"A few months ago when I was here late a night I saw a mouse. Then this week it's been closed with a hygiene emergency notice to say there is a serious mice infestation and dirty conditions with poor structural repair resulting in a very high risk of food contamination. 
They had moved the buffet display that is at the front window and there was what looked like piles of mouse poo. So disgusting. 
I was going to complain about the plates because they had chips on them (very unhygienic) but this really tops it.
I would really recommend not eating here, they do not care about the safety of customers.",-1
5,"Excellent and very, very quickly served bowl of soup noodle.
Companion and I came at 7:00 on a Monday, and the place was pretty full with the dinner rush. They seated us with two other parties of two at a table in the very back, and within about 10 minutes of butt-to-chair we had our food. 
Service Note: The lady who took our order seemed very good-natured, if rather curt. 
But the noodles! I had the Roasted Duck Soup Noodle and it was excellent! The broth was super flavorful, obviously made from scratch, and had just enough of a white pepper kick to feel really authentic. Also, super super plus for me was that the broth wasn't too sweet. I can't always handle that note in Cantonese soups, but this broth was managed to pull it off beautifully. 
The one bad thing was that there were only about four pieces of duck topping, but I guess that's about as much as 6 pounds will get me.",1
3,"Actually having been to Lanzhou, I am VERY picky about their noodles, cause I've had some of the best and some of the worst. This place was actually recommended by my father, for he heard about it through its reputation.
In actuality, I found it to be just mediocre. Granted I got takeaway, and I don't think that I got the full experience in that form. The broth that came with the noodles didn't resemble the exact flavor of the broth in Lanzhou, but that could probably be attributed to the differences in water. The noodles themselves were fine and the beef that I got with it was tasty as well. 
There were some elements missing, such as radishes, that I usually saw in Lanzhou noodles, so that was slightly disappointing. 
Next time, I'll make sure to dine in, so that I can get it in a bowl. No more excuses then!",-1
5,"GBP 6.90 for a wonderfully huge noodle dish with duck.  Super nice staff.  Lots of locals eating there - must be authentic.  Super fast.  The noodle soup was very flavorful.  Drool.
When I was looking for this place (thanks to Yelp), I almost missed it.  It doesn't say ""Lanzhou Noodle Bar"" anywhere (that I could find).  It does say ""Noodle Bar"" or something like that, and it's next to a souvenir shop.
I went at 3pm and there was no queue and enough seating.  Very cozy spot.",1
4,"So I came here based purely on the Yelp reviews - and I was not disappointed. Not being Asian, it's slightly daunting to enter a restaurant like this. For starters, the sign above the door is in Chinese (I presume!) and just says Noodle Bar in English. So we walked past it on the other side of the street to start with. Then to say that we stand out once inside is an understatement!
That being said, with Yelp on our side, we were confident that we were in for some good eats. We avoided the offer of the buffet and opted for the hand pulled noodles instead. There were no seats upstairs so we went downstairs, and we moved around to our own table eventually. 
We both ordered fried noodles, one plate of char-siu pork and one sliced beef. In the end, we couldn't work out what was better. We also got a side of pork and chive fried dumplings (we went for everything fried - it was blue Monday after all). These were also really good - and you get a crazy large portion for £5. In the end though, we couldn't finish any of the plates of food despite it all being delicious.
A great ""hidden"" place that we would never have visited without Yelp, and now I feel like I had some proper Chinese food for once. Great stuff. So two massive plates of fried noodles, two cokes and a portion of dumplings came to just under £22, a real bargain for the area.",1
4,"I was shocked to find this handmade noodle bar hidden away behind the touristy exterior of precooked Chinese dishes. Don't be scared! Go in, get a seat (if you can) and just order the noodles. 
What size, shape, flavour etc doesn't really matter, but I'd be pretty happy to take on any combination of what they have on offer and walk out paying full price for it. You can see the noodles being hand made, and the service is quick and food tasty. 
Better than your average plate of noodles in Chinatown for sure, but given how crowded the restaurant gets and how variable the service is (par for the course in Chinatown), 4 stars overall!",1
5,"Found this place online, and all my friends were obsessed with it. We went here many times - food is cheap, quick, and good. Plus, where else can you find good food in London late at night? It gets pretty crowded, and definitely would recommend their stewed beef la mian or dao xiao mian. They make the noodles right in front of your eyes, and have great business.",1
5,"I was surprised to find this place just off Leicester Square, especially considering the disappointment of my first encounter with Chinatown. Heaps of delighted tourists loading up plates with gooey orange meats at the all-you-can-eat isn't quite what I'm looking for.
Glad I checked Yelp and popped into this little noodle shop (err, bar?). There is indeed a final station of hot counter food to ensnare you, but walk on by that and be astounded by the noodle soups they do at the benches in the back.
I noticed all the other Chinese folks were getting the knife-cut noodles with slow cooked beef, so I knew I couldn't go wrong. Watched the chef slice and dice 'em up fresh, and after a few dollops of the chili sauce, the steaming bowl of noodles was perfect. Big chunks of meltingly soft beef with a hint of tendon, and the broth itself isn't just a faceslam of MSG.
A meal on the heavier side, but great to warm you up! Definitely coming back, and the prices are reasonable (around £6 for everything).",1
5,"This place is unbeatable for the price. Delicious hand-pulled noodles for £6.50. I always try and come here when I'm in central London. The noodle soup is particularly good. Hands down the best Chinese-style noodles in central London. 
Generous portions, efficient service, and you can watch them making the noodles if you sit at the front. 
Pro tip: Only bother with the noodles and dumplings. Everything else on the menu is pretty average. But why would you come here for anything else?",1
4,"In a very heavy tourist area of Leicester  square / convent garden so thought it would be overrated and a tourist spot. BUT it's not! 
We had the  bbq pork noodle soup and it was amazing. The noddles are hand made at the front of the shop and placed in the soup just before serving. The broth was unreal and the bbq was ok but the rest made this dish.
It's a hole in the wall and cheap as chips but great fresh quality.
Be aware it's tiny so try not to go in large groups!",1
5,"My love affair with Noodle Bar began last September when I stumbled in here to remedy my cold. (I always get sick in London).
And oh my god, it was love at first sight. And I'm shocked because Noodle Bar is a hole-in-the-wall on one of the most touristy, high-traffic areas in Leicester Square...which is the last place you'd expect cheap, authentic Chinese soup.
As soon as you walk in, you're rushed to a communal table in the back. The air is filled with the clanging of pots and the slapping of dough against the counter as the noodles are made fresh. Within minutes, you are face-to-face with a piping hot bowl of deliciousness.
I always get the La Mian noodle soup - either beef or bbq chicken. Add a little red chili sauce and vinegar = PERFECTION. The steamed pork dumplings also rival ones I've had in Chinatown SF. 
Whenever I'm in London, I come here at least once a week. I'm usually one of the few non-Asian peeps up in here, which is always a good sign that a place is truly authentic.
I miss you Noodle Bar!",1
2,"My wife and I went here because we had discovered Asian Twist Delicious was closed, but we still wanted Asian food. Overall, I wasn't impressed. 
Pros:
* Service. The staff were pretty friendly, they found us a seat immediately, they didn't rush us, etc. 
* Location. Very convenient to the tube. 
* Food preparation. Was served fresh, came out steaming. (They did make the noodles fresh, as advertised.)
Cons:
* Taste. I hate saying this since the good had tons if oil, and yet it lacked dimension. I shouldn't have to add black vinegar and chili to make the dish interesting. 
* Gyp-factor. Want water? That'll be bottled, and it'll add £5 to your bill for two small bottles. And you will need it because the place is hot, and the food is piping. 
Others may have had different experiences, but I don't think I'll be returning.",-1
3,"How do you rate a place that has such good food but such awful service? I just took the average here, but it really depends on which component you value more.
I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance to today for lunch. When I got there it was already pretty busy but there were still a few seats left at the counter (and maybe downstairs?) so I got seated there right away. Within a minute, the menu was thrown in front of me (yes, THROWN). They have a fairly extensive list of options but clearly their specialty is noodles so I went for the vegetable noodle soup. After ordering with a very curt waitress, I asked another if I could get a glass of tap water. I'm not sure if there was some sort of miscommunication or what, but she brought back a fork...And then when I asked for tap water again in Chinese (thinking there was some sort of language barrier) she just stared for a bit then turned and walked away...Huh? I know I'm not a native Chinese speaker, but I'm not THAT bad. So after my noodles came I flagged down another waitress and asked for tap water, and guess what I got as a response? ""Sorry, no tap water only bottle."" Wait, how is that possible? Maybe this is just me, but never before have I encountered a restaurant that didn't have tap water. At this point I was pretty whatever about my whole experience and just hoped that the noodles would be good - which they actually were. The noodles were fantastic and clearly homemade, and the soup base/vegetables were great too. Not salty at all and incredibly fresh! 
So overall, even though the food was good (and the value too - I paid 5 pounds flat for the vegetable noodle soup) I'm sad to say I will not be coming back. I value service a lot in a restaurant experience and this place was just ridiculous. Do NOT come here if you're looking for good service in addition to good food - this place doesn't provide both.",-1
4,"Very delicious hand pulled noodles in London's theatre area. For the price and the amount of work it takes to make the noodles, it is a steal. Their specialty is the beef soup or beef stew with noodles. You definitely have to try what they're known for. Try that, or some of their stir-fried noodles with duck. It is awesome. If you're having trouble, ask one of the wait staff. They're more than happy to walk you through their menu.
They have food in heating trays for take-away as well. I didn't try it as it didn't look all that appetizing.
It is important to note that if you eat in, it is communal style. You're seated in on tables with benches and may have to share with other patrons.",1
5,Perfect for a cold rainy day. My friend and I got the la Mian duck noodle soup and it was so good. It's so filling too. We split the sesame seed chicken and we couldn't even finish. The sesame seed chicken is sweet and delicious. Definitely some authentic Chinese food and you know it's real when they ask you how you want your noodles because they make it right at the spot for you. I recommend getting the thick noodles instead of the regular!,1
5,"The hand pulled noodles are too die for!!!!! The spicy soup is amazing along with the ramen noodles. My boyfriend and I each tried something different. All of the soups are cheap and the service is QUICK. My only irritation is that they have picnic tables and try and cram as many people at these tables, which is uncomfortable when it's family style. If you're craving asian food, this is definitely the spot to go :)",1
4,"The very definition of a hidden gem. OK, I may be a little bit of a food snob and had walked past this place multiple times on the basis that it's located in tourist central and secondly, they have trays of ready cooked takeaway Chinese food at the entrance to sell to passing tourists
So, it came as a surprise when London Yelpers who I respect raved about it. I triple checked that it was the same 'Noddle Bar' that I had walked past multiple times
However, they gave me the key to the secret kingdom here, which I'm going to share with you. The good stuff is in the back. So, you have to puff up your chest, look confident and stride past the trays of ready cooked food and either ask for a table in mandarin or point to the back in an assured manner. Then, they'll let you eat in
You'll have a menu thrust at you, which has a bewildering choice of dishes and on my first visit, an impatient waitress tapping her pad almost as soon as I had sat down. There are useful pictures on the walls and on the menu but perhaps, the biggest clue as to what to eat here is in the name of the restaurant - noodles!
Another clue comes from seeing the chefs at the open plan kitchen, hand pulling and hand carving fresh noodles in front of your eyes. These can be served in soup, fried or cooked probably in any way you wish and served with different meats or vegetables. I've enjoyed both soup and fried noodles, both for very reasonable prices.
The place is tiny and you'll have to share tables but to find fresh, authentic food in the heart of tourist central like this is a goldmine",1
3,"Edible, but definitely not a gem.
That was the final words from me and a friend of mine when we get to the door after eating here. Yes, you have the noodle man showing incredible skills, yes, it's almost cheaper than a beer, yes service is super fast, but it was nothing breathtaking.
They have a basement where you can seat, so do enter in the restaurant even if it seems full, they may have some seating inside (and either way, they will push out off the door somebody else!).
We ordered two different kind of noodles (at the end, we wanted to be sure the noodle man was working!) with two different protein, sliced beef and duck, both dishes were tasty, but they completely missed the wow factor, the thing that makes you say ""WOW, I just found a hidden gem!"", just boring chinese street food. The taste was the same as the noodles you can find on the roads in Shanghai, I mean yes I do get this is authentic and so on and so forth, but the dish per-se it's damn boring! I ate too much of those things in my past, and now I want something delicious, not just ordinary!
Do come here if you are on a budget as this is a very good place under 10 £, but it's not worth a travel here!",-1
3,"I ordered poorly. I should've looked around and just had what everyone else had. I unfortunately thought i'd be different and go my own way. BAD. I ordered the duck, which was GOOD but it came on top of dry noodles BAD. 
I can't wait to go again and get the soup that everyone looked so content to eat.",-1
5,"I've had great noodles before, but this makes almost every noodle joint I've been to seem pale in comparison. Amazing value considering the size and generous distribution of meat/seafood in the dish, consistently delicious and fast!
Try the seafood la mian soup for a taste explosion!",1
4,"This place turned out to be very good!  I'm glad we found this place!  As other posters stated, it is a ""hole in the wall"" place, so it's communal seating in a very small space.  Just be prepared to sit next to a stranger.  
But the noodles are hand-pulled and made fresh.  I order the spicy noodles with veggies and duck.  My husband ordered another spicy noodle dish, which was also delicious!  
Note to future diners: you're there for the noodles and not for excellent service. Not to say that the service was bad at all!  The service was on par with the establishment.  Let's just say we went in with the right expectations and left very satisfied with the surprisingly delicious meal we just had. 
I would go again whenever we are in London again!",1
4,"This place is small and very unimpressive to look at, but the noodles are awesome!  They're hand made on the premises and they are delicate and delicious.  The service is fast and efficient although it does feel rushed.  That's to be expected with the size of the place.  you sometimes have to share a table, but it's part of the atmosphere and doesn't get in the way of enjoying the food.  prices are very affordable especially for London.  I can't call out any one specific dish as I really like them all so much and I'm still working my way through the menu.  
if you find yourself in or near Covent Garden, go and have a bowl of this deliciousness.  you won't regret it.",1
5,"TLDR: Cheap, delicious, legit Chinese hand-pulled noodles.
There's a Walk to Wok across the street. Despite my appreciation of puns and play-on-words, I can't help dislike Walk to Wok. ESPECIALLY SINCE LANZHOU IS SO GOOD AND ACROSS THE !#)*)&@ STREET :D
Staff was really friendly (speaking Mandarin) and I was recommended the beef noodle soup for 6.5 GBP. F-ing delicious. Soup was spicy without the intent to bring you physical pain, noodles were fun to bite into and the beef was cut into slices instead of chunks, which made for less meat stuck between your molars ;)
So happy I got to eat here this last trip and chat with some locals sharing my table.",1
4,"I didn't quite know what to expect when we first decided to try this place.  On the one hand it was in a high traffic touristy area and the other was it was very busy for Monday night with a lot locals.  The wait wasn't too bad, maybe 15 minutes and we were seated at the bar type table opposite the cash register.  Its a very small place to begin with and we soon found ourselves a bit squished as people were coming in and out of the place.  I also realized why the wait isn't that bad, they serve you pretty quickly, the noodle soup is very good so you slurp it up pretty fast and the place is cramped, you want to get out of there as soon as possible.  Overall, a great noodle shop to try if you're in the area and not expensive at all.  And a must try is their hot sauce in those big brownish jars with a cover, they add a nice kick to your noodle soup !",1
4,"Found this place on Yelp as cheap dinners in Chinatown. Small lace but bench seats and bar to sit at and plenty of takeaways ready to go. 
We sat at the bar and ordered Bok Choy, half roast duck and sliced pork noodles for two. It was plenty to eat and just over £25 which is a bargain for Covent Garden.
Delicious quick meal - only thing is cash only. Highly recommended!",1
4,"I would give this place five stars if all that mattered to me was flavour. The food was simply amazing. I visited the bar with a Taiwanese friend who has eaten her fair share of noodles and we both agreed that the noodle soups we ordered were absolutely delicious. I would go back in a wink to eat another bowl of that liquid delight, not to forget the freshly pulled noodles that were absolutely divine. For the price you pay, you really get great food value.
But when I go back, I'll make sure I'll go alone. The simple reason being that the restaurant is rather anti-social. We were asked to move places three times, which is simply odd when you are eating. On top of that my friend and I had different eating paces. When my friend finished her dish she was asked to pay and leave right away, while I was clearly still in the process of eating. We refused. Not only was I stared at for the remainder of the dinner, my friend also perfectly understood the less than friendly comments that were made about us by the waiters in Mandarin. 
So when you go, go for the food. Don't go to socialize.",1
2,"Go somewhere else for your noodles. My wife had the sesame paste noodles, and it was the worst I've ever had. I had the dry noodles with gravy with a fried pork chop. The fried pork chop was good, but the noodles weren't.",-1
4,"Very reasonably priced, cheap and quick eat @ central London, I'm not amazed by the noodle or the soup, but I don't mind to visit this place again when I crave for some quick and warm noodle soup.",1
4,"Totally Legit & CHEAP.
Hand-pulled noodles, sliced beef, tasty broth = WINNING.
Garlic cucumbers also AMAZING... and I don't even really like cucumbers a whole lot. 
A true hole in the wall with an extensive menu. It's like Panda Express in the front, school cafeteria in the back. You'll be sitting on benches rubbing elbows with your Asian neighbors. ENJOY!",1
3,The food is ok if you really want some Chinese and have no enough time - The place is too narrow and crowded.,-1
4,Delicious noodles. Very reasonably priced. Cash only. Fast service. Small space.,1
5,"I love GOOD-CHEAP-EATS. And this is a place that is just like that. Lanzhou Noodle Bar was a reco from a friend and it definitely satisfied my noodle cravings and more. They have hand cut and hand pulled noodles (each of them equally delicious) and their beef stew was just juicy and fatty enough to melt in your mouth. It gets super busy and packed here so don't be surprised if you have to share a table with a stranger. The line goes by pretty fast as customers go in and out quickly, and you can entertain yourself by watching the chefs make the noodles right before your eyes in the front of the restaurant.",1
5,The place is packed with Asians so that is always a good sign! They even have 4 or 5 tables in the basement because the place runs out of room so quick! Yes it is very small but the food is amazing! Best ramen I have ever had,1
4,Best noodles I have ever had in my life! Bok Choy  with garlic was awesome. Strange experience though. They claimed to have run out of rice and then wanted us to buy fried rice which I turned down and then they appeared a few minutes later with some white rice. It was the worst white rice I have ever tasted. What Chinese place runs out of white rice and what Chinese place doesn't know how to make white rice. (I'm Chinese so I guess im a bit picky) noodles were to die for though would of gave 5 stars of the rice wasn't that bad!,1
2,The place gets fairly busy and the restaurant is pretty small. The service is okay but they move pretty fast that you feel really rushed. It's cool that you get to see the noodles made. I enjoyed the charsu  pork but felt that the soup base could use a little bit more spice instead of msg. It's good for a ramen fix if you're ever craving.,-1
4,The noodles are good. They make it fresh after you order. The soup could use some flavor. The place is definitely a hole in the wall. It's not a great place to take a Tinder date. It is a great place to take a friend who's never tried authentic pulled-noodle before.,1
5,"Outstanding flavours, service within minutes, huge portions and very affordable. Highly recommended.",1
5,"Exceeded expectation - who would have thought you could find an authentic Chinese noodle joint in the middle of a packed touristy spot. I was expecting stuff like orange / lemon chicken. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The noodles are indeed hand drawn and it comes out real quick. Perfect for a late night grub or if you need to squeeze in a quick bite before a show with a packed schedule. If you looking for a legitimate Chinese noodle experience, I really recommend stopping here.
P.S. If you are curious what the Chinese characters say - they're ""Authentic Nan Zhou Hand Pulled Noodles.""",1
5,"Great tasting noodles, fresh and fast. Some of the broths weren't as tasty as others (I'd recommend beef over chicken). The service was top notch aside from needing to ask for a drink of water.",1
5,"This non-descript place right by the Leicester Square tube stop is amazing. It's nothing to look at but if you want to look at pretty things, you're in London. Go to the Tate Modern, the NPG--whatever. If you want delicious made on site, hand cut or hand drawn noodles this is the place I'd go to. I went for the noodles and had the hand cut noodles with stewed beef. The small runs 6 pounds but is massive! I scored an outside table which was less crowded. This place is so much better than so many of the places in Chinatown I've been to. the staff are charmingly indifferent to you, so if your egos bruise easily go to Pret an get their cold noodle salads which will undoubltedly have edamame. But if you want good, soupy, delicious hand cut noodles, this is the place to go.",1
4,"I spent about a week in Europe before I started craving authentic Asian food and according to Yelp, this place was great for that so I went here in desperation on a Monday afternoon. As a solo diner, I was seated at a crowded table next to seven other diners. The guy next to me seemed displeased at his lack of personal space but I've spent a fair amount of time eating at food stalls in Taipei so this was nothing to me. I ordered the spicy + sour beef noodle soup with the knife cut noodles - it came out within a few minutes! (Although a party of four next to me didn't seem to have the same luck as they seemed to be waiting for a bit).
The actual food: great taste value for my broke American college student self struggling to adapt to the British pound (my dish was 7 pounds but I thought it was 7 dollars while I was ordering it - still it's good value compared to most other places). The soup was savory without being too salty. I very much appreciated the spicy sauce provided at the table. The noodles were thick and fresh. The beef wasn't the best but I'm also spoiled by my mom's cooking. Service was efficient and fast (all I can ask for...and all you should really expect at these prices). Anyway, I will definitely be stopping by here on my grocery trips in Chinatown.",1
5,"I was craving spicy hot noodle soup with meat, came here and got exactly that. La mian noodle soup with char-siu and added pork-veggie wontons (for an additional cost). 
The food came out within 10 mins and was burn-your-mouth hot...just the way I like it! There's a jar of chili flake paste on the table you can also add to make it spicy. So duh, I had to. 
The tables are like picnic style with benches and you sit with other parties, but I didn't mind. They don't cram you in or anything...you'll still have elbow room. If it gets more people in faster, then it works. The place is really small though, there are only 3 picnic tables I believe, so it's good that they get people in and out fast.",1
3,"Dropped by after reading all the reviews and was a little bit disappointed. My main complaint is the taste of the soup noodles. The noodles definitely contain more than just flour & salt, I couldn't pinpoint what the weird flavor was. Ive had Lanzhou lamian and knife cut noodles countless times in China & the US and Ive NEVER tasted anything like this. So be warned.
Noodles aside, the broth was a bit light but the meat and vegetables were just fine. Their takeout food is very basic and the same as any other. I will definitely come back and try their fried noodles & other dishes though!
You will be sharing communal tables with others, group over 4 people will probably find it hard to get an empty table.",-1
3,"crowded and noisy small restaurant, not a very good environment to stay and enjoy eating. Good noodle soup, same taste as I had in China.",-1
5,"Absolutely love this place! I feel like I walked out of London and into Hong Kong except they speak mandarin instead of Cantonese. 
The place is a little small but for the most part it's clean.
The best part about this place is that they have hand cut noodles.. Amazing!! Get the pork sliced noodles NOT the cha sew.",1
4,"I wonder if this is associated to the Lanzhou in Manhattan Chinatown, which also serves hand pulled noodles. Maybe just a coincidence. Noodles and broth on point. This place is no nonsense Chinese place. Great food. Shared tables. Cheap for the area.",1
4,"I've both eaten in and gotten take-out from here a number of times. Probably one of the cheapest meals I've had in London. Also, one of the tastiest and most authentic. These are legit hand pulled noodles and we are so happy we found this place!
When you walk by it on the street, most people wouldn't even take a second look as it has all the makings of really bad Chinese. From the window you can see a steam table with a bunch of dishes. You know, the classics like fried rice, chow mien, orange chicken, etc. Don't be fooled. Walk in and you will see that there is a man making hand pulled noodles right behind the steam table, and there are a few tables for eating. Sit down, get a menu and order one of the noodle dishes! Also, if you're looking for some type of ambience, you won't find it here. This is no frills, the long communal tables in the back (yes, you might be sharing a table with strangers) are just there so you can eat your food and then get out. 
We're all about the noodle soups and I love both types of noodles. If you like thicker noodles, get the ""dao xiao mian"" which is knife cut noodles. If you like them thinner, go with the ""la mian"" which is hand pulled - though you can get the la mian in different thicknesses as well (skinny to fat to flat). They're all good and always perfectly al dente. They have a bunch of different noodle soups but we usually get the stewed or sliced beef. They are both our favorite. If you like it spicy, add some of the hot chili sauce on the table, so good! The only misstep we've had (and why it is 4 instead of 5 stars) is the fish noodle soup. It was incredibly bland. The noodles were good but the broth had no flavor. In our opinion, the beef options are where they shine!
If you want to try some of their other dishes, we've had their mapo tofu - definitely a no. It comes with peas and carrots and isn't the slightest bit spicy. Their dumplings actually didn't fare much better as the skin was way too thick. The one standout that we have had would be the pig ear with cucumber. Totally refreshing due to the immense amount of garlic (don't eat this if you're on your way to a date, dancing, um, really anything that involves close human contact) that they mix everything in along with some vinegar. While pig ear is definitely not for everyone, I actually really enjoy it and Lanzhou makes a very good version of this classic dish!
Lastly, the best part is they are open SUPER late. If you're out in Soho for the night and want something to eat other than a kebab at 2am, this is your place. I don't know about you, but this is my perfect end-of-night meal. :)",1
5,"Difficult to find but enter a small world where you see only Chinese people sitting here and eating. A very good sign. In the small cramped place there are two picnic tables sitting up to six and one long wall table seats up to 3. Be prepared to cozy up with others as the chefs slam down the noodles as the twist and contort it.  Fresh before your eyes, verified. The food came out quickly and ordering the stew beef noodle soup and my friend ordering the plate noodle with slice beef. 
It was heavenly.  I was saying oh my God as I was eating and that is when I know I found something amazing.  This is authentic.  Prices are great. Absolutely would find my way here next time I'm in London.",1
4,"Great food, very tasty broth. We went there for a late night snacks, we liked it so much that we returned for dinner two days later. Roast duck soup noodles and spicy soir beef noodle are both pretty good. I only wish the staff wasn't standing next to me waiting for me to order though, I kinda feel pressured lol",1
3,"Who doesn't love hand made noodles?!?
I don't think I would ever have tried this place, but after seeing the great reviews we decided to give it a go. Any place that has a nasty looking buffet near the window is a big X on my list. Once you wonder in, you notice a couple of guys pulling and knifing dough non-stop.
We tried the char sui fried la mian, seafood dao xiao mian, pork and chive dumplings, and the salt pepper fried chicken. The noodles and dumplings were pretty good but the chicken pieces were small and there was not a ton of meat. Fortunately, there were no fried fat chunks though.
Food came out reasonably fast except for the char sui fried la mian which seemed to come at least 15-20 minutes after the rest of our food had already arrived.
 Cash only!",-1
4,"Now THIS is a find worth mentioning. Among busy and tourist Leicester Square, this place at first does not look what it is (I passed by so many times not noticing and thinking this would be yet another rip-off ""Asian""restaurant in the area). Having lived in China for a few months, this place hit the spot immediately and I felt I was back in the country of cheap yet mouthwatering delicious food.
Just go straight for the simple noodle dishes with meat. I had the crispy pork belly which was incredibly good. Staff is all local Chinese with little understanding of English which makes this place even better and more authentic. 
In for a quick bite before your theatre and up for REAL Chinese food (which is hard to find, even in Chinatown): go here and you won't be disappointed.",1
4,"Even though not all my experiences have been great here. The noodles are one of the best in London and the cheapest eats in town. 
Yes, you get the typical waitresses flagging you down at the door and you look over and see vats of sweet and sour chicken but look past that and you'll see a heck of a lot of Chinese people inside slurping noodles as the noodle chef is making them! They do both traditional Lamian and dao xian mian for about £6.50. A big bowl of soupy beefy goodness and homemade noodles. 
The soupy noodles are so mic better than the dry ones. And the service is Icy at best. I properly feel like I'm in china. The last time I went with Isabelle the mainland Chinese female customer next to me kept pointing and staring at my noodles as I ate. Because they are shameless. I mean keep it subtle no?",1
3,"I located this noodle bar on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot since the reviews were a mix of average to amazing. First, as we arrived to check out the menu through the glass window--since there is not an online version we took our time reviewing (I didn't want to go in straight away because it often takes my children a long time to decide what to eat). We were stared at without a greeting by a host person for a few minutes, which didn't bother me too much, but just felt odd. Upon entering we were asked how many (again even though this person had been staring at our family for nearly 5 minutes, he asked), and then promptly seated in the back on a picnic table (next to a sink full of dirty dishes). Although Yelpers had stated the restaurant takes card, I wanted to verify, and asked the host. He stated ""only £20 more. Don't have, leave, get."" Estimating that our family would easily surpass this guideline, we stayed seated. Not a big deal, but they serve both Pepsi and Coke products (£1 for a can, 20p more for Coke? Strange, but okay). Now came time to order or so we thought. The waitress was friendly, but was really pushing with regards to the menu ""noodles are specially, you order noodles,"" she took our drink orders, and walked away. I totally get it, noodles are the thing here. She returned with the drinks a few minutes later. The majority of our party went for noodles. Of note, the one dish that was not noodles, was served with steamed rice (some good parts, many parts were hard and clumped). However this dish was Kong pao chicken, and the chicken/sauce made up for the lame rice. Back to the other dishes: noodles were amazing, we had a dry chicken dish and sour/spicy chicken noodle soup. No issues with these noodle dishes at all. We also had very good crispy spring rolls! Yet, back to the issues of service. Having never been there before, we were unsure of where to pay/how to pay. I got up and asked the host, and he only pointed me to the cash register, then screamed across the restaurant at the cashier. I never received or was even able to review my bill. I attempted to follow the addition on the register (everything seemed to line up until the last items), this is where a mysterious £5.20 was added to the bill. I asked, and the cashier responded ""VAT, card charge."" Card charge didn't make sense as I was never notified of this when I asked before, but not willing to argue, and ready to go, I said nothing further. Yet, I suspect this is the main reason many people can't give the restaurant better ratings: the interactions. I want to see my bill. It was a good meal, and I'm willing to pay for it, but if you cannot explain to me why I am paying x£ for my food, I don't want to return. Sadness.",-1
5,"It's cramped and very, very Chinese, so it's not at all a great place to take guests, but I do anyway because the noodles are amazing. Walk straight in and avoid the Westernized Chinese fare that's out for takeaway in front, and ask for a table (in Chinese if you can). They'll seat you wherever they've got room (friends and I got plastic stools handed to us at one of the outside tables once...) and when you're ready, order your noodles. The classic beef noodle soup is amazing, as is the thicker cut beef stir-fry noodles. Their vegetable dishes are done well, too. One note - they only sell bottled water or soft drinks. No complementary tap here, but hey, it's cheap enough that the bottle doesn't add much onto the bill.",1
5,"Best hand pulled noodle outside of China.
I visited the noodle bar on a Friday night at 7 pm.  This was literally one of the first restaurants out of my first trip to London and I was REALLY REALLY excited to see some authentic Lanzhou noodle place outside of China.  Although the restaurant was in a touristy area the small group of chinese customers waiting outside of the restaurant convinced me that this must be a legit place.  
I was first a bit intimidated by the line but it actually moved pretty quickly.  Even from my place in line outside of the restaurant I could see the chefs pulling the noodles by hand.  Wow that was a sight I have not seen outside of China.  The broth was very authentic and I snorted that bowl in 15 minutes.  No wonder the line moved  so fast haha.  I then proceeded to visit that noodle place every night for the next 3 nights.  Even my caucasian bf admitted that this was one of the best noodle places he's ever been to and we frequently visit good chinese restaurants in the San Francisco area.    
The service was very efficient but honestly pretty nice compared to the standard good chinese restaurants in the bay area (US).  Also - most importantly, tipping didn't seem to be a thing in that restaurant so I really don't understand what everyone is complaining about.",1
2,"It's almost never that I don't leave a tip, but I swear that if they had added one to this meal, I would have removed it.
Service: perfunctory. He wasn't particularly rude but he was zero on the helpful scale. After getting the meal we were on our own.
Seating: we were taken downstairs, a tiny table by the stairs with a stool and a chair. Apart from being uncomfortable, if you sat there you'd have people brushing by you constantly. We said we'd wait, then they found found us a better table and gave the other one to the next sucker.
Food: maybe we ordered the wrong thing. Of course we got the noodles, one of each type, but I got mine 'dry' not realizing that dry meant flavourless, and that it only comes in a wide noodle. My g/f got the other noodle, fried, wide; that one tasted OK but big lumps of pasty flour tasting noodle where it obviously wasn't 'pulled' correctly, or cooked long enough. Putting enough chili oil on both made them tolerable. Mine was with duck, a tiny portion of duck. My g/f got chicken, a ton of chicken. Both meals were huge, so if you are just going for quantity you probably won't be disappointed for the price.
tap water: they don't do tap water! That's right, the only restaurant we've ever been to that wouldn't give us tap water, even though they served some other people some kind of drink in a polystyrene cup so it's not like they couldn't have managed it.
Most people were getting the soup, so maybe that was the better thing to order, but it doesn't matter to us because we won't be back.",-1
4,"Food was properly traditional, at a very reasonable price. But seating was a bit squashed and crowded.",1
4,"A legit noodle place. Love how they have the guy actually making the noodles from scratch in the open for everyone to see. Expect it to be crowded and noisy. There's a good chance you might be seated next to strangers as well but that's all part of the experience. Prices were decent and so was the food. The dan-dan noodles didn't blow me away, but they got the job done for when I was craving comfort food.",1
5,"Yes it is tiny, but really authentic. So far the best Lanzhou noodles in London. Highly recommend. The place is so small so can be easily packed. Never mind, I can ignore everything for the sake of food:)",1
5,"Unexpected surprise! From the window, there's ready made food people order for take-out, reminiscent of Panda Express. Next to the cashier is a man making handmade noodles! 
The place is very tight and less than appetizing but the servers are curt due to their limited English but helpful with the menus. Noodles were amazing. Charsiu was not fatty and very flavorful. Dumplings were also fresh made and delicious. Would definitely return!",1
4,"I went on vacation with the understanding that I would probably not have any Chinese food in the foreseeable future, but I still wanted to see how expats in London did Asian cuisine.
As it turns out, London's Chinatown is a 3 block long corridor of shops and restaurants. That's about it. I tried following my nose towards a good option, but nothing really popped out as a great option.
Thwarted, I walked towards Leicester Square station with my head hung low. However, as I crossed the street, a certain aroma hit me. Spicy. Meaty. Something was calling me towards this small, unassuming shop with a queue full of Chinamen. An auspicious turn of events to say the least.
The weather wasn't the best, but I could see that I'd have to wait a while if I wanted a seat inside. But I had no problem sitting outside in the cold. I asked the waitress what the big deal was and she told me, ""Beef noodle soup. Very good."" How could I say no?
Fortunately, she was completely on point. Hand-pulled noodles made en masse all day is the star here. Like having al dente pasta with a hearty broth ( a broth which didn't have too much MSG if any).
Needless to say, I came here literally every day I was in town. Not on purpose of course. It just happened to be around when I had a craving. And at their price point, Noodle Bar was easily the most value packed meal I had on my trip. 
I would say that I hesitated to write this review, but since they're already so busy, it doesn't really matter what I say, does it?",1
1,"Uhm...walked here last night after arriving in Leicester Square expecting some warm noodles to fight the cold weather, but was unceremoniously introduced to a notice from the health inspector shutting down Noodle Bar for ""an infestation of mice."" So yeah, just in case you were hoping to eat here you oughta think again at least for the time being. The more you know... -__-",-1
3,"I'm not a big noodle fan but I have to say, this place is not bad at all. 
Their noodle is actually quite good. I ordered the beef (soup based) dao xiao mian and its good! Especially for 7 GBP (compare to other restaurants), you can't go wrong with this place. The place is small but if you are by yourself or 2 person, the wait isn't too bad. Otherwise go at non-peak hours. 
So for anyone that want noodles or a quick cheap bite to eat around Chinatown, then this is the place to be!",-1
5,"There's no better way to warm yourself on a rainy day in London than slurping a hot bowl of noodle soup at this restaurant. The noodle soup with duck is my go to meal at this restaurant, and it has not disappointed. The proportions are large for only £5, and the duck taste great with the chili paste that is placed at every table. The atmosphere feels very authentic because sharing a table with strangers was something I did frequently during my travels in Taiwan.",1
4,"Hole-in-the-wall kind of place with amazing hand pulled fresh noodles. Good serving, easily sharable portions.",1
5,"A-ma-ZING! service was quick and very polite, very cosy set up, like clean sit down Street food. Would definitely come again and highly recommend.",1
5,Definitely recommend this place. Service is good. Very affordable. I like getting the dry noodles i believe its number G 17 on the menu its the beef stew one. Try it its soooo goooood! The place could be packed tho be ready to wait.,1
5,"Mahoosive servings of legit la mian and dao xiao mian for £6.50-ish!
THANK YOU YELP FOR BRINGING ME HERE.
THE END.
(Take away portions are tiny though. BOO.)",1
5,"Fantastic authentic Chinese food. The best Chinese food in Chinatown is this place right outside of Chinatown. 
We've been here several times and it never disappoints. 
We highly recommend:
- Beef Stew Dao Xiao Mien (thick short cut noodles) - the noodles are ""bouncier"" than the la mien!
- Lamb skewers
- Roast duck rice - cheaper than Chinatown prices, just as good
- Won Ton in hot chili oil - not really spicy but are really big and delicious",1
4,The restaurant is kind of dirty/greasy all over the place but the food was really amazing. I had the beef noodle soup and it is one of the best I've ever had by far.,1
4,"My daughter and I were visiting London for 10 days this month and we went to Noodle Bar twice. The food is so very good!!! Really amazing. 
What you should know before you go:
If you plan to dine in, prepare yourself for an up close an personal experience with your fellow diners. The dining area is very, very small with few tables but they are insanely busy!! You will be seated shoulder to shoulder at communal picnic styles tables and bench seats with perfect strangers which most of us aren't accustomed to. It was uncomfortable for me at first until I embraced it as an experience I'll always remember. It's loud and it's hot in there too. 
The second time we enjoyed Noodle Bar food, we did take away and ate in our hotel room. 
The food is remarkable! Really wonderful when you're hungry in a town where the food is weird and expensive :)",1
4,"Recommended by a coworker - quite tasty! We had the dao xiao mian and it was quite nice, if I came back would also want to try the la mian.",1
5,Hand made noodles were amazing! I got the chicken dao xiao mian and got to see them roll the dough and make the noodles super fast whole slicing it into the pot! The noodle texture tastes amazing and the chicken had a lot of flavor! The price is super affordable and the portions are huge! I would definitely recommend it to people who crave Asian food or want to try legit noodles!,1
5,"This noodle bar has authentic Beef noodles, better than most Chinese restaurants I have had so far. The environment is a little noisy but the food makes great compensation to it!",1
4,"I'm always skeptical of places beckoning customers to come in, and also front window buffet displays that contain congealed food.
But for this gem, I will happily squeeze myself between all the patrons at one of the 3 tables in the back, and eat all the noodles there are here.  We ordered the Tomato and Egg, and Pickled and Egg, bowls of thin noodle soups, and were bowled (hardy har) over by the amount of egg there was in here.  We could have shared just one bowl, and it would've been more than enough.
Aubergine was a bit oily, but it was addictive. Cucumber in garlic sauce was wonderfully garlicky.
Whole meal cost us 25 quid, not bad for a filling meal for two. Remember it's CASH ONLY",1
4,"Came here after watching Miss Saigon so there wasn't really a wait. My wife had the beef soup pulled noodles and I had the beef soup knife cut noodles. We went in with low expectations as different people have different opinions on what's considered authentic/tasty. But we were happy that the Yelp reviews this place received were well deserved. The only reason this place didn't receive five stars is that the cucumbers were a huge let down. I love me some Chinese cucumbers, but I felt as if this place cut up some cucumbers and mixed it with a pinch of salt and dribbling of vinegar. For the price, they could have put in a bit more effort. 
However, with that being said, I would definitely come back, but forgo the cucumber next time.",1
4,"Crazy, hectic place!  You squeezed onto a bench as this place gets busy.
Prompt, abrupt staff and alot of them!
You get to watch the chef make the noodles by hand, which is pretty impressive!
Very cheap and affordable.
Well, worth a quick stop - don't bother trying to linger they won't let you - for a bargain bite to eat.",1
5,"AH-MAZING!
The noodles are out of this Earth.
Ate so much that I didn't even have room for dessert (which is rare in me).",1
5,"Don't be fooled by this restaurant's standard appearance... Their handmade noodles, especially their noodle soups are delicious!  The dumplings were excellent as well, also possibly handmade. It's hard to find good food in London, especially near the touristy areas, so treasure this one!",1
4,"Great little place serving authentic hand pulled Lanzhou noodles.
There is a generic hot counter at the front of the restaurant with the standard gloopy fake Chinese food, which must be ignored.
Instead ask for the menu and order the noodle soups with a choice between thick or thin hand pulled noodles. The original beef brisket soup is perfect on a cold day! The spciy beef version is also good. Other dishes on the menu are just okay.",1
4,"I yelp'd. I walked. I entered and requested a seat for one. They pointed to a stool on the end with a piece of counter. They provided a menu, chopsticks and a napkin. They asked if I was ready to order. I was. I ordered spicy & sour soup with noodles & sliced beef. I waited. They delivered a steaming hot bowl of soup. I ate it.
It was delicious. It was cheap. It was awesome.",1
4,A cosy and share table experience. The staff are friendly and patient and the clientele know what they're eating. The noodles are handmade fresh although there is choice to have from the ready cooked. Really enjoyable for a quick and cheap bite in the heart of Leicester Square and Covent Garden.,1
5,Loved the shrimp and pork wonton's and reordered another round after trying the first piece!,1
5,I followed the advice of other yelpers pointed to the back and stated noodles. We ate downstairs. As recommended we ordered noodle bowls- vegetarian as we are mostly nonmeat eaters. Wow- delicious!,1
5,"If you're itchin' for some delicious, inexpensive late night ramen, this is the place.
Nice people, good service. Very small super-casual place. TASTY. Do it!",1
5,"Yum Yum Yum, came here 2 nights in a row and still walked away full and happy! 
I came here with Yinnie one night after watching The Pride (which was fantastic BTW, courtesy of Yelp!).  
I stuck with my usual stewed beef la mian soup noodles.  Broth was tasty, beef was still tender, with lots of cilantro, just how I like it!  
Yinnie had the Fujian Peanut Sauce noodles with La Mian (£6) - it was a dry dish with a peanut sauce overtop.  I'm not usually a huge fan of dry noodles, so I personally didn't think it was that appetizing to me.  We also shared an order of the garlic cucumbers soaked in Chinese dark vinegar, which was just OK.  I think they key to this is that the cucumbers need to be soaked a bit longer, and the seeds need to be removed - otherwise the vinegar gets watered down which is what happened here. 
Onto the 2nd night! We had 4 people with us and ordered the following items:
Salt and Pepper Squid, £7 - 8 large pieces of squid, nicely fried, better than any other Chinese resto I've hit up in London. Could have been a bit more spicy, but was easily remedied with their massive pot of chili oil!
Stewed Beef Frried Dao Xiao Mian, £7.50 - nicely done, thick chewy noodles fried with chunks of tender beef and sauce. 
Dan Dan La Mian in soup, £6.50 - it was just OK, couldn't detect much peanuttiness in this dish.  I probably wouldn't order it again.
Fried Pork and Chive Dumplings, £5 - 8 pieces of pan fried dumplings, really good value and tasty! Make sure you dip it in the chinese dark vinegar with chili oil 
Mapo Tofu, £6.50 (with rice, £2) - spicy tofu dish with some veg in it, sauce wasn't too thick, could have been a bit spicier, but overall a decent dish
Beef Tripe in Red Oil, £6 - Just cooked beef tripe sliced thinly, with hot chili oil drizzled on top.  I've had this cold appetizer several times before, but its generally not my favorite.
 
We all ordered a few drinks, and it came to £14pp, and rolled away full! 
Again, decent place, would come back in a heartbeat to try other adventurous things on the menu.  Don't expect much on their service side.. they are pretty efficient in how things are done, our dishes rolled out very quickly, but have an eagle eye watching you, because once you're done, they will tell you to settle the bill up front since there's usually a table waiting.",1
5,Great cheap food that's served up quick and fresh. There was a line out the door when I visited today (a Saturday) for lunch. Had the steamed pork dumplings and sliced beef noodle soup. Would recommend both.,1
4,"Wow I felt like I was back in China when I stepped into this little hole-in-the-wall. It's very narrow and there's tight seating in the back and downstairs in their little basement. The kitchen is at the front and you can see the staff making the noodles, pulling and sketching the dough. It's very fun to watch and to know that your noodles you're about to eat are authentic. I got the most popular dish, which is the beef noodles; my friend got the pork belly noodles. The portions are enormous and it was difficult for me to finish the whole thing, but it was incredibly tasty. It was only 6.50. Definitely coming back, I want to try all their noodles!",1
4,"Outstanding pulled noodles. Fried rice not bad either. Atrocious service. Still gets 4 stars, that's how good the food is.",1
5,"It is authentic enough to have it outside Lanzhou. If you want the noodle to have more flavor, you should choose thin or regular. If you want your noodle to be more chewy, thick will be a good choice. Try to avoid of lunch or dinner time if you don't want to wait in a long line.",1
4,"As always - it depends on what you're here for. 
If you ever swing by this joint, please ignore the £5 (or whatever it is) box of pick and mix of pseudo-Chinese food and make your way through to the back. You'll be doing yourself a favour. Although if you find me cramped enough on a table - please come back another time.
It's all about the soup noodles here, whatever else you had on your agenda when coming here, throw it away. I've had a few of the noodles here, my favourite is probably the hot and sour soup with beef slices and knife cut noodles. It's warming, big and satisfying in every way, the price tag is also music to my ears. Sometimes I order sides of dumplings or tofu and although it's nothing to write home about, home being Hong Kong, in this case - it's good enough to compliment the noodles.
I can see coming here in the summer being an infrequent occurrence, but I will endeavour to try as long as the price doesn't go up, this place has a firm place in my heart for it's authentic Chinese noodles - I always leave content.",1
4,Found my first Chinese noodle bar in London. Good experience and food was great. Surrounded by a lovely environment. Trafalgar Square.,1
5,"It's only my first week in London but I've already found my favorite restaurant. The noodle here is so authentic I thought I'm still in Asia! Their portion is huge but because the handmade noodle is made so well that I did not find it fattening. In addition, the price is so cheap!!!! Definitely recommending everyone to try this place",1
1,"We're in London and we have a craving for Chinese noodles.  Nope, disappointed.  Broth had no flavor.  Both are noodles dishes lacked flavor.  Place is dirty and cramped.  We sat so close together to the next guests - literally like sardines.  It was a fire hazard.",-1
4,"Don't be fooled by the neon orange chicken in the ready-made buffet by the window. Nor be bothered by its too too convenient location right outside of Leicester Square Tube. 
Do notice, however, the queue of Asians crowding the very narrow entrance. Ok, I DID notice that they assumed that every non-Asian walking through the door probably wanted chow mein and neon chicken. Is this racist? No, not really, because in my time sitting in the restaurant, pretty much every person that came in that wasn't Chinese-ish looking DID order neon chicken takeaway... Hmm. 
Be brave. Beat their assumptions. Come in, say you want to order noodle soup, and they will seat you in the small communal tables in the back. Legit la mian with char siu. I didn't like it quite as much as the minced pork la mian from the Brick Lane La Mian Stall, but this is probably the second best Chinese noodle soup I've had in London. If you are a fan of noodle soups, definitely check this place out. Nom nom on a chilly London day.",1
4,"The first person to discover honey probably looked at a beehive and thought, ""I bet those bastards are hiding something delicious in there"".  I think I had similar (less offensive) thoughts when walking past the innocuous-looking Noodle Bar, which features a buffet in the window.  All you need are the two magic words 'noodle soup' to give you access to the La Mian list.  The place itself is dinky - there's barely enough room to hand-stretch noodles in there, and there are only 4 small communual tables, so you may find yourself being asked to move up halfway through your meal (they'll even move your bowl for you mid-mouthful - such attentive service!)
Despite all this, the staff have been pretty friendly towards me, and the La Mian soup noodles are pretty good - the noodles are freshly made on the premises and not overcooked; so far I've had crispy pork and stewed beef as 'toppings' (yeah, the crispy pork thing kind of seems a bit pointless in soup as it gets a bit soggy, I just don't like HK-style char siew very much).  The stewed beef was ok, but I prefer the one from the La Mian stall on Brick Lane.  A big positive is the tub of chilli on the side, I just can't resist the stuff, even if it makes my nose drip and my brow glisten.
At £6.50 a bowl, you can't really go wrong here.  It's a good bowl of noodles, fairly filling, and generally fast.  Their menu also claim to open at 9 on most days, so it's become my breakfast noodle venue of choice by default.",1
5,"Tiny bar, does not look fancy nevertheless that does not matter because the food, Lamian noodles especially, is amaizing. I come here very often and never leave disappointed. Always extremely full because it is so tasty I can't stop eating. If you want to try real Chinese food, that's the best choice.",1
4,"very good chinese noodle. rarely find this taste overseas, at least in australia. the only drawback is too crowded and the environment could be improved. but can not complain too much.",1
4,"Hidden behind the bright glow of the sweet and sour chicken, sitting on the gross looking buffet in the window, is delicious noodle soup. The menu is long, with mostly crummy looking dishes, but when you get to the end you find a list of hand pulled noodles with the option of soup or not. You can get la mian and dao xiao mian -- from my understanding some are noodles that are pulled and all the same, rather than ones that appear just torn up pieces of noodle.
It gets crowded, so prepare to sit in someone's lap, or their table and don't expect good service. It was slow, but damn was it worth the wait. I opted for the pork slices, Char Siu.. I also saw the crispy duck which looked phenomenal. 
This is truly a hidden gem. But they lose a star for service.",1
5,"The best authentic Chinese food in London, without a question. The Lanzhou Lamian is a revelation.",1
4,"Just the place to stop for a bowl of hot soup noodle if you are in the Soho / Covent Garden area. The aroma invites you in to the tiny spot. The char siu and la mian noodle soup is fragrant with a hint of star anise and garlic with well balanced broth (not too salty or weak or too dense) and I always love hand pulled noodles. A large portion with plenty of noodles. Spring onion and coriander added to the slices of char siu which had the right flavour, not quite as tender as I have had at some other places but still great. You can also enjoy watching the cook swinging loops of noodle dough back and forth between his outstretched arms to make hundreds of strands of doughy noodle goodness in the tiny open kitchen.
Pretty extensive menu with many options (soup noodles are just one section on the menu). Great if you want to eat quickly and be prepared to squeeze up with fellow diners on cramped tables because it's always crowded but come here for the food. It's unpretentious and it's great value too at £6.50.",1
5,"The Beef stew soup was delicious. The hand pulled noodles that I got were a bit thinner than the guy's across from mine but it still tasted amazing. I didn't drink much of the broth because there was a lot of msg in it. The place is quite small so you have to share a table with other people, but for 13 pounds for two soups, this place is well worth it!",1
5,"Great noodle place! The noodles are either hand pulled (la mian) or knife cut (dao xiao) and you can put all sorts of meat in there. The broth is pretty good and for only £6.50. It's definitely a steal since I have not had anything like this in years!!
There are only 2 tables that seat 6 people each and then a bar area that seats 3 people. You will likely be forced with people that aren't in your party, but it's a great way to get to know people. I was seated at a table with a party of 3, party of 1, and party of 2.
Even better is when it rains, they give you some napkins to help dry off and the service is super quick! I ordered, got my meal, ate, and was out in about 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend trying this place. For those who have never tried knife cut (dao xiao) noodles, I would heavily recommend it. It's well worth it!!",1
5,"This is one of the best places to get beef noodle soup (think Ramen but with beef instead of pork), in the world, period. We are huge beef noodle soup fans and If you want better BNS you have to go to Taipei or China, there's no place in America that can rival this one. Simply amazing, and If you can handle them make sure you get their mixed beef/intestine/tendon noodle soup, all their other BNS varieties are excellent. Their hand-pulled noodle is made per order (128 noodles per bowl, we counted), and the beef was cooked to perfection. We went to this place twice during our 7 days stay and didn't try much else because their beef noodle soup was soooooo good.",1
4,Soooo good! You know you're walking in a good Chinese restaurant when the people eating there are Chinese. I tried the roast beef  noodle soup and I was happy. I'd say one bowl is good for two people ;) if definately go back to try more of their dishes,1
4,"When I'm craving noodles, Lanzhou Noodle Bar is the place to go.  From the outside, this nondescript hole-in-the-wall appears to be another place near Leicester Square serving hot food for take-away.  However, inside is where the magic happens: long strands of chewy noodles are hand-pulled and served in steaming bowls of soup.  The beef la mian is the perfect dish for a cold London evening.",1
5,"This unassuming hole-in-the-wall is the place to go for a bowl of hand pulled noodles (La Mian) for 6-7 pounds. Always busy, no frills and with two tables upstairs and one downstairs (that I've never been invited to sit at...I think the workers may eat down there) and some limited bar seating - this is hectic, busy, excellent Chinese noodlism at its finest. They also serve a cut noodle (Dao Xian Mian) which is more cut to the shape of sliced brisket, but my favorite is La Mian (extra thin) with Pork Dumplings.",1
4,"Noodle is good (delicious in fact). I also got roasted duck over rice (rice is good but duck is pretty much bone) ..Restaurant is tiny and fast pace ... If you come here, get noodles as that is what they are famous for :)",1
5,"Im quite fussy when it comes to chinese food, but Lanzhou has got to be in my top 3!! Ignore the hot counter of sloppy chinese food at the front and go in and look at the menu! Their hand pulled noodles are the best iv had, they are amazing, the staff are really friendly and to top it all off the place is cheap!",1
4,"Very dirty, but it is quite traditional Lan zhou style ramen!",1
5,"Pop out of the underground tube station at Leicester Square, this place is right in your face!  Great Noodles, they are freshly made and you can seeing them messing with the dough and then slicing into long delicious and chewy noodles.  You can have these noodles all kinds of ways, thin, thick, in soup, dry with variety of sauces.  I got the traditional beef brisket noodle soup and my wife had it wonton noodle style.  Wontons were great as well as the beef brisket, tender but not overly salty like in the US.  Great place to hit after visiting some museums.  Show up a little after lunch time like 3-4pm, and you won't be in queue.",1
1,"This  rating is NOT for the food as we did not get any.  We walked in at 11pm and placed order for noodles and fried rice. Then we waited...and waited while the cooks scraped grease off the walls and stovetop. ""Maybe there's a second kitchen"", we thought. Finally after 15 minutes, I asked when our order would be ready. Same cashier told us ""a few minutes"" and gestured to the cook/cleaners! Couldn't she have mentioned that BEFORE we placed our order?? Or better yet, STOP CLEANING AND LOOK AFTER YOUR CUSTOMERS!! We didn't expect this to be a classy joint and have no issues with dives but really, making customers wait while you take care of your nasty business?",-1
4,This is really a Chinese local delicious noodle restaurant. The jiao-zi is not bad too.,1
5,"The best Lanzhou (Chinese beef and soup) noodles in London. Cheap, tasty and central, my go to noodle place.",1
4,"I went for the classic sliced beef noodle soup that everyone raves about on here. I wasn't disappointed. The broth is rich in flavour and the veg soaks this up well. The noodles were also obviously super fresh. The beef was OK, maybe a bit too much jelly for my liking but that seems pretty typical for this type of dish. I'd perhaps try out pork to avoid this. The price was £6.50 for a very large bowl and tasted great after 15 mins of travel on the tube in the takeaway tub, sure its even better if you eat it there.",1
4,"Walking by this place, it's one that I would normally avoid.  When you look through the window, it has the fast food laid out in trays like Wasabi.  Also, the place doesn't look very inviting.  A chinese friend took me here for lunch one day and I ordered the same thing she likes - Sliced Beef La mian noodles.  The best part is that the noodles are fresh and you see them make it at the front.  Seating isn't so great as you'll end up having to share the table with strangers.  Really good and cheap lunch option.  I think this place is way better than chop chop noodles by King's Cross.  The bowls are huge so no need for a starter - but if you're extra hungry, try the chive and egg pie.  It kind of looks like a pasty.",1
5,"Probably one of the best deals for Chinese food in London. Where else can you get a big bowl of delicious hand-pulled noodles for ~10 quid? Just remember to bring cash. When you walk in, go sit down at the tables in the back instead of ordering at the front because that's all for takeout and you won't get any noodles there.",1
5,"5 stars because in London where a sandwich can cost 10£ an authentic bowl of noodle soup on a cold rainy day really hits the spot.
This place is crammed, open late, not very clean, and has people speaking to you in Chinese even if you don't speak it.  It is legit - being in China kind of legit.
Noodles are hand pulled in front of you and DELICIOUS!",1
5,"OMG, this is the BEST noodle I have ever had outside of China, after a week in Scotland I was dying to have some decent Chinese noodles, luckily we found this on the way to Chinatown, it is unbelievably good, I live in SF wish we could have something like that here!!!",1
5,"Definitely a hole in the wall - questionable-looking buffet window at the front, and tightly-packed communal tables. But you'll get efficient service and most importantly, the biggest bowl of tastiest, freshest hand-pulled La Mian noodle soup for under £10. And when I say ""fresh"", I mean that you can literally watch the noodle specialist at the front of the shop hand-pull and cook the noodles when every order is put in.",1
4,"The food in the buffet window looks very shady, but I came here for the la mian & dao xiao mian after reading the reviews.  Agreed with pretty much everyone here - very authentic and freshly made noodles.  and GOOD VALUE!  You could spend 2x as much at one of these trendy ramen places like Bone Daddies or Tonkatsu.  Broth is not as good as the trendy ramen places, but the noodles are top notch.",1
5,"Hidden gem full of in the know locals. It's the real stuff, as you can readily tell by the authentic Chinese clientele. The noodles are fresh and the broth is tasty. What's better, the portions are huge. Granted, the actual decor and seating is lacking, but it mimics the conditions of Hong Kong eateries. Oh, and for added ambiance you have the waiters and workers yelling loudly in mandarin. All in all, excellent meal!",1
5,Really good Chinese food in a tiny restaurant. Get the crispy pork noodle soup. Soooo tasty and a perfect warm pick me up for a dreary London day.,1
2,"Didn't taste like anything really, I just felt like I was eating some tasteless food. This was disappointing since it has 4 stars. It is only 5 pounds tho for a plate ( noodles + 2 sides) so that is awesome.",-1
3,"I'm recalling a late January night when I ended up going for a pit-stop part way through a stag night. That's what I've become, even when I'm seven sheets to the wind, I'm thinking about food. Noodle Bar is on Cranbourne St inbetween the twin hells of Leicester Square and Covent Garden and their USP are their Lanzhou-style hand pulled noodles aka la-mian.
 I stood transfixed watching the noodle maker convert a block of dough into la-mian to go into a bowl of soup with roast duck. Sadly, the roast duck was a bit tired and soup was full of MSG but frankly standards are lower when you're drunk and besides the noodles were a work of art.
 The other guys I was with couldn't wait for a bowl of noodles so they went for a selection from the buffet counter where lurid sweet and sour pork, beef in black bean sauce, and other take-away classics lurked. I must confess I went for a giant spring roll whose greasiness soaked up yet more of the booze. I need to go back here one day when I'm able to walk in a straight line.

3,"Solid bowl of noodles, very fast service, perfect for a rainy day. Le boyfriend ordered the roast duck la mian (he really enjoyed it, but it was just a roast duck thigh with some oyster-esque sauce stirred in) and I ordered the dan-dan dao xiao mian which was hot and soupy. It would've been perfect if they had a dry noodle option! The noodles taste very fresh!",-1
5,"The food is very tasty and very affordable. They make the fresh noodles right in front of you, and I must say they are the best noodles I've had in London. The place is very small and hectic, so don't expect an calm atmosphere where you can have long and deep conversations. However the noodles make up for this.",1
5,"Fantastic. It's about the soup here, and the noodles. I've been twice. First time I actually ate two soups in a row, it was so yummy.",1
5,Darn Good dumplings and yummy handmade noodles.  Who would have expected such traditional street food outside of China!  Don't pick the noodles too thin in order to enjoy the texture without the risk of being overcooked.,1
4,"it great place, but i dont like when they serve you and the food it cold i hope they undestand that same people they like to eat the food very hot",1
4,"Been there couple times, definitely a fan! 
Not so great in terms of ambience but extraordinary value for tasty satisfying good portion of authentic Chinese food !",1
5,"Freshly made noodles right in front of you at this independent little shop. Lovely food. Fair to great value depending. The Chicken Dan Dan noodle soup is a favourite of mine  it's a bit pricey at £6.50  £7+ for the soups but you do get like a litre of soup  great if you're still a bit jaded a lunchtime from the night before, hydrates you right back up! Alternatively you can get a Tonto size portion of food from the Buffet for a fiver and eat in  that's great value for that area. Spring rolls are 2 for two quid which is just right for a snack before the beer'o'clock.",1
1,"BEWARE! I've always trusted yelp and its users to guide me to the right restaurants, but this time I have been severely misled. I had high hopes for this place because of the great reviews I read, and being a noodle enthusiast I have to try all the (good) noodle places in London. The place was packed, and I ordered their ""signature"" soup, the beef la mien (not to be confused with the Japanese ramen), when the order came, the noodles were coagulated, and beef slices were tough and chewy, and the worst part was the soup, it was full of MSG, and full of sodium too. I asked for a glass of tap water to relieve the yucky taste my tongue and throat, and the answer I got from the rude waiter was: we don't sell tap water here. Although the noodles were ""cheap"" by Leicester Square standards (£6.50), I found it to be a giant waste of my money because I couldn't bear to eat the rest of my soup/noodle.",-1
4,"It's a ""real Chinese"" place: if you expect a fancy, tidy restaurant, this is not the right place for you. But these are some of the best and most authentic Chinese noodles I have found in London so far. The place is a bit cramped, the air conditioning leaks on some tables in the lower floor, and the place in general is very small. But in a way this makes it even more authentic. The only real downside is that, as many other restaurants in the area, they don't accept credit cards and you have to bring some cash with you (or run to an ATM if you forgot).",1
5,"Don't let first impressions fool you. Otherwise you'll not have eaten at one of the best chinese restaurants in all of London. Seriously. I was part of large group that wandered into this tiny gem just around the corner from Chinatown and thought ""oh crap, this isn't going to be good.."" that was after being led through the main dining room/restaurant, down tiny, steep stairs, and into a second, closet-like dining room in the basement. We all wondered what we were in for, but after a few rounds of tsingtao we were game for anything. Having filled my stomach with beer, I ordered the breaded sauteed mushrooms.. and OMFG, best mushrooms ever. Seriously. Even people at the table who HATE mushrooms were picking off my plate! Others had noodles (which were freshly pulled as other reviews have mentioned), some had soups.. all in all, everyone agreed that it was fantastic and that we were wrong to have thought we were in for a nice dose of salmonella (which no one had, lol). I definitely will be visiting the next time I'm in London (and will be spreading the word to others!)!",1
5,"Having lived in China, I am always on the look out for authentic noodles here in the UK. Though cramped, this place has a solid authentic Chinese feel and serves food to match. The prices are reasonable and both kinds of noodles, thick daoxiamian as well as thinner lamian, are not to be missed.",1
4,"This is NOT a date place or where you go for lingering meals.  But it is totally the place for great value, super tasty fresh hand-pulled noodles.",1
5,"I loved this place. It's conveniently located right behind Kings Cross station. I went alone so I was able to get seated right away, else there's a bit of a wait. The restaurant is huge and always packed! 
The bar tender recommended the food for me to pick and they were all great minus the fried okra. The romali roti and paneer masala is delicious and a good combination. The waiter also recommended one of their house cocktails which was really good and refreshing. It was a gin cocktail with a variety of spices and lemon juice or something. It was amazing. Go to this place if you're in London!",1
4,"Really wonderful evening spent at Dishoom in kings cross.
The lamb biryani and black lentils were the standout dishes.
Service was slick and friendly.
Whilst I very rarely stand in line for 45 minutes for a restaurant, it was just about worth the wait. Only real negative are the prices are on the high side.",1
4,"Food is legendary as ever, great value for money and to be quite honest, I don't mind waiting a while for a table, whilst having a drink but I think it's probably time for Dishoom to incorporate a booking system for couples and small groups for dinner reservations after 545pm, in my opinion.
We (Group of 3) waited almost 90 Minutes for a table.  Saying that, the restaurant in Kings Cross was heaving on a Monday evening at 7pm, indicating how popular the food is.
Service was good, bar service is also good and the atmosphere is buzzy and noisy in a good way.
My advice is to get a bunch of friends together, book a table and go as a group.",1
5,"I've been in London for only a week and I've already been here twice. And now that my flat is right around the corner, I think I'll be coming here pretty often 
Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. I'm a big fan of the Keema per eedu, which is basically chicken liver under two fried eggs. The naan roll is the most popular menu item and and sure does look delicious. Lassi is good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.
For lunch I ordered the Ruby Chicken and gunpowder potatoes. The Ruby Chicken is best enjoyed with some rice. The potatoes are the real deal! So much flavor with all the herbs and spices. 
Check back with me in 2 months and I think I'll have the whole menu sampled by then ;)",1
5,"When in London, do what the desis do, right?! Cannot rave enough about this place! In the 4 days we spent in London, we made it here 3 times. Sadly never for the bottomless chai brunch, but mostly late night dinners. The Kings cross location is way bigger than the downtown location (which we went to, but didn't eat at given the insane wait). This location has several different nooks and crannies, differnt seating styles - very reminiscent of  1980's Kolkatta in my opinion. The place is a warehouse turned into a restaurant and there is a cool little story on their menu. I loved everything about the decor - the office style chairs, the loungers, quirky hand wash sink, family pictures up on the walls - very very cool.
Now for the food. Both Anurag and I had our favorites. For me, it was the vada pao, which I ate every time I made it here. The bread to filling ratio was just perfect, the sauce on the side was delicious. Any one who knows me, knows I cannot handle spice - but I kid you not, I poured ALL the ghati masala (super spicy) on my vada pao, along with the spicy sauce and devoured it all. I had tears in my eyes along the way and my tongue was numb, but it was just amazingly delicious, washed down with a generous swig of king fisher. Anurag tried the keema pao and deemed it delicious too. His all time favorite though - the butter chicken (murgh malai) - succulent pieces of chicken, velvety smooth gravy, sopped up with traditional roomali roti. He was so in love with the dish, you could see his eyes light up every time he took a bite, haha!
The chicken biryani was another delicious dish - it made for an excellent jet lagged yet hung over meal for my husband :) We also tried the bhel - it was okay, but not at the same level as the dishes above. The paneer kathi roll was also delish -  made for a great back ""open the boot and chill"" kinda snack as we drove down to Dorset the next day. Perfect balance of spices - excellent road side snack :)|
Definitely recommend coming here - there is a bit of something for everyone!",1
5,"Walked in on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated immediately! Although, we were told we got the last table so I would definitely recommend calling ahead to check for wait times. This place only takes reservations for parties of 6 or more.
It was our first time at Dishoom and we were quite overwhelmed with their extensive menu. The menu was explained to us twice, and they were really patient with our confused selves lol. After explaining that each person should order 2-3 dishes, we opted for the bhel and prawn kaliwada for starters. For the main dishes, we got the murgh malai (chicken thighs) and lamb kebab to share with their signature black daal. We also ordered the garlic naan and I got the kala khatta sharbat drink. This may seem like a lot of food but the portion sizes are pretty small.
The drink had hints of chili but was still incredibly refreshing and sweet! We didn't realize the garlic naan was only 2 half pieces, so we ordered a bowl of basmati rice to share. Next time, I'd rather skip the naan and order just rice. There isn't enough naan to last the meal and the amount you're getting isn't worth the price. One bowl of rice was plenty to share for 2 people.
The prawn kaliwada was good - it came with a sweet dipping sauce which I wasn't a fan of. The shrimp itself was flavorful and spicy. The bhel was so complex in flavor and texture. And the colors were pretty too! Definitely my favorite appetizer - it was light, refreshing and delicious!
The grilled dishes each came with about 6-7 pieces of meat about the size of ping pong balls. They were dressed with cilantro and a side cup of onions, cucumbers and more cilantro! The lamb kebab was very good and extremely flavorful - it was my boyfriend's favorite but it was a little too dry for me. The murgh malai was THE BOMB. Extremely tender and flavorful, and the green cilantro dipping sauce made it even better! The black daal was delicious, I understand why it's a house favorite. 
Everything here seems very affordable but keep in mind, the dishes are small. Each person is meant to order multiple dishes for sharing, which can add up.
Definitely will be coming back to try the rest of their menu!
Note: super cool ambience! The restaurant used to be an old rail yard for shipping and packing goods. The restaurant has a unique variety of furniture and there are incense everywhere! They also sell their own vinyl...",1
5,"I've been here numerous times but oddly have never penned a review.  I was most recently in because I needed to do work in the vicinity of Saint Pancras and this, in Granary Square, is really nearby.  They let me sit in a corner, sip chai, and grind away on my laptop for hours without fussing once.  That said, when I've come, it's almost always been for breakfast, and everything about this place is just *proper.*  They have incense burning, very friendly staff, an accessible menu, and delicious food.  Do not miss this place if you're even remotely close by.",1
5,I was told this was one of THE best Indian food restaurants in the world. I was not disappointed. We arrived at King's Cross from Amsterdam late and wanted to experience this place. Even without a reservation we were seated fairly quickly. The staff was wonderful and the cocktails - oh my god. We received our food quickly and it was heaven on earth I swear. So many flavors and spices. Do yourself a favor and stop in to this place if you're in London. You will be thankful you did.,1
5,"Magnificence achieved! From walking in to walking all around and reluctantly leaving this establishment happy and satiated, this place is a joy. The restaurant is huge inside with 4 floors of service! No joke!!! And every nook & cranny is lovingly decorated and designed to stay true to the fusion of elevated vintage ""travel/goods exchange station"" and India (like an authentic washing station, photos, coloring, etc.) with written signage in both English and Hindi. I've been lucky enough to have visited India and this felt so familiar and comforting. The service was impeccable and our server Falhid (spelling?) was so accommodating and informative. We were dressed super casual and obviously not locals but were treated like royalty. 
The food was insanely authentic and delicious with quality infused into each dish and bite. 
We arrived just after breakfast service but they brought us a serving of Bun Maska upon seeing our disappointment and we were so grateful. The bread was so fresh and the chai warmed the soul. We also had some colorful Indian snacks brought complimentary, and we ordered Muttar Paneer (wife's favorite!), Chicken Tikka Roll (like kathi roll), and bowl of greens with plain biryani. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. Lucky and unsurprisingly they have 5 more locations!!!!
PS: check out the bar downstairs and the restrooms! Even they are an experience. So special!",1
5,"Dishoom was a fantastic choice for us on our one night layover in London.
While it's definitely not as cheap as the likes of Brick Lane, Dishoom offers up a more upscale dining experience with great ambience and delicious Indian. You're definitely paying for quality here.
On a Monday night, the restaurant was extremely packed so we had to wait about 45 minutes for our table. As we were waiting to get inside, the hosts graciously offered some chai that really warmed us up. LOVED THIS! It's the small things that really make the experience even when we hadn't sat down to eat yet.
Before being seated, we hung out at their bar downstairs and ordered drinks while waiting. My Kalamansi Smash was a fantastic fusion of lime and vodka with this Filipino fruit. Once we were ready to be seated, our servers took us to our table and explained how ordering would work. They recommended that we each order a curry of some sort, some naan, and perhaps some chicken and lamb for the table. 
We did just that and my goodness, everything that we tasted was delicious! The curries were definitely hearty enough to fill one person and the lamb kebabs were fire. I wish that we received more naan for the price but it was still good for what it's worth.
Overall, we had a great time dining at Dishoom and would come back here in a heartbeat. Note that they add an ""optional"" 12.5% service charge which is awkward to refuse, but completely up to you if you choose to opt out. Be sure to make it clear at the beginning.",1
3,"Really nice looking 3-story restaurant that would look like a good place to take a date. I visited for breakfast so there wasn't much of a crowd like the lines I saw at the more touristy Covent Garden location. The bar area had a lounge where you can enjoy a coffee or a stiff drink along with your breakfast. I just sat at the bar which had a lot of hustle and bustle with the  busy staff. My server was really nice.
The vibe and menu reminded me of Pondicheri's in Houston and NYC. Prices were not too high given the upscale nature of the place. I ordered the Kejriwal which were two eggs over chile cheese toast. It was good and the colours were striking with the orange egg yolks but the bread was stiff and hard to cut with a butter knife. I was also surprised to find not a hint of spice given the chile in the toast. My breakfast lassi was also surprisingly less sweet than I expected with the dominant taste of oats and cardamom in the drink. Overall, the flavours of the food and drink were more subtle than something I can get at Pondicheri and may reflect British palates. 
I would come here again to explore the lunch/dinner menu though.",-1
5,"We went to four countries in three weeks and ate a lot of good food. Dishoom was our unanimous pick for best meal of the trip. It's rare that a restaurant impresses everyone in my family of four equally, but this place definitely did.
They accept reservations before 5:00, so we booked a table at 2:00 (or 14:00 for the rest of the world) to have a late lunch. It was busy, but we were seating immediately upon arrival.  
We ordered several plates, but the two standouts for us were the cheese naan and the pau bhaji. 
The service was great. Our waiter even tracked us down after the meal to give us the bags we'd accidentally left under the table. We were all in food comas and not thinking clearly.
I usually skip the mid-day beer, but we were on vacation and they had an IPA that was brewed specially for Dishoom. When in Rome (or a hipster Indian restaurant in London at 2:00 on a weekday).",1
5,"I've only been here once for breakfast and it was a spontaneous decision based solely on a recommendation.  But it was a 5 star meal nonetheless.  
Despite its size (Dishoom has three levels), everyone was very welcoming and the atmosphere made it feel like cozy.  And then there was the breakfast food itself.  I'd never consider an Indian restaurant for breakfast, it's just not something that ever crossed my mind.  Dishoom's breakfast menu offered several delicious options though that proved to me that not only is it possible but also fabulous as well.  I ordered the bacon and egg naan sandwich and their house made chai.  The chai was out of this world and included free refills.  And the flavor combination with that sandwich was unbeatable.  Service was attentive.
What I had might be considered a simple breakfast, but that sandwich and tea were one of the highlights of my trip to London hands down.  It might sound crazy considering all the options for breakfast, but I would go out of my way to go back there.",1
4,"First, the space is awesome.  Tons of interesting nooks and crannies.  Location is also fun, especially on a summer weekend.  I really like the community tables as well.  Big enough to fit a lot of parties without overhearing everyone's conversations.
However, the place needs to seriously invest in some kind of cooling or ventilation system.  I mean, goodness, it was probably 95 F in there last night.  That just doesn't work.
On to the food:
- The ruby chicken was creamy, tender, and had a nice pop to it.  Probably my favorite dish
 - The mattar paneer was fantastic.  The combined flavors of the paneer, curry, and peas was something I won't soon forget
- The chicken tikka was below average.  Chicken tikka shouldn't taste like boiled chicken.  Very disappointed
- The black daal was rich and had a very nice smoke flavor
- The pau bhaji was above average.  It definitely did its job of whetting my appetite",1
5,"We were lucky...arrived at about 5:30 on a Thursday and were seated right away.  By the time we left the line was going around the block.  We walked along the canal to granary sq..a fun way to get to the restaurant.  This was our first time.  All our food was delicious!  We ordered the black dal, stewed lamb shank, paneer curry, appetizers and lots of nan to sop up every delicious flavor.  My favorite was the fall off the bone lamb in a slightly spicy rich aromatic sauce. The seasoning of all the dishes was so sophisticated.  Also our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and could guide us in our selections.  This was one of our best meals from our London vacation.",1
5,"I freakin love Indian food in London. There's no place like it other than possibly India itself. It just tastes substantially better, with bursts of flavor. 
Dishoom is no different. It is a very popular restaurant in London with multiple locations. There is always a queue and the best possible way to get in without waiting is to make a reservation.
I made a res at the King's Cross location. The space is bustling, with an amazing bar downstairs and seating both floor level and upstairs. Upon arrival, there was already a queue and I had made res for a lunch hour (although I did hear that their breakfast is pretty darn good). The menu is a little extensive, but innovative than the typical Indian food you would get in LA. The table was just big enough to accommodate all the food we had ordered, so we were lucky. 
 
OKRA FRIES (£4.20). Fine Lady's Fingers for the Fingers. I wasn't the biggest fan of these. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I'm just not a fan of okra. Though the slimey layer was almost non-transparent, I could still taste it. But, if you like okra, you'll love this.  
VEGETABLE SAMOSAS (£3.50). Fine Filo Pastry, Pea and Potato Filling Warmly Spiced with Cinnamon and Cloves. These were delicious. It was light and airy and wasn't heavy. I'm always a fan of samosas and they're one of my favorite appetizers. If you want something on the lighter end that isn't too heavy, get these!  
HOUSE BLACK DAAL (£5.90). A Dishoom Signature Dish-Dark, Rich, Deeply Flavoured. It is Cooked Over 24 hours for Extra Harmony. This was absolutely delicious. I didn't know what to expect. We ordered a medium spice level which was perfect. It went so well with the biryani. I definitely recommend getting this dish.  
 
JACKFRUIT BIRYANI (£8.90). Delicious, Savoury Jackfruit and Delicately Saffron'd Rice, Patted and Cooked with Mint, Coriander, and Sultanas. I loved this dish. It's different than the usual biryani you get at other restaurants. There was so much flavor and surprisingly, the jackfruit tasted like there was meat in it. It's a great dish for the vegetarian and awesome with curry.  
GUNPOWDER POTATOES (£6.50). The seduction is in the Tumble. Potatoes with Brown Skins, Smoky-Grilled, Broken Apart, Tossed with Butter, Crushed Aromatic Seeds and Green Herbs. This is one of the most popular dishes at Dishoom. I thought it was good but not amazing. I mean, they're potatoes and I'd actually rather eat something that consists of curry. If you love potatoes though, you would enjoy these.  
MY FAVORITE DISH. CHICKEN RUBY (£9.50). A Good and Proper Curry Redolent with Spice and Flavour, Tender Chicken in a rich silky 'makhani'sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. I love freakin curry and this is by far, one of the best ones. It's similar to a tikka masala but better than what you would get anywhere in the States. It's rich and creamy and if you love tikka masala, you definitely should get this.  
SPICY LAMB CHOPS (£11.90). They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice and jiggery, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. Blackened by the Grill, but Juicy inside. I thought these were good but I've had better at Tayyabs. The chops had a lot of flavor, and it was grilled nicely, but it wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. Regardless though, I would still order it.  
HOUSE CHAI (£2.50). All things nice: warming comfort and satisfying spice. Made in the proper way. All who have tried it are swearing by it. This was delicious. It was creamy, smooth and had all the right spices. If you're a chai drinker, you'd love this warm drink.  
Overall, I loved Dishoom. For Indian food with a twist, this is the place to go. It's not super traditional, but they do have traditional dishes. The space is amazing and the service was pretty good. The waiter was insisting I visit again the next morning, but I couldn't. I wish I did since their breakfast menu looked amazing and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes and it's a great place for a get together. If you're ever in London, hit up this spot. for other reviews, check out thefoodseeker dot com",1
5,"You can't go to London and not go to Dishoom. It's a fundamental rule of visiting London, in my opinion. If you haven't yet, you should consider trying out their breakfast options, because they really are delicious. The bacon and egg naan possibly changed my life. Plus, free refills on chai to wash down that spice.",1
4,"We need Dishoom on the UWS in NYC. This was my second visit to a Dishoom, with the first three years ago in Covent Garden. The food was very good to excellent. The service was friendly, attentive, and thoughtful. I liked my gin gimlet. This is accessible Indian food at fair prices in a comfortable, contemporary setting. (12 May 18)
TIP: Ground floor seating was very good to fair because a change to the bar seating was underway. The seating on -1, the lower level, appeared cozy and desirable, especially the high tops near the bar. The lower level bar had no seating of its own.",1
5,"This plane is fabulous! You can't throw rock in London without hitting an Indian restaurant, but most of them are suitable for takeaway when you don't want to cook dinner, but not much more. Dishoom actually has chai and it's excellent. The lamb boti kabab and gunpowder potatoes were both delicious and unlike anything we'd had in other Indian restaurants.",1
4,"Dishoom was definitely good, but in not bought into the hype that it is ""the best Indian food"" in London.  I think maybe my expectation was wrong, but the place where I thought this restaurant did best was the more modern interpretation of Indian food which at times bordered more on fusion.  Definitely worth a visit (prepare to stand in line!!!) but check out the menu first to set your expectations around what you're getting.
All that being said I enjoyed our meal here.  Service was super friendly and helpful.",1
5,"Whether you're a local or a tourist, there's no way you wouldn't have heard of Dishoom - because it's one of the best places to have Indian food in London. Dishoom is widely known for the thoughtfully curated modern Indian cuisine and the interior design of its restaurants.
Unfortunately they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 people and the wait can be long but not to fret, all locations have a bar area inside for those who are waiting for a table to grab some drinks first. Try the Calaba Colada, it's like a pina colada with a Bombay twist and trust me, the 45 minute wait won't feel long at all.
Shortly after being seated, you'll get a pretty extensive menu printed on a double sided A3 paper. I'll make this easy for you - for a classic curry, what you should try is the Chicken Ruby. This is rich and flavorful, and the chicken is incredibly tender. You'll get a ton of curry sauce so help yourself to some slow cooked and aromatic biryani. I recommend either the Awadhi Lamb Biryani or the Jackfruit Biryani. I'm a huge fan of both and it's great for sharing. For sides, I like the Gunpowder Potatoes - they're smokey and aromatic with a slight kick to your taste buds. For those who can't pass on paneer at an Indian restaurant, the Mattar Paneer is the way to go. It's rich and flavorful, you can't go wrong with this. And if you find that you have a ton of extra sauce left, a garlic naan or the handkerchief-thin roti is great for this.  
On their menu, you'll also find the specials which are seasonal and usually great for big groups. I got to try the pulled lamb shank on the bone once and it was super tender, spicey and delicious! 
I highly recommend checking out Dishoom, it definitely lives up to the hype. And don't forget to ask for some of their complimentary chutney!",1
4,"Came here based on a recommendation from one of the GF's college friends. We waited about 15 minutes outside, but they give you complimentary house chai for you to sip on. Very delicious and I wish I had taken more than 1 cup of the chai. Once inside, we were handed a buzzer/pager ushered downstairs to the bar where we waited another 30-40 minutes for a table. There the GF and I shared a beer. After waiting we were again ushered upstairs to a table where we ate. We ordered 5 things for £41, and the thing I liked the most was the Dishoom Calamari and the Black House Daal.
This is by far one of the better spots in London. People in NYC recommend it. While not the MOST AUTHENTIC, it the food does live up to the hype.",1
5,"Among the top things I recommend when friends go to London. Loved this place so much that we had to go multiple times when we visited. The housemade chai is delicious. And they also have their own IPA, brewed by Mondo Brewing. It's served bottled though. For starters, the vada pau was great. Even for a soft bun item, it had great texture because of the fried pea sprinkles and I slathered it with the cilantro chutney. More buns came via pau bhaji, which didn't seem to be much at first but it was dense, creamy, savory. Excellent savory app. As for some main dishes, I loved the awani lamb biryani, especially with the spices in it. The chicken ruby, another excellent dish. Creamy, buttery, melt in the mouth chicken. the garlic naan went perfectly with the whole meal.
As for breakfast, we had chai and coffee and the big bombay breakfast, which had masala baked beans, half roasted tomato & mushrooms - both tangy. There was bacon and sausages. There was akuri, a type of scrambled egg. More buns came with this. The breakfast naan rolls were filling too. We had a sausage & egg one. Much saucier than I anticipated.",1
4,"Went for a friend's birthday lunch, and everything was great. We had the set menu, which included an assortment of nibbles and mains and sides, all of which were served in turn and in generous portions. Unfortunately, they ran out of one of the desserts, so we had only the three flavours of Indian style popsicle to choose from. Nonetheless, all was good and I quite enjoyed my mango popsicle. 
Service was excellent. They brought everything out promptly and went out of their way to assist us in various things, ranging extra drinks for select ones of us to helping charge my mobile in their office. The staff were friendly through to the end. A great different nice staff can make, especially for a part of c20 people. 
Ambience was also fab. Typical Dishoom style interior, but I appreciated how they paid attention to the details of maintaining the ""old"" and the history, amidst the modern infrastructure.",1
5,"Dishooooom!!!!!! If you've ever passed by one, you've probably noticed this is the place to go in London. While the wait does take up a bit of time (and reservations aren't accepted) the staff are available with complimentary glasses of the house chai to sip on while you wait until you get to the bar. 
Everything we had was delicious. The star for me was definitely the black daal. Everyone who works there is also extremely friendly!  While this may not be the most authentic Indian food, I can definitely appreciate the cuisine they are producing at a very reasonable price. 
It lives up to the hype!",1
5,"This was our first great meal in London. The restaurant is in old factory but whoever redesigned the whole thing deserves a medal - super stylish and somehow all the elements of the old, new, and foreign mix perfectly together.
We had a wait a tiny bit but the place was packed on a Sunday lunch. My buddy and I ordered the following:
vegetarian samosa
chicken rice
garlic naan
lamb kabob
Everything was top notch but the lamb kabob was outrageously delicious. Super moist and tender and full of spices that popped.
The have a few of these place in London but it's hard to see the other spots topping this place. Highly recommended.",1
5,"Easily the best Indian restaurant in existence insofar as Ive had.  I thought id had indian food before i came here.  
The cocktails were great.  I ordered off the menu twice and they did it right.  The black daal is really yummy.  Try it, even if you are there for a drink itd be well worth it as a snack.
Lamb stew, cooked greens and tikka mahi are all good.  Their red chutney which goes with the fried things as an appetizer is out of the world good.
The place has a cool 1800s indian railway theme going jn the decor department.
Absolutely a wonderful place.  Well worth a planned night out.  Go here and prepare to be impressed.",1
5,"I've been to India. I've eaten real Indian food. The spices here were incredible. The flavors, the tenderness of the meat (melts in your mouth, the crispiness of the Nann and more... I don't think five stars is enough. It was SOOOOOOOO GOOD. 
Get the chicken ruby and rice! Insanely delicious",1
4,Omg this place is so fucking good. If you dint like spicy food then go to ..... i don't know mc do. This is the best Indian food I had in my life ( outside of India of course) if you like indian food this place is a must. You will regret going somewhere else !!!,1
5,This is my new favorite breakfast place! I am a big breakfast girl and between the decor and the tasty originality of the food here I give this place 5 stars. We made a reservation for 4 at 11 am on Sunday and was seated right away. The server was lovely and kept refilling my house chai which was delicious! I will make sure I come back here every time I am in town!,1
5,"I dare you to walk by a Dishoom and not go in after you've eaten here once. Go on, give it a try; I'll wait.
This place is beyond wonderful. I can't think of a single thing wrong with Dishoom. The service is grand, this particular location is stunning, and the flavors are everything that I crave.
Be warned: the queue can be quite long. Two times I was in, we came right before the rush but alas, the third time, the line seemed to go on forever and didn't make it in. (They serve drinks outside for you, as a little teaser to the excellence inside.)
During dinner, we sat at the bar on the main level and felt right where I needed to be. This place is beautiful and though I haven't been to Mumbai, I'd like to think that this is how it must look. Sigh. 
I started with their take on an Old Fashioned. Don't know why I'm drinking these, they're a little sweet for my taste, but the presentation here is sure delightful: served in a small apothecary-like bottle with the ice on the side, it wasn't very strong but that was fine by me.
The dinner menu looked incredible but we didn't want to overdo it. We had the Murgh Malai, chicken marinated overnight in garlic and other tastiness. Yum! The roti is thin and made a great spoon to sup the House Black Daal (black lentils) and wooosh it was delicious! 
To keep things light, we also had the Paneer and Mango salad. The crispy shallot crumbs elevated the salad. 
Breakfast at Dishoom. Oh dear. I didn't want to leave. 
This time we sat on the top floor. It was early so it was slower than usual. My guy ordered the chai while I opted for the fresh-squeezed Pineapple, lime, and black pepper juice. It was so very good and not as acidic as it sounds. 
We also enjoyed the Bun Maska, which was like a toasted sweet roll with a thick layer of BUTTER inside. Its sole purpose in life is to be dunked into the side of Chai tea that came with it. Ooooooh 
The Bombay Omelet was beautiful, but was a little underwhelmed by the flavor. I ended up using the ketchup served on the side. 
So while you can pass on the omelet, do not miss the Kejriwal. Two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. Eggs in London are gorgeous, bright orange, and everywhere I eat, they're cooked to flowing yolk perfection. Theirs is no exception. For this dish, I laughed the ketchup right off the plate. 
Ugh. I want to go back. We don't have anything remotely like this at home. For a great atmosphere, service, food, and overall vibe, make Dishoom your next stop.",1
5,"I got this recommendation from a graduate student friend originally from India but living in the UK. Like his other recommendations as a foodie and a native it did not disappoint. Everything was amazing except the chicken biryani, which was just ok. I went back two days later for lunch to try a few more things. Order the lamb samosa, pau bhaji, chicken tikka roll, and the choli poori. Be prepared to queue for an hour. They will serve you free chai, mint tea, and sherry while in line, which can be out of the door. Once you get inside you can order a nice cocktail at the bar.",1
4,"One of the better spots in London. This is authentic Indian cuisine with an amazingly beautiful and cozy interior and stellar customer service. 
Their menu is tapas style so everything is meant to be shared. You also eat in a magnificent order where the appetizers, main course/meat, and sides are built to complement each other in a stunning way.  
I had the samosas, potatoes, fried okra, and garlic naan and they were good. The samosas were flavorful but I would have preferred a bit more spice (they were heavy on cinnamon and nutmeg). The okra was amazing and I typically hate okra. The garlic naan left a lot to be desired. It would have been better paired with a more flavorful rita. 
The service was the best part. Our server went out of her way to be accommodating and sweet. We went later in the evening after he dinner rush and she never made us feel like we had to hurry and she still had People sing happy birthday to me at the end of our meal. 
My recommendation is to call and determine how long the wait is before going. You'll wait for hours if you aren't prepared.",1
5,"Love this place! Came here a few times over the summer. Don't be intimidated by the long line outside - they are extremely efficient at moving people into tables and serving drinks (even complimentary tea) while you wait. If you're desperate not to wait, you'll have to come early (before 6pm).
The cocktails are a real treat - take a look through the book. As far as food goes, here are my (veg) highlights:
Okra fries
Black daal
Chole bhatura (amazing)
The price point is great, and they're very accommodating about food allergies - I brought a gluten free person here and the staff was very helpful. In general the service is excellent.",1
4,"This is the restaurant that has the following properties:
1/ Everyone in New York suggested that I go here.
2/ Is basically the only restaurant in London that people recommended I go to as I was deciding to move to London.
And today...exactly one month into my time here in London - I've done it! I've gone! I would like to say a few things:
1/ The food was very good. Like high quality stuff.
2/ If you gave to me in a blindfold, tbh I'm not sure how to tell the difference between good and pretty good indian food and so I'm developing a palette which is why we're not at 5 stars yet.
3/ There's always a massive line, but i think* you can make a reservation so I'm not sure why anyone waits in the line?
4/ Favorite dish was the lentil dal on top of a bit of rice.
5/ They also have really cute drinks like the chai punch. Comes in a cute 'peg' (glass bottle) which you pour out onto some solid ice cubes which gives it a look of whiskey (which is part of it).",1
5,"Thank you taking care of us last night with great food and even better drinks.  We ordered cocktails and beers.  Ambience is great.  Worth the one hour wait anytime.  Servers were professional and the tab was reasonable.   3 entrees, 1 garlic nan,  2 beers, and 2 cocktails came out to about 75 pounds.",1
5,"We saw a bustling crowd here on Friday evening where the wait time was approximately 2 hours. Given the enthusiastic crowd, I knew that I must eat here! I made a reservation online for Sunday at 5pm. Tip - they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 after 5:45 PM! 
Sunday came and my gosh, this was some of the best Indian food I've eaten around the world! I've been to India and this food was amazing. Get the vegetable samosas, okra fries, naan and the chicken tikka were great. 
Looking forward to the next visit to London!",1
5,"Phenomenal! Our favorites were lamb chops, daal, curry Ruby chicken, gunpowder potatoes and Pau Bhaji. Absolutely worth the wait. They said 45min and we were seated in 20. If you're visiting London, don't miss it!",1
5,"Based on suggestions from our fellow Yelpers across the pond...we made a point
to try this place out.
Although I was really pumped up to try their Breakfast naan, we didn't make it
on time to try their breakfast menu.
This location at Kings Cross is a pretty spiffy place. We really liked the way
the place is all laid out. Outdoor seating options are also available, but was
too cold for our March visit to try. Note that this place can really get busy,
so it's better if you have a reservation.
As for our lunch visit here's what we tried:
-- Far Far for starters. A crunchy, salty type of cracklings...really good!
-- Dishoom Chicken Tikka...this is pure awesomeness
-- Adwahi Lamb (Biryani)...flavorful and very tender
-- Garlic Naan...soft and tasty
-- Gadbad Mitha...its like mixed bowl of sugar goodness
This place is a MUST visit if ever in the area. Would definitely be back.",1
5,"It had been nearly four years since we'd enjoyed a Dishoom breakfast -- far too long. Thankfully, little had changed. The porridge and chai remain bottomless, the space vast, the lighting low, the service attentive, the Big Bombay delicious, the intention to read the Guardian we grabbed at the entrance outstripping the time we spent with the paper. It remains my favorite way to start a London day.",1
5,"We had a little trouble locating the street but once we found it, we were delighted that the restaurant lived up to our expectations. We enjoyed some rose and cardamom lassi to cool down the spicy chicken ruby, house black daal, and the Dishoom take on the legendary Irani Café special chicken berry biryani with cranberries.",1
5,"Absolutely worth the hype! We got the Ruby Chicken, Mahi Tikka, Garlic naan, bowl of greens, and basmati rice. Not only is the food unbelievably good, but the atmosphere is SO cool - I felt transported to Bombay just walking through the doors. There's always a long wait, but my husband and I arrived at 5:30pm and got seated within 10 minutes - so if you want to get in quickly, go a bit early! Definitely recommend!!",1
4,"""Two of us first tried coming for dinner on a Friday night, but the wait for 2 hours! We went online and made reservations for lunch the next day. They do not take dinner reservations under a certain amount of people (I think 6 people). When we were finally seated, the menu was a bit overwhelming because everything sounded so good! We opted for the lamb samosa, chicken tikka masala, veggie biryani, braised lamb that came with naan, and a side of roti. Oh my goodness, we ordered way too much food for 2 people! The tikka masala was juicy! The braised lamb was AMAZING, and by far my favorite dish. The meat fell off the bone. The sauce was so flavorful. All I wanted to do is soak my naan in the sauce!! 
Overall, if we had to wait an hour, it was definitely worth it. Just plan ahead and make reservations if you can't wait. I'm not sure if the lamb was a special dish for the night or not, but if it's on the menu, order it! You won't regret it. """,1
5,"I've had my fair share of Indian food and they really aren't kidding when they say get Indian food when you visit London! The spices, the flavor, the cook of everything was fantastic. My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after having to wait over an hour at another location and couldn't pass up this opportunity. They send you inside to wait at the bar, which is nice. 
When we were ordering, they explained the menu. It was suggested that we get 3-4 dishes per person since it's quite small. We got 1 order of garlic naan, 1 order of rice, chicken ruby, mahi tikka, house black daal, dishoom calamari, roomali roti. (I don't/can't eat spicy foods so none of these dishes are spicy!) We didn't order a single thing that we disliked. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The only thing I wish they could do it tailor things to people's spice levels, but there were plenty of delicious dishes I had anyway! I highly suggest coming and waiting because it's worth the wait!!!
PS: get the house black daal, it'll change your life :)",1
5,Awadhi lamb has a settle but good flavor of Indian spices. The lamb was super tender and good flavor. Also the Chicken Ruby has a sweeter sauce and the chicken is tender as it compliments the sauce. The food here is great and the service is excellent.,1
5,"This is probably one of the best Indian restaurants that I have ever been to. It is obvious Dishoom makes everything fresh and they make a conscious effort to make every dish different from typical Indian restaurants.  Some of the most memorable dishes were the mahi tikka, spicy lamb chops and gunpowder potatoes. We felt the grills were a bit better than the mains. 
We also tried their breakfast which was decent. The house chai is amazing and the best I have ever had.",1
4,"I visited this restaurant twice in summer 2016 and 2017 with friends. In both occasions we had to queue for around an hour till seated. However the staff didn't spare any effort in making us comfortable while we waited. They offered us traditional Indian tea drinks all the time till we were directed to our table. I find myself obligated to mention the kindness of the staff and there willingness to help. The smile didn't depart their faces.
There are two bars offering wide range of alcoholic drinks. Kingfisher beer is a very popular choice here. My friends liked the wine.
The food is good but not excellent as some reviewers commented. I find it lacking a pinch of salt to kick out all those spices.
I recommend this restaurants for groups of adults and those who want to enjoy a different atmosphere in London.",1
5,"Come in for dinner with a group of friends around 7pm. There was a line around the corner and we decided to join it. A very nice hostess walked down the line letting everyone know it would be about a 45 minute wait (I appreciated the honestly and prepared myself for the wait). Another very nice host walked down offering lemonade and chai to waiting guests. Once a table freed up at the bar area we were offered to come sit and order drinks while we waited for our table. A few minutes later, we were escorted to our table were the menu was explained. We ordered an assortment of dishes a total of 11 for a table of 4. The flavors were rich and went well together. We finished our meal with popsicles (I had the mango one and my husband had the pistachio) Best way to finish our meal. 
My hubby said the Chicken Tikka was the best he's ever had. 
The wait is worth it. Enjoy a delicious meal!",1
5,"So good so good soooooooo gooooooooood! 
When flavors get married and you're invited to their wedding you just can't miss that party!!!",1
5,I'm glad we came here. The best Indian food I have ever had outside of India. Got their daal and murg chicken.,1
4,"I had the ""Kejrwall"" (fried eggs on cheese bread) and the Bacon Naan Roll. Both very well done and tasty. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly.
Definitely a good place where to have a (heavy) breakfast.",1
5,"Dishoom is one of a kind, amazing food and an atmosphere of love. Love the Ruby chicken with Rumali roti!",1
1,"Amazes me that people can say this is the best indian food in London. Surely what a travesty. stood in line for 1.5 hours, with about half outdoor while half indoor where they kept you downstairs and wanted you to partake in their cocktails offered. This was surely inauthentic indian food and overpriced for the portion. Their signature dish is daal which is basically lentils and costs very little to make. Everything is significantly overpriced and made to suit westerners. You don't see any actual Indians eating here, of course they are the smart ones and the Brits that do eat here are either gullible or patsys. The lamb chops we got were burnt to a crisp and the naan and roti we got was horribly overpriced was neither crispy, flavorful, nor appropriately portioned.",-1
1,"Dishroom is stupid,  other restaurant will take yr name and bizz u ten mins before yr tanle ready, bit dishroom nees u to wait in line for hour and a half to get in even after they take yr name. If u leave the line u are out. Non senses.  althought they give u a shot of lemonade while u waiting.",-1
5,"Great place for lunch or dinner. Since you need more than six ppl to reserve for dinner, would be easier to go for lunch instead. The lassi was amazing and so was the naan! The naan comes out hot and soft with amazing flavor and texture!",1
4,"Dishoom was recommended to me by 2 friends so I made a point to come here during my trip to the UK.
I ordered the chicken ruby which was AMAZING! Wanted a second order of it but I was stuffed. Make sure to order naan or rice because these dishes don't come with either. I opted for the garlic naan and it was great!
Black house daal (4/5): now although this is the ""house special"" I didn't think it was particularly good. It's mostly lentils in there and the sauce wasn't really my favorite.
Overall, nice ambiance and good service. Worth a try!",1
5,Omg!!this is the best food ever!!! I will never have anything like this unless I go here. We waited in line to enter the place which they gave us little shot of drinks/alcohol. Then after that line your brought into a room where you can order appetizers which we did and it was great. We finally get seated for dinner and man that dinner was the most amazing dinner I have ever eaten. I can't remember what we ordered because a friend ordered it for us. I tell everyone if you go to London you have to go here if you like foods from India and the experience alone should get you here. The place is a really cool atmosphere too so a plus all the way. I can't say enough about this place,1
5,"I freaking loved this restaurant. Hands down a five star meal. Having a lot of Indian friends has pushed me to try Indian food a lot and this was by far one of my favorite meals. 
We ordered the vegetable samosas to start, the house special daal, the dishoom chicken tikka masala, the naan and garlic naan, and the murgh malai. The murgh malai and the daal were probably my favorite dishes but I honestly enjoyed everything I ordered. The samosas were hot and flavorful, the daal was perfect, and the naan tasted almost like homemade naan. Be warned that they charge £3.50 for water so you might as well order their chai tea. 
Definitely give this a try if you're in the area! Not only was the food good but the ambience was perfect as well.",1
4,"Authentic restaurant serving great egg dishes in the morning that are actually like the ones in Mumbai. We had several Indian people at our table and they concurred.  The atmosphere is fun and eclectic. 
I would not recommend the drinks myself. The lassi drink I had was too protein tasting.",1
4,"This was my first time trying Indian food, and I'm so glad it was at Dishoom.
I was visiting from Boston and Dishoom was recommended by colleagues who are from the area. I've heard Indian food is great in London, so I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed.
We went at around 6:30 on a Thursday and waited for an hour for a table. We didn't mind because they have a great bar downstairs that they bring everyone who is waiting to be seated. The atmosphere is very cool at the bar and in the restaurant in general. Waiting for an hour didn't seem too bad because of the great cocktail list they have.
We had heard that a lot of people usually split plates, but since we all had different preferences, we got our own. I had the lamb with the bowl of greens and garlic naan. All of it was fantastic. Others at the table got the cheesy naan and they said that was also great.
It wouldn't be a place that I was a regular at since it's always so busy, but it's a really fun place to go with a group, and the food is very good.",1
5,"Oh my goodness, this place is heaven on earth. It is one of the most gorgeous restaurants in London (specifically this location) and staffed with the loveliest people. The food is out of this world. I wish I had two stomachs so I could've tried more things. 
We started with the lamb samosas which were amazing: crispy, not greasy, and spiced to perfection. There were three sauces that went from mild, medium to spicy and I preferred the slightly sweet mild sauce. Next was the house chai. This is the best chai I've ever had so far. It was so good I forgot to take a picture until it was just a few drops at the bottom of the glass. 
For our mains we had mattar paneer and mahi tikka with garlic naan. The vegetarian curry was the perfect level of spiciness for me (mild) and I inhaled it quite quickly. The garlic naan was perfect to mop it up with. The mahi was so good. It was clearly very fresh and done perfectly.
I also tried the mango and fennel lassi and the pistachio kulfi. A kulfi is pretty much a lassi in popsicle form. It was a lovely way to cool things down and satisfy my sweet tooth.
I dare say we had a perfect dinner.",1
4,"Well a very nice restaurant... Nice decor, being stayed in Munich for 5 yrs i find the Indian restaurants in London very refreshing.. Well coming to dishoom , dint lunched or dined there as it was always crowded but had breakfast couple of days back to back.. and my gosh it was good... the kakuri burji is good but not excellent, the stuffed nan is certainly recommended and yes to all the Indians that bun maska is very nostalgic(oozing butter) and yes the best thing is that, that you can order as many glasses of tea u wish, u will be charged only for one",1
5,"Staff is nice, food is great!
Long lines suck, but show up late and there will be none!",1
5,"I've been to 3 different locations of Dishoom over several years, and Im baffled at how they all manage to retain quality and consistency.  Last time I was in London, I went twice in 24 hours!
Their naan is excellent, dhal is the perfect complexity of spices, and I always make sure to add some raita to the order to balance out the heat from everything else.  They have an excellent selection of cocktail. 
The staff is friendly, attentive, yet casual.  The environment is stylish without trying too hard.  Expect a wait, no matter what time of day you go.  Its totally worth it though.
This was my first time at breakfast, and now I want an Egg Naan Roll every day - runny eggs wrapped in their tasty naan with tomato chutney, plus a never-ending glass of their chai. Perfect!",1
5,"Great service! Greatest brunch! Yummy naan ! Outstanding chai! 
We had brunch here today and we absolutely loved it.
The service is so great.
I love the chai. I could drink that the whole day.
I tried their naan and egg roll which was so yummy.
My boyfriend got the omelette and was ok.
We are planning to back again for dinner.",1
5,"This place was amazing. We had the Masala Prawns, Jackfruit Biryani, House Black Daal and Naan. Everything was tasty! The shrimp were seasoned and grilled to perfection. The rice was cooked perfectly. The service was amazing as well. The food came hot and was served quickly. I definitely recommend eating here I you are in London.",1
4,"What a super cool place. Old-style colonial decor. Reminds me of the expat areas of Southeast Asia. Very chic-chic yet casual. You can grab a meal or get afternoon drinks or even work away on your laptop (lots of outlets and free wifi too!). A real communal place.
I came for their Indian style breakfasts. Hubby and I split The Big Bombay - an Indian take on the classic English breakfast - and on a whim I ordered the bacon naan roll to boot.
* The Big Bombay (scrambled eggs, 4 slices streaky bacon, 2 sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushrooms, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns £11.50) - sounded terrific but wasn't quite as good in person. The bacon and sausage were good though I liked the bacon more than the sausage. The scrambled eggs, baked beans and pau buns were okay. The grilled field mushrooms were really good. It didn't really add up to anything memorable though. Just bits and pieces of good and okay food. 3.5 stars
* bacon naan roll (4 pieces of naan bread wrapped about slices of streaky bacon smeared with tomato chili jam £5.50) - simply the BEST naan I've ever had. Reminded me a lot of the pizza crusts that come out of those fancy brick ovens. The bread was chewy and charred deliciousness. I would come back simply to get an order of those to gnaw on. The bacon and tomato chili jam were a great addition. 5 stars
Hubby and I both agreed the bacon naan roll was the star of the show. It's so good that if I ever came back I'd probably just order it again and ignore the rest of the menu.",1
4,"I could've eaten everything on the menu. A great concept and terrific food. It's not surprising that there was a 50-yard long line when we left. This Dishoom is also in a beautiful location behind Kings Cross and just off the canal. We had cocktails at a little shack on the canal. Fun!
The only disappointing thing was the cocktails; we tried 4 different ones and they all tasted watered down.",1
5,"You need to go here.
The food is incredible but the absolute highlight is without a doubt, the service. I'm not sure what they pay their staff or what their incentive is, but it truly is 5*. 
Despite a 45 minute wait at lunchtime on a Saturday - I was made to feel as though waiting was not a chore.
Any small issues you may have (unlikely) are quickly resolved.
I'm not usually a dessert person, but I went for their chocolate pudding.. unreal.
Please go.",1
5,"Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Decor & Style: 5/5
This place is the best Indian food i've ever had in the world! and Top 3 restaurant i've ever been to in the world, period!
Biryani, Awadhi Lamb, Cheese Naan, Mattar Paneer were freaking amazing.
The style is also quite different as well. You wait in line (because it's really crowded), however they serve you drinks while you're waiting. Once you actually get inside the building they take you downstairs to the bar area, which reminds me of a Disneyland themed dark, old school, yet modern dungeon. You drink and snack for awhile (30-60 minutes) before your table is actually ready! It makes the whole experience (2-3) hours totally worth it. Can be pricey though! 
Of all the places to see in London, I will be back here next time I visit the UK!",1
5,"What a fun place!! Walking distance from St Pancras train station. Authentic Indian, with nimbu pani, sugarcane juice and - bhaang - on the drinks menu. Vada pav for appetizer, comes with 2 green chilies, Pune style. Roomali roti, with butter chicken (called something else) hits the spot. To say that the service is great is an understatement. Lively staff and fun atmosphere. Must go place.",1
5,"Dishoom at Kings Cross serves fantastic food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food was delicious and filled with flavor and the service is friendly and inviting. The decor of the restaurant has a 60's Bombay vibe to it and the music is lively (you can actually buy the album, which is produced by the restaurant?) The restaurant can get very busy and the wait can be long. We lucked out and was able to snatch a table before the dinner crowd started lining up, but if we were to have to wait it would be worth it. I'll be sure to come to Dishooms again when I'm in the U.K.",1
5,"Came on the recommendation of a friend who eats here ALL the time so I had to see what it was about! The interior itself is beautiful, with a short description of the history of the building at the bottom of the menu. There are a ton of options and the menu is labeled with spicy, vegetarian, and other descriptors (our waiter even offered us vegan or gluten free menus upon request)! Everyone was very happy with their meals- I had the chicken ruby (the flavor was nice but the meat was a little darker/fatty than I had expected) but after seeing what my friends ate I would try the biryani next time! Overall a great experience with naan and roti flowing, made even better by friendly, quick, and accommodating service in a lovely atmosphere.",1
4,"Still the best modern Indian food place in London. We come here every single time we come to London.  This time we got the naali nihari, the naan,the roti, the lamb samosas, and the dishoom calamari.  The lamb samosas were small but tasty. The calamari was a tad bit salty.  However, the Star was totally the nali nihari. Spicy, rich sauce with a tender lamb.The roti was so soft and thin... it was perfect to sop up the sauce to he nihari.  Only bad point was the service; slow and aloof.  Can't wait to go back to London for our next visit to dishoom",1
4,"I still find Dishoom's portion sizes to be rather small, but my brunch experience was pleasantly good. The waiter comped all of us bottomless chai and a virgin bloody Mary, and gave each of us a voucher for a free tipper and breakfast.
I like food from the dinner menu more, but it's a nice place to chill for brunch.",1
5,"Amazing Amazing place!! It is modeled after old Irani cafes and Railway canteens in Mumbai during the British Raj. The attention to detail in the decor is stunning! Even more stunning is the authenticity of the food! We got the Chili cheese toast, Keema Pav, Chole Puri with halwa and the Paneer Rolls along with Kala Katta sherbet and Mango lassi. Each and every item was brilliant - the mango lassi was light and refreshing- just like what we get in India!",1
5,Vegetable samosa's and gunpowder potatoes were fantastic. Definitely one of the best Indian places that I've been to in London. Great service and location as well! Good place to go to whether you're eating out with your family or hosting an event.,1
5,"We waited an hour in line, but they were so hospitable and served hot chai and sherry to those waiting, and it was a cold night, and they came back several more times with more warming drinks, what a great way to start. Once inside, the place is very spacious and cozy, three levels of dining and drinking, all buzzing with happy customers. Everything we ordered lived up to my dreams of having a great Indian meal while in London. The service is great, drinks also good, and the whole experience felt like a party. I'd definitely recommend this place and wish they would open an outpost in San Francisco!",1
5,"My favorite Dishoom! (Also the first one we'd been to!) We had a wonderful server who upon hearing we were vegetarians recommended the Pau Bhaji as it was his favorite dish on the menu. It was perfectly delicious! Tried it at a different Dishoom later and it was not the same! We paired it with a rose lassi and a mango lassi. And shared the Mattar Paneer with rice. The rose lassi was surprisingly great, we wish we could recreate it at home. Everything was delicious, the service was nice + friendly and the ambient was lovely. We would definitely come back.",1
5,"Being use to Indian food, I wonder if this place would give me the taste I like. First you enter and the place is huge. You can't tell who are the waiter compared to the customers but you get nicely welcome and invited to wait in some comfy seat with a buzzer to let you know when you table is ready. 
Once seated, the lady explained and advice on the menu. And we are ready to share Indian food and have a nice time. 
Everything we tried except the fish where tasty.
The drink especially the lassy was excellent. 
I am not disappointed at all by this place and would highly recommend it. Some people might say it's not as spicy as in India but still the taste is there and we love it!",1
5,"Went there for dinner when on a trip to London. Easily one of the best Indian meals I've had, from the fluffy slightly charred naan bread to the fragrant rich curry. I cannot understand how they can make food taste like this. Everything was so good. We had the chicken ruby, sheekh kebab (lamb), paneer tikka (charred cheese) and of course naan. Way too much for two people but they're so good.
The wait gets a bit insane unless you come here at odd hours.",1
4,"A delight to the eyes, stomach but not the wallet.
What an amazing looking place! Sure we had to queue for an hour to get in but they served us mint tea and sherry while we waited out in the cold October air. I just couldn't get myself to hate such a nice deed..  after all it was our decision to stay!
Getting in we were told that we had to wait a bit longer until the electronic buzzer on the caller went off and someone came and collected us. So we waited and helped ourselves to the exotically named cocktails. Mine was a ""Bombay"" Colada.. whis is an Indian spiced pina Colada. I did ask for a Mai tai first but learned that the whole idea of Dhishooms was about Bombay and the food and drinks from there.
When we were taken to the seats we were told that its best to order food to share so we did:
Lamb chops: these were exquisitely grilled with a coating of spice but the gamey taste of the lamb was somewhat retained. I am not a big fan of the lamb being gamey but this was acceptable. The pieces were thicker than I expected and biting into it I tasted the fat which was delicious. I was thinking initially that I have tasted better but in reality I had tasted different as this was unique and as equally as good as I have tasted on commercial road. 
Black Dhal: wow! Tasted amazing and a great accompaniment to my butter narn. The Dhal reminded me of a black bean but the sauce was thick and rich like a vindaloo without the heat. 
Paneer: sadly disappointing as I felt it was under done but maybe it's the way they do it in Bombay. 
Chicken: sadly it was so average I forget what it exactly was called. 
Vegetables: again some spiced boiled vegetables. Nothing to shout about.
The place by the way is huge and is styled like an indian resthouse with everything relating to a Mumbai from the 1950s. A sheer joy to be in and with lots of atmosphere. My only question  is if they have a Hindi menu which might be more special.",1
5,"Great Bombay food. Exotic. Portion size is not very Bombay-like though. But not complaining as quality more than made up for it. More here: 
bengalibiped.blogspot.co…",1
5,"Such a great Indian spot. We came here with a large party for a company dinner and we had such great food. There was a great variety of food options for vegetarians and people with dietary restrictions. They had a great, diverse drink menu.",1
5,This place is huge and very cool design.  The food is really put together with care and quality ingredients. The cheese and garlic Naan were both tasty. The okra fries were crunchy and light. The paneer was my favorite! The curries were good also. The lamb biryani was flavorful. Everything we ate had a lot of flavor.  I also loved the pistachio kulfi... so creamy!! Get the kulfi!,1
4,"The area behind Kings Cross is changing with food choices now expanding beyond Caravan and the Grain Store on Granary Square.  Exciting stuff, where will it all end?!
I've been to a couple of the other branches of Dishoom across London and really like the concept which, according to the blurb, is based on the old Iranian coffee shops around Bombay.  This translates into a great selection of interesting drinks and nibbles to be enjoyed throughout the day.
I came here for a casual business meeting and we found a quiet lower table in the corner.  Free chai-fi :-)
Only snacks on this occasion.  Ordering a chicken tikka sandwich sounds like a bit of a cop-out but the filling was truly delicious and very different from the generic flavouring prevalent in shop bought versions.  The chicken wasn't died red and beautifully spiced.  It came in a chappati which didn't really work that well for a wrap, especially as I tried to combat it with cutlery (this was a business meeting after all) - too tough and tha chappati won in that I didn't eat most of it.  The okkra fries are amazing and I know I'll find an excuse to order them with everything on future visits.
Staff were very friendly but overly keen to clear empties.  I suppose Dishoom strives on a quick turnover and we may have overstayed our welcome a bit?",1
4,"If you don't mind not being able to book & probably having to queue, Dishoom is really worthwhile.  Slick informal but very efficient & friendly service,  a young crowd, excellent food and interesting and delicious cocktails.  Food is not your average High St Indian, it's subtle but very tasty, portions smallish but it's not expensive so easy to order a variety.  A bit noisy but that's part of the general buzzy atmosphere. But the main attraction is authentic spicy Indian food unlike almost anything else you'll find, and well worth the wait/queue Unless it's raining - this is London, after all, so take an umbrella, though I was pleased to be offered one by the restaurant as I waited in the rain!",1
5,"Waited in line for two hours to eat here. Not sure if all location are this busy during weekday dinner time. We ordered a variety of dishes including the okra fries, bhel, chicken ruby, awadi lamb biryani, nalli nihari with bheja, roti, and garlic naan. 
My favorite was the chefs special nalli nihari with added bheja. The meat was so tender and flavorful. Also, I loved the okra fries. I wanted to order more fries at the end but I was just too full from all this food. Everything tasted great. Best Indian meal I ever had. I recommend coming here and getting that chefs special !",1
5,This was absolutely one of the best overall food experiences that we have ever had. A great introduction to Indian cuisine. The ambiance was perfect. Every single dish was flavorful and delicious. The service was exceptional as well. The waitress provided excellent recommendations based on our palette.,1
5,"This place is totally cool! I went to the King's Cross location. It's so sceney and hip! You've gotta try it just for the hip London atmosphere! Never mind that the food is out of this world delicious!!
We didn't have to wait for our table as long as we thought we would and when we got there, the service was great, friendly and informative, and the food was to die! It's what eating delicious Indian food in a super cool, impressively designed atmosphere should be! 
Everyone on the staff was incredible! They even gave us brunch coupons when we left, encouraging us to return. We were tourists, but the next time we are in London, we will definitely be back! Don't sleep on this place!",1
3,"This review is for BRUNCH! I have had dinner at dishoom and it has made me fall in LOVE with the whole Bombay cafe aesthetic. As always, the atmosphere that dishoom provides is unparalleled. You truly feel like you have stepped into another time and place. The music that they play can actually be purchased too, great for all those dishoom hardcore fans.
I ordered seasonal fruits with yoghurt, along with an egg naan 'sandwich' of sorts. The yoghurt was both creamy and flavoursome, with hints of vanilla coming through. The naan was good, but not the amazing I have come to expect at a restaurant like this. The naan was a little on the hard side, and the chutney along with the egg did not offer tastes that were new or unique. Maybe dishoom is just too good for their own sake. I would vote this place as a top 10 London dining experience. Though if you can, go at a later time. Dinner time.",-1
4,"Fantastic food.
We ordered a bunch of dishes to share between 4 adults and 1 child and I loved every bite.
My favorites were the Grilled Masala Prawns, the Mahi Tikka, the Chole Frankie, the Gunpowder Potatoes and the buttered naan bread. So yummy!
That red spicy dip on the table was also incredibly good.
I can't award 5 stars though cause they made several mistakes on our bill that needed to be corrected.",1
5,"Best Indian food ever.... lamb chops - tender... kheema pav - must try. Awadi biryani cooked in the pot. I don't drink, but tried Bombay colada and sugar cane juice... yum. Unique desserts- chocolate pudding w Kashmiri chillie ice-cream.. goes in sweet and then the spice hits you... very addictive. Also, try pineapple crumble w crushed pepper.. a taste to remember... All of this w a great ambiance!!!",1
5,"I had been meaning to try Dishoom for quite some time but had always been too impatient to wait in line. They don't take reservations for the evening but by chance we found that it was possible to make a lunchtime booking. 
One of our friends was visiting from the States and it seemed like the ideal opportunity to check out Dishoom. The venue was a large open space spread over many levels and the smell of Indian food hits you as you walk through the door more than whetting the appetite. Our server was good at explaining the menu and gave good suggestions on what to order. It seemed like Indian tapas so we ordered a wide range of dishes which we all shared. The highlights were the vegetable samosas, gunpowder potatoes, the Black House Daal and the chicken ruby. There was also a good fish curry which I can't remember the name of. Everything we ordered was eaten.
It lives up to the hype, definitely worth the wait although I would book a lunch slot if I ever went again!",1
4,"Excellent choice for Indian - love the authentic, traditional Chai served in a glass.  Tried a few basic dishes, everything was great.  Restaurant is in an old renovated warehouse space, very cool spot.  Blazing fast free ""ChaiFi"" which is nice.  I'll definitely be back...",1
3,"I was pretty disappointed with my visit to Dishoom King's Cross. I have been to the Soho location and had a great experience so I was looking forward to my friday night Dishoom plans with eager anticipation. 
We arrived at around 6:15 and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we headed down to the bar. I ordered a mango lassi at the bar and was underwhelmed by the drink. It was too sour and weak on the mango taste. 
We were seated in the basement space which is quite dark but the booths are quite charming and comfortable. I ordered the Bhel to start which was soggy and missing the ""chatpatta"" flavour of a good Bhel. The pommegranet seeds were a great addition though. For my main I got the mattar paneer and Naan. The curry was great - no complaints. However my naan was not warm when it arrived. This sucks because we all know that a good naan is best consumed hot!
My dining partners were surprised that the Ruby Chicken was packed with a spicy punch while the Lamb Biryani wasn't too spicy though it was marked as such on the menu. It's frustrating because you should be able to trust the spice levels on the menu. They were very happy with their roomali roti which was great! 
My theory is that since we were seated in the basement the food was sitting in the kitchens for a bit before it got brought down. This sucks because it lessens the food experience. 
Now overall upto this point I would have given this experience a 4 star review. However - when the check came the waiter had added an ""optional 12.5% tip"" onto our bill. When I asked him about it he said it was ""optional"" and there as a recommendation but it had been added into our total which made no sense. So either the waiter was backtracking after being caught in a lie or Dishoom writes their bills where they give the big bold total with an optional tip added in. 
Regardless of which it is - I really disliked the lack of honesty with the process. I'm from Canada so tipping is actually a very normal thing. However, it shouldn't be added to the bill without being told! 
Will probably be back for the food and will definitely be checking the bill!",-1
5,"First trip to london. On a rainy evening, we headed drenched in rain towards dishoom. There was a long wait outside but we were greeted with chai and umbrella. we were initially taken down to the bar area but our table was soon ready. the food was probably the best indian food i have eaten outside of india. highly recommend this place",1
4,"Their Indian brunch game is pretty off the rails at Dishoom. This leads me to think that all of the food here is great. They are putting a modern spin on Indian cuisine, like putting spices and flavors into things that you wouldn't normally associate with Indian. Their cocktail game is pretty tight also, same concept. 
It's modern, hip, and decorated in English-influenced colonial Indian style, so it's pretty interesting inside. And, it's only about a 10 minute walk to the train station, so if you have some extra time... pop over for at least a cocktail.",1
5,"I'm really enjoying my trip to Europe so far because there are a lot of additions to my 5 star list of restaurants. This was the only 5 star (in my opinion) restaurant that I ate at in London and I have to say that this place is actually incredible. If you want any indicator that this place is great, almost every day there are scores of people lined up outside waiting to get in and get a taste of this delicious meal. 
We got there at around 5pm and didn't have to wait (we had to head to a show afterwards) so that was fortunate for us! I personally ordered the calamari, Dishoom chicken tikka, garlic naan, and one of their mango ice cream desserts. The calamari was one of my top five calamaris that I've ever had because the flavors and spices gave it a little kick that made the dish perfect. It also had a nice crispiness to it which I loved. The garlic naan paired nicely with the chicken tikka because it balanced out the spiciness of the chicken (which, in all fairness, was not that spicy). Finally, the dessert was fantastic as well. The prices were also pretty decent for a place this good so you should either come early and eat delicious food or wait in line and then eat delicious food. Either way, you have to eat at this place.",1
5,Probably my favorite place to eat in London. Had to go there more than one time during my trip. The first time I went I got the lamb with rice. The second time I went I got some brunch. Both times the food was excellent. Definitely a must go place when in London.,1
5,"Came here with my boyfriend for brunch. So incredibly delicious! I recommend getting a hot chai, the sausage naan roll, and the porridge! Yum!",1
1,"i propa hate eating desi food in this country. Nothing is spiced accordingly and they do some blasphemous things to a beautiful and rich cuisine. honestly if you're indian don't eat Indian food in england, especially in Central London. i prefer restaurants in the West end and in East London. Even though they're mostly bengali owned at least they know how to SPICE THE DAMN FOOD NOT EVERYTHING TASTES LIKE ITS MADE OF MALAI....
ALSO WHY THE EFF DO U THINK BACON AND EGG NAAN IS A GOOD IDEA??? I CANT BELIEVE U SELL OUT TO THE COLONISER SMH LUV URSELF DECOLONISE THE FOOD GODAMN",-1
5,The food was outstanding! I tell people that I don't like Indian food but this place completely changed that story. Had no idea how good it really could be.,1
5,"We waited 1 1/2 hours on line outside in the cold to get into the bar area and another 1/2 hour to get into the restaurant and it was worth it! Incredibly delicious food and warm and welcoming service from everyone we encountered. They even served warm chai and mint water to people waiting in line outside while thanking us for our patience and loyalty to the restaurant. My friend Meredith was so kind for sharing one of her favorite places with me! It's near the Kings Cross station.  Had vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, chili cheese toast, garlic naan, bowl of greens, matter paneer and basmati rice.",1
4,"I'm going to give them 4, only because of their sneaky 12,5% service charge pre added to the bill. More and more places are doing this now and I'm not okay with it. Put a suggestion, but already added to the bill? No-no. 4£ tip for a 25£ breakfast is HUGE! 
The food was delicious, I had the sausage and egg naan which was everything I expected, with a freshly squeezed orange juice. This dish is my new FAVE and will be my first stop the second I step off the Eurostar. 
My partner had the big Bombay breakfast which for him, needed slightly more on the plate to be a real big breakfast, but hey. 
The chocolate chai tea latte wasn't balanced so you couldn't taste the chai at all, unfortunate. 
The decor and mood is amazing, and (surprisingly!) they take breakfast reservations, although arriving at 9 and leaving at 10.30, there was definitely no need for them. 
Service overall was efficient and friendly enough, not enough to warrant me giving them a 4£ tip though. 
A definite keeper and I look forward to returning.",1
4,"Ordered some Bombay drink and lamb rice, also chicken balls. Nice place and lucky me only queued for 10 minutes to get a bar stand!",1
4,"This was my second Dishoom experience, though first one at this location near Kings Cross. We rolled by around 11am on a Saturday and got right in which was magical. 
Fantastic place as usual - great service (also really fast!), excellent food (those okra fries - yum!) and excellent ambiance. Not too loud for London so it was nice to actually have a conversation. 
I'm happy I live so close - I'll be back!",1
5,"I love Dishoom more than life itself. More than my two younger siblings and the woman that gave birth to me (and they really are the best). More than watching a Keith Moon, Slash, Bowie, Bruce Foxton, Mick Gallagher supergroup gig (oooh that was tough!). More than how my lil heart keeps me alive (I'd swap an egg naan roll for a portion of heart any day of the week). More than....well everything. Honest. Ok, so the service isn't always the quickest but strangely that only seems to be the case when the restaurant is quiet, during peak times it works like clockwork. And yep sometimes it can be quicker to run the London marathon, twice, rather than queue and wait for a table but whats an hour or two in a queue right in return for a Dishoom chip butty!? ('Vada Pau' if you were wondering). 
The food, in particular the breakfast menu, is amazing. Great quality, and tasty. Don't expect your usual local curry house menu. The portions for dinner aren't overly huge so you may want to order a side or two to go with them. I've eaten here for breakfast about 15 or so times now and it's definitely a favourite if not THE place to find me of a morning (oh hello there stalkerface). There's lots of choice for the lunch/dinner menu too. This particular Dishoom is a really airy building spread out on different floors, go and take a wander if you have time. I love all of the pictures of India on the walls. Its great for big groups here too. There's an awesome bar 'The Permit Room' on the lower floor where the toilets are that I haven't tried yet but looks great.
My favourite dishes are: the infamous breakfast naan rolls (egg please), the breakfast Akuri (spicey scrambled eggs), the chai is good and unlimited (although I think that's only at breakfast time, anyone know?) The wraps are great for lunch too and pretty much any of the curries and naan breads for dinner are winners as well. Oh what the hell, just stay for the whole day with a good book and eat your way through all the menus. Ask for a breakfast loyalty card if you're not offered one, 5 breakfast visits and a stamp each time earns you a little thank you and a naan roll and some chai on your next visit. 
I was there last Tuesday, oh and Friday and will most probably be there on Monday. My face, coming to a Dishoom near you soon.",1
5,"My husband and I have been waiting anxiously to eat here! I booked lunch reservations over a month ago, I really wanted to eat here for dinner but everything had been booked weeks in advance! We came all the way from the U.S (for sightseeing obviously) but I researched quite a bit about Indian restaurants and dishoom outbid the rest by bloggers and reviews. We were blown away by the ambiance, the vibe, the smells and sights of small gestures every where that will remind you of Bombay or India in general. The food is outstanding! You can't go wrong with ordering, we enjoyed the lamb samosas and chili cheese toasts for apps, my husband and I shared the paneer tikka, and we got a side order for cheese naan and basmati rice. Honestly everything was just perfect. Everything everyone else ordered looked perfect. The only downside is I wish we had saved room for dessert but were too stuffed to go any further. We will recommend this restaurant to all our family and friends who come to visit London. High five to the brains of this restaurant and compliments to the chef!",1
4,"Excellent place to eat Indian food in London. In general the food is not greasy and has a lot of flavor. Started with the okra fingers which were fried but not greasy, and a nice vegetarian starter. The chili cheese toast was a nice appetizer and came with 4 pieces of toast. The chicken tikka was grilled after being marinated as was the paneer tikka. The black daal was excellent as were the spicy lamb chops. No meal is complete without some rice and some naan, both of which were very good. Although a chain restaurant, this was one of the best Indian meals I've had in a long time.",1
5,"Tucked behind King's Cross, an amazing first dining experience in London for us.
The two of us came for Sunday dinner, told that the wait was ~45min but we could wait downstairs at the bar. The downstairs area had a cool, lively atmosphere. There is no cell service, but they have free wifi to counter that problem. 
We ordered a Bombay Colada and an Edwina's Affair, the former being sweet and tangy, the latter being quite minty and refreshing. It wasn't even 30 min and we were already called for our table. We were seated on the main floor towards the back. 
With such a big menu - we got the Murg Malai and the Mahi Tikka (both Grill dishes). These were both very delicious and though the portions seemed small, they were very filling. We also got the Black House Daal signature, which wasn't that flavorful to our surprise. Overall, very price friendly and delicious flavors. We got 1 rice & 1 naan, but the naan was only 1 full piece so we had to order another. 
It was such a great meal, we came back a few days later. The second time coming, there was no wait as we came during a weekday for lunch around 11am. We got the Chicken Tikka (grill dish) and the Mattar Paneer (a curry). We loved both. We also ordered the masala chai, which comes with 5 refills. It was a drink packed with a strong, spicy flavour. It was delicious. 
The service was very good the first time we came - we were impressed since it was very busy but they did well in coming by frequently to check on us and the hosts at the door were great. 
For some reason during our second visit, they sat us at the very back with no other tables, even though there was a handful of tables available towards the front upstairs where everyone else was. We asked to be moved, which they did so kindly. They were not as attentive to getting us water refills and checking on us, though we still enjoyed our time.
We didn't have the chance to come here for breakfast but would love to in the future. Highly recommended for anyone who wants some great Indian cuisine in a modern setting.",1
5,"It's great. Not a tourist trap at all. Wonderful food. Be ready for a 1+ hour wait, even during the week.",1
4,"A look at the queue in front of Dishoom just gives you an idea of the buzz that surrounds this indian concept...it's crazy, and so was my excitement yesterday night for my first try. This type of buzz is certainly something I've never seen where I'm from (Bruxelles). 
Food is definitely 5-stars-worthy: I've rarely eaten such tender and tasteful pieces of chicken (Murgh Malai), their Dal is a classic, and I totally got why, same story goes for their special : a lamb stew slowly cooked for months, well maybe not but surely tasted like it. So YES, Food = delicious. But...
What I'm not sure is if this very good indian food is worth the 1h30min wait (30min outside, 1 hour in their Permit Room). To be honest, I've heard such good things about London Indian's restaurants even before Dishoom existed...in a few words, I'm pretty sure I can find about the same quality in a more well, ""normal"" indian place I guess...not sure if their strategy will pay off in the long run.
Anyway, the place looks like a Museum, team is lovely, and they even offer chai tea while you're waiting in the cold. Nice right ? 
PS : Trying their breakfast/brunch might be the best tip if you'd kill to go there, without the waiting the waiting part.",1
5,"Holy cow! Who would have thought you could have bacon and egg naan for breakfast! 
This is my first time having Indian for brekky and let me tell you, it was AWESOME! I had looked up Dishoom before I got to London and saw great reviews. I gotta agree with everyone that it was really good! 
Let me start with the chai - order once and get free top ups! But it was soo good! You could really taste the spices!! The way it should be!
Now to the food!! Simply a really good twist to fusing Indian and western brekky. Think of it as instead of a sausage mcmuffin, you get a sausage naan!! Same with a bacon and egg naan!!
Any ways, all in all great experience. The restaurant itself is really nice as well!",1
4,"Cool.
Dishoom is one of those really hot restaurants (with multiple locations) in London currently that I didn't think I'd end up going to, but actually ended up going to. 
Service was mostly disingenuously friendly at first, especially after some initial confusion of whether or not it was permissible to order food at the bar. (The hostess had suggested it wasn't.) The bartender seemed cheerfully annoyed when we were not ready to order within 5 seconds of sitting down, as if he expected us to fire away our order despite lack of introduction to anything on the menu, which took some time to sift through. Not even halfway through our meal, where the dude had spent most of his energy avoiding eye-contact and chatting with other servers, he decided it was finally acceptable to desert us all-together, which was most fortunate because a better server took over. Enough about service, let's cut to the food --
There were some good things at Dishoom. The standout was the ""ruby chicken,"" with a silky red sauce that you just want to leave nothing behind of by burying a piece of naan into, again and again. And then there were some forgettable things, like how a lassi is still just a lassi, which leaves no surprises. 
Overall, I thought the fare at Dishoom had some nice spices and flavoring going on. It was also fun to have the chance to taste many different, interesting sauces. Harsher criticism includes a mild irritation against servers who seem to have gotten caught up in their own personal aesthetics, putting on glassy smiles that match the shiny restaurant interior, which lest we forget, is still an imitation of the real thing at best. 
Aw look, I can be a douchebag for fun too.",1
5,"Great brunch, tons of food for the price as well. The egg naan was great, and bun maska comes with a chai tea for dipping. The Bombay breakfast is enormous and the porridge is bottomless. And the best part is that it all tastes great and is only a  5 minute walk from Kings Cross!
Food comes out working minutes due to electronic order taking, some outdoor seats available as well.",1
5,"Had heard a lot about Dishoom which tries to replicate quintessential Mumbai Cafe's and was surprised when we found one Tucked away behind Granary Square, Kings Cross. We decided to try it out and it was indeed a new one which had just opened.
The Decor - from the moment you enter has a Indian touch, or rather a Mumbai (Bombay) feel to it with Hindi Scripts and Indian artefacts and humour. The music is retro Bollywood and the menu is local Mumbai. I found the dishes reasonably priced. I ordered a Dishum Chicken Tikka(£7.50) and a portion of Cheense Nan (£2.50). My fried decided to go light and ordered from the light bites - he ordered a Bhel (Street food made with Puffed Rice), Vada Pav (Check out my review of Sree Krishna Vada Pav) and a glass of Sugarcane Juice. We decided to share a portion of Gunpowder Potato(£5.20) (Roasted Potatoes with hot chilli and spices).
 
The food quickly arrived and literally blew me away! It had the heat and spiciness, the kind we get in an Indian restaurant in India! It was refreshing and there was no attempt made to tailor it to local palate. I looked around me and saw the majority of clientele were non-Indians and were obviously enjoying the food, a big change from the standard curry joints.
The menu has only two curry dishes and all other stuff are authentic Indian stuff. The waiters are extremely friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.
It was a bombardment of senses - I closed my eyes for an instant and The Decor, food, the smells of incense sticks and the old Bollywood songs transported me to my favourite Mumbai cafe.
 
Highly recommended.
PS :  Dishum are giving away £10 vouchers to every visitor which can be redeemed between Jan and Mar at their Kings Cross Branch, minimum spend of £40 required to claim.",1
5,"So far I have loved every single Dishoom that has opened and if I may dare say it, it might be my favourite chain restaurant.
Like their sisters the venue is massive consisting of three floors, up stairs for the formal restaurant, ground floor for the lounge and downstairs for the bar area. All children friendly though as I saw families with children  in every section. 
As we made a reservation and I highly recommend it if you want to be seated immediately, we were seated upstairs.
With views over to the ground floor the place felt big and airy maximised by its high ceilings. Although I was quite confused to why the ceiling fans were still turned in the middle of Winter wasting electricity and not helping the place keep warm. 
The wooden decor was lovely though, dark mahogany with its spiral staircase and simple dangling lamp shades. Noise levels drown out and the seating layout allow you to wind down happily with your companions.
As this was a breakfast date was my partner we went crazy and ordered the following:
Sausage and egg naan roll. 
The dough had a lovely bite to it being stretchy and warm. The flavour almost creamy with a nice smokiness to it from the browning. It was filled with sausages that could have been cooked slightly less to have kept its lovely juices and bounce being quite dense. But the flavours and spices redeem itself and paired with the two delicious runny sunny side up and a good kick from the chilli jam I still enjoyed it very much.
Chilli cheese toast with two fried egg. 
I found the cheese toast slightly on the overcooked side. But that's because I prefer my cheese more stretchy but the flavours were rich, well spiced and plentiful of herbs creating an extreme mix of flavours in one bite. Delicious. The runny yolk help add that beautiful moisture and earthiness that added to the tasty experience.
Bombay omelette 
So much flavour! The minced meat was so beautifully spiced my tongue was trying to keep up with all the taste. I noticed a pattern here is that they like their things well done. The egg itself was slightly overcooked for me I found it lost its silkiness and became crisp. But once given all can be forgiven by the flavours and together eaten with the soft buttered toast, washed down with my chai tea it was totally awesome. 
Keema per eedu. 
A very rich spicy dish of minced chicken and liver pieces topped with potato chips and a runny egg. The only dish where I'm not complaining that something is overcooked. The tender pieces of chicken went really well against the softer smoother kidney pieces. Together with the crunches from the potato chips and soft runny egg the sensation in my mouth was amazing. The spices used was also incredibly fragrant and not just there for the kick. It was also served with soft fluffy buttered toasted buns which were helpful in reducing the heat. Delicious and very filling and wholesome.
Although this is a brunch review I have also been for dinner and it was just as mind blowing and expressive. Whether it's for a date, casual dining or special celebration I'm sure Dishoom caters for everything. It's in such a location too, near Granary Square right beside the lovely canal. Service has been friendly every time I visit. 
Did I mention that if you order Chai Tea it comes unlimited? So awesome.",1
5,"This Dishoom is a little bit less crowded than the Central London ones. I recommend going for brunch around 11AM and you may avoid the queue. Decoration is nice too, food is a good fusion British / Indian. I loved it. that's a 5 staaaaars !!!!!!!!!!",1
3,"I ordered the bacon naan for a quick breakfast take away and honestly I was quite disappointed. The naan bread was dry and there was barely any bacon. The bacon was good but also quite dry but not crispy.
The only highlight was the tomato chutney which was amazing and I could have eaten it with a spoon.",-1
4,"As good as Indian restaurant can get. There's a modern flare so don't expect pure classic Indian taste like a Dhaba. The only thing that was close to perfection was the Cholay Bhatooray. 
Samosa - 3.5/5 
Chilli cheese sandwich - 2.5/5 (least fav item)
Lassi- 4/5 (very impressed with presentation, flavor and consistency)
Chai- 4/5 (excellent chai and definitely a must)
Cholay- 3/5 (could use some redesign and needs to be spicier)
Bhatooray- 4.5/5 (most well executed item here) 
Didn't blow my mind. Worth a stop but not the hype.",1
5,"London is so lucky to have multiple Dishooms!
Every dish we have eaten here has been perfect! And the choices on offer will give you something to think about, they are all so very good.
Staff is always helpful and welcoming, and this place can get crazy busy. Don't let that stop you, join the brief queue and you will be glad you did!
Enjoy!",1
5,"THIS. BRUNCH. 
Open at 9am weekends, Dishoom's expansive space is the holy grail of brunch in Kings Cross.  
Our group of 3 tried almost all offerings on the menu, I can heartily vouch for: 
KEEMA PER EEDU: A Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicate
morsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs and
sali crisp-chips. Served with pau. £7.90. (SO RICH and delicious)
HOUSE GRANOLA: A Dishoom recipe, handmade with oats, seeds, cashews, almonds, pistachios and cinnamon, toasted in butter and honey. Served with fresh fruits,
Kerala-vanilla yoghurt and Buckinghamshire honey. £5.20 (Your friends will say they'll share but they won't, everyone get their own granola -- you'll thank me!) 
The service was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. Flawless. It was an exceptional brunch, so much so that I've convinced my friends to go back next weekend. 
Pro tip: if you think you've had real chai...wait til you've tasted the glory of Dishoom's offering. It is comfort in a glass. I order a single espresso with it for a little kick, but they keep the chai coming (free of charge!) after you finished a glass. Pair with the Musaka bun (buttered bun) for dipping, and holy wow you've got yourself a winning breakfast treat.",1
5,"Is it weird when I give 5 stars but the daal makhani was the best dish on the menu? Yeah, sorta. But that's ok! The daal is really just that good. We also got tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, the lamb dish (similar to lamb jalfrezi) veggie korma, chicken biriyani, and samosas. Of all of them, I would recommend any, though the veg korma was not as mindblowing.
Also they make great cocktails. Luckily (or semi-unluckily) the line (queue) was so long you'll have a chance to try a few before your meal. The first part of the line takes place outside. In the late fall chill, this kind of sucks but they do ply you with free sherry, mint tea and chai. The second part of the line is in the downstairs bar where you'll be temporarily seated and can order drinks and two snack options. Of the two, get the banana chips. The various chutneys are excellent.
Once you're actually seated the good comes out quick too. It almost seems like a wonder the line is so long, given how fast they actually work, and the size of the place, but that just speaks to it's well earned popularity.",1
5,"Best Indian I have had in years. Eye for detail, great quality and meaningful decor. Def worth the 20mins wait. Friendly service, as I was offered lemonade and tea during the wait
Had the black dal and spicy lamb chops, with garlic naan and lamb samosas.",1
5,"We have been hearing phenomenal reviews about Dishoom from friends, and locals while visiting London, and decided to give it a go on Wednesday night.  Since we are staying near St. Pancras Station, we opted for the location in Kings Cross.  No reservations could be made for small parties so we just ventured out around 8 hoping to avoid any huge lines.  Unfortunately, this was not the case and we were promptly greeted with a line with a queue time of  1 hour.  This did not phase us or persuade us to leave due to the fact that these people were gathered here for a reason and we were ready to find out what that was.  As we waited in line, we were offered a water, hot mint tea or a sherry.  Since it was a little chilly, I opted for the hot mint tea.  After our complimentary drink in line, we had the option presented to us to sit at the bar and eat which we gladly accepted.  
The atmosphere is a cozy, dim lit, Mombay-style setting.  Our bartender/waitress (Adele) was more than helpful when deciding on items to choose from very friendly during our visit. 
We ordered the Calamari and some vegetable samosas to start off with and they were instantly devoured.  Some of the best Calamari I have had while visiting London.  For the main course, we ordered the following: Mattar Paneer, Gunpowder Potatoes, Cheese Naan, Dishoom Slaw, and a side of rice.  EVERYTHING was superb.  It was hard not to keep ordering but this much food between 2 people was more than enough.  The food comes out quickly after placing the order so if I were to switch it up next time, I would stagger my orders a few more minutes in between dishes.  
I can't wait to try the breakfast menu on my next visit.  It looks just as good and the Bloody Mary's look insane.",1
4,"This is a revival of the Irani cafes of Bombay. Probably one of my favourite restaurant spots in London this year. No wonder they have expanded to include many other locations across the city. 
It was a somewhat lengthy, but fun experience. They have worked out the waiting experience pretty well. You will be served complimentary drinks while you queue to get in. 
My aunt is from a Zoroastrian family and told me that Dishoom is nostalgically accurate, right down to details like the chairs and the bathrooms. 
There are some fusions like the Indian Pimms cup, which uses ginger beer and is studded with pomegranate seeds. 
VERY tasty cuisine and a lively scene. Highly recommended.",1
5,"The food here is absolutely amazing. Every time I have come here the staff have been so helpful and accommodating, especially with food restrictions (gluten, dairy). 
Last time we were there for a company lunch and they were able to serve us very quickly and we ordered a bunch of small plates which were easy to share and everyone had something they liked (actually we liked everything..). Have yet to try something there that I haven't liked. There is a great variety if you don't like spicy food, or are a picky eater..there is really something there for everybody. 
the restaurant itself is decorated really well and you can tell the owner and staff really put their heart into running the company and it is very authentic. Would definitely recommend for any kind of event (family dinner, date, company lunch, etc.). I would suggest making a reservation if possible since it does book up!!",1
5,"Dishoom is special...like...really special. Sorry for the novel of a review but it's worth every word. 
Dishoom is so special that I came here twice in the last week that I lived in London...it's so special that eating a very early lunch here was the very last thing I did before getting on the tube to Heathrow. I'm gonna attempt to break down what makes this place so spectacular. 
First of all, the vibe of this space is very special. It's large and light with high ceilings and comfortable seating on the entry level. Both times I have visited we stayed on the ground level, but I poked my head upstairs and it's beautiful. Downstairs they have a little lounge-ey bar. The owners have done a masterful job, updating this building while still hanging on to the old school industrial feel to it. 
The service on my first visit was flawless. The waitress broke down the menu for us and helped us to figure out exactly what to order to suit out preferences. She was very thorough in asking about food allergies and preferred spice levels. Also, she was clearly passionate and informed about the food. It didn't feel like she was trying to up sell us, but instead to make sure we were getting the right items that would be ideal for sharing. On my second visit, the staff was less amazing but I chalked that up to our early visit and the fact that we were in a bit of a hurry and didn't ask for a menu walk through. Again, I found out waiter to be helpful, though somewhat less attentive. 
The food here is show stopping. Easily the best Indian food I've had in my life and possibly the best meals I've eaten in London. I adored every bite of every item we ordered. You must try the black daal. It's spectacular. Rich and savory and outstanding. The calamari was definitely a stand out (in a sweet and sour fruity sauce). The lamb kebab and chicken tikka were juicy and delicious and perfectly spiced. The lamb samosas were crispy and well flavored (though I wish there were more than 2 in an order). The gunpowder potatoes are tasty and savory and a cheap side dish to go with all of the other more flavorsome dishes. The house special lamb stew was outstanding. Like my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. Oh my god. Also the naan (we tried all four kinds) are all fabulous. 
The cocktails and even the nonalcoholic drinks all looked incredibly tempting. My friend and I split a pitcher of Bombay pimms and it was fabulous and refreshing.
The one caveat of this place is its crazy business. Make sure you book a table if you can or be prepared to wait. But really. It's like so worth it. I am heartbroken to have moved so far away from this magical restaurant. Please go there for me. Show me the pictures. I will cry from jealousy but it will be worth it. Go. Now. Right now.",1
5,"Amazing !!!! The best Indian food I've ever had and the place is so cool. I guess it's a converted factory and that plays really well in this location . The service was a bit slow but acceptable . It's is a large space and that makes it harder for the staff to get around . Love the look and feel of the main floor . Downstairs is more lounge like and the upstairs is open and perfect for a lunch break .
The food is the star here and I can't wait to go back on my next trip to London . I wish they had one here in NYC as well.",1
4,"I've always cycled past their Covent Garden branch and marvelled at the long queue outside, wondering if it was really worth it. 
Turning up to their Kings Cross branch and seeing a line of fewer than 5 people, we decided to wait in line. We got the customary ""It might take 30min, but we doubt it"" and fewer than 10 minutes later we were seated. 
The decor is amazing; if I could buy a home like it, I would. It does however feel quite colonial. But has a great charm to it (if you get a chance, check out the toilets!) 
The food was also awesome, and kudos to them for having both a gluten free, and a dairy free version of their menu. 
Will definitely be back.",1
4,"We went due to the reviews on yelp. We waited in the lower 'permit' room for 40minutes until we could be seated, party of 2.  The drinks were wonderful as were the chips, albeit a small bowl of the chips.  The food was average.... no better than any other good Indian restaurant.  Portions were slightly smaller but the cost was reasonable.  We had 5 dishes we shared and all were ok. Nothing spectacular.  The service was good and fast.  The restaurant decor and ambiance was also very nice. I would go back but I would not wait to get a seat.  It's not worth that especially in a city known for amazing Indian food.",1
5,"When I visited London last Fall, we tried to get into three different Dishoom locations, only to find unbearably long queues, so it's been at the top of my suggestion list since I got back to London in June. 
Finally, today was the day I got to experience the bacon and egg naan that I'd been hearing about, but first, let me say how beautiful this location is. Unassuming from the outside, inside you're transported back in time to British colonial Bombay. The interior is fantastically done and feels rich and opulent, yet cozy and warm. 
We were seated upstairs and ordered two cappuccinos. They arrived in what looked like small  milkshake glasses, topped with a bit of chocolate. To be fair, they tasted good, but needed to be much hotter. I prefer my coffee in mugs that tend to keep them warmer, but that's just me. 
My girlfriend ordered the bacon & egg naan (noms!) and I ordered the Kejriwal -- two gloriously orange-yolked fried eggs atop chilli cheese toast with spring onions/scallions/green onions/whatever you call them here and coriander. They aren't afraid of flavor and it showed. It. Was. Perfect. Perfect size (though I could've eaten way more), perfectly cooked, perfect price at only £4.90. Seriously, i can't get breakfast at the crappy takeaway down the street for £4.90! 
The service was super fast, friendly and attentive, which pushes it to five stars for me. Price, flavor, speed, ambience. Two thumbs up. I want to go back for dinner!",1
5,"My friends and I came here for a quick lunch, and it ended up being our favorite meal in our entire London trip. Everything about the food was wonderful (and one of my friends and I don't usually eat Indian cuisine) -- from the naan to the murgh malai to the paneer. I'm still thinking about this food a month later.",1
4,"SO GOOD. SO WORTH IT. Service could be a little better hence the 4 stars.
We had heard a couple great things about this restaurant before we took our trip to England and decided to pop in for dinner on our last night in London. Since I had read Yelp reviews about the long waits during peak hours, we came in around 9pm on a Wednesday evening and were sat within minutes. Dishoom is in a beautiful old building (it's a huge place) and the decor is simply stunning. 
I had already perused the menu (thanks Yelp you always got my back) so I had somewhat of an idea of what we were going to order but were happy to hear our waiter's recommendations before we made our final decisions. We definitely ordered more food than we needed but have nooo regrets. Our dinner at Dishoom was definitely the best meal we had during our 4 day stay in London.
Drinks: I ordered the Bombay Colada (NOM) and my partner had the Viceroy's Old Fashioned (also NOM). My partner has had many an Old Fashioned and thought Dishoom's version was absolutely fantastic so that's sayin' somethin'. 
Appetizer: Dishoom Calamari which was uniquely spiced, just the right about of oily, and perfectly cooked!
Entrees: Chicken Ruby, Black House Daal, Vegetable Biryani, Lamb Boti Kebab, and Garlic Naan. All of it was absolutely delicious. That's all you need to know.
Dessert: House Chai (wonderfully spiced and delicious) and the Pineapple & Black Pepper Crumble which was subtly sweet, a good size, and the perfect ending to a great meal.
My only complaint would be the service. While good overall, it could be improved considering how great everything else is. The biggest issue for us was that one of the servers spilled a bowl of their Raita right behind us which splattered all over my partner's jacket and shoes as well as my shoes. While they quickly cleaned everything up and gave my partner a cloth to clean himself off, nothing was done after that and our server never mentioned it. Considering how pricey Dishoom is, I would have at least expected an apology or an offer for a free dessert. We were just at Mowgli in Manchester days before and our server told us that she took our naan off the bill for us because it came a little late. In terms of our server, he never refilled our water and it took him about 20 minutes to bring our check to us after we had finished our meal. We noticed other tables around us who were served by him waiting a while for their checks as well.
Overall, I LOVE Dishoom and will definitely be back when I'm back in London.",1
5,"Really beautiful restaurant. Highly recommended for breakfast. The bacon naan is splendid! I would say that it could be served hotter but it tasted so good I don't really care that much. It's really great price as well!
Don't try to come for dinner, the wait has always been 1 and 40 minutes, even at 6pm on a Tuesday night",1
5,"Loved this place! The atmosphere is incredible and detailed and the food is delicious and original. The restaurant is styled after an old Social or Gentlemen's club in colonial India. The decor and furniture is incredibly detailed and makes you feel as though you have travelled back in time. The menus include a wide variety of food and include charming history and anecdotes for certain dishes. 
We tried the naan bacon breakfast sandwich as well as the porridge. The breakfast sandwich was amazing the bacon was cured and cooked in a unique sweet chili sauce which was ask so served with the plate. To say the bacon was delicious is a vast understatement. The whole sandwich worked well together. 
The porridge was tasty and I mostly ordered it because I had never eaten porridge before. It was simple with bananas and dried dates and very satisfying. That porridge is all you can eat. 
We also ordered the red grape and lemon juice which was a bit expensive at £5 a glass but a thrilling combination. The drink was sour and sweet, and a nice new experience. 
Dishoom blew away my expectations and my wife and I still talk about how happy we were with the whole experience. We can't speak for the dinner menu and have heard there is quite a line but will definitely make this a London MUST.",1
5,"Went for breakfast and loved the atmosphere, super beautiful restaurant with a great staff and excellent menu.  The chai was on point, but whats more, the management at this restaurant is SO kind and went out of their way to help return a personal object I left in the restaurant (I had left the country when I realized!).  Piotr is the MAN.",1
4,This is a delicious Indian place! I'm from the States and my friend decided to make reservations here. The line was almost around the block so I definitely recommend making reservations if you can. The food was excellent and the service was wonderful. I enjoyed the overall vibe of the restaurant and will recommend it to any friends visiting London.,1
2,"Lunched here yesterday on Sunday with the family at the Dishoom Indian restaurant in London for the very first time. It is situated in a ancient English railway warehouse. The place was abuzzing on our arrival.
The Bombay Big Breakfast at an expensive £11.50 was very disappointing, compared to  Big Breakfast size meals in other London cafes and restaurants (which charged at even half the price). 
There was bugger-all ingredients on the plate, hardly any grilled streaky bacon or grilled mushrooms to  be seen , and the fried tomato was quite small in size. Only the two sausages were of normal size. The massala flavour baked beans tasted kinda odd too. 
Their Chai tea at an expensive £2.50 per small glass although tasty was served only luke warm. I hate luke warm tea!!
Also their old wooden styled chairs weren't very comfortable, and the whole place felt very old and cramped. However our waitress was friendly enough. 
A restaurant is only as good as its last meal. And for that reason alone, I would not return here again in a hurry. It's expensive and the food is nothing really special. 
Though for many I guess, the Dishoom is good for its authentic old Indian styled restaurant novelty value.. 
But sorry......... thats not good enough for me!!",-1
4,"Truly excellent Indian food experience. Based on the old Bombay cafes, Dishoom at kings cross invites you to drink and dine in a unique old railway warehouse. The atmosphere with the dimmed lights is exceptional. In the lower level you will find the ""Permit Room"" bar which creates unbelievable drinks - most of them with an Indian touch to it.
The food itself is very tasty - from the naans over the paneer tikka to the daal and the various curries. You can't go wrong with anything. It's a good place to come with friends and share a variety of food. The only problem with this place is the door personnel that often tries to scare you away with an extremely unfriendly attitude and exaggerated waiting times (that actually are never true)",1
3,"Food was great! Between 4 of us we ordered 4 dishes and naan. I particularly enjoyed the dal and chicken ruby. Other guests enjoyed the paneer!
Service made this a less than fabulous dining experience. Our waiter was condescending and disappeared halfway through our meal. Another waiter picked us up (he was much friendlier), but our last order took forever and it took multiple asks to get our check.
Would I come back? Yes? If I was really craving the food...",-1
4,"Amazing food! Service could be better.. There is a big difference between the waiters and the service they provide. I've been here before and had help how much and what we should order. That was great, now went there others who did not go before and it was all not clear for them. But the food was amazing! Also the puddings! Strawberry merengue was to die for and the chocolate pudding EVEN better! Looking forward to next visit.",1
5,"My no. 1 dining experience in London! 
Dishoom serves modern Indian food out of a renovated railway shed built baaaaack in the day. The place is huge, cavernous in fact, and the decor incredible.  It's like being transported back in time to a first class cabins in the 19 century... lots of dark wood, patterned tiled floors, marble countertops and metal finishings. 
Anyway, enough about the décor.  The food... well, it's darn delicious. Every dish we tried was packed full of flavour w beautifully balanced spice and lots of fresh herbs. We got a smorgasboard of dishes and all were to die for but the surprise standout dish for me was their daal, which they simmer for over 24hours so it's absorbed all the delicious liquid.  Unfortunately this time we didn't have room for dessert but next time I am back in London this week be my first stop.
Oh and  make sure that you go downstairs to the Permit Bar for a drink either before or after dinner. It's got a bit of a speakeasy vibe and the service and drinks are impeccable.  Try one of their signature cocktails or tipples, as they call them. I'm a negroni fan so couldn't go past Sonia's take on the classic - Hayman's Dry gin, Campari & Dishoom vermouth served with hand carved ice.
One last thing... Dishoom doesn't take bookings so I'd recommend getting there early, putting your name on the list and then heading downstairs for a tipple (or two).  We got there around 6pm and were seated well before 7pm, but apparently the wait can be up to 3 hours during peak times.",1
5,"Great spot for a date, party or just a night with friends. 
We didn't have reservations - we arrived and there was a line. We were told that it would take about an hour to be seated. After about 15 minutes, we were let into the bar area. The drinks were unique and delicious, and the ambiance was great. 
We were in the bar for about 30 minutes before we were seated, and the food was totally worth the wait. We shared about 5 plates (one of which was at the recommendation of our waitress) between 2 people. We loved every dish. 
Highly recommend!!!",1
5,"One of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been - this includes Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, New York, Los Angeles etc. Great staff, awesome service and really good food.
The ambience is really chill, they decorated the entire place with a sense of humor and bring the Bombay-Irani cafe feel to it. Sort of like a hipster version of Soda Bottle Openerwala.
Will make a point to come here every time I am in London",1
5,"I've been to Dishoom quite a few times and I can honestly say there is not a single dish I've had that I wouldn't order again! It has become our number one choice for business lunches and our guests always leave very happy.
If I had to choose a few favorites, they would be: okra fries, awadhi lamb, chicken ruby, and roomali roti. I always have a tough time choosing between the sugarcane juice and the house chai though. Both are SO delicious.
As far as the restaurant itself, there is such a nice vibe at Dishoom. It's big, well decorated, and the staff is very attentive. I just love the interior! It really is a perfect place to have a meal.",1
5,"Excellent last minute choice for my friends and I! Visiting from California. 
Service is excellent. Were able to seat us right away at 10pm.
Food was excellent.
Okra fries were amazing. 
Very accommodating menu. 
The vibe of the restaurant is very hip. Location was easy to find. Highly recommend!
Very large restaurant.",1
5,"I took my first jaunt to Dishoom (a perennial Yelp favorite) and decided to go for breakfast.  I've heard praises from here to Timbuktu about their bacon naan roll, and finally woke up early enough to try it.  
Decor: Feels much more vibey and well put-together than its costs (95% of the dishes are under £10).  Way ahead of the game when it comes to affordable franchises having a certain ""oomph"" to its ambiance.  Would make for a great date spot.
Food: After a complimentary (and delicious!) hot chai tea, they brought me two folded bacon naan rolls.  I never had a naan serving on its own, but Dishoom's version is quite different, fusing the British bap concept with Indian influences.  So how was it? Chewy, spicy, sweet, smoky, tangy, savory...absolutely delicious. 
Go, go, go!",1
1,"Disappointingly all style rather than substance, and we won't be back. We wanted an early dinner in the area, and read the reviews about the long waits, so made a booking for 5:45pm thinking it would be empty, because who really eats at that hour? We probably could have walked in at that point, but it was pretty full, and there was a wait by 6:30. 
We arrived and were seated by a friendly host, but then didn't see a server for more than 15 minutes. People walked past with water jugs, but didn't offer us any, and I had to catch someone's eye to make our order, which seemed pretty silly. There were tons of staff around, so no idea why we had to wait so long to order. 
Ordered a number of dishes to share based on other reviews, and there were a couple dishes that I would be happy to eat again. The black dal was delicious, and felt like it was reasonably priced. The bhel starter was very good, although inconsistently spiced (it felt like it wasn't stirred together properly), but I would recommend it. 
I don't get the love for the okra fries, which are a spicy version of something you can get at any BBQ place or TGI-Fridays style place in the US. Nothing special. The roti was obviously not cooked to order as it claimed, since the top was hard and stale. The grilled greens were OK but nothing amazing. The gunpowder potatoes were actually inedible. The spicing was decent, but the potatoes themselves were undercooked, which is never a good thing in a potato. 
When I asked for the bill, the server noticed we'd only eaten a bite of the potato and asked what was wrong. I said they were undercooked and not good, and he apologised. But of course, he didn't take it off the bill, so I kind of felt like he shouldn't have bothered asking if he wasn't going to do anything about it. 
The physical space is beautiful, I have to admit. I love the area, and enjoyed walking around the warehouses behind King's Cross. 
Oh, if I wasn't already disappointed, my visit to the bathrooms sealed the deal. Down in the basement, the whole bar is smoky with incense, which is odd in a restaurant. In the bathroom itself, the smoke from incense was insanely thick, and my clothes ended up smelling like a dirty hippy shop for the rest of the evening. I agree with whoever said that the toilets remind them of an outhouse, weirdly out of place. 
Basically, it was an interesting experience, and I had one good dish. But I won't be back-- service was slow and not especially professional, food was more expensive than I felt it was worth, and drinks were astronomically expensive. Next time I want Indian food, I'll head for Drummond St instead.",-1
4,"Many friends told me that London has the best Indian food.  My husband highly recommended Dishoom in Kings Cross，so I decided to give it a try.  
They only take reservation for 6ppl+, so we decided to arrive a bit early at 6:30.  The place was packed, but the lineup was better than expected, we got seated in less than half an hour. They offered us free cocktails while waiting.  
We had the fried octopus as appetiser and it was so good that we order a second round.  All dishes were delicious and up to expectation.  
Recommended to get a seat on the inside if you are having dinner, as the outside area get pretty windy and cold after sunset.",1
5,"The hype is real, people. This restaurant is the place I tell everyone to visit when they're traveling to London. Consistently good food in an amazingly themed Bombay café. I particularly love this location because it's an old warehouse with big ceilings and space. 
To avoid the ca. 1 hour waiting times for a table, I'd recommend going in between meals. We got seated straight away when we showed up at 5.30pm on Sunday. 
I raved about the breakfast in my Shoreditch review but again: bacon and egg naan. That's all you need. 
Dinner is just as amazing. Far far, chicken tikka, house dahl, calamari, freshly made naan and rotis plus okra fries which are simply incredible to name a few. 
Expect innovative takes on Iranian/Indian dishes with great flavours and surprisingly amazing prices - I love that the prices are modest despite the ongoing hype with this place. The service was great; our Hungarian waiter was the sweetest, explaining the menu, recommending dishes etc.",1
4,"Been to both Shoreditch and the new branch in Kings Cross Granary Square and prefer the latter for it's more grander feel.
The décor is fantastic with some old Indian photos and interior. For me it's the perfect place to start of with food but especially drinks (sit at the bar if possible in the middle if on a date). Really good drinks served here. We had about 8 in a few hours and all were great. 
Stand out things to have for me are:
- Moonsooned Cobbler cocktail
- Whiskey Sour
- Mango Fennel Lassi. 
- Chef special of Nalli Nihari
- Okra Fries and Calamari are musts to have to start off with
Didn't like:
Dishoom Slaw
Murgh Malai (they serve it slightly pink chicken as a footnote)
Little tip don't bother getting any table at back as it is around the side and bit out of the way I feel. We actually moved back more into the length open space at front. And DO go up the stairs and see the view from there.",1
5,"Simply love this place, the vegan options are just too good and I can't NEVER get tired of it.
the cocktail are also so nice and the place is perfect for a date or a friends reunion",1
5,"Back again... Still banging... Excellent food and service, this time we smashed out the amazing cocktails...",1
4,"I've visited at several different times of day and this place is always a hit, great food, drinks and atmosphere. The staff are nice and know their stuff. Especially recommend the chicken ruby, washed down with a hot baileys chai (which could be a bit bigger but hey). Be prepared for a small wait at peak times.",1
5,"In a month I've eaten here 12 times and literally eaten and drank everything on the menu. I've weathered wind, rain and ice, for dates, get-togethers and family dinners. And though it's not perfect and you can get better Indian food (if you look REALLY hard) in London, it is the best place I can recommend in London overall. 
+ Breakfast: I thought I knew it all about Dishoom until after a year having dinners I went for breakfast; and I fell in love all over again. The Bacon Egg Naan Roll is delicious; wood smoked bacon with gooey organic egg, a layer of cream cheese and fresh chopped coriander, with the char from the tandoor on the naan. Paired with a sweet and very mildly spiced chilli jam to lighten the smoke and char- I was licking the plate. Which is a beautiful white and blue like your Nanniji might have. The Chicken Keema looked good but wasn't amazing, and I found it too oily. Fire Toast (2-3 pieces) was ok, came lukewarm and a touch dry, but the preserves were nice. The Big Bombay breakfast is awesome, and the Masala Beans yummy; if needing a slight chilli kick (my preference). 
+ Have a Dhoble cocktail to perk up your brunch, or a monsoon malabar coffee for those grim morning-afters. It must be said the coffee isn't great (i.e. barista level), but I like the chicory hit from it. Get a lassi, or ask can they do a sugar cane & lime juice otherwise.
+ Lunch: you can't go wrong with with a Frankie roll and a Thumps-Up. Get it into you. Their wine selection is average, but their cocktails are why you are here. Summertime, hit the juleps. Wintertime go for a chota peg. Avoid the Indian Sula wine (overpriced) and Amrut whiskey (sub-par) if you are into those things. Sorry India :(
+ Dinner: Aw yisss. I mean, I can write on every item, but no need. Their special, Lamb Nahil Nihari is a leg of lamb originating in Iran and infamous on the streets of Pakistan. The sauce is thick and unctuous and morish, scoopable with the garlic roti. The lamb itself is well cooked and tasty, but I doubt slow cooked (would be better) as it needed to be carved/pried off the bone on both occasions we ordered. A large portion, get to share at £17.50. Don't opt for the brainzzzz (my preference).
Headliners are the Chicken Ruby (perfect for those people who think Indian food must be a sauce, meat, and rice), Chicken Berry Britannia (recreation of Café Britannia in Mumbai), house daal mopped up with roomali (handkerchief) roti, vada pau with a dollop of fresh green coriander chutney, paneer tikka and more. 
Desserts- probably the only thing I'm not impressed with. The overly heavy Guju Shrikhand & Chocolate Mouse, and the Ghola Ice is divisive among friends. Best opt for a simple kulfi. Pudding wine isn't much to talk about, don't bother with it. Get chocolate chai or a 'Dirty chai' instead.
Cocktails/Drinks: all of them. While downstairs go for the juleps and pegs; at the dinner table I love the East India Gimlet.
Overall- for its price, service and consistent quality every day all day, it's impossible not to say it's my favourite place to eat in London. Always coming back.",1
5,"Wowzers. Great atmosphere. Our trip to London wouldn't have been complete without a visit to Dishoom. It's close to King Cross Station (Platform 9 3/4). I highly recommend making a reservation. If you do end up waiting in line, they bring out appetizers or let you sit at the bar, but it can be a long wait. This was the first time my family ate Indian food and they were spoiled by the best in London. Gluten free menu available.",1
5,"We came here yesterday (Wednesday) for lunch and were blown away with the quality of the food and also the service. 
I ordered the chicken balti which was exquisite. Really tastes unique and authentic unlike some other curry houses in London. Great use of herbs and spices. 
The atmosphere is also great. There's something about the restaurant which makes you feel somewhat at home rather than in a big space with people you don't know. 
Definitely one of my favourite Indian restaurants in London. Recommended thoroughly.",1
5,"LOVE THIS PLACE, food was excellent and price was decent. Service was great even just before closing",1
5,"Everything from the cocktails, to the free bites while waiting for my meal (and the sauces they came with!!!), to the meats and naan, was absolutely perfect. My waiter was exceptional and guided me through the menu. Could not have asked for a better meal. Would highly recommend for a date, a family gathering, or really anyone with an appetite.",1
5,"I generally don't like Indian cuisine and I definitely do not like Chai. With that said:
I decided to try because I heard London had really good Indian food. I yelped the closest and best option from where I was, Kings Cross. I walked about 10-15min and when I got to the restaurant, I was shocked to see a long line outside on this late chilly night (8:30pm). I got on line seeing as it should be good since it's so popular. I overheard the wait would be 1hr+! The group ahead of me was about to turn away but the waitress convinced them to stay by accommodating them with outside seating with drinks from the bar before being seated for dinner. Then a waitress came out and passed out warm drinks to everyone waiting outside, it was pretty chilly out so it was very nice. I didn't realize what I was drinking but it was the best drink ever at the moment! 
I was seated only after 5min of waiting because I was alone and was able to sit at the bar. SCORE! The atmosphere was so chill. The bartenders were so trendy dressed in hipster suspenders. My bartender was super friendly and recommended a few options because I had no idea what to get. I got the cheesy naan and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and then a mango kulfi for dessert. EVERYTHING was sooo good! On top of that, I asked the bartender what drink they gave me outside and I was shocked when he told me it was CHAI! He was so nice that he gave me a free refill! 
I highly recommend this place when in London! I will definitely come back here on my next visit!",1
5,"I stopped by here during breakfast since I heard that it gets busy during lunch and dinner. I had the bacon naan and it was AMAZING. Seriously, anything with bacon works in my favor.
I love the decor and that it takes you back in time. Def a place to go when you're in London!",1
5,"I think between this most recent visit, and when I lost my Dishoom virginity, I've pretty much eaten everything on the menu, and it's all fantastic!
As this Dishoom is tucked out the way in Kings across, it doesn't seem to be as crazy busy as the one in Covent Garden, but that's not a reflection of the food, or the service, as both are excellent.
On this occasion we gorged on half of the menu between the 3 of us, my particular highlights were the lamb on the bone and the keema pau.
A bunch of food and a steady flow of gin came to £50 per head including a tip, so it's not something I could afford every day, but a great treat.",1
4,Arrived on a quiet Monday morning seeking sustenance. Greeted by a group of lovely ladies working front of house. They tucked me away with a great view of the place and plied me with water and tea (was it strong enough?) instantly. My tea needed to be stronger and it was taken away and repaired with no fuss. The akuri came shortly with lovely soft pillows of pau. It looks meh but trust me your mouth explodes when you fork it in. Must try! Service was attentive but not intrusive. Lovely!,1
4,"Fabulous Indian, great bar downstairs with some interesting drink concepts. 
The wait is well-organized, although there isn't much to do in this neighborhood while you are waiting. 
We had a great server and everything we tried was fabulous. Recommended!",1
5,"This restaurant was recommended by a cousin on our first trip to London. It was fun, funky and delicious.  Many portions are meant to be shared. Four of us shared: 
Lamb samosa, vegetable samosa, creamy Black daal, not very cheesy naan, Rice,
Calamari x2, very spicy Chicken ruby, flavorful gunpowder potatoes, Murgh malai, 
Far far and Two drinks. We could have left two items off. We enjoyed it so much we came back the next day for breakfast. Fresh!  Please note the heavy inscence smell is strong by the door but not throughout the whole space.",1
5,"What a delicious experience! Came for lunch - actually, came for brunch but didn't realise it stopped at midday. Was disappointed initially as came for the bacon naan but ordered several small plates between us and they were fantastic. Particular props to the calamari, chip butty, chai tea and pistachio kulfi. We actually ordered a second calamari after finishing the first bowl!  Everything was flavored delectably and dishes complemented each other perfectly. 
On top of that, the location is just cool. A huge, atmospheric warehouse, with plenty of twists and intriguing touches. Even the toilet was an adventure!
Will definitely return - for brunch and to try the rest of the menu!",1
5,"This is a wonderful place!  I don't think I ordered especially well, but we were there with two small children and they couldn't have been nicer.  They served us chai on the sidewalk as we waited and were exceptionally gracious.",1
5,"On our first night in London, we walked over to find a wait of almost two hours, so we returned the next day around 1pm for lunch and were able to walk right in. From the bright, ginger-laced Pimms Cup to the impeccable naan, everything was spectacular. The prices are reasonable, but it's easy to run up quite a bill as each dish on the menu begs to be tasted. I would recommend everything except the tomato and onion salad; it's exactly that, and comes as a side dish with the delicious chicken tikka masala, so don't bother ordering it separately. We loved the lamb shank stew and the grilled corn on the cob, too.",1
5,"I had an excellent meal at Dishoom.  I know I'm trying - truly, truly trying - to be more discerning with how many 5 stars I give out but...here?  It's totally deserved.
After finding it (this was no easy feat as we were going lo-tech and finding it sans smartphone), we were torn between three seating options: outside on the (limited, but sunny - vitamin D-enriched meal!) patio, inside at low rattan furniture with sun streaming through the windows, or upstairs in the more traditional of dining rooms.
We opted to sit in the dining room; not perhaps the best option for the tan, but good for a quiet tete-a-tete which was the social purpose of this mean.
The service was *on point*; always there to answer questions, always quick and responsive, but never overbearing.  Provided great recommendations and really helped make our meal spectacular.
We decided on some far far (basically a must for all children of the 80s; they're essentially neon-coloured crisps with a trio of dipping options) to munch on while we decided.  Ultimately we went for some grilled mixed greens (SOUNDS BLAND; GET 'EM), the much-touted okra fries, the warm (ish) chicken pomegranate salad and the murgh malai, which was one of the best uses of chicken thigh that has ever graced my lips.  THAT WAS A LOT OF TRUTH SAY.
We were both super-full (oh, did I mention; wine?), and got out with - including tip - 35GBP of damage.  Excellent work, Dishoom.
Yelp note: decor is lovely, as is the incense burning.  Truly my sole but (but/t?) is...the wooden toilet seats.  Reminds me of camping outhouses and...yeesh.  Clearly some childhood camping trauma I hadn't unpacked, but didn't welcome revisiting it mid-way through such a lovely dinner.",1
5,"Dishoom Kings Cross was wonderful. I was greeted by lovely hosts, shown my table and enjoyed a delightful meal with a few drinks.
I never realized how big King Cross actually was and I now have huge respect for everyone who works there, they must have strong legs! Thanks to the whole team for an amazing experience.
A beautiful meal in a beautiful setting, I will be visiting again!",1
4,"Great Indian restaurant in the style of a Bombay Cafe. Food is fantastic, atmosphere is great. Definitely a fan!",1
4,"Getting into Dishoom is a Herculean in patience and false hope. It is worth documenting here upfront so you know.
First of all, it will be busy. If they are open, they are busy. There is a reason for this but later. Second, yes the line is long. Yes they will tell you an absurd amount of time until you are seated but fear not! There will be little drinks while you are in line, bigger drinks once you get into the downstairs bar and amazing food as your reward. Finally, it will not take as long as they have told you. Which is a neat psychological trick.
The atmosphere is probably the one thing I did not love. It is a sweaty, packed and really loud room. Pair this with eastern european waitresses whose high pitched voices do not carry across the gap and it can be difficult to even order. All of that being said, we got exactly what we ordered every time, even if it was difficult to flag someone down for additional beer.
The food. I need to say it again, The Food! Amazing, Delicious, Indescribably Good... this is why you wait 40 minutes, shout to be heard with a waitress and endure your neighbor's chair bumping you 15 times during dinner.
Go to Dishoom, then go again and then keep going until you have eaten everything!",1
4,"Creative British-Indian food in a nice atmosphere. If you go early (around 6pm or earlier), it's fairly easy to walk in without a reservation.",1
5,"This one is at the top of my list, it is such a nice place to indulge yourself with friends/family/romantic date depending on the area you choose. The Indian cuisine is divine and you'd feel on vacation without leaving London!",1
5,"A bit of background for you, I grew up in Leicestershire and have always found curries in London and Hertfordshire too sweet. I'm hardly a connoisseur but know what flavours I like.
The first time I came the queue outside was an hour long so I walked away, vowing to return earlier next time. I'm so pleased I  did because Dishoom has quickly become my go-to restaurant when I'm near Kings Cross. I've been twice since, once with a friend and then with my dad - who said this was ""the best Indian he'd ever had in London, probably the best Indian EVER!""
The experience begins from the moment you join the inevitable queue outside. They offer you a drink (mint tea or a spirit I seem to remember) which I think is a very kind gesture. You hopefully go inside quite quickly to sit in the bar downstairs. The cocktail list seems to cater for all tastes - strong shorts or sweet and fruity options. My only criticism come from the trip with my dad when the menu had at least 3 drinks listed that they no longer offered.
Once the go upstairs to the dining room you'll realise how nice and helpful the staff really; offering recommendations of their favourite or most popular dishes. I have over ordered on both occasions but they generously boxed up the remaining food into individual pots so I could take it home. I rate the Prawn Koliwada, Lamb Biryani and Ruby Murray but still have lots of the menu to work my way through.",1
5,"So stereotypical to love Dishoom, but it just cannot be helped. The 24 hour black daal is just mind blowing. The naans are always fresh. The cocktails are unique and tasty. And the vibe is just so cool. I've been here a few times, usually getting the chole bhatura with an extra garlic naan and it is always good. The brunch is good as well - though a much more limited offering, it is all delicious. The masala beans offer a spicy twist on typical English breakfast beans. Don't miss out on the house chai - it's what keeps bringing us back. All in all, it's a great place for locals as well as to bring visitors to London. I will undoubtedly be back again.",1
4,"Indian Street food at its finest,  never greasy like the food was drowned in gee.. Been to both the Covent Garden branch and the Shoreditch one and both never fail to impress me and my friends when we go.. Live the Okra and the chicken curry but my favourite is the vegetables paste that's served on the toast.. Yummy!   Actually typing this is making me hungry... Think a ghost is overdue",1
3,"We went to Dishoom on Saturday morning for brunch. Having been to their Covent Garden branch for NYE dinner some time back, I had decent expectations.
The decor, the setting etc are supposed to take you back to Bombay. The hallmarks are high roofs with lights and fans hanging, wooden furniture that give you an impression of time having passed by and an atmosphere that whilst looking busy, lets you sit back and relax. Dishoom ticked all these boxes. 
Now, because we went at breakfast/brunch time, we got the breakfast menu.
Going to the food, we got two bacon rolls with naan, which to me, is the best of both worlds. Delicious bacon sandwich, pimped up to an Indian level with naan and some tasty chutney. We also got a fire toast, which was, toast with some spicy chutney. We also got a maska bun (bun with butter) to share. There was the option of bottomless house chai, which some of us went for. For me the biggest delight was South Indian coffee from the Coorg district of Karnataka! I go giddy for Coorg coffee, so yes, that was brilliant. The food tasted great, the coffee was exceptional and the house chai, with the bottomless option was also a winner. However, there were drawbacks, significant ones, which take the experience down to a 3 star.
Now, the problem was that if you are a vegetarian, who does't even eat egg, you have no options. You can either opt for the fire toast or go for an egg roll (similar to the bacon roll) without the egg. This, by far was the biggest disappointment. The other big factor was the congestion. The tables were stacked too close to one another, which meant that if you lean back you make unnecessary contact with the person behind you, especially if you're both big blokes. In a traditional Bombay Irani cafe, the tables aren't that close that you lose a sense of privacy.
But having said all this, the staff were friendly and courteous, which is an asset to this industry.
If I did go back to Dishoom, it definitely will not be for their brunch/breakfast, but perhaps for a proper meal.",-1

Now this is why I flew to London from Los Angeles, london claims to Have the best indian food in the world and dishoom you Def proved yourself. Where do I begin let's start with the atmosphere of this place very colonial vibe which is awesome you don't have anything like this in LA. Now to the food man everything we got from the condiments to the ruby chicken all amazing back to back packed with amazing flavors that hit the spot when your craving indian. The service here is on point whatever you need their waitresses are great. Prices here are a little high for the size of their portions but for the quality and taste this place is worth spending money in especially for how bad the dollar is compared to pounds. All I'm gonna say is I'll be back tonight for round 2 keep up the great work and amazing food keeping london on point with the best indian food by far",1
5,"Amazing restaurant bar just behind the Granary. Architecture is stunning, and the food matches.
We visited for the first time 11 Nov, when they had the soft opening - and probably went 5 times in two weeks!
Had a selection from breakfast, the masala with chopped chicken liver and eggs - not too spicy and incredibly moreish and warming. Granola with berries and yoghurt - healthy and delicious. Sides of bacon (ginger pig) and masala beans which were also incredible.
Running out of adjectives.
My new favourite destination in Kings Cross.
---
Delighted to see that Dishoom has been picked as the Yelper's favourite restaurant in the UK. I know that it relates to another branch, but still, this is as good.",1
4,"If you ask for any popular Indie restaurant in London, most people will tell you about Dishoom.
It is located in King's Cross street (remember the famous hot dogs I told you about?) and unlike most places in the area, this restaurant really lives up to its reputation. 
Most times it will be crowded, but don't let that drive you away. The food experience you will get is definitely worth a little waiting and you'll leave with a full tummy and a smile on your face. 
I'd recommend the Bombay breakfast as it is personally my favourite, but there is a big variety of meals on the menu, so don't hesitate asking the friendly staff for suggestions.",1
5,"Ambiance - classy yet hip
Service - top notch from greeting to recommendations to top ups ... with you at the right moments 
Food - breakfast with an Asian kick on a solid Brit foundation - innovation
Masala tea - let us order with less sugar please otherwise right amount of Cardamon
Enjoy!",1
5,"Wow...what can I say...this place is just outstanding! As a British Indian i feel it represents what modern Indian food is all about. It has that classic home food/ street food foundation but does it in modern, fun and classy ways. 
The restaurant just is so amazing inside. It plays on its location as a former railway depot and has made it Indian railway style...it's just such a great place to sit and eat with friends as there's so much cool stuff to look at while you eat
The food is outstanding : the house daal, pao bhaji, chicken biryani and lamb chops are world class
Honestly if u want REAL Indian food go here!! This is not a curry house...its quality and class Indian food for people who know what Indian food from the subcontinent really is!",1
5,Awesome experience. This place is absolutely massive. Make sure you either make a reservation or be prepared to wait in a long line outside. They have a large communal sharing table in the back that is great for large groups.,1
5,"Went here for breakfast today and was blown away by the place. It is just very slick from the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave.
The first thing that struck me was the size of the restaurant. It's huge and despite being split over three levels it somehow manages to be intimate at in spite of the space. 
Dishoom has received so many plaudits and accolades - and I can easily see why - but it's extremely modest to be described as a 'Bombay style cafe', as it's much more than that. 
Even the breakfast menu is full of Bombay flavours - one of the most unique breakfast menus in London. 
I went for the sausage and egg naan roll. It's unlike any sausage and egg roll you'll ever eat - in a very good way. Others in our party went for the acclaimed bacon naan roll and someone also chomped on the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli toast). 
After this experience, I'll definitely be coming back for dinner. And breakfast, again.",1
5,"Heavenly... Just Heavenly food! This place deserves 7 stars. Everything is just so great. Food, hostesses, service, ambiance... Very ethnic and classy Indian.",1
5,"The stars are kind of a giveaway, so yes: this place is great. I would be remiss if I did not note that there were a few initial red flags, however.
First: it's both huge and nicely decorated. This, perversely, worried me. Gilgamesh in Camden is huge; it's been years since I've been, but it was a hot mess of a restaurant, with orders mixed up, confusing portion sizes, swarms of confused staff, and cryptic pricing. The money had all gone on the decor and a very decent bar staff, but eating felt like you'd done very badly in an exam you expected to ace. 
Second: when we were seated, the waiter asked if I'd been to Dishoom before, and then explained the 'concept' to me. This worried me too. In a culinary context I am rarely keen on concepts that require explanation. But in this instance the concept was that we were expected to share, that it was a small-plates kind of deal, and that things would arrive when they were ready and not as part of a traditional starter/main framework; so, fine. This isn't Gilgamesh, where the concept was that they did expensive food very averagely from a bewildering variety of Asian cultures, so that's fine. (I'm still bitter about it, yes.)
The worries melted away when the food came. Lamb samosas and some calamari - a signature dish, according to the waiter - came first. The samosas were pretty good; the calamari was excellent, with a light salty batter and a sweet, acidic sauce - tamarind? Pomegranate? Something like that. I would come back for the calamari alone. 
Seekh kebabs and mahi tikka were next, with some excellent cucumber raita and crispy, fresh naan bread.  Everything is really interestingly spiced; nothing's overpowering, or even very hot, but it's complex. The signature black dahl is brilliant, but there's equal attention to detail in the complimentary relishes (mint and coriander, red and green chilli, and something I missed because I'm a bit deaf.) I don't know what they put in the 'Gunpowder potatoes' - I assume it wasn't gunpowder - but they were delicious and fragrant.
This all felt like pretty good value for thirty quid a head (including an OK cocktail and a nice bottle of pale ale.) I've eaten at pricier Indian restaurants like Tamarind and the Cinnamon Club and not had nearly as nice a time. 
The one drawback really is that it's very popular. When we arrived at lunchtime on a Saturday it was packed, and people (ourselves included) were queuing outside for quite some time. Inside it's noisy and occasionally hard to catch the waiters' eyes when they're running around making sure the food gets out to the tables hot off the stove (which they do brilliantly, but it's difficult to make sure this works in an it-comes-as-it's-ready environment. Or at least at Gilgamesh, anyway.) 
Definitely go. Book in advance if you can. I'm interested to go for breakfast - served until 12 - which looks like it'd be great, going by the menu.",1
5,"To get to dishoom, you walk though the fountains on granary square, along canals and through crowds of students from St martins. It's a beautiful location, which adds to the feeling that dishoom is out of the ordinary. A feeling that continues when you get inside and experience their drinks, service and food.
The door staff are polite and friendly, but be prepared for a long wait in the evening. Booking a table isn't available unless you are a group of 6+. We started out at dishoom at 3pm though on a Saturday and we got a table for cocktails in their bar below. There were eight of us and we decided to stay and eat upstairs later on. The table took an hour of so, but it's not really a problem when you are waiting in such nice surroundings. 
The interior design of the place is exquisitely executed. Signs are in English and Nepali, antique pictures from Nepal and India hang from the Jade coloured walls. A colonial vintage feel runs through dishoom's three floors, yet it never feels antiquated and modern twists breath vitality into the place. 
As you head downstairs to the 'the permit room' bar, their is a cosy atmosphere. The colonial feel continues, with teak furniture and Tiffany lamps. 
We started with some sumptuous cocktails. I had the Tanchoix fix. This is a delicate blend of mandarin, peppers and aged gin. The cocktails are quite pricey though at £9 for a small one and £18 for a large. Unfortunately not something we could have sustained. We then found that there was a great punch whose recipe dates back to the 1600's. It uses tea, arak, limes and jaggery. It is served in a cute vintage punch bowl with copper cups for all. There were 8 of us and the punch served us with a glass and a half each per bowl. This was a bit of a bargain, as each bowl was £29 each. We went through six bowl and were quite merry!
We ate upstairs and chose to get a number of dishes and share. The food is like the decor and uses the traditional flavours of South Asia whilst adding modern twists and European flavours into the mix. Particularly exceptional was the black dhaal main course, the paneer roll (which comes with a divine mint sauce) and the paper thin roti. This is not your traditional British Nepali/Indian takeaway usual... You won't find a greasy rogan josh or a bland korma on here. Instead Chili cheese toast, lamb on the bone curry (with or without lamb brain) and the Bombay dish of pau bhaji set your tastebuds alight and help to soak up the punch. After 7 hour there (not a joke) we were throughly drunk, thoroughly full and thoroughly glad to have chosen dishoom. And those of us who didn't have an individual cocktail at the beginning the whole experience cost £35. You can't say fairer than that!",1
5,"Best Indian food I've had in London...excellent food, service and atmosphere...it's a must do in London.  It also has a great bar...enjoy!!",1
5,"This place is fantastic! We choose one entree from each section (mains, sides, etc) and mainly the recommended foods along with one garlic and one normal naan. Come early since the line starts around 7 PM. The waitstaff is very attentive and even the restrooms are cool!",1
4,"Good for brunch, lunch and bkfst. Good replica of Irani (Persian-owned) cafes in India. Cool crowd",1
5,"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had was at Dishoom. I had a Bombay Breakfast which is an Indian take on the Full English. Everything is cooked to perfection using quality ingredients. I loved the massala baked beans! Can't wait to have it again. 
The interior is really cool also and the staff are lovely. Can have a bit of a line on the weekends so plan ahead.",1
5,"It was a 45-60 minute wait for a table and it was so so so worth it.
We went here for my housemate's birthday after he had heard very good things about it. The decor was wonderful and it was a lot bigger on the inside than it looked from the street. We waited downstairs at the bar where we had some very tasty and interestingly flavoured cocktails. The table service here was wonderful and, although busy, the staff were very attentive and friendly.
When we were seated, the three of us all ordered a side, main and naan to be shared between us. The flavours were phenomenal and it's some of the best Indian food I've had in a restaurant. 
Amazing food, flawless service and a wonderful ambience. Couldn't fault it, would love to visit here again soon.",1
5,The most satisfying meal and also the most authentic Mumbai dishes. Trust me.. I'm born and bred in Mumbai .. And This is what food tastes like in Mumbai! I'll be getting my weekly fix of food from home here!! Highly recommend it!,1
5,"For my first trip to London, one thing that was said by several people is that you HAVE to try the Indian food when you get there.
Let me tell you, Dishoom knocked it out of the park. We ordered a variety of appetizers and main courses to split between three people. All of it was top notch Indian food, making coming back to the States even that much harder.
What really sold me overall was their incredible drink menu from the permit room. I got a gin cocktail that was absolutely to die for although I couldn't find the name of it on their website. Would absolutely make this a must-stop location for anyone looking for some authentic and delicious Indian food.",1
4,"Went here for dinner and thought it was solid but not extraordinary. 
I strongly recommend the lamb kebabs -- super flavorful! Thought the chicken biryani and okra fries were only ""OK"" -- same for the lassis.
A note on the service and decor -- really spot on. Decor around the restaurant was comprised of a lot of salvaged/found goods, which gave the place a really ""worn-in"" and comfy feel, despite being a new and pretty large restaurant. The long bar was beautiful -- I would have loved to come back for a few drinks if I had more time.
Seems like everyone rages about the brunch so might recommend that instead of dinner.",1
5,"Dishoom is all sorts of amazing!!
It's not your traditional style Indian restaurant at all; it oozes class, sophistication, decor that's almost as fab as the food and staff that never disappoint.
They catered for a huge group of 24 people and there was no struggle, plenty of food and happy tummies as we left!
I can't recommend this venue enough!",1
4,"This place is really cool. I've been to the dishoom in Leicester Square/Covent Garden, but had a much better experience here. 
We came for breakfast on a Sunday at 9:45am so thankfully there wasn't a queue! We opted for the famous bacon and egg naan roll and were not in the slightest bit disappointed. The combination of tastes were delicious! We've tried coming in the evenings but the thought of queueing for 2 hours is just ludicrous. So we got a take out instead and whilst I still think the dinner prices are a little over-priced, I'd definitely eat here again.",1
4,"Perhaps I'm a bit naive, but the queue for here was phenomenal. My friend and I stuck around because we didn't really have much to do, but I still can't quite get over the wait! 
The queue managers are nice, though, and have taster drinks for people outside. At the bar downstairs, the waiter was friendly and knowledgable and made some tasty cocktails in front of us. When we finally got to eat (after 2 hours), we were famished. The black lentil daal and gunpowder potatoes were total winners, though. 
The interior, as with other Dishooms, is interesting and atmospheric. Split level, each section feels small and intimate, even though the whole restaurant itself is bigger than average.",1
5,What an experience! Excellent service - even waiting in line! Chai and sherry made the wait short! Food was very delicious. Portions just right! Servers world class! A must when visiting London.,1
5,"Our last night in London, we waited over an hour in the blistering cold to get a seat and it was the best decision we made. By far the best Indian food I've ever had in my life. We had the okra fries (loved it - didn't even taste like okra), chicken ruby (a must have), Dishoom chicken tikka (a nice spicy kick to the flavorful and super tender chicken), and the black house daal (not sure what was in this dip but it was delicious). If you're in London, this is an absolute must go to place.",1
5,"Simply amazing! The chef special lamb stew was scrumptious - be brave and try the brain!
Everything we ordered was fantastic: chicken ruby, fried okra, shrimp masala, and garlic Nan!
We sat at the bar and the gents took great care of us and shared some London insights with a couple of tourists!",1
5,"This place, much like the one in Leicester Square is always packed with queues outside. Same fantastic ambiance and food quality (see my review of the location in Leicester Square). They have the same menu. If you are reading this in a hurry, I recommend the black daal, romali roti, rajma chawal and the biryani. Everything is really good, but of the things I have had, these are the best.",1
5,"Came here for brunch. Incredible service, beautiful decor and the best omelette I've ever eaten. 10/10",1
4,"Amazing Indian food, authentic atmosphere,nice decoration, friendly staff... Kejriwal which is two eye egg on a cheese toast with several herbs was really delicious. And it was served very hot, the way I prefer. #kejriwal #indiancuisine #indianfood #breakfast #coventgarden #london #dishoom",1
5,"Wow, amazing interior! 5 stars just for that! You will feel like you are transported to a bygone era. It's got such character down to every little details. I didn't know the Persian/Iranian heritage until I saw another Yelper's review, I wonder how that affects the place.
As far as food goes, I've had better Indian food elsewhere but no where has the place looks as handsome and invigorating as this place.
Beware of the wait at rush hour as it could go as long as 2 hours. They have free chai and lemonade while you wait!",1
2,"Oh Dishoom. You had a lot to live up to. Claims of 'The best indian I've *literally* ever tasted' were thrown around.
I cannot fault your food. It was up there. I wouldn't say the best *literally* but that's a sliding scale. You were definitely a solid second.
If this review was on food alone, you would have got a five star.
Alas.
It is not. Instead your review includes service. Service particularly from a lady called Natalie. This is where things go awry.
I have one rule when I'm eating anywhere. In fact, make that two rules. First being 'Even if it does look like a hipster would have an orgasm when they walked in, don't let that mar your judgement'. I didn't allow that to sway me. Joss sticks and all. I held my resolve.
Joss sticks. In a restaurant. Right by the open kitchen.
Second rule is, never allow a server to say 'you can't have that, other people on the table have ordered it'. Oh Natalie. Mistake number one. When I come to your restaurant in a group of eight. Not all of us are going to buy into your 'a dish is for the table, not for you' attitude. Oh no. If I order a lamb balti, that lamb balti is MINE. Not the table's. MINE.
In the words of his holyness Joey Tribbiani: 'Joey doesn't share food'. No Natalie. He doesn't, and neither do I.
When a table of eight has ordered three bowls of Black House Daal, and try to order a fourth. We don't care that you would never normally allow a table of six to order two between them. We'll order what we want.
Your judgemental comments and attitude did nothing to make us like you. It only served to put us off coming back again.
Once you'd seen that we had infact consumed all the Daal that we ordered. You comments of 'well, I assure you that has never happened before' also did nothing to warm us.
The final straw in your incompetence was when, after we had paid all of our bill, including a larger than due 15% tip you proceeded to tell us that we had not even paid the base amount without service charge.
Now don't get me wrong. You made an honest mistake. Maths off the cuff can be hard. Anyone could have made the mistake. The tone of, and judgemental nature 'Eeeer, excuse me. You're 60p short of the minimum'. Only disappointed us further. Had you checked your maths, you would have found your mistake.
We left thoroughly disappointed, and will not be returning. 
This place gets a two solely for the food. I'd have knocked off another star and given it a one because of you, Natalie, but I'm not that rude. I recommend you avoid.
I haven't even covered the offers of waters and snacks whilst we chose our food - all of which were charged for with no discussion of price. The 'bottle of water for the table' became three bottles of water for the table as they emptied one, brought over another and charged us for them.",-1
5,"Brunch at Dishoom has to be one of my top 3 London brunches. 
I kept plate watching as the waiters were bringing out all the food and everything looked amazing! I had the naan bread with eggs and bacon. I honestly did not want the meal to end. The banana and mango lassi was really good and the meal was finished off with a side of masala beans. 
The decor and atmosphere is fantastic, service great and the food... well, I'm already planning my next visit!",1
5,The most delicious breakfast! Great atmosphere and really good service. Some of the best coffee I have had along with delicious mango lassi. A rainy day outside so nice to be in the rowdy indoor atmosphere. Sausage and egg naan definitely a highlight!!,1
4,We first tried to get in on a Saturday night but it was a two hour wait in the rain. Then we went again on Sunday at around 8 pm and got in much quicker. We were also able to wait at the bar. LOVED this restaurant. The food was delish. Very different than  Indian in the states. Not heavy on the sauces but more the spice. Our waiter told us to keep ordering and he would tell us to stop. We ordered all the naans and a variety of lamb and chicken dishes. Every dish was better than the next.,1
5,Super creative restaurant with a twist on Indian cuisine. Probably the best in London. Offers all the Indian street food delights.,1
4,Dishoom is a classic for a reason. Get the stuff you don't recognise. Get the salted lassi. Don't eat fo ra couple of days before you go. Just go.,1
3,"This review is mainly about the experience, rather than the food. 
It was an insidiously windy hike up from Kings Cross station to Dishoom and we were horrified to be told on the door with a smile that waiting time for a table was an hour and 45 mins, ... but not as horrified as we were when we were then told that there was a waiting time for the bar that we had been directed to wait in !!! We were also told that we couldnt order drinks whilst wiating for room at the bar 'because by the time the drinks are made your table would be ready ...' Not sure what that said about the waiting time for either. 
So we stood by the doors gazing upon the restaurant, a bar, people sitting eating and drinking ... for what felt like a thirsty 10 mins or more until we were able to go down to the bar that we would be waiting in. 
During that time we were able to appreciate 2 things : the visuals were awesome, the noise sucked. But the interior was lovely. i actually started to feel pangs of longing to be back in the asian subcontinent, such was the nostalgic attention to detail in every part of the sprawling comfortable 3 floor (? 4 floor ?) building.  And somehow , despite the dodgy soundtrack (a few guitar band indie-pub tunes) , all the vocal clamour and people noise added to the bustling-India ambience. In the event we 'only' had to wait for an hour and a quarter for a table, by which time I had kind of lost my appetite. 
Cocktails were good, as they should have been; pre -made, which mate be contentious or perhaps marketed as a plus point. The Gimlet was awesome, other nice mixes. Served on a hand-cut shard of ice which was definitely the epitome of cool.
Food :  I was looking forward to their signature Black House Daal, and when it came it was good, but i wasn't too bothered about paying too much attention to it because I fell in love with the Roomali roti, soft, delicate, big, warm. Likewise with the Gunpowder potatoes  and Biryani and Mutter Paneerm which my three friends loved.  I felt the tastes were comfortable and pleasant, not quite as complex as I would have liked, but I was brought up on a Sri Lankan palate and perhaps we are notoriously exacting when it come to food ....
The service was great, and the ambience in the restaurant was also awesome, i preferred it to the subterranean bar. The restaurant was a really great combination of relaxing, chilled, intimate, but feeling as though you are in the thick of things and able to gaze on some activity. Looking around, it felt like this would probably be the case from every table, and it was here that I felt that I could almost be in India. By that time the tunes had changed to seem more congruous. 
So, my friend said that the website says no need to book : I would come back, but I would not wanna be faced with that wait again, I would love to check out their other locations, im hooked on the interiors and i would definitely bring friends. I wanna to try more of their dishes and spend more time at the restaurant table eating",-1
4,"We live locally so only come here for breakfast or takeaway as we wouldn't stand waiting in the queue for hours! The bacon & naan roll is the best, hits all the right sweet and savoury spots and is very affordable. The takeaway menu isn't huge, we'd prefer if we could takeaway from the normal menu, but everything still tastes great. Dinner menu is definitely pricier than the breakfast one.",1
5,"Pure deliciousness. Friendly wait staff, fast service. Open late. Can't go wrong with the menu.",1
5,"We went here for my birthday dinner. It was outstanding. There was a wait for a table, so we sat at the bar. The bartenders were very helpful, and offered suggestions to help us make selections from the extensive cocktail menu.
I had the vegetable biryani, the house daal, and naan bread. Very impressed by the quality of the food. The Guju chocolate dessert, which is served with blackberries, is decadent and delicious.
The restaurant is huge, and beautifully decorated. The downstairs bar is dark and cozy. I will definitely return to Dishoom!",1
4,"This place is fab. From the moment you walk in...the atmosphere, the decor, the friendly staff, the scent of incense and then, of course, the excellent food.
Top tip- go early. We had dinner at 6pm and walked in to a table straight away but as we left the queue was already quite long (on a Tuesday).",1
5,"This place gets 5 stars from me.  The staff was great, very attentive and answered all questions and gave great recommendations.  The ambiance is worth the visit and the food is the best Indian cuisine I've had in multiple countries in Europe.   This is by far my number one visited restaurant in the UK.   I'll definitely be back.  There's something for everyone here and vegetarians will be well fed.",1
5,"Very good Indian food and one of the best meals we had in London! (Which explains the lines of ppl outside). Next time we would skip the pricy cocktails for a beer. 
Friendly services, except a few hiccups here and there.. and nice environment. 
We went for lunch and the wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad comparing to dinner hours. We asked our waiter about portion sizes and he suggested 5, 6 dishes for two of us. (Either we looked starving or I never knew people eat that much there). We ended up ordering only 3 dishes + garlic nan and we were stuffed. Every dish was delicious!
Although they forgot our Okra Fries. The waiter apologized and brought it out later, said it was on the house but when the bill came, it was charged. 
We didn't bother to correct him since we did order and finished it. 
The okra fries were a bit salty and a few pieces were stringy. Overall it was great and we walked out full and happy.",1
5,"This place is incredible, though it is admittedly my first foray until Indian food in the UK. At any rate, I've never had Indian food quite like this is my life, so flavorful and impeccably prepared. I had the Vegetable Samosa, Okra Fries, Chicken Ruby and Roomali Roti - they were each fantastically delicious. I had a hard time picking a favorite when the waitress inquired - I ultimately said the okra, but could have selected any of them. I also had the Baileys Chai for dessert, which was a lovely, silky yet lightly spiced drink. The service was great too - she was very kind and made excellent recommendations. Had I come here at the beginning of my trip as opposed to the end, I may never have eaten anywhere else! Bravo!",1
4,"Flavoursome Indian street food in a funky retro surroundings - a real authentic Bombay Café! Dishoom really encapsulates the current trend for quality without the fuss. Step through the door and you leave London behind for a few hours - a heady mix of spice, sandalwood and sloooow scratchy jazz tunes really set the mood. Both the food and cocktails were exceptional, I'm a real fan of street food and sharing dishes so my friends and I ordered lots of smaller dishes to share which was perfect. Service was quite slow but we weren't in a rush, it's the sort of place that makes you feel nostalgic (must have been the jazz...or one too many Bombay Coladas!) and you just never want to leave - but alas, we had a train to catch! We came early evening so didn't have to queue very long but at busier times you can be queueing for ages which I can't be done with - no matter how good the food!",1
2,"I can give them points for storytelling but not for the good. 
It's really over rated. I run a food tour of Delhi and went to college close to Bombay. There is nothing Irani about this menu. The menu is surprisingly limited. There are only two veg curries and no dry veg or chicken dishes. Their signature Dal is too tomato-ee and does not bring out the flavours of the lentils at all. The service is in haste and sporadic. All our starters came together with drinks but were followed by the main course within 5 minutes and it was only 5:30PM. 
I've eaten much better Indian food in London. You can too.",-1
3,"Warning - be prepared for a long wait!
We (2 of us) visited Dishoom (Kings Cross) on a Tuesday night arriving at 7:30pm and were told that it would be a 2 hour wait, although as soon as there was room at the bar we would get let in. We waited outside for 20-30 min (but were given a hot cup of chai), then moved inside to a bench, but weren't allowed to order a drink there. Waited another 20-30 min, then sent downstairs to the bar. Were there for about an hour and a bit, ordered 2 cocktails and then were finally moved upstairs for dinner. I have a feeling this is the standard pattern of how things are done at this restaurant - so expect that you'll have to spend money on at least 2 cocktails in the bar before you can have dinner and you won't feel annoyed about it!
We had Keema pau, Chilli cheese toast to start (both were bordering on cold when they arrived). For mains we shared house daal, mattar paneer, murgh malai, kacchi lamb biryani, cheese naan.Can not fault any of the mains, arrived hot and well seasoned. Cheese nan was a bit too heavy perhaps (so much cheese!). Food prices are quite reasonable I think, but its the money you have to spend in the bar that really bumps up the bill. Not sure I like this system - not sure it happens at the Covent Garden branch.
The decor and design of the restaurant is very special though - nice to have a chance to see the whole place, but not sure I'll be back in a hurry (definitely not when I'm in a rush to eat).",-1
5,"I'm writing this review a bit late (catching up, lol) - but this place was absolutely amazing.  I came here for brunch, and have only eaten at a handful of places this flavorful.  My boyfriend and I have yet to find a better Chai tea (we've looked) since we returned to the U.S.  Very reasonably priced, very cool and trendy atmosphere, and the food is outstanding.",1
5,"I have been in London a few times. It is one of my favorite cities. And every time I'm here, I make a point to go to Dishoom. I have eaten in Brick Lane and yes there are great Indian restaurants there, but this place is beyond. The food, the service, the ambiance, everything is so on point that the experience is always amazing.
I have been at the one in Covent Garden but decided to visit this one. New up and coming area and the restaurant has been open for about a month or two. 
My wife, who does not like spicy food, yet loves Dishoom, and I decided to split the following;
-Dishoom Calamari. Crispy and a touch if sweetness. And the sauces they come with, mix excellent. 
-The Special-Nalli Nihari with Bheja (Of Course). A hearty stew. Leaves up to its billing. Amazing balance of taste and spice.
-Dishoom Chicken tikka. This classic and beautifully done. Delicious
-Cheese naan. Amazing, not much to say there.
-Rice. Soft, steamed basmati rice. perfect complement. 
-Kingfisher beer. If they don't have the Dishoom IPA (which is excellent) this is your second best option to pair with your food.
-Mango-fennel lassi. Just delicious. I always get this.
-Blow horn spiced cider. My wife got this. Very crisp and refreshing.
-Raita. Not only is helpful if you need to tame down the heat but its also delicious.
Another amazing experience at Dishoom. Thanks also to our server Paul. He was awesome.",1
5,"I LOVED my experience here. After rave reviews from one of my friends and seeing those sentiments echoed on Yelp, I popped-in for dinner. Because I was dining alone, I was able to skip the line and eat at the bar, but the line was absolutely absurd (take note if you're planning your night - at least they give samples of beverages and food while you're waiting). I had the chicken tikka (super flavorful, but a tad on the salty side), black house daal (delish - perfectly balanced flavors... recommend this with jasmine rice), and a virgin bhang lassi (highly recommend this smoothie-like drink, especially if you're not too good with spice - this will cool you down). These three items were more than enough for one person. I just wish we had this great of Indian food in a similar atmosphere in the US!",1
4,"I heard that Indian food in London was great and this Bombay style cafe certainly did not disappoint. Chocolate chai, Chilli cheese bread was delicious as well as the chicken tikka, gunpowder potatoes, and cheese naan. My only criticism was the vegetable somasos were a little soggy/chewy and the service was lack lustre. Not sure where our waiter was most of the time.",1
4,"Loved the atmosphere and the wood-paneled decor. I agree with other reviews that there is always a wait unless you go early.  The food was delicious. It was busy, but the service was still reasonably good.  I would definitely recommend this place for dinner and drinks.  Every dish we got was really good.",1
5,"This restaurant was a dream. If you've ever imagined what's like to travel in time and space to a different era, this is it. My friend and I popped in before our train to Paris, and we went from being in the middle of London in modern day to enjoying mango lassis under the swoop of large fans, feeling like the jungle was right outside, and this was one of few outposts of civilization. The restaurant is based on the Irani cafes in Bombay, but not being familiar with those, I could only identify it as feeling colonial, for better or for worse. The food was absolutely divine, and surprisingly cheap for the experience. A must see in London.",1
5,"Really delicious food, great range of curries! The prawn dish I had was amazing. 
The staff were so friendly and really contributed to us having an amazing night. .I even went back to give them a tip.
Please go and experience this restaurant if you like Indian food, you might well kick yourself if you don't!",1
4,"I am Indian. I am very picky about my restaurant Indian food. I was not absolutely blown away (especially after waiting almost two hours) but you should still eat here. It is trendy and gorgeous and the food hits the spot. And they have CHOCOLATE CHAI, my lifelong dream. Would give them three stars, but the chai adds a star. I didn't think it could be real, and then it was and I ordered it and I took a sip and I think it made me love my husband more... Powerful stuff. They do it right. Go with my blessings, beta.",1
5,"Was in London for about 3 days and came here twice because it was so good. Awesome ambience. It's a converted train station, with a big clock in the middle, lots of cool windows, and several stories. There's also burning incense in the air! Great vegetarian options as well. The curries are light and tasty, and the garlic naan is ultra garlicky-- just the way it should be! The staff is very nice too, gave us two free chai teas. Also had a dessert of chocolate pudding with cinnamon ice cream. It was so decadent and delicious! Love this place, and if I'm ever back in london, I will definitely be here again.",1
5,"Why can't there be Indian food like this in the US?  Great cocktails, delicious food. Not to miss if you appreciate good Indian food. Best vegetable samosas. Excellent chicken tikka and chicken ruby. Please open up a location in the US - we need Indian food this good.",1
5,"We got the samosas and pau bhaji to start:
- samosas were nice and flaky
- pau bhaji was decent, not a lot of curry for 6 to share
Then went with chicken tikka, lamb chops, gunpowder potatoes, dhal, chicken biryani, mattar paneer with a side of roti and garlic naan. The roti was good - soft and easy to take apart, and quite large too (we shared 2). The naan was decent. Chicken biryani wasn't very spicy and the mattar paneer had too much tomato flavor for my tastes, but everything else was great, would definitely recommend.
To drink I got the chocolate chai which was a nice, sweet way to end the meal.",1
4,"Came here for the first time tonight after hearing great things and it certainly didn't disappoint. The food was incredible, the okra fries and murgh malai in particular.  And I then went for the Eton mess style desert and a bite of my friends pineapple and black pepper crumble-two amazing sweet treats. The restaurant itself is very cool and has an industrial but cosy feel. I loved everything about it and the prices are so reasonable. The only reason it's missing the full 5 stars was that the service was quite slow, we were left waiting for so long  to order food and get the bill-although the staff are lovely! Will definitely be going back very soon!",1
5,"Yum! Tonight was my first time trying any of the Dishoom restaurants and I really enjoyed it.
I started out at the bar, I ordered a Chaijito, a fusion of Mojito and chai flavour. The guy behind the bar was very friendly and made my drink right away. It was very refreshing and I ended up having a few more. 
Once we were seated we ordered some okra and calamari to start. The okra was amazing especially with the Chili chutney. I didn't try the calamari the other guests really enjoyed it. 
Next we ordered some main dishes. And biryanis to share. The Bowl of Greens is a must! It doesn't look like anything special but the flavour it amazing and the greens are cooked to perfection. The House Black Daal was also very nice and paired with the Gunpowder Potatoes I was in heaven. 
All the staff were lovely and the waitress we had was very sweet and had a great personality.
Overall everyone enjoyed the meal. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. I will definitely return.",1
5,"Without question, the best Indian food we have had. The offerings are unique and so flavorful. If the food wasn't so great all around, I'd say eat samosas for your appetizer, meal, and dessert. We loved the setting and service was excellent too. Can't wait to be back in London for another taste.",1
2,"Ridiculous wait time for food that was ok.  Not saying that the food was bad,  but the was very limited for strict veg diet who don't eat eggs.  Not worth the wait or hype.  Glad I went once to see what the hype was. But for people who don't have strict diet please don't look at my review. It is really for the people who have the same diet as me.",-1
5,"Another excellent meal in this wonderful Indian restaurant, we love the food, the ethos and the staff!",1
3,"They like to stress the Persian/Irani heritage of this place, but it is 85% Indian influenced. I won't lie, it's got amazing atmosphere and ambiance. The decor is fabulous, the building is wonderful (love converted warehouses), and it is tres stylish. I sat at the bar because I was a single, though it was not very busy and would have appreciated a booth. I decided to go with the flow and trust them.
I think dining has a lot to do with trust when you're not sure on a place or you've never tried it. Yelp reviews and other people's recommendations can only go so far - in the end, it's what your tastebuds want, what your mind thinks is a good value for time and money. I think that for me, I will not be back because of the following:
1. When I was seated at the bar, I noticed how blaring loud the music was. Because of the open structure of the warehouse, the two levels in the restaurant allow for the music and chatter from the upstairs to melt in with the downstairs. So when the bartender tried to talk to me, I could not hear over his heavily accented murmurs.
2. While gorgeous, the bartenders can't be heard, at least by me. And they returned the favor. So I had to point out my items on a menu so I could be understood.
3. I decided on the spicy lamb rice dish with a side of raita. The raita is first rate but the rice dish... well, the meat bits were good, but the rice overall was bland. The side sauces worked temporarily (by the way, who doesn't have salt and pepper out if you're going with the logic of bland rice?) but I felt near the end overwhelmed by the spice, and not enough flavor. The raita was tastier than the entree. Bad sign.
4. I didn't want to finish the entree or the raita at the end. I was getting full, but remember my review for Salvation In Noodles when I talked about wanting to have a bigger stomach so I could eat more? I didn't feel that way at all for this place, these dishes, or the service. I think the bartender was disappointed that I wasn't ordering a drink and was confused why I would sit at the bar if I was just going to eat. Look buddy, I was just being polite and following the host's recommendation.
5. At the host bar, there's easily four or five employees just standing around talking to each other. Which kind of upset me just because no one bothered to walk over to the bar and at least set things up. The menu was set in front of me after I sat down, thirty seconds later. I know that's a picky thing to complain about and it normally wouldn't be a big deal, but personal touch is really missing from this place, which unlike SIN, doesn't have the food to make up for it.
Reasons to go? I dunno, I guess I can tell the bartenders put effort into their cocktails, they have a full bar, it may have been a dud dish I got, it may have been a bad seat, it also may have been the heat of the day that got me a little frustrated since Dishoom wasn't my first choice to eat at. I really wanted curry, and despite a lot of Indian inspired dishes, there was none. Crazy, right?
So take my review with a grain of salt. I only wish that they had some to share with me for the dish I got today.",-1
5,"Enter at your own peril! Culinary witchcraft in broad daylight!
We stumbled upon this restaurant when embarking on yet another pedestrian journey around London. We were hungry. It was on the way. So we briefly glanced over the menu and decided to give it a go. 
As soon as the doors opened, we stepped into a futuristic split-level, oddly decorated HUGE space, it felt like a set of Dark City, or The 13th Floor movies. That futuristic 50s, old with modern look. First impression - intriguing!
We were promptly ushered to our table. We ordered okra fries and calamari as a starter (both very morish and delicious), followed by gun powder potatoes (nom!), mahi tikka (delicious dry fish, but order a side of something), and a black house dhal (OH-EM-EF-GE, this flavour explosion is a must have).
The first time I visited, I was left LITERALLY speechless. The only thing that I was able to put together was profanity and swearing at just how incredibly unbelievable the food was. Honestly, it's witchcraft!
Despite what the waiter will suggest, DO NOT share the black house dhal! This magical substance can divide friendships and start a war at the table! We were forced to rely on the trusted rock-paper-scissors to decide who was worthy of the last spoonful. I kid you not!
Other deliciousness:
- roomali roti - this thing is nearly the size of a beach towel. You could order it instead of rice!
- chicken berry Britannia biryani - cooked in a dum pukht, where the pot is sealed with dough and content is cooked until it is tender and bursting with flavour
- chicken ruby murray - award winning! And it got us leaving FAT TIPS!
But wait! You're not allowed to leave yet! The desserts! What you gotta do is order the pineapple - black pepper crumble, and combine it with the cinnamon ice cream, ARE YOU INSANE! Oh lawd have mercy!
Other equally delicious ways to satisfy your sweet tooth are the kulfi ice cream. Have the pistachio one!
And just before you leave, order yourself a chai tea. 
Now that you're ready to do the penguin waddle after consuming what could have fed a small family of 12, welcome to the world of never ever being satisfied with any curry ever again. 
All in all, we think we are ruined! We have had to set ourselves strict limits and we are not allowing ourselves more than one visit a month. Enter at your own peril!
One suggestion - come early if you can. Sometimes you could end up queuing for 3 hours to get a table. Booking is only accepted for groups of 6+",1
4,"Having been to the other locations, I am excited to have Dishoom in Kings Cross, although I fear that this place is becoming a chain with its formulaic setting, service and menu.  But they execute well here.  Good somosas, dal to die for, great grilled potatoes and lots of other consistently well-executed food.  
The space is enormous so will be interesting to see if as word gets out whether this place will get packed.  Lots of different rooms and options for seating so it makes a big restaurant seem small.
I do like the background music--was busy Shazaming songs although many of them weren't recognized.",1
5,"I'm not a big fan of Indian cuisine, so when my boyfriend suggested going here for breakfast I was very dubious. But I really enjoyed it =p The staff were ridiculously awake and happy for 8am! I had a sausage naan with masala beans, so a little twist on English brunch and it was super. The fruit smoothies are juiced as and when you ask for one and they taste wonderful.",1
5,"So let me preface by saying that I am not the biggest fan of Indian food. But i am in London, and if you can't be in India this is the place to get it. A friend who travels to India a lot recommended this place.
We lucked out and got the last two seats at the upstairs bar, and thank goodness we did because the queue piled up fast. (as a note to those not afraid to wait- we did notice waitresses going out with complimentary shots of sherry). The building itself is beautiful. 
I have an aversion to cumin, and hence the aversion to indian. So I asked which meals didn't include it. not only was i given an answer, but an outlined menu on which meals could be made without so i desired. The food was incredible. I even ordered one dish out of my comfort zone and i think i will crave it when i return to boston. 
More importantly were the servers though, and the drinks. oh the drinks. They are craftsman behind the bar. such unique spins on common bar drinks. Bay leaf and green tea infused old fashion, with an accompanying history lesson as the backstory to the inspiration of the drink. Everyone we spoke to was so happy, so personable, so knowledgeable and just lovely to be around. 
this will become a staple place every time i visit London, without question. 
Thank you for such a wonderful evening that wont be forgotten.",1
5,"Having never been to Dishoom before I was able to visit the new Kings Cross location and cannot believe I have waited this long to try their food. 
Although I have seen it during the soft launch, the staff were knowledgable and attentive, the space itself was beautiful and reminded me of a cafe in an Indian train station and the food was incredible. 
I will come here as often as possible. I am determined to spend time in the basement bar.",1
4,"Went on a Tuesday night and waited for 2 hours for a table. We had heard about wait times but didn't expect this. When we showed up before 7 there was a lineup all across the front of the restaurant. Although we waited quite a long time, I have never had such a good waiting experience. From drinks provided in the queue, to being moved to the bar as a secondary waiting area, 2 hours actually seemed to go by quickly. The place was well staffed and my friends and I became quite convinced that a girl's sole job was to go around making sure incense was always burning everywhere. Atmosphere was great. The building is massive, it's crazy to think how long we had to wait considering all the tables actually in the restaurant. 
Food and drinks were stunning. We were 6 all sharing so I can't actually confirm everything I tried, but it was all amazing. Will definitely go back.",1
4,"Finally made it to Dishoom after much anticipation. I loved the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant and we were lucky enough to get seated quite quickly. The staff were very friendly and we were served some nice chai tea while waiting to be seated. Although they initially told us it would be a 45-60 minute wait we were seated in about 20 minutes. I had the mango lassi to drink which was very refreshing and not too sweet. The waiter recommended 3/4 plates per person which was more than enough food and we had enough to take leftovers home. The best dishes were the calamari, the matar paneer and the black daal lentils. Everything was quite spicy so be careful if you don't like spicy food. I was very impressed with the price for the quality of food, nothing we ordered was more than about 8 pounds. Overall great experience and a beautifully designed restaurant.",1
5,"This restaurant is located in a former railway barn. Great atmosphere, great food and even gluten-free",1
5,"I believe it is very hard to do a themed restaurant without it being tacky, but they have managed it! 
The theme is Bombay cafes in the 1920s and 1930s when prohibition was enforced so alcohol could only be drunk with a permit and they were the only place that everyone all Indian castes could go.
Right down to the drinks served in apothecary glasses, the historical pictures on the wall and the real research that has got into this place, aligned with their quest for to authenticate flavours,  makes this brilliant place.
Bookings are hard to get at short notice and turning up means a 1.5 hour wait, even on a weeknight. They  do make you feel very comfortable while waiting in the drinks area, but probably not worth waiting quite this long.
The average age is probably late twenties and there are few people in the mid 40s and above, this is a trendy cool place and is quite noisy as goes with places for such a young crowd. 
The service levels are high, they really know how to talk about what a serving and whoever runs this place is bang.  However the waiters do have that slight cold edge of being on sales commission.
It is not cheap, but not overly expensive.
An authentic a big recommendation, that you will enjoy and so will the people you take.",1
4,"Dishoom is the epitome of fusion; everything from the food menu, to the array of drinks to the layout of the restaurant and even the staff members are a wonderful mishmash of ingredients and culture. A replica of a Bombay Cafe, Dishoom represents a Persian influenced restaurant located in Bombay. The inside of Dishoom is certainly elaborate and transports you to another world. Their lamb and chicken is succulent, their prawns are sweet and their salad is fresh. My only criticisms of their food are that they have not allowed the Naan and Roti bread to rise much but instead enabled them to become a little dry with less flavour and whenever they have grilled the food the exteriors have been somewhat burnt and blackened. Both the drinks and desserts hold pleasant surprises and tasteful combinations. The waiter said I was brave to try the Kala Khatta Sharbat which contains kokum fruit juice, chilli, citrus and black salt but actually far from being a decision I would live to regret, as with most of their ventures, they succeed in achieving the combination of interesting yet pleasant. Unfortunately the toilets are buried far away and underground so try not to eat so much that it's hard to move, or drink so much that you would urgently need to relieve yourself. It is remarkable however how uniquely designed even the toilets are to suit the whole image of the restaurant. I am not a fan of smelling incense at every turn but all-round wonderful to behold, Dishoom is top-notch for originality.",1
4,"I have been waiting for an opportunity to try Dishroom and couldn't resist not to try the new King Cross branch when I heard about a soft launch. We queued for 1hr 20mins in the pouring rain. But thank you for Dishroom providing us entertainments to keep us amuse in the queue.
There are a range of drinks (alcoholic and non-alcholic) to order and all look interesting.  I started off with one of the rose lassis and was hoping to finish the evening with the Bailey Chai which was unfortunately sold out.
The food was good but could had been warmer as most of our cooked dishes were luke warm. I enjoyed the okra fries and the Bhel which we started as an appertiser.
I love the chicken ruby over the chef special (nalli nihari). But both was nice with roti or naan bread. Instead of steamed rice we had the chicken berry britannia which reminded me of another version of fried rice.
There are a range of grills and we orderd a few to try. My favourite has to be the Murgh Malai which used chicken thigh that give it that smooth succulent chicken texture.
Dessert we tried the pisatchio kulfi and the pineapple and black pepper crumble. I could not remember tasting or seeing any black pepper. It was like apple crumble but pineapple instead. 
The service was really slow but it has improved since the soft launch. We struggled to get service and getting a menu or making an order took ages.
Overall good place and will return!",1
5,"this place . This is the first time my husband and I have had Indian food and we  everything we had The street Bombay food was very very flavorful minus the poor food condition in Bombay, as my husband has been in downtown Bombay  prices, quality & quantity is excellent. If you don't want to wait at LEAST an hour every night I suggest going at noon.  This place has tons of seating room but is always full with waiting at night.",1
5,Love this place...when I come to London for business trips I make sure to have at least one meal here.,1
5,"It was extremely busy when we came here (and i can see why, such delicious food) but the staff compensated us with a free bottle of wine and free drinks while we waited, and once we sat down the service was so quick! and our waitress (I think called jo), was so lovely and helpful
the food is delicious here, and the atmosphere is amazing, it feels like a movie set
really well priced as well, for how excellent the food is. totally recommend!",1
5,"If you're looking for an authentic and scrumptious Indian meal, THIS IS IT. We ordered the Dishoom Chicken Tikka which was absolutely amazing! The chicken was moist and incredibly flavourful. We also got the black dhal and a vegetarian curry which was amazing and paired really nicely with the garlic naan. The concept is similar to how it is in India as well where food are served in small portions and meant to be shared. Price for each dish averaged between £5 to £9. The service was impeccable with attentive and friendly servers. All-in-all, an amazing experience. Definitely worth a return.",1
3,"If you're looking for top class service and atmosphere this is the place. 
If you are looking for great Indian food, this isn't the place. 
I found most of the dishes were sweet, as if the chef replaced spice with sugar. 
The wait for a table was a killer, so advise to get there very early. The menu selection is limited and the portion size was small so really you are paying for the service (even though it's a separate charge on your bill). Really it's a shame, as the service is probably in the top ten in London (if you discount the waiting time), but its just not Indian food as expected, more like sweet tapas with a Indian twist",-1
2,"I give a smirk when I see the line. Its good but not great. Maharani Camden has better more authentic north indian food and they actually deliver. Dishoom on the other hand has too many restrictions. No take away after 5pm. No delivery. You can't order certain things off their lunch menu.The portions are tiny for the price. The only thing fantastic about the place is the ambiance but its not a place for a first date, it's very loud during lunch and dinner hour.",-1
4,"Really solid Indian food, nice atmosphere, and good value for the price. Liked the little touches in the decor.",1
5,"came here three times last time I was in London. SO good. cocktails were great, wine was meh, but the food was fantastic.",1
5,Hands down the best Indian food I've had. Ruby chicken was amazing. Perfect sweet and spice. Came back for breakfast and got the most incredible naan bacon and egg wrap. Hope they open one in LA. Will be back next time I'm in London!,1
5,"This was a great dining experience! We were prepared to wait, so we weren't bothered by the one hour line. We just had a drink (the drink menu was really fun to read!) and got our table sooner than expected. The service continued to be great, with our waiter taking several trips to the kitchen to make sure our meal was free from coriander. And, of course, the food was amazing too. The chicken ruby, black daal and lamb chops were all so flavorful and delicious. We also had roti and some rice, and samosas to start. If I were to repeat this meal I would order these exact same items, maybe with the okra fries which were out.",1
5,"What a great place to enjoy authentic Indian food while in London.  My wife and I stopped here after reading the solid reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed.  We had the Vegetable Samosas Biryani, and the Chicken Tikka.  All were extremely flavorful with just the right amount of seasoning/spice.  We finished our meal with a traditional chai tea latte and their famous chocolate chai tea.  The chocolate is very good!  Come here to enjoy a great meal!",1
4,"W O W! My only two even slightly negative comments are: this was not an easy place to find without GPS (the map on their website is NOT clear!), and we waited longer to get the check than we did between ordering and getting our food which is just plain annoying.
The FOOD however was divine, absolutely wonderful and inventive. We had fried okra, which my 16 year old daughter discovered was a lot spicier three minutes after the first bite than she reckoned on. I adored it! The okra is not fried whole as I've had it before, but rather in thick slivers and the coating has lime and chili in it. I also really enjoyed the garlic naan, which was offered with or without butter- I went for with of course. Murgh malai (chicken with garlic, ginger, coriander stems and cream) was not spicy but flavorful and enjoyed by my daughter, I had the mango paneer salad, vegetable samosas and bowl of greens. This last was quite yum but had a LOT of sauce...if we had had rice it might have soaked it up but we went with roti and naan so it didn't add much. I was truly looking forward to the dessert called ""kala khatta gola ice""... but sadly they were out. So they offered us complementary chai and when we said ""no thanks"" ( as we wanted tea and scones at the V&A later) the server surprised us with complementary ice creams! The cinnamon was intensely flavored, not necessarily a bad thing...but the chili ice cream (yup, a slightly orange concoction) was downright sneaky! The first taste was smooth, creamy, slightly sweet and then POW! your tastebuds come under assault from the spicy chili. I managed four bites before putting down my spoon.
We went Saturday afternoon around 2:15 and waited less than five minutes to be seated, less than ten before we ordered, less than ten to get our food...but almost twenty to get our bill. I didn't add to the included 12.5% service charge, but I didn't subtract anything either...
Try this place if you have a varied palate, especially if you like your food spicy!",1
5,"I don't know where to begin. This place ROCKS. First off, their drinks and food are amazing, the Bombay colada is awesome and the brilliant bartenders are excellent at improvising with drinks. Our server, Mat was sassy and fun and recommended delicious food. We order the raita (cucumber yogurt), which perfectly complimented our order of murg malai (grilled chicken with some lovely spices). We also had the best curry ever: chicken ruby! Spicy, but full of flavor that left you wanting more. Also, we had the number one bartenders on the planet. It was me and my two best friends in our party, and bartenders Jan and Pavel took GREAT care of us. I've never had service from a bartender, let alone TWO bartenders, that was this amazing. They made us delicious drinks on the spot. These two gentlemen are definitely the reason I will be back incredibly soon! Thank you Jan and Pavel!! Dishoom was the best dinner my friends and I had in London. The food and service was out of this world. Did I mention they gave us some delicious chai drink while we waited in line? Yeah. This place is awesome. If you go anywhere else, don't expect you'll get as good of service as this place will get you. Especially at the bar!!",1
5,"We just completed an amazing meal here.  Oh wow!  Incredibly good and friendly service, interesting, fun space in a large converted warehouse, great cocktails, but it's really all about the food! Just delicious Indian - most of it nicely authentic and respectful of traditional Indian, yet much of it with a great modern twist that made it even more interesting without being pretentious or fussy.  Decent value as well. The desserts - we tried four of them - were just as amazing!",1
5,"Really awesome spot -- fantastic food, atmospherics and service. Masterfully decorated and exceptionally run. A real must, great for intimate or group gatherings including families. Also, a real model of how things should be run -- neighboring spots, take note!",1
4,"I much prefer this branch to the Covent Garden branch of Dishoom. Despite the infamous wait, service looks after you with a cup of cha and snacks. It's far more roomy inside and has a pretty cool layout with mezzanine dining above the bar area. Food is great (lamb chops get two thumbs up), but portions are pretty small - it's the only fault that makes me question the epic wait.",1
5,"The fried okra appetizer is to die for! Had a bit of a wait to get in, but well worth it.",1
5,"Best Indian food I've had when traveling to London. Such fabulous decor, really unique. There's always a wait, but it's so worth it! Enjoy a cocktail at their awesome bar.",1
4,Had a great meal here. Service is excellent. My favorites were the dal (recommended by the server -- he was so right) and the naan. The lamb chops were good although not exceptional. The bowl of greens was overcooked.,1
5,"Love this location. Great food and atmosphere. Would definitely recommend going there. Be sure to get the biriyanis, black daal and chicken ruby!",1
4,"It was really good. I've never been to another indian restaurant before and I really enjoyed it. Good service, nice meals, super tasty. The restaurant itself is really nice as well. The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is that it's quite expensive, moreover you'll sometimes need to buy a few things separately so it can be around 25£ per person, but it's worth it!",1
4,Not many options for vegetarians but great food ambiance and drinks. Sugarcane juice !! Oh yeah!!,1
5,"I went home feeling like I want to rewind and eat everything all over again. I ordered the chicken biryani which went amazingly well with the yoghurt and the nan etc. Fried courgettes were spectacular, prawns and calamari..  I ate everything they have really. And their dessert was to die for and the service was on point and not to mention the venue itself! What a magical place..  it's Indian with a modern twist. Enjoy every second of it!",1
5,"This place is very popular and even when it's pretty quiet on the streets of London on a bank holiday Monday the place is buzzing. We over ordered getting 3 starters and 2 mains but it was all very good. You need to be a group of 6 or more to reserve a table. Btw, it wasn't very spicy and I prefer it eye wateringly hot!",1
4,"A very different take to your usual Indian restaurant - but a good different! Had a selection of snacks and main dishes and everything was really tasty, including the extensive drinks menu too. Only thing would be portions are relatively small and we were a group so had reservations and no waiting for a table - which I hear can be really long! Worth a visit",1
4,"Great food, and great cocktails. It was extremely busy and the line was long, but they comp'd us the drinks for waiting longer than the amount of the time they'd quoted so big thumbs up from me! That chai paanch is so velvety on your tongue, you'd never guess it was a clarified milk cocktail.",1
5,"Just happened by and chose the place since we were pressed for time. We lucked out, this place was outstanding. The waiter was awesome, explaining everything on the menu. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious!",1
4,"Good selection of dim sum, overall very good but I was expecting something that I couldn't get back home in Glasgow. Loon Fung in Glasgow is actually pretty similar in taste and the selection available.",1
1,"The staff is so rude. My one year old daughter played with 4 toothpick. The waiter said in Cantonese, ""Don't hurt yourself. Otherwise you will cry with no tears."" It means you can only blame yourself. He was not showing any care at all.
And then my daughter played the china spoon. We was just gonna to replace our own plastic spoon. The same waiter came across again with a very mean tone: be careful don't break it. 
How can customers have enjoyable dining experience in your restaurant?!!",-1
2,"We stumbled on this place in Chinatown and were hoping to get dimsum, but noticed that they only serve it for lunch sadly. The interior is clean and the menu is expansive with options for everyone.
We ordered the duck, the chow mein, tofu with broccoli, and orange chicken. All of the food was FAR too salty besides the duck which was cooked perfectly. The only thing I would order again would be the duck. Everything else was too greasy, slimy, and salty.
Overall, would not come here again! I had hopes since the yelp reviews were decent but this place disappointed me.",-1
5,"My husband and I found ourselves wandering around Chinatown shortly after seeing a musical in the West End.  Many of the restaurants had menu boards outside.  Most of them were open late and we were interested in a snack.  
I had a terrible time deciding where to stop.  I'm pretty picky about my Chinese food after doing a study abroad in Shanghai a few years ago.  However, when we came upon Golden Dragon, all signs pointed to ""here.""  First, there were about a million Yelp stickers on the window and I love yelp, it rarely steers me wrong.  Secondly, Golden Dragon is the name of our favorite Chinese restaurant back home.  Third, my husband saw the ducks and knew that was exactly what he wanted so in we went.  
My husband debated over which version of the duck to get and eventually decided on the duck with rice based on the recommendation of the server.  He LOVED it.  He said it was one of the best things that he ever put in his mouth.  It was by far and away his favorite meal in London, but one of his favorite meals of the year.  He wouldn't shut up about it the rest of the trip.  
I ordered egg fried rice which I know sounds really boring, but it sounded incredible to this pregnant lady.  My stomach is super out of whack these days so I wanted something simple.  It was also very late so I didn't want to eat anything too heavy either.  I don't think the photo I took of my rice does it justice.  It looks really boring, but it was actually super delicious.  It had great balance of flavor.  
Finally, the prices were reasonable and the service was fast and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place.",1
4,"A nice busy chinese restaurant in the heart of China town London. The restaurant is clean - 2 story and full of people dining. 
The food is flavorful, priced fairly, but I can tell that they used a lot of MSG. I felt the saltiness and headache after a couple of hours.
The roasted pecking duck was great. And so as the rest of our order.",1
3,fresh ingredients but bland seasoning - no spice in the kung po. Service is as expected for Chinatown.,-1
2,"The dinner menu here makes it easy to order your food just by pointing, but too bad not everything you order looks like the picture. No surprise some places do that. But then I looked over at someone else's table and their version looks like it's ready for a tv commercial. The waitress told me it was because I said I wanted soft noodles inside of crispy. The bbq pork looked like it was days old, had no red outer glaze, and was inedible. I asked the other waiter if he would eat it and he paused for a good minute making an awkward smile then replied no. Nothing was done to resolve this.  
The other dishes we ordered were ok at best.
FYI - Service fee of 12.5% is added to your bill automatically. The table next to us was screaming about it",-1
3,"My girlfriend and I luckily stumbled upon London's Chinadown while taking a stroll around Piccadilly Circus. Although there were plenty of restaurants to choose from, we rolled the dice on Golden Dragon after seeing their decent Yelp reviews. 
It was no surprise that about 95% of the customers were non-Asian and, from the looks of it, were probably tourists, but don't let that deter you from thinking the food was not legit. Once we got inside and were seated, we actually could have easily mistaken the restaurant for any Chinese restaurant we had been to back home in New York. In addition, we were greeted by employees that spoke to us in Cantonese, and in a way it made us feel like we were home. 
As for the menu and food, the menu selection was huge and very detailed. Every legit food that we could get back home was on the menu for all to see. All of it in Chinese and English. The only gripe we had about the menu ... the prices! Everything was much more expensive here.
After mulling over the menu, we decided on the Crispy Sucking Pig, Orange Duck and Tofu with green vegetables. When the dishes came out there was an obvious observation and that was that the dishes were kind of small for family style type food. The flavors were OK, but nothing like we hadn't had before. However, it wasn't a bad thing either because we now knew that London had a Cantonese food scene that we didn't realize existed prior.
Bottom line: The restaurant was huge (with 2 floors), the employees were fairly nice and spoke good English, the menu was legitimately true to Cantonese style food and the flavors were average compared to what we had experienced back home.",-1
2,Yuck. Fried rice extremely bland. Pork slices with greens not what was described and once I got it it was tough and chewy to the point where I had to spit it out. Soup was bad. I'm only giving it two stars because I'm in a good mood. My advice: go somewhere else,-1
1,"Food bland.  Overcooked noodles that was supposed to have crab.  Lots of carrots, green stuff, and needed a magnifying glass to find crab.  When we arrived we were taken upstairs and put with the all the non Asian people. We noticed upstairs it was paper napkins, downstairs  cloth napkins. Watch out they charge 12.5% service charge.  Typical tip 10% in London.  As you can imagine  don't expect great service.  Huge disappointment as this place was recommended",-1
5,"This restaurant is our favorite Chinese spot in London.  Every time we're in London we always make it a must do.  We come here for the Dim Sum which is our favorite.  We live in the states and I got to admit this is the best Dim Sum I've ever had, including back home in the US.",1
4,Try the Ho Fun- it is phenomenal! We also got the vegetarian stir fry with tofu but the tofu was pretty dry.,1
4,"Could this restaurant sever the best Peking duck in town? I dare not offend, but yes!
My mates and I were just craving some Peking duck and this restaurant, filled with yelp stickers on their window, served us exactly what we wanted. I would say I have an average knowledge of Peking duck around the world. Beijing tends to be really fatty and oily because that's how they like it. Hong Kong tends to serve the skin and aerate it so it's crispy and light. London, on the other hand, serves it crispy and light but cuts off loads of meat so we can eat the meat too!
We also ordered some other side dishes as well. Roast pork, Pei Pa Tofu, Kung Po Chicken, Garlic Kale. They were all very tasty and I can see myself trying other things on the menu in the future. I'm making a mental note to try their Dim Sum in the new year!
In terms of service, I felt that it could be better. Like any Chinatown restaurant, I find that they're a bit pushy. They wanted us to order food as soon as possible, eat and leave. I'm use to that. But I don't see why they need to be that pushy when they still have extra tables for customers.",1
4,"Fantastic dim sum place. 
We dropped in here with a party of five on a Sunday afternoon and got a table after only a twenty minute wait.
Staff are very attentive and friendly. Their dim sum menu is quite large and everything was super tasty. Service is fast, even in a packed restaurant. There's definitely a reason people queue up to eat here.
We didn't try their regular menu, but I'd highly recommend their dim sum, especially for larger parties!",1
1,"Horrid horrid experience. Please read review and consider what I am saying. The place says Dim Sum on the outside but does not serve dim sum passed 6:00pm so went went for the incredibly lackluster menu. Food was bland, service worse paid and went to leave, left my receipt on the table upon leaving was grabbed by the staff who said they needed the signed copy, which I left on the table. Was physically held against my will and demanded the police intervene and they never called them. Please avoid, very unsafe atmosphere.",-1
1,The waiters spilled hot tea on my leg and it essentially BURNED my leg. Now I have a dark cherry mark on my leg. Food was bland and they tried to charge us extra on the bill. Really bad Chinese restaurant.,-1
4,"The best thing I had was the dim sum, which was exactly why I stopped in.  Nice size establishment tucked away in china town (London).  I wish the customer service was a little better, and the knowledge of the dishes, but maybe I misuderstood some things.  All in all, a decent restaurant, with a very large chinese menu.  My szechuan was good, and spicy just how I like it!",1
4,Recommended by a friend.  Food was great! They were slammed so customer service is at a 4. Would recommend to other,1
3,"Good food in London's version of Chinatown. I was a little disappointed that when I arrived they no longer were serving dim sum. Made do with what they had on the menu (lots of good food) and had a delicious and filling meal. I was made slightly uncomfortable by the fact that the staff circled the dining room and I felt like I was being watched throughout my entire meal. What I loved about this restaurant was that they were able to store my large travel backpack for me while I ate (I had just come from the train station). There is plenty of seating, so getting a seat shouldn't be too difficult.",-1
2,"If you love to read an impossible to navigate menu and have a waitresses question how thirsty you are,then the Golden Dragon is for you.  I am going to assume that she had tenure, because that is the only reasons to give piss poor service the way she did. Other than that The food was pretty tasty and there were a couple of different wait staffers that help and the brief interaction we had with them more in enjoyable than the what seemed one minute to long with the waitresses with RBF.",-1
3,"We were drawn in by the dim sum, but realized they only had it at lunch. The food was good, the duck was excellent. The service wasn't what we expected. No personality and our chairs were bumped by waiters a few times with no apology.",-1
4,"Was looking for a good place for Chinese since that is something that I cant find easily back home.  This place is in the heart of Chinatown in Soho and while it was very busy the night I was there, it took less than ten minutes to be seated.  Taking a tip from other reviewers I tried the crispy duck appetizer, then some wonton soup, followed by a crispy beef with chili main course.  Overall the food was quite good and I did not find it too salty as some reviewers have found it.  The duck was the best and I would not hesitate to go back just for that dish.  The soup was overflowing with wontons which was great, but the flavor was mild.  I expected the crispy beef with chili to have some heat to it, and it may have, but this was cut by its sweetness.  Reminded me of General Tso's chicken I have had elsewhere, which would have been fine but I was expecting a more savory and hotter dish (this was no fault of the food or it's preparation, just my expectations).",1
3,"I'm writing this as I wait to digest my starter. Don't get my wrong, our main courses are in front of us but we so, so full. Words cannot describe how we're feeling right now.
In short, great food but do not over estimate yourself. You cannot take down the following between 2:
Half a duck,
Spring rolls,
2 soft shell crabs,
Prawn crackers,
Crispy pork belly on rice,
Sea weed,
Singapore noodles,
Crispy shredded beef. 
It's a pity that they didn't advise us on the amount we ordered as the food is generally pretty good. Going to have to get a doggy bag...",-1
5,"Love coming here for dim sum. Service is good, food is great and prices are reasonable. There's usually a wait so be prepared.",1
1,"45 minutes...still waiting for shrimp...beef and rice...We ask manager how much longer? With attitude he said that it is normal to wait. Also he added...you can leave if you dont want to wait...Really? 
Food just Okay...nothing special...
Try to find other place to eat.",-1
1,I wish I could put 0/5. I wouldn't recommend it. We never even go to the food because we had to order a minimum of 10 pounds per person plus the hidden service charge of 12.5% and none of us wanted more. The server would be judging all of us on our orders. They offered tea and didn't even mention that it cost money until AFTER we all poured a glass. It was the WORST experience I've ever had. Piece of shit!!,-1
4,"I came here with a couple friends on a Tuesday evening (around 6 pm) and the place was already fairly packed. The wait wasn't too bad though - no more than 10 minutes. For food we went for three dishes - sauteed prawns with vegetables, monk vegetable dish, and honey barbecue pork (I don't remember the exact names) - and three orders of white rice. 
After we ordered, the lady taking our order indicated that she thought three dishes wouldn't be enough for us - this was fine, but what bothered me was how when we said we would order more later if that turned out to be the case, she said that if we did that we would have to wait 20 minutes for the next round of food...I also didn't appreciate how when we got three orders of rice (for four people) and I asked how big the rice portions were, she said they were ""very small"" and ""only for one person."" Both of her claims turned out to be wrong, however, as the three dishes were perfect for feeding four people, and the rice portions were HUGE.
Anyway, I was very satisfied with the food. My favorite dish was the prawns, which I thought was very light but well-flavored. I also liked the monk vegetable dish, which came with stir-fried tofu, mushrooms, and other greens. The honey barbecue pork though...I wasn't a fan - it was very difficult to chew and was too heavy on the sauce, in my opinion.
Overall, I enjoyed my meal here (despite the service in the beginning) and the food definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food. I've been to a couple other Chinese restaurants in the area, and this place has definitely been my favorite so far in terms of both food and service (overall).",1
1,"1. Zero customer service. 2. Manager is super rude. 3. Waiting for a food for 45 min and when we asked the manager how much longer we have to wait answer was as much as we need to prepare your food, do you still want it or you wanna leave? (Helllloooo I'm your customer be nice) 4. Come once to USA and learn to give a customer service and be polite, smile and be nice.",-1
1,"Terrible service and slimy, terrible food. A package of top ramen would have been better than the sad excuses for noodle dishes - the shrimp looked like the dried shrimp that come in cup-o-noodle packages. Their famous duck was dry, sad and disappointing.",-1
1,Yea... we waited for more than 30min for our dishes. Very hungry. These were really not complicated things to make.,-1
2,"After a very long and exhausting day walking around in the streets, or more likely the underground hopping in London, we found our way to ChinaTown and visited this place because of a recommendation from a friend. It didn't take long before we were seated, at first we were told to go upstairs, but the lady saw we had luggage and didn't wanted to hand them in the ""wardrobe"" so she found another spacious table for us close to the door. We ordered a couple of things and got our chinese tea pretty quickly. 1 teapot were charged for 5 people and I see the same teapot everywhere it doesn't even depend on how many people were drinking from that. Our orders arrived pretty fast and before we thought about taking picture of our first dish, it disappeared quickly since we were so hungry! It looked delicious but I miss a bit taste to it, the others at the table agreed it was the fried beef ricenoodles. Then our fung chao arrived, there was nothing to complain about it. The charsiu buns were also fine! We also ordered 1/2 duck, it was perfect but a little bit raw since the meat was a bit too rosy. We also ordered charsiu cheong fun and it was smooth and delicious! 
Last but not least, we know that in London there's always a discretionairy charge so we were fine with it, but the waiter never came back with our change, at least if he was expecting tips, he should have come back with our money first, BEFORE TAKING WITHOUT ASKING. HOW RUDE! This is why it's a 2-star worth because of the service (VERY IMPORTANT!) and the expensive chinese tea.",-1
3,"Dinner at Golden Dragon was decent although a little bit more attention to detail in the kitchen could have made everything over the top amazing.  We had:
- Baked crab with ginger and scallions:  this is a classic Cantonese preparation of crab although I'd never had it baked.  The crab was perfectly cook and the flavour was spot on.  They used a bit too much cornstarch to coat the crab though and brown crab and coating generally was gloopy because of it.  Still tasty but the consistency could have been less viscous.
- Gai lan with oyster sauce:  again, another classic Cantonese dish.  Unfortunately, the gai lan was overcooked.   The stalks should have been still slightly crunchy but instead were very soft.
- Salt and pepper pork chops with chillis:  very tasty seasoning which was great with rice.  The pork chops were unfortunately not served on the bone and were slightly overcooked.
The food was good but could have been slightly better.  However, I'd still come back here for a meal.  They do good dim sum if you are around at lunchtime.",-1
4,"Dim sum in London? Look no further. This place is it. First of all, the dim sum menu (like most Yelpers said) is super friendly - with pictures for each menu item served so you know exactly what you are getting. I'm Chinese but my Chinese is shabby so I always somehow manage to order a wrong dish when faced with a menu with no pictures and just text (even when it's translated into English). The wait was under ten minutes for two people at 2:00pm on a busy Saturday. 
We got: shrimp/chive dumplings (good), bbq pork triangular pastries (a must get, there's a reason this menu item takes up one FULL page of their dim sum menu - it is definitely one of the hottest centrefolds I have ever seen), chicken feet w/ black bean sauce (really good), scallop cheung fun (pass, I have had better), fried shrimp dumplings with salad cream (pass, I have had way better), beef chow fun (good), taro croquettes (good), duck tongue (good, if you are into that stuff--my date was), and steamed spare ribs w/ black bean sauce (portions are too small but they are good). 
As for the spotty service, we didn't experience any. You get different servers who bring you what you have ordered and some of them are smiling, some of them are not - but who cares? I feel like people who leave bad reviews just because not every server smiled at them when they put the food down is just looking to get their egos stroked. The food is piping hot, fresh and delicious. When you ask for water, it comes fast and when you want an extra plate of chili oil, it comes right away. Tea pot out of hot water? Flip the top up and put it on the edge of your table - it is a Chinese standard way of telling the servers you are in need of a tea refill. Tea is £1.50 pp but it has unlimited refills, and the refills come fast, which is surprising since my date and I  were seated in a dark corner - we thought they would forget about us, but that was far from the truth. 
I'm a generous tipper but don't like to be ambushed with the mandatory 12.5% service charge when handed the bill. This was the first dim sum place in Chinatown to have that mandatory 12.5% - so I took one star away. Other than that, I recommend this place and would take my parents here if they ever come visit me in London!",1
2,"Very busy and crowded but feels undeserved. The service was sub par. The food was equally sub par. E.g. Fried rice was soggy and chicken was overly salty. 
Honestly, I would not return nor would I recommend this if another restaurant is available.",-1
2,"I decided to try this place rather than opting for my usual picks in China Town.
I ordered duck and pork as i normally would do to see if they make it any better. It did not take long for us to be served nor did it take long for the food to arrive either.. But that was the problem, fried squid was too salty and soggy, not at all crispy. Portions were not as impressive as some of the photo reviews i've seen either - maybe because it was a Friday night, who knows.
Upon receiving the bill i asked about their discretionary service charge - waitress was quick to defend and in her words ""you sat down, we served you.."" Quite forceful like I had no choice but to pay it.
Whatever, I was going to pay it anyway i was only asking. Needles to say, she did not come back to process my payment and had to call over another waiter.",-1
4,"This place was my favorite when I was living in London, in a flying visit, I decided to go back and see if the food is still good.
It was jam packed on a week night, a good sign.  
There were only the two of us, so we ordered a Wanton Soup,  Eel and Roast Pork Hotpot, BBQ Roast Pork and Suckling Pig, and the Bean Shoot in Garlic sauce.  
The Wanton Soup was nothing special to me. The eel was very well cooked, not overcooked which is easily done.  The Roast Pork and Suckling pig was great.  The vegetables was cooked to perfection.  
I can testify that it still is as authentic as food I ate in Hong Kong, the service is efficient but impersonal.  Price is like everywhere else in the neighborhood.  I will not hesitate to go back again if I am in the same hood.",1
4,"Decided on eating in china town london, and got a table  for four straight away. 
We ordered drinks, starters and mains. They did miss off one guy's noodles so he just ate the other noodles n rice on the table. It was tasty and reasonably quick. 
One waiter didn't really do what we asked when we asked him to see where the noddles were, he never came back to us, we asked a second waiter who checked and found it was not on the order.
But I would return to eat again.",1
2,"Very rude personnel, however, the food is not bad. They have quite a lot of dishes on the menu and the food tastes quite nice. They could definitely work on their customer service and that was all I could think of when I left the restaurant. If I had to rate them purely on the quality of food, I would have given them 3 stars. I wouldn't recommend this place and I wouldn't return there.",-1
5,"For my first dim sum experience in London, Golden Dragon was a jaw-dropping and belly-gratifying opening salvo, so I'm glad my mates invited me along!
We started with half a roast duck, dripping with nutrients (see: fat), and the flavors were so rich, I wasn't even really tempted by the usual orange sauce. My mouth just kept flashing DUCK, MM, DUCK into my brain, which was more than okay.
Then the waves of steamed dumplings started washing over us all, and there were serene moments of the eight of us just chewing and sighing at how good it was. 
Big fan of their Shanghai soup dumplings actually, and the boiling soup didn't have that MSG tang when it hits the back of your throat.
Other highlights were their aubergine clay pot (get some white rice to soak up all juices, folks), the sticky rice packets, and the spicy chicken feet.
Staff was rather friendly! We had an OBSCENE amount of decadent food, and it came out to £17 a person.
Come check it out on a Sunday afternoon with your eating dress on, and then go curl up somewhere for naptime before the dim sum sweats start.",1
2,"The food was decent and the restaurant was clean, so I would have rated this three stars, but given the service and the price - I simply cannot.
When I stepped into this place, the server did not say ""hello.""  Instead, she said ""10 pounds minimum.""  I thought this was a bit rude, but I was starving and missing Asian food, so I sat.
I ordered the following:  1 cup of hot and sour soup (decent, not great), salt and pepper soft shell crab (very good), and crispy noodles with seafood (decent, but the sauce was clumpy), and 1 glass of water.  My food was served efficiently, but the service was never friendly.
To top it all off, the bill was 23 £ - and yes, they added the 12.5% for the ""service"" I received.  The most offensive part is that they charged me 2 £ for my small glass of still water.  If they were going to charge me for my water, they could have (at the very least) left me the bottle on the table!  I do not mind paying for good service and great food, but that was not the case here.",-1
4,"Delicious Dim Sum. The best by far were the pork soup dumplings, the fried pork dumplings and the prawn steamed dumplings. Wish we had ordered the duck it looking amazing. You also can't beat the price! Very reasonable for all the food we got but even with two people you are required to order 5 Dim Sum.",1
4,"Decently priced dim sum, my friend and i enjoyed the food very much. We did get seated in a corner..so it was very hard to get the check as none of the waiters can see us! You just mark on the slip what dim sum you want to order and it comes out pretty quickly. I'd come again for dimsum when I come back to UK!",1
2,"Food: average- OK BUT not for vegetarians. 
Service: blunt
Price: expensive for what you get. 
There s a discretionary charge on your bill. 12,5%. 
We always leave a tip but to already charge it ! That's just arrogant. 
Would I go back ? No.",-1
3,"I've been to Golden Dragon for so many times for dim sum and dinner. Personally, it is my favourite dim sum restaurant in London. It deserves 4 stars for the food, however, the service seems to be a bit worse than before. 
Last weekend, a friend and I decided to have dim sum for lunch and I suggested GD. There were only the 2 of us, so, we were going to order 4 dishes. When we finished placing our orders, the waitress said, ""Minimum order 6 dishes!"" Well, we had no choice but ordered 2 more. 
Guess it must be a new policy, I don't really suggest anyone to go alone in this case, unless you have a big appetite. 
But at the end the dim sum were still good.",-1
5,The best overall dim sum we've had in Chinatown and we've tried a lot of them. The congee is excellent too.  This has become our default dim sum place on weekends. Service is authentic too - grumpy and surly.,1
1,Took forever to get our food and then there was a hair in it.  It then took another 15 minutes.  Service was horrible and the food wasn't great.  Not a place I would go back to or recommend.,-1
5,"A little Hong Kong right in the middle of London. Lovely authentic Cantonese food that is as good as the one in Hong Kong. 
Great experience!",1
3,"I come this Chinese restaurant for the 4th times in 13 years. 
The dim sum brunch  and dinner here are both all right, some dishes are nice but some are not. So I actually want to Mark it as 3.5 out of 5. A nice to try out but I am not amazed by their food.  
I always find it hard when my friend asks me for a authentic Chinese restaurant for them to try. It is not necessary the way they cook are different,  but it is just the fact that you can't get the same fresh meat and seafood in the UK compared to China.  Especially for Cantonese cuisine,  the freshness of the ingredients are the soul of the dishes. Similar to Italian cuisine,  if the ingredients are not fresh,  u can't copy the taste in Italy. 
But this Restaurant is surely perfect for family as they have lots of space!! So difficult to find another like this in China Town.  So easy for family with kids!",-1
1,"Terrible. We didn't get sick or walk out, so I'd give it 1.5 stars if I could. The food was dry (including the duck), the service was absolutely atrocious, and the ambiance was really bad. I'd eat at an airport take-away stand before this place-- I'm not exaggerating. And to be fair we weren't expecting a nice ambiance or great service, but the food was horrible. Did I mention the food was bad? Save yourself and try ANY OTHER place in Chinatown.",-1
1,"Absolute worst meal. Very slimy, chewy, bland food. Definitely discrimination towards us English, Five other Asian groups/couples were handled in much quicker, friendlier fashion. After waiting 40min for 3 plates the manager told me to sit back down and it was on the way. Very rude, tall and lanky manager. No wonder they charge a 12.5% gratuity without the option to tip. TRASH.",-1
2,"Roast duck was juicy tender but no crispiness to the skin.  Peking ribs tasty but so soaked in bbq sauce, you need to order white rice to balance it. Suggest you skip the vegetable spring rolls, tasteless. Chicken & vegetable stir fry dish was okay, fried rice was okay, crab and corn soup was okay.  We ordered tea, --the waiter poured out hot water, caught himself halfway through the pour and came back with actual tea a few minutes later.  Beware the food takes time coming out; the appetizers came out timely, the entree dishes took another 45 minutes & we were served finally only after we asked a waitress -- our original waiter had disappeared --  whatever happened to our order about 30 minutes in.  She checked the order computer then came back and assured us just another 10minutes.  It was another 15minutes, and I was a bit tired and grumpy at that point, but okay let's blame it on the disappeared waiter.  
btw London Chinatown itself was hustling and bustling and fun for people-watching on a Wednesday night.  Surrounded by live theatre venues, too.  Rainbow power and multiculturalism was very evident there, supercool.",-1
5,"We had roasted duck,  miced port with Aubergine pot cooked in hot pot, seasonal vegi, and monk Chinese mixed vegi. With soup of day. All are good, the soup and duck are super. Plus, the waiter and waitress are really nice. We love this place.",1
4,"Golden dragon does not have dim sum at dinner, which isn't a surprise, but that's kind of what I wanted. We had seafood chow mein with scallops. It was pretty good. I noticed that everyone else got orange slices with their bill, but I didn't. That made me a little sad. 
I'd like to come back and try the dim sum,.",1
4,We decided to try this restaurant after looking at the variety of different restaurants in China town. This seem to the busiest out of all the restaurant and it looked good judging from the menu. We went in and were seated immediately. We ordered the fixed menu since we weren't sure what to get and an order of dumplings. The service was a bit slow but the food was great. Everything tasted fresh and not too salty like some other Chinese restaurants make their food. I had an enjoyable experience there and would probably go back if I'm back in London.,1
4,Came here 2 times while in london.both times Ordered the aromatic crispy duck which was very crispy and yummy. Barbecue pork was alright.fried rice was very bland not recommended.stir fry flat noodle with beef was good.,1
5,"Always fantastic food
Salt and pepper squid to die for
Best with a large group so you can try a variety of dishes
Scallops now in season and well worth a treat
Hoping to go back again before we leave London",1
4,"I went here a couple weeks ago for Dim Sum with some friends, and I must say, I'm glad I did. This place finally quenched my dim sum craving that I have had since moving here. 
I particularly like the siu mai, duck tongue and chicken feet (my favorite), and the nai wong bao was quality. Their beef chow fun was also probably the most authentic I've had in London so far.
The funny thing with Chinese food is that everyone has different standards and tastes. I am from Portland, Oregon, USA, which is not necessarily renowned for Chinese restaurants, but actually has some great ones IF you know where to go. I consider myself a bit of a snob when it come to Chinese food, but this place was great.",1
4,"Good dim sum, kind of pricey. Very quick service though! No carts if you're looking for that kind of dim sum experience. Perfect for if you're looking for a good place to get your dim sum fix.",1
1,"Served rotten duck and they refused to swap it for a new plate or refund us. We even talked to a manager very politely and simply asked if they would swap the dish out and he said ""no"" and walked away. Too bad.",-1
2,"The quality would be 4 stars, but quantity of food and service brought my review down to 2 stars. We ordered 4 dishes off the menu, one of them pork belly (with extremely salty wasabi dipping sauce!?!! vulgar and destroyed taste buds) and another shrimp + scallions and were given tiny servings on tiny plates. Our party left with empty bellies and drained wallets with not much time left in our day since the service took a long time to get around to us.",-1
4,"Very yummy and tasty dim sum! A lot of the dishes remind me of my favourite dim sum place back at home.
Still not sure if it is the BEST...hard to say...I need to keep exploring!  But I liked the chicken feet, ha gar, xiaolongbao and veggie potstickers!
Would suggest this place to friends and for people who enjoy a good dim sum.",1
5,"In search of the ever elusive ""best dim sum in London"" we visited Golden Dragon and left with bellies and hearts full.  They don't have CART SERVICE which I would normally consider a sine qua non of good dim sum, but this place proved that you don't need carts to have great food.  Love it.  Too many places to come back to this one immediately but I'm very comfortable recommending it to fellow dim-sum lovers.",1
4,"I've only come here for dim sum, but I've come here A LOT for dim sum. It is my default recommendation for anyone looking for dim sum because the quality is consistent and well above average, plus the location is central. I know Chinatown restaurants seem to get a bad rep, but I go by my taste buds.
The dim sum menu is really friendly, with pictures so you can point if you're a newbie. The service is ""Chinatown standard"", brusque and efficient, sometimes a bit hard to get someone's attention, but only a little rude. They only have one kind of tea, unfortunately.
Must-gets: baked pork puff, taro croquettes, prawn and chive dumplings, egg tarts for dessert. Their specialty is sesame balls, which are sweet, and I haven't quite figured out when to order them because they take some time to prepare (unless they're sold out). The time is variable: 15 minutes to an hour(!). Sometimes I order them with everything else, and then they come before we're ready. Sometimes I order as we're finishing, but then the wait is too long. It's a mystery. But totally worth it.
Fine: cheung fun, steamed pork bun, beancurd prawn rolls, Chinese greens (hard to mess up). I once tried the crispy seafood noodles, which were a little disappointing.
They don't take reservations for Sunday dim sum, so just show up at noon. By the time we leave, there's always a queue out the door. Last time was just under £13pp with 7 people, including tea and service charge.",1
4,"Service quite slow but spring rolls, prawn dumplings and salt and pepper squid  are to die for. Unfortunately, they only serve dim sum at a certain time ) :",1
3,"After a full day of Stonehenge/Roman Baths sightseeing, we decided our best bet for anything that's open at 11pm would be in Chinatown. We wanted something relatively affordable and served quick to feed 7 hungry people.
It didn't take us long to decide what to order and in 15 minutes, piping hot dishes of minced pork with aubergrine, mushroom and chinese broccoli, chicken fried rice, beef teriyaki, chicken with scallion and ginger graced the table. It was like a war of chopticks and forks when everybody dived into their food. The roast duck with steamed buns took longer to arrive and by then, we'd already placed an extra order of fried rice, because, Asians LOVE their rice! the boys each had a bottle of Tiger beer to round out the greasiness of our food. I stuck with good old black tea.
Decor is typical Chinese resto with wooden accents and year round Christmas tree lights. The tablecloths were tattered looking but the plates are clean. Service was so-so and we had to flag our waiter down for our bill which was 100 quid with tips. Overall, an ok choice in Chinatown but we should've just gone to the $6.99 AYCE buffet across the street.",-1
4,"Very good dianxin and chaomian. The mixed vegetable chaomian especially is quite wonderful and full of flavour. This is a Cantonese place through and through and the designs all across the room make that clear.
Expect to pay a lot for dim sum, though. My fiancee and I ordered a mediocre amount and got charged £30 for the privilege.",1
1,"We found this place in Chinatown. The food was okay. It wasn't bad but not a standout. The shrimp chow mein had all of 7 shrimps in it. A bit chintzy. They charged us about 3.5 British pounds- that's over 4 US dollars-for a small bowl of white rice!  The worst part of our experience was that we had 2 grand-babies with us. While the 3 y.o. quietly ate her small bowl of plain white rice, the 2 y.o. was getting restless so we let him play with the small salt shaker where he put salt into a bowl, so he doesn't throw a tantrum or food around. The short man, whom I found out was the owner, marched over to our table in anger and scolded us for wasting his salt. He looked visibly angry. We spent 37 BPs ($48) for the light lunch, so I am sure we more than paid for the 5 cents worth of salt my grand-baby wasted.  As we were leaving, he lectured us about controlling the children. What a piece of work. He was plain mean and stingy.",-1
5,"'The Golden Dragon' is all you would expect from a premium restaurant in China Town...
The food is incredible and the servers are very friendly...yes there's more 'Cooler' places to go but sometimes it's nice to go somewhere that's a little more refined...
If you want all you can eat buffets or pokey smokey restaurants this isn't the place but if you want that quintessential Chinese restaurant feel from the movies from Hong Kong this is the place...",1
1,"Damn, this was so expensive for food that absolutely nothing exceptional and served as small quantities!
Plus, the waiters are not welcoming at all.
In short: don't waste your time and money in this place.",-1
3,"Came looking for authentic bbq sliced pork on steamed rice.  Simple but pure heaven when done correctly.  Ordered the Sesame Toast (2 Stars) Pan Fried Dumplings (3 Stars) and Deep Fried Stuffed Crab ( 3 stars) appetizers.  Had one glass of red house wine for 9 pounds (1 start, only cause it was at least wet).  Then, received the aforementioned pork dish. Over one pound of perfectly prepared pork.  Great balance of sauce and sear, succulent pieces all.  This was 5 stars all day and worth the vinegar, err, ""wine"" I was forced to pair with it.  Now they had other wine choices, but I wasn't about to tempt fate for 25-30 pounds per glass.  If i ouwld have skipped the toast and had a better glass of wine, this was 4-4.5 stars all day. Wait time was 15 minutes.  Atmosphere was...well,  a classic London Chinese place I suppose!
Would certainly come back for the pork!",-1
5,Excellent food and lovely service. I had the famous roast Peking duck and it was glorious! It's so crispy and the sauce is just mouth watering. I also had the honey glazed pork which is also well cooked and tasty.,1
5,"Great chinese food at a fair price. 
You have to try the fillet steak, melts in your mouth.
Singapore noodles are great if you want a kick.
My family raves about the duck -- its the number 1 reason they go.
Vegetable spring rolls are nice and light (tip: try them with mustard!)",1
2,"I'm sitting in the restaurant right now and I'm lowkey ticked off. We got seated almost right away and the food is typical Chinese food--maybe a notch higher than Panda Express--which is probably the only thing decent about this place, because the service is terrible. It took like half an hour for two dishes of our order to come out--and the place is crowded, so you'd think they'd try to clear the place out--and we had to wait maybe fifteen to twenty minutes more for our last dish, which was chow mein. Furthermore, in order to get our last plate to come out, we tried to flag a waiter down several times, only to be either ignored or unseen. One of the members of my party had to get up and talk to one of them in order to get them to bring the last dish out. Our water glasses were unfilled, nobody came over to ask if everything was okay, and the portions were fairly small. I might just be going on a rampage right now, but this restaurant was average at best. If I ever come back to London, I'm not coming back here.",-1
2,Tried this place when I was in London for work. The service was horrible and the food pretty average which makes a pretty bad combination.,-1
2,"Fairly underwhelmed by this place. Our Chinese friends brought us here as their regular joint so I guess I expected a decent meal :s 
This was probably more the case as I've been to some great places recently...
Anyways, being veggie, there wasn't a great choice, but seeing mock chicken on the menu made me happy. We ordered that alongside some forgettable veggie and rice/noodle dishes. Everything except the jasmine tea and chilli sauce made me feel let down. Sorry folks, it was all bland and unappetising. Please do better?",-1
3,"Good food but service is rather rude at times. Often felt hurried to finish a course and our waitress was especially annoying initially, particularly with the constant buzzing around our table with an abrupt manner!
That said, the food is good and generally we had  a good time. The portion size was very good...for.five of us we left with a healthy doggy  bag!
Watch out for the sneaky 12.5% service charge! Simply challenge them about this...due to the service we left a smaller tip- the waitress did eventually find a personality!",-1
4,"A few of us came in for dinner after a couple drinks so very hungry and excited to eat. We started out with hot and sour soup, which was indeed hot and spicy - so be careful if you're weak of heart!  We then got the prawns, Kung pao chicken, soft tofu with meat sauce and rice. Super filling and actually quite tasty though it was oily. 
Minus one point for confusing service but I would come back to try some other spots.",1
3,"Despite of three stars, I do like this place and it's definitely not once that I've been there. Normally, when I have cravings for Chinese I find myself there.
I like the large hall on the ground floor.
Definitely don't expect anything spectacular but food is nice, nothing special, but Chinese food well made.
I would recommend the squid in black bean sauce and recommend against pork belly. The latter was stiff and not juicy at all. Whereas squid was tender and not at least rubbery.
Shame they don't have any side salads, but you can order broccoli with garlic sauce which is nice too.
The place is good for groups - they have large tables that can accommodate up to 8 people at a time.
Service is good: they would explain the difference between the sauces & dishes and drop an occasional joke.",-1
4,"This is one of my go to spots in London.
The food is always great here and there is always a crowd.  Even late night is packed. So, the service can get a little slow.  Just be patient.  The servers are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have about the menu.
My favorites:  hot and sour soup, spring rolls, kung pao style chicken, vegetable fried rice, bbq spare ribs. 
Enjoy!",1
4,"Solid food, not the best but good. Service is excellent. I highly recommend the honey barbecue pork and duck it's among the best I've ever had.",1
2,"Ok Chinese food at an ok price. Shredded chicken starter and crab & sweetcorn soup were yummee.
Just ok.",-1
4,"Decided to check out this restaurant after passing through Chinatown as it seemed to be the most crowded at around 2. We were seated immediately but it took quite some time for the waiter to take our order. We decided to order from the set lunch menu and sea urchin and pork dumplings. After about a 30 minute wait for our food, it finally came out. Being from New York, I'm always a little hesitant to try Chinese food in other cities but all in all it was very good. Sweet and sour pork was very tasty along with our beef with peppers. Only complaint would be the service at the establishment. Once our food arrived, we never saw our waiter again.  No one to ask if we would like any more water or additional drinks. I would have been more upset but the food made up for this. Would definitely come back here again when passing through.",1
3,I love their Beef wrapped in noodle. Good place to have dim sum.,-1
5,"From the street level it's difficult to appreciate how different Golden Dragon (GD) is different from the rest.  Just going by their conventional menu GD appears to be no more touristy than the next.
Having visited for dim sum several times before booking Chinese New Year dinner, both of GD's on- and off-menus are, in terms of breadth and regional focus (soups, seafood and veggie dishes of the Cantonese persuasion), very much congruent to what one would find in major U.S. cities with a size-able Chinese population and, arguably, Hong Kong itself.  
Most tourists and locals would for the most part opt for the BBQ items dangling from the shop window, but it's clear just looking about the dining floor that Chinese customers are calling up steamed sea bass, lobster on egg noodles and single-serving specialty soups.
Like anything else in the city, eating out in London can be quite expensive and Chinatown is no exception.  When it comes to dining happiness is key, and to some degree so is value.  GD isn't the only game in town but certainly places in my Chinatown top 3.",1
1,"There  was no choice of 0 stars , so had to give them 1 . Worse service in London with sub standard food . Avoid this trap at all cost.  I spoke to Managment about there service and they did not care.",-1
4,"Pricey but well worth it. We had the mabo-dofu, stir-fried vegetable, cha-siu pork, and stir-fried rice.  All were delightful, especially the cha-siu pork on crispy noodles. 
The mabo-dofu (szechuan style tofu) could have been spicier with more szechuan peppercorns (my tongue was tingling but not stunned into submission as with some other places).
Unfortunately no dim-sum for dinner (we wanted to get sho-ron-po) but otherwise a great dinner at the usual inflated London prices. As long as you can swallow that you'll spend $75 for two people, you'll be pleasantly pleased.",1
4,"After being told we couldn't get a table at all at honest burger and waiting for 30min at Byron it was quite nice to walk into the first place in China Town and get a table straight away. The food was delicious and the prices reasonable, even including the 12% service (20£ each for more than enough food + a pint of lager). However the service feels a bit rushed. Guess that's the reason we got out table so quickly though. Makes sense and hits the spot.",1
3,"I haven't had dimsum in about half a year (bad Chinese girl) and was really looking forward to this. 
The dim sum was good...not great, but really quite good. 
I was shocked by how exp dimsum in London was tho...much cheaper in SF and even Toronto.
Glad i tried it...but if you're visiting London, i'd skip dimsum if you can get it where you're from. 
Otherwise, Golden Dragon is a pretty good place...and clean. Definitely a place white people can venture into w/o feeling too sketched out (admit it, you know how i mean)",-1
1,"Worst service ever! The server took us directly to a table of two without saying anything. I asked him if we could change to one of the other bigger open tables nearby since we have another friend coming in a bit. He was apparently offended and yelled at us ""why did you come inside if your friend is not here?! Go out and wait till everyone is here."" That was so rude and we were just shocked. We left and we will never come back again. Worst experience in London.",-1
2,"For food I would give this place a four, but for service and price a 1.
I have been to London several times and have seen all the major tourist stuff and one of the tour books had a suggest day walking trip in the west end/SOHO area and seeing I love SOHO and was staying in the west end decided to do that on Thursday.
I went to several businesses recommended on the tour and they were all great.   It recommended Golden Dragon for lunch and that was an awful recommendation.
The server was the rudest I have ever had at any place in London.   I ordered the number on the menu and she got nasty and said she didn't know the numbers and I had to tell her the item on the menu.   I had bought a pair of shoes in one of the shops that morning and had the bag sitting beside me out of the way and another server walked by and gave me a nasty look and picked the bag up and threw it on the empty chair next to me without even asking.
When I ordered I asked for a diet coke and she asked if I was sure I didn't want tea and I said no diet coke and I could tell she was offended.   If you don't want your customers drinking diet coke and only tea, then don't offer diet coke on the menu.
The chicken dish was good and it was grilled sliced chicken instead of the deep fried stuff you get in the US.   I cant eat rice with chopsticks and when I asked for a fork was told they didn't have forks and I was in a Chinese restaurant and to use chop sticks.
By the time I got my lunch my diet coke bottle was empty and I asked for a glass of tap water.  I get the bill and not only was there a 12.5% service charge when I had awful service, there was also a charge for a glass of regular tap water.",-1
4,"Above average Chinatown restaurant.
Quite large and bustling.
Evening meal for four including crispy duck + pancakes (good), 2 hotpot dishes (one good, one OK), pork + choi sum (good), spicy prawns (OK).
Straightforward service.
Nicely full and satisfied afterwards",1
1,The restaurant's employees are very rude! They require a minimum order witch is unacceptable!!! I do not recommend this restaurant!,-1
3,"Foods are tasty, reasonable price. this restaurant is more spacious than other restaurants in China town, so you won't feel like you are over hearing conversation of other table.",-1
2,"I've long given up on Chinatown as most of the restaurants seem to have become mere tourist traps. But happy to make an exceptions when friends are in town, especially when aromatic crispy duck is included in the deal ...
Gold Dragon was busy with a good mix of people, ie not just tourists but also large groups of Chinese families, and staff were extremely friendly and efficient.
But it is the quality of the food that makes a great restaurant, after all. Perhaps we would have enjoyed everything more had it been a bit hotter. The pancakes served with the duck weren't even luke warm but cold with the main courses arriving on plastic plates - what happened to the old-fashioned tradition of hot plates?
I am also not a big fan of MSG and all dishes were heavily reliant on this additive. Some of the sauces actually tasted as if they came straight from a bottle - all very underwhelming.
Never again.",-1
3,"The dim sum here was quite tasty on the absolute scale of dim sum tastiness, but I'm finding that London dim sum is quite good in general, so I can hardly recommend this place over others on that basis alone.
The service was appallingly slow (at like 3pm on a Sunday so it's not like they were that busy) and they lost track of what we ordered and what we had received. They don't keep the checklist at your table like other places do. We were served ice water that was absolutely funky, tasted like watered down rice wine. It probably wasn't alcohol, but maybe some result of a dirty glass?",-1
2,"On previous trips to London, I've walked past Golden Dragon, thinking it looked too touristy.  But I read some good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try.
I walked up next to the cash register, waiting to be seated.  Many employees were rushing by all around me, apparently busy.  Finally one noticed me and seated me.
The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (hoe yau gie lon) and the rice arrived at the same time.  They were both tepid.  With electric rice cookers nowadays, which can keep cooked rice fresh and hot for 24 hours, how is it possible to serve tepid rice?
The tofu and seafood hot pot (dung gong dau fu boe) did arrive hot and steamy.  It had generous pieces of tofu, some pieces of squid and shrimp, some mushroom caps, and very tender but not overcooked baby bok choy -- all in a broth.  This is a standard Cantonese menu item.  Here, however, the tofu had been stuffed with shrimp and deep fried before being put into the broth.  I wondered, why go through the bother of deep frying something and then putting it into a broth?  And why stuff the tofu with shrimp when this dish already has shrimp in it?  Then the thought crossed my mind that the deep fried shrimp-stuffed tofu could be an ""overstock"" dim sum item.  This dish (dung gong dau fu boe) is typically made with regular, plain tofu.
The service was not friendly, but it was efficient.  It was easy for me to flag down a server and ask for some hot sauce.  (In some Chinese restaurants, this is impossible.)
My beverage was Chinese tea.  The bill came to £24.40.  It was not itemized.  I added a 10% tip.  However, I was just re-reading some of the of reviews for this restaurant and they mention that the gratuity was included in the bill.  My bill had nothing broken out.",-1
5,"Excellent dim sum selection, and great service. I'd go again in a second.",1
4,"Yummity yumm! Me love dim sum, me love traditional chinese dim sum even more!
Love their scallop and prawn cheung funs, an order of each is always a must, pork hot buns why yes, followed up by some prawn dumplings oh my!  I never get their main entrees and just stuff my face full of dim sum so can't comment on that (although my father had a beef entree there which was huge and that he enjoyed).  
Downside of this place, like most of the restos in chinatown is that it looks a bit run-down, easily forgettable decor for sure, and the staff is not the most attentive or gentile buuuut, I don't think I've ever been to a Chinese restaurant where the staff cracks a smile so I'm going to assume it's a cultural thing and just shove another dim sum in my belly.  Cause at the end of a dim sum day, that's all I really care about, quality dim sum that isn't ridiculously priced and you'll find it here!",1
4,"Having visited this place 2 days running, I thought it would be rude not to write about it. The Golden Dragon is a special favourite of mine, simply because it's never let me down. 
Whilst the menu is full of all the standard tasty stuff, it's the Dim Sum that I dribble over. There's none of your Ping Pong pretension here -  presentation is average, but the dishes are reasonably priced, generous and taste divine. I absolutely love the Prawn Cheung Fun and the Char Siu. 
The place is big, sprawling and I often wonder whether they have a hierarchy system in placing people upstairs or downstairs. I'm still trying to work that one out as it all seems rather random. Service is typically unfriendly but fast and efficient. 
I've spent hours here over lunch, catching up with friends and slowly becoming more whale-like. It's definitely easy to keep eating. At least it keeps gym memberships alive!",1
2,"At most, just your average dim sum based on the Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) and Siu Mai and the Siu Long Bao that I got. Maybe because of the rave on YELP and also an auntie we met on the road that said this place is quite well known for its Dim Sum in the area, so I thought it was going to be good but turned out to be sub par. Pretty average dim sum in my opinion. Nothing really stood out. Not elegant, no unique taste.
Taste Breakown
Har Gow: it was ok. just your typical taste, typical size
Siu Mai: there was a piece of shrimp on the top. feels a bit like the taste of har gow more than the typical siu mai which is more of a pork taste.
Siu Long Bao: no juice inside. did not even make my mouth water (not hard to do when I'm hungry).
I thought the price was ok since I have had more expensive ones and also cheaper ones but maybe in London, this is cheap. I saw another table ordering actual dishes and those look quite good so maybe their other food might be better but based on my own experience on the Dim Sum... it was sub par and therefore the 2 stars.",-1
5,"Went here for dinner with friends while on vacation in London.
The star of the show...or rather what made this place get 5 stars:
Duck with Black Bean and Chili Sauce
Really...that is what makes this place 5 stars! Best duck I've ever had and so much of it too.",1
4,"This is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Soho.
 The food is divine (i've never felt OD'd on MSG as one person mentioned). If there's something you want that isn't on the menu they will do their best to accomodate you.
 Some of the female waiting staff aren't the friendliest in the world and if you want a relaxing, sedate meal then this definitely isn't the place for you.
 Little tip, order the steaming bowl of fruit for desert lol",1
3,"I went to this place for some traditional Dim Sum.
I wanted a push out tray and waiters/waitresses pushing you to eat the dim sum served. I didnt quite get that, you ordered on the menu and they brought out the dim sum.
I was not really impressed with what was served. The portion sizes were small. The taste was good but not great. I have had better dim sum that was more authintic than what was being served here.
i would recommend this place but I think that there are better places out there where you can get cheaper and tastier dim sum",-1
5,"I  went there all the time between 2005-2009, before I came to the US.
Good interior, good atmosphere with good music, good waiters with good manners.
Their Ha Gaw, Shiu Mai and Siao Long Bao were really really good! They serve good teas. I love their Pork Congee with those black colored eggs in it and some of their deep-fried dishes were super good too. I went back there to find the old time feels when I stopped by London in 2010 and they were still as good as I expected. 
Good job, Golden Dragon! Cheers!",1
4,"Bollocks! A Yank beat me to it! Haha... Well, I agree with his assessment of Golden Dragon. This is a top notch establishment frequented by many ethnic Chinese. That is generally a good sign of a restaurant's authenticity. If you wander out into the West Midlands or worse, Essex... You'll be hard pressed to find a Chinese restaurant of this calibre.
The red barbecue pork buns (Cha Siu Bao) are fluffy and flavourful. Do NOT give into the temptation to dip those perfect white buns into the soy! It ruins the balance of the flavour and the pork is already a bit salty. I also enjoyed the chicken feet. As strange as they may look, they're delicious. They're steamed in some soy sauce vinegar broth, reminiscent of Filipino Adobo. Bloody Hell, I could mong out on those feet for ages; and the best part: you can pick your teeth with the little claws.
Now, for the bad part. For traditional Hong Kong dim sum, this place is rather spendy. You can easily shell out 35 quid a person, especially if you accompany your meal with a Tsingtao lager. A similar feast in the States would cost you just about half, but don't think about that. You're an ocean away from New York, and in Jolly England, this is as good as it gets. Eat, drink and be merry!",1
4,"In the chaos of China town restaurants this one is always a good staple. It is quite large and there is a lot of coming and going. Guests are asked to leave their name and number of guests and are then called out. I have never waited longer than 15 min.
 They have an excellent dim sum during the day but not in the evening. The quality of the food is excellent and decent value for money. If you do not like the hustle and bustle downstairs ask to be seated upstairs.
 A word of advise: This is an extremely busy restaurant so sometimes it can be a challenge to get the attention of the waiters. Some of them can be quite rude. The breakdown of the bill is written in Mandarin, so try to keep track of what you ordered. Service charge is included in the bill, do not let them charge you twice.
 Verdict: Good quality food for decent prices in a very touristic area. Good for large groups, but don't expect a zen moment in this busy place.",1
4,"It was really busy and we had to wait for about 10 minutes for a table, but the service was very fast and swift. They had a wide variety of dim sum dishes which were all delicious, although the spicy duck tongue was not as spicy as I had hoped, perhaps the flavour was lowered for other tastes. Apart from that everything tasted fresh and the flavours were well balanced.",1
1,"Servers seemed inconvenienced by us.  My food was ok, but other plates served at my table weren't so good.  Bathroom was disgusting.  I wouldn't go back since there are lots of other options on the same street.",-1
5,"Yum yum dim sum.. HK, LA, GZ, Richmond (Vancouver, not  Virginia).. and London??  
London, the united freaking kingdom that is no longer a kingdom.  Home of sausage & mash, fish & chips,  also has good dim sum?   Crazy right?  But I had some of the best char siu cheung HERE!  The place is packed, and I ate with a bunch of younger folks, so we got the customary stuff.. like duck tongue, chicken feet, and taro.  The crazy stuff like har gow , siu mai, etc. is also available for the crazy folks.   All fresh and made to order...   
As good as LA?  Check
As good as Richmond? Check... 
As good as HK?  Check.. 
As good as GZ?  ..  ..  no.. GZ is good and super cheap.. this is just super good.",1
4,"Following the recommendation of a shopkeeping at a Chinese takeout place around my flat, I went to Golden Dragon for dim sum. Quality of the dim sum is definitely up to par with places in Hong Kong and Toronto. Prices are high but not any more than other dim sum venues in London. I recommend this place.",1
5,"Fantastic choice for a late night Chinese dinner. The seafood is fresh, delicious and served up in copious quantities. If you like it spicy, just ask.",1
4,"Golden Dragon is always a reliable place to go to for some great dim sum, or for some decent Chinese food. They have two large floors that are constantly busy with people, so much so that it's sometimes hard to get a waiter's or waitress' attention. There are so many tables on the floor that they can quickly accommodate especially large groups, something many other Chinese restaurants in the area struggle to do.
 All of the dim sum dishes are always consistently good, and if anything I highly recommend people try the black sesame dumplings for dessert. It's a little bit of an acquired taste, but when you bite into those warm, white dumplings to intercept the tasty black liquid that fills it, there's just nothing like it.
 One word of warning is that sometimes they ask if you want to put extra service on your card, when it's already been included in the bill. Sometimes it pays to double check the items you order as you end up having to decipher Chinese characters to validate your bill.",1
5,"If one afternoon you're in Chinatown on the prowl for some delectable Dim Sum, you'll be hard-pressed to trump the Golden Dragon. Dishes are moderately priced and you certainly won't be doing your taste buds a disservice. Must-tries include the prawn rice noodle rolls, lotus leaf-wrapped glutinous rice and their mini egg-custards (a sweet alternative to the British nutmeg-laced treats). Be aware however that the staff have a tendency to impose a minimum dish order not levied against linguistically able compatriots. Still, the main menu has much to offer also, and will appear much less daunting if accompanied by an aficionado of Cantonese cuisine. As with most high quality Chinese restaurants, sharing is the key to a rounded meal, particularly given the generous portions afforded for main dishes here.
 The ambiance encapsulates the fervent collective, both large dining areas ornate and joyous in their decoration, typical of the nation's favoured depiction of prosperity. The service is efficient without being overly boisterous, but do note that as much as they would like you to believe otherwise, the bill summary does include a standard service charge (you can always check the total against the detailed list, albeit written in Chinese).
 The highest accolade I can bestow upon this restaurant is the simple fact that the three generations of my girlfriend's family (originally from Hong Kong, and including a retired chef), have selected this as their Central London point of convergence. Evidence enough to give the place a chance? Well you know my answer to that",1
3,"Chinatown staple with all the usual dishes but it's open until late which is always handy.
 It's a bit quieter upstairs, so ask to be seated up there and you can fit bigger groups.
 Always good to wash it all down with some Tiger beer.",-1
4,"Excellent place to venture if you're in need of a dim sum hit. The swanky interior is nice if not a bit snobbish, but the food is lovely.
 Had some great sui mai here, as well as some of the others things the menu has to offer. Recommend the deep fried squid - very tasty!
 It's often hard to choose where to come when you're surrounded by so many in Chinatown, but this one always seems to shine.",1
2,over priced and food was just so so. i went for dinner and their food had a very westernized taste to it. would not recommend for people looking for legit chinese food.,-1
4,"This is one of the best places in china town. I especially like the roast duck, which is one of the best in London. It is a nice place aswell with plenty of space. The staff are more polite and attentive than in some of the other china-town restaurants.",1
5,"I'm very picky about my Cantonese food and this place is just awesome!
We celebrated my dad's 60th here with one of their set banquet menus (I believe it included dishes from every meat category and then some!).  We were rolling out of there, and ooo'ing and ahhh'ing about the quality of the food and incredible presentation.
The staff were fabulous and treated us really well even though this is the first time we had a meal there.
Ended up having over 12 dishes for 9 people and every single one of them was great.  
Apparently queues for their dim sum start at 11, never tried it but I will the next trip.",1
5,"If your after consistently good Chinese food or dim sum and you happen to be in Chinatown, you can't go wrong with Golden Dragon. The place can get extremely busy so try to book or come extra early if your after Dim Sum. I have been coming to this place for years, since childhood in fact and I have to say I have never been disappointed. Prices are very fair for the food you get and the staff are very good compared to some places in Chinatwon. My only tiny niggle would be the roast meats, (such as roast pork) they seem to lack tenderness and moisture that I look for. Though this might just be a personal preference.",1
4,"In China Town gibt es sehr viele Chinarestaurants, das verwundert kaum. Doch welches ist gut? Im ""Golden Dragon"" habe ich sehr lecker gegessen. Dass fast nur chinesische Gäste dort waren, werte ich auch mal als Qualitätssymbol!",1
5,"Dishoom is an absolute must when in London. If you have never tried Indian food before this is the spot to try it out for the first time. My husband and I had an absolute feast. The food isn't cheap, but it is worth every penny!!! From the vegetables to the chicken tikka, you cannot go wrong. The garlic naan is to die for and so are the side sauces. I didn't really care for the dessert here, but that's no biggie. Just go somewhere else for dessert and stick to the food.
As far as the vibe goes, it feels like you've been taken back in time. The music and decor are aesthetically pleasing and the music just seals the deal. 
Enjoy every minute here...I don't live in London and this is on my to-do whenever we visit.",1
4,"In what appears to be lots of options for this place wherever you are in London, the carnaby location was closest for us.  
Orders of garlic, cheese and plain naan were a must.  We had to get some samosas which ended up being the vegetable variety was my preference.  Biryani's were good, the chicken berry was good, though I'd want to try the jackfruit next time.
The salli boti stood out in the menu as well as the taste in my mouth.",1
5,"Extremely impressed, definitely lives up to the hype. Arrived on a Thursday evening, was told there would be an hour and fifteen minute wait, but actually only had to wait around 20 minutes. I will say that their process seems overly complicated, we first had to give our name to a man across the alley with a tablet, and five minutes later he gave us the go ahead to see the hostess inside for a pager.
The okra fries were phenomenal. Great seasoning and came out hot and fresh. The grilled corn was also fantastic, amazing flavor profile with the smokiness from the charcoal with the chili and lime. The chicken tikka was moister than other chicken tikka I've had, it seems like they use fattier pieces. It was good. The chicken ruby aka butter chicken seems to be a favorite but I'm not a huge fan of butter chicken, so I found this dish to be fine but nothing special. Overall, it was a fantastic meal, I would go back for the okra and corn alone.",1
5,"I don't normally go out of my way for Indian food, but when in London, you've got to try this place. Best Indian food EVER!
We sat outside along the walkway which was perfect for people watching. I think the passersby in general were curious as to what Indian food is all about. People would literally stop and stare to see what was on our table.
Service was outstanding with our waitress making thoughtful suggestions. The Bombay Pimm drink - mint, citrus, pomegranate, and coriander served with ginger beer instead of lemonade - was refreshing in the warm weather.
The one dish you have to get? Salli boti. It's braised lamb in a rich and flavorful gravy served with buttered roti bread. I ordered a half plate and ended up ordering a second because it was that good. If you're on the fence about lamb or have never tried it, then order it here and make this your first. Order the garlic naan as well. The bread was terrific by itself but even better with the lamb.
We tried many dishes and they were all delicious. The favs were the prawns - Masala if you like it grilled or Koliwada if you want a little more tamarind flavor with date chutney. The chicken tikka was good too. Although the biryani was wonderfully aromatic, I'd pass on this and carb up with the naan. There's just so much else to try.
The food is amazing. Be sure to make reservations. There's little to no chance that you're going to walk in and sit down...especially if you're a party of four or more.",1
3,"This is more of a 3.5 star than a 3.  Came here during our long layover in the UK and the wait time here was 1.5 hrs!  
The food here although it was good we didn't think it was worth the wait.  Note that I am from NYC and we also have a lot of great Indian food selections but definitely wanted to try it in London because it is so well known. 
I didn't feel like any dish stood out but although overall it was filling the flavors wasn't what I consider out of this world.
Good place, nice setting but food was just good not fantastic",-1
5,"I love Indian food. I love it so so so much but I rarely eat it bc many around me don't care for it, including Chuck. While in London, I needed to find a delicious meal for, what was likely, my only chance to score some delicious naan, samosas and curry. I landed on Dishoom. We arrived around 630 and there was already an hour wait. Thankfully, we were not super starving so we headed to the bar for a round or two of cocktails. They were very well made and our waiting time flew by. Thankfully our buzzer buzzed and we were seated. We grabbed an order of lamb samosas to start, followed with a cheese naan, garlic naan, roasted potatoes and an order of chicken curry. Now. We wait. 
The samosas arrived in three crispy little pockets of philo, expertly seasoned. They paired very well with the small sauces placed on the table before service. The naan was the perfect dipper for our curry which was nicely spicy while not being overwhelming. The small potato chunks were covered in dry seasoning and tasty. This meal (sans drinks) only cost about £40 which was nice for all the plates we got. It was so good that I was able to get Chuck to go to the other location one more time before leaving.",1
5,"As an American tourist in London, I loved this restaurant, and appreciated such yummy food at this price point. The staff was great about explaining house specialties and the appropriate number of dishes to order (apparently 2-3 small things per person).  Our favorite dishes were the lamb samosas, raita (a yogurt and basil-type dip), and the house special.  Important to note is that this house special dish varies between Dishoom locations, and the one of Kingly Street was excellent!  We found the black daal to be underwhelming (given how popular it seems to be) in comparison to the house specialty. No reservations needed for lunch on a weekday, but be prepared to wait ~1 hour for dinner. They may bring you spiced chai to sip on while you wait in line!",1
4,"Large location - with a small outdoor seating area on a relatively quiet street. Some ongoing construction in the distance though right now so avoid sitting outside if that type of noise bothers you. The seating indoors is fun and the decor together with the incense/music whisks you away to another era. The kitchen downstairs is fun too - you walk past the energy (open kitchen) on the way to the WC. 
The food as always is solid. This time I just did a small order - house Dahl (so much flavor) and garlic naan. Highly recommend both items. Wish I were here early enough for breakfast - the bacon and egg naan eludes me yet again...",1
4,"Be prepared to stand in a queue and build your appetite while waiting for your table!
Dishoom is the go-to spot my friend brings visitors to when in London. He suggested we arrive about 30-45 minutes in advance, knowing there would be a long queue. We got there at about 6pm and waited 50 minutes outside just to get the pager! Luckily, the weather was unusually warm and we were offered sweet wine and tea. Once inside, we waited about another 50 minutes at the bar. It was very crowded, but we were fine sipping on our Gimlets. We were seated by a fireplace with sofa seating, which was cute. Our friend did the ordering, but everything was delicious. Looking back at the menu, we had the okra fries, chicken ruby, chicken tikka, black daal, jackfruit biryani, roti, and cheese and garlic naan. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed. I enjoyed the ambience at Dishoom and the surrounding area in Carnaby was also a joy to walk through.",1
4,"This is my first time visiting London. I got recommendations about this place from 4 different sources, so definitely had to try. I have heard they always have 2 hours wait, so please make reservations.
We were lucky to get a table with 10 mins without reservations.
Ambience is nice & classy & it is pretty spacious.
Food: we ordered vada pav, pav bhaji, okra chips, romali paneer wrap & chili cheese toast. 
Romali Paneer Wrap was the BEST tasting wrap I have ever had. In love with it. It actually takes you back to Mumbai.
Pav bhaji, okra chips & chili cheese toast were also super tasty. But vada pav I felt the crust was a tad bit thick. But flavor wise I feel they have nailed the taste. 
All the dishes we ordered were Amazing... A must go indian restaurant in London.",1
3,"ASTHMA WARNING: If you have asthma, they have so much incense going that you may not be able to breathe inside, so plan to sit outside. Otherwise the service was great and the food good. Not the best, but still tasty in a cool area. We went with the waiters recommendations and were happy with everything.",-1
4,"I was looking for good Indian food while in London and stumbled upon Dishoom through yelp. I tried to go to the location near convent garden but the wait was 50 mins! So I decided to try this location and was lucky to be seated right away!! 
I got the chickpea salad and the pau bhaji for an appetizer. Let me tell you the pau bhaji was AMAZING! It was so tasty and the flavors were so diverse. I could eat 2 more servings. The chickpea salad on the other hand was not my favorite. I wouldn't order again but I'm giving it a 4 because of the pau bhaji. Would come back to try another dish.",1
4,"We tried our luck with walk-ins late on a weeknight and waited about 45 minutes. 
Keena pau - ground lamb. Decent appetizer, comes with a side of bread. 
Chicken Tikka kebab - a bit too salty. Wouldn't recommend it. 
Lamb boti kebab - flavorful, amazing dish and my favorite. 
Black caal - lentil based. Goes well with the grilled meats and roti.
Chicken Ruby - tastes similar to Tikka masala but a bit spicier and not as buttery. 
Roomali roti - like that it's not too flaky. 
Garlic naan - decent. not very fluffy.
Service was okay. Water refill could be much faster. It was a bit too chilly at night to keep the windows open so the food cooled down quicker than I would have liked.",1
5,"Easily some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Got recommended this place by a friend and absolutely had to go out of my way to try it and I would recommend it to anyone.
We ordered the Okra Fries, Paneer Tikka, House Dahl, Garlic Naan, Basmati Rice and Mango Lassis for drinks. The okra fries are literally to DIE FOR. They are crispy, spicy and light and somewhat healthy because it's okra. Way better than any french fry or onion ring I've ever had and definitely use the dipping sauces (the orange one is the best). The paneer tikka could've used more flavor, but they were well made and tasted great with the dipping sauces. There was not much special about the naan or rice, but the House Dahl was awesome. Not a huge fan of dahl in North Indian cuisine, but this one had a hint of spice and a really deep taste and went great with both the naan and rice. The lassi was slightly the only disappointment as it was not creamy and was too sour.
Debated between 4 and 5 stars for this place, but I was extremely impressed by the service. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and half the food had already come out. The waiters are all nice and the vibe of the place is awesome! Will definitely be coming back next time in London.",1
4,"Make sure to come here early or make a reservation, or expect to wait! There is a bar area available during your wait but you can't wander around as the pager is based on wifi. 
This location is right near a ton of shopping options and also has outdoor seating. It was about a 30 minute wait at 4pm for two people. We were seated outside where the waiter asked us for our drinks. Their house chai is delicious (and also bottomless). We also ordered, chicken ruby, naan, chicken tikka and lamb kebabs. 
After that, the service was horrible. Super super slow. Food took forever to come out and they forgot about the chicken ruby so we waited an extra 30 mins after we had finished eating the rest of the food. Waiters were hard to track down outside. However, a waitress did give us fresh complimentary naan as ours got cold in the meantime, which was greatly appreciated. 
Food-wise, everything is delicious!! And they do not hold back on the spice! Super flavorful, tender chicken and one of the best indian foods I've had!! 
I would definitely come back again and I hope I just caught service on a bad day. Because of that, I knocked the review down 1.5 stars.",1
5,"Indian food is a MUST in London and Dishoom showed up everywhere while I was researching for my recent trip.  I believe there are 5 locations but this one on Kingly St was the closest to where we were staying.  
There will be a long wait during dinner hours and you can only make advance reservations with party of 6+.  Our wait time was just under an hour at 8pm on a Sunday, we were offered refreshing watermelon lemonade while waiting.  
We had chicken tika, the daily special of lentil curry, roasted corn and a side of veggies. As in all indian restaurants the rice and naan bread are ordered separately.  Everything was flavorful and delicious! I was most surprise with the lentil curry.  It was so creamy and tasty! I also recommend the rose lassi, it was so refreshing! For dessert you got to try the kulfi ice cream on a stick! We had the mango and the original and can't decided which flavor we enjoy better.  
We love this place so much we came back the very next morning for breakfast!!  The naan bread roll is sooooo goooood!!  I wish I didn't have to share that with my husband because his omelet was only so-so.  
Overall a great Indian restaurant with friendly service. Be prepare to wait for dinner but we walked right in during breakfast hour.  It's also very noisy and dark during dinner, sometimes I feel like yelling across the table to talk.",1
5,"Trust me, just eat here!! We waited more than 1 hour at 9pm on a Fri night and it was 100% worth it. Best food we had in London
Some pros:
- friendly staff
- they give out free sherry and lemonade to people in line
- delicious cocktails (and mocktails)
- all of the dishes we tried were fantastic
- reasonable prices for food
Cons:
- long queue just to get a buzzer
- cocktails are expensive
- dark and noisy inside
- service can be slow on busy nights
Note that you should order rice and naan separately from the other dishes as they aren't included. Will be back next time I visit London for sure.",1
4,Wow there are lots of these Dishoom restaurants throughout London. We landed in the Carnaby one. It was about 30mins wait during lunchtime. Everything we ordered was extremely flavorful. The portions were too small and the naan was overcooked it was too crispy. The service was friendly and helpful. If you want a place that will awaken your tastebuds this will be the place.,1
5,"This was the best curry I have ever had.  I was just going to be in London for the day as my flight back to the US was the next day.  After the first bite I knew i had to try more. By the time i was finished i must of ordered half the menu. Everything was so good I just had to order more to try as much as I could.  
When I went in the restaurant was packed full of people but I didn't have to wait for a table but by the time we were finished there was a long line of people waiting.  I must of gotten lucky!",1
4,"I got this recommandation from a trendy travel guide. We enjoyed it!
Food was spicy at times. Lassi was good. 
Arrive early, long line ups.",1
5,"This was a fun girls night! Expect 
An hour wait for dinner. I had been told that many times before going so it didn't bother me. I showed up 30 minutes before my girlfriends to put us in line. While you wait they offer you a free hot chai. You can also get alcohol beverages at the bar while you wait. The food is delicious. The service is great. The price is fair.",1
5,"Visiting from the US, I had pretty high expectations of Indian food on the UK. Not only Dishoom deliver in taste and experience, I'm utter devastated that they've set the bar so high for all Indian cuisine that NONE in the US can compare to.
When we first arrived, it was jam packed with people, I was worried we would have the longest wait if life, fortunately, not so. We were greeted by the warm smiles of our hostesses and offered that we wait at the bar for our 15 minute wait. 
The bartender seemed to have a keen sense of reading people because he knew exactly what I needed without me asking. It probably helped that I had no idea what to order. The Gimlet was a refreshing concoction of celery bitters, gin, lime, and a sprig of dill. One sip and I was transported straight to summer, refreshing, cool, and a little alerts cleanser. 
Our waitress then ushered us to our table, and with British hospitality explained with great detail how to navigate the menu to four clueless Americans. My eyes settled on the grilled king prawns and a side of basmati rice. As it arrived the Indian spices left a mouth watering aroma that left me drooling.
No fuss, just king prawns encrusted with dried spices that my tongue could not pronounce. I bit and I could've burst into tears. It had the perfect char, lending a beautiful note of smoke, the spices provided a pleasant crunch before I reached the succulent meat of the prawn. The texture and flavors married perfectly into one bite. It was at that exact moment I knew I would never taste Indian food as delicious as was offered at Dishoom in the USA. 
To all those visiting the UK, this should be your number destination for Indian food!",1
4,"Really nice restaurant but the line was almost an hour long outside.. in winter. On the other hand the staff was really welcoming and nice, every ten minutes or so they kept coming and offering little glasses of either hot chai or sherry - how lovely. We tried both their chai and sherry and they were both really good.
When we got inside there was another wait. We got lucky and found a place at the bar and waited there.
Finally we got a table and ordered couple of dishes - Butter Chicken, Matar Paneer, naan bread and mango lassi with cardamom and eggnog chai. The food was very tasty and flavourful. I did not enjoy my eggnog chai, I think it was too sweet. And I wouldn't say it was the best I have ever tried. I'm not sure it was worth the wait for more than hour. I would definitely like to come back and try other dishes.",1
5,"A must for me when visiting London! I only had on night to go out to dinner on a quick business trip, and I'm so happy that I picked Dishoom. I went on a Tuesday night at around 8pm wanting to have a quick meal by myself and ended up waiting at the bar with a delicious cocktail for about 45 minutes. Completely worth the long wait times!",1
5,"Omg! Who knew the first meal that I had in London would taste so amazing! Seriously, and I did not expect anything from this place because we just walked up to a random restaurant to eat after landing in London. First of all, the service was spectacular and our waitress was super friendly and helpful. We got a lot of food and shared it amongst each other. Everything tasted delicious! I would recommend the bread and the chicken curries were good! They gave use some yummy crackers to start our meal and I was a bug fab of all the sauces that they provided us with! Everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection! You have to try this place of you are in London!",1
4,"Yeah, I'm going to have to go with the crowd on this one and say dishoom is pretty good: you'll spend a lot to get the variety necessary to sample lots of the menu, but it's a pretty good value. 
The chicken dishes (ruby and tikka) were both very good, as was the naan. The dishes that were really hyped (chai and daal) were both nothing special: I think I've had better chai at home using ""Oregon Chai"" concentrate (which is admittedly pretty awesome). 
My complaints deal with the wait, which is understandable if a place is popular. But the beeper says right on it that they give drinks to those waiting in line (sorry, I mean ""in queue""), and I saw none of this.  I asked about it (because I'd also read about this in other reviews), and I was told it's for times with longer lines before they hand out beepers - we'll then why does it say it ON THE BEEPER?!  Plus my wait was an hour, which deserves something. Instead I was invited to wait at the crowded bar and spend my own money.",1
4,"Following several failed attempts at trying to dine at their Covent Garden location, stumbled upon this outpost late on a Tuesday night. Managed to get in just before the kitchen closed (around 11pm), thus avoiding any lines they usually have.
Quickly was given menus and settled on the Lamb Samosas (£4.90), Chicken Ruby (£9.50), and a Roomali Roti (£2.70). Certainly on the expensive side which is assuming because it's high-end quality. Food comes out amazingly fast - first being the samosas. Three well crisped triangles with ground lamb and spices inside. Pretty good on it's own, but much better with the chutney provided. Chicken and roti come out next; a solid portion of diced chicken swimming in a rich gravy. Roti is soft but a little chewier than expected. Curry has a large tangy flavor that can get intense towards the end. Extremely filling meal leaving no room for dessert. Had also ordered an East India Gimlet (£7.50) - a gin-based cocktail with celery bitters that was a solid nightcap (though I ordered it early on).
I'm thankful this place was around after a disappointing stop at a nearby bar. Great over-the-top flavor that's good to try at least once.",1
2,"**Breakfast Review**
Finally made it to Dishoom for a bit more Indian in the UK after failing to endure a 45-minute wait for dinner on a Sunday night. But the breakfast--a rarity, particularly for Indian--was pretty disappointing.  I was really hoping to maximize eating Indian while in the UK, and Dishoom's breakfast just wasn't up to par.
They were kind enough to swap out the chicken livers in this dish for some portobellos. But while the minced chicken keema smelled terrific, it was just a massive salt bomb, especially when combined with the equally greasy and salty buns and crisps. It was just too much and I could even finish despite it being awfully expensive for breakfast. Other diners' order of naan wraps looked awfully good too so I ordered them to go.  The bacon one was not great, the sausage one offered a bit more texture and was better.
The chai tea was awesome and unlimited. The normal menu for Dishoom still looks amazing.  But don't get breakfast here.",-1
4,"Oh, glory be to Dishoom and for saving us from the... not so brilliant food in London. It is no wonder England imperialized everywhere else... they really needed some food with seasoning, taste, and that was edible. 
There isn't really any food you can go wrong with here, trust me I tried it all and I will do a quick line item list of what you need to do.
Slaw - Had a little cranberry in there that did a wondrous job acting as the sweetener. Great crunch loved every bite and it was great as a contrast to the other flavors.
Black Dahlia Curry - Great get it. Flavor that went well with some of our chicken appetizers. Smokey, a little sweet, and heaven.
Appetizer Chickens - I don't remember their names so check out the pictures both were great one was a little spicier than the other.
Potatoes - Went great with curry but not a must.
Samosas - Good but once again not a must, if you are trying to get a little bit of everything go for it.
THE VERDICT:
Not the coolest experience place in London, but by far the best food. The wait staff was okay... the ambiance was decent. It was really the food alone that stood out for me and I wish we could have gone to more places like this while we were out there. There are multiple locations so you should easily be able to hit it up, even if your stay in London is short.",1
5,FANTASTIC food!!!!!!! Drinks were amazing too. A bit noisy but I devoured all the food hahaa!!,1
5,"Since the first time I visited London I've been wanting to come back specifically to try this restaurant!! It definitely did not disappoint. I went once for lunch and the second time for breakfast, that's how much I enjoyed it!
For lunch we tried the okra fries, salli boti, garlic naan, and chicken tikka. The okra fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy and came with different dipping sauces! The Salli boti was so flavorful and fragrant with the right amount of spice. So good with the roti/naan. And the chicken tikka was tender and definitely had a kick to it!! Everything was delicious and packed with flavor. 
When I went for breakfast my friend and I shared the Big Bombay & date and banana porridge. Also ordered the chocolate chai drink which was so good! The big Bombay plate came with an assortment of foods and everything was so delicious. We had no complaints whatsoever. 
Overall, good service, delicious food, would definitely recommend to anyone visiting London and wants a great meal.",1
5,"Solid Experience! Good drinks, delicious food, amazing vegetarian options! Long line, but worth the wait.
Food Order:  vegetable samosas, Pau Bhaji, Bhel, gunpowder potatoes,  Mattar Paneer, jackfruit Biryani, Raita, Paneer Roll, Garlic Naan.
Bar Order: Viceroy's Old Fashion
Environment: spacious table seating with a variety of options depending on the room you are seated in. They have large 6-8 person booths, 2-person cubbies, tables, and even some ""outdoor"" verandah area seating.  Service was quick and very efficient!
Verdict: a ""Definitely Visit"" for all travelers. Food is delicious, drinks are fantastic, and service was efficient. You will walk away very satisfied and filled with a great experience!
Tips: block off at least 90-120 minutes for your visit. Check-in, Enjoy a drink at the bar, and look over the menu so you can be prepared to order. Are you a desert person, try the Malai Kulfi- it's amazing (says my partner).
Next Time: try Chana Chaat and the Butter Bhutta. It sounded amazing, we just didn't have enough space in our stomachs.",1
4,"My wife and I were very tired from a day of walking. And we were also tired of eating out, I know you may not believe it, but even I get tired of restaurant food sometimes. So we decided to try something completely different. 
We ordered a few items and were hoping for something decent. What we received was absolutely delicious. Everything melted in our mouth. I wish I could tell you what we ordered, but I don't really know what anything means. I always just fake it and order random items, it worked out! The waiter was very helpful with what we might like. He was right, we loved it all.
This place get's packed and the wait is long, but it's well worth it. I was just sad that the portions are not what I'm accustomed with in most Indian restaurants. However, the prices were great, so I can't complain too much. Just be prepared to order a couple of items.",1
5,"Thanks to the multitudes of other Yelp reviews, I chose Dishoom for my ""must-have-Indian"" restaurant on my most recent quick stay in London.
This location was absolutely bustling on a cold winter Sunday night. Was given a buzzer, had a cocktail at the bar, and was seated about 15 minutes later. Food was delicious, service was attentive and polite, menu was ""not the norm"" Indian - which made the experience even more enjoyable!",1
5,Very nice ambiance and great food. Very friendly staff and good service. I am a vegetarian and I had Chole Puri and fried okra and both dishes are very tasty.,1
4,"I've had some of the best Indian food in my life here at Dishoom. This was a serendipitous lunch, because we were actually in Carnaby to eat at Mother Mash. Unfortunately for Mother Mash, they had a mechanical issue that drove us straight into Dishoom's arms. 
We were seated immediately and I ordered a house chai to start. On the menu, it states that ""all who have tried it are swearing by it."" That is no lie. This chai was really, really good. Better than any chai I've had. Very warming and comforting. 
For food, we ordered the following:
+ Pau bhaji (£4.50)
+ House black daal (£5.90)
+ Gunpowder potatoes (£6.50)
+ Sali boti (£11.50)
The food was incredible! The pau bhaji was a bowl of mashed veggies and came with a hot, housemade, buttered bun. An incredible start to the meal, with a slightly spicy kick! The house black daal is a MUST. I've never had such amazing daal before. It's got so much rich flavor, given that it's been cooked for over 24 hours. The gunpowder potatoes were great too, as they were tossed with butter and cooked with aromatic seeds and herbs. And the house special - sali boti - is a classic Parsi dish. Braised tender lamb in a rich and deeply savory sauce that's topped with crunchy crisp chips. This dish is served with a roomali roti, a soft thin bread.
I would recommend every single dish we ordered. Everything was cooked to perfection and left me wanting more. Make a trip to Dishoom today.",1
4,"A really great and authentic Indian restaurant right in the middle of shopping areas in London. I got the vegetable samosas and smashed potato main, however there wasn't much more on the vegan options that I liked the look of. Although our server was incredibly helpful offering other options and suggested a dish for another time. 
Service was quick and efficient and decor is lovely! It's a bit dark inside but does have a nice ambience. I would fully recommend, even if it is a bit on the pricey side when compared to other Indian restaurants.",1
5,"This place is amazing all around. The food, the customer service, the atmosphere, the drinks, etc. We came here based off Yelp reviews and I'm so glad we did. Yes, there was a wait at 6pm, but it was beyond worth the wait. They make it very comfortable for you. It was chilly out so they brought a choice of Chai or Sherry. They brought us in to the warm bar as quickly as they could for the rest of the wait. Every employee we came in contact with was beyond nice. They explained the menu to us and made suggestions. It was so amazing I came back for breakfast, which was just as wonderful. I can't say enough good things about this place. Don't miss out. You won't regret it.",1
5,"Came to the Carnaby location since it was closest to where we were staying at. Waited for ~under an hour on a super busy Saturday night.
Everything was absolutely delicious and super tasty. All the dishes we ordered actually got to our table all at once and pretty fast too! 
Food was so good we actually came back again the next day for Sunday brunch! Delicious and very filling meal.
Would definitely recommend this place. I am definitely coming back here the next time I'm in London!",1
5,"Delicious food, awesome decor and ambiance, friendly and fast service. Vegetarian friendly and breakfast served which are both great. 
Try the breakfast lassi-best lassi I've had.",1
4,"Pretty good stuff! 
They team is friendly & makes it easy to be gluten, nut, & dairy free with their menus. 
If I had had to wait in line, I don't think I would've been into it... so just be aware of that and head on over at a smart time!",1
4,"This was the most anticipated food stop during my most recent trip to London. I have to say, I expected a little more. The food was fine. I was completely satisfied and don't have anything major to complain about. I just wasn't blown away like I wanted to be. Chalk up another win to the hype gods I guess. We ordered the ruby chicken with garlic naan and plain rice. We also tried the black daal. Everything was fine, except I wasn't a fan of the black Daal. I suppose that dish just isn't for me. Dishoom is good, but isn't worth the 90min wait that is often required to eat here.",1
5,"Dishoom was unlike any Indian food I've had. 
Everything we had was on the spicy side (but I very much liked that), there is definitely a fusion aspect but Dishoom keeps the authenticity. 
Okra Fries - YES, there is that fried sliminess that I dig. The seasoning on these fries were so good, and the dipping sauce was even better.
We got the garlic naan, Roomali Roti (thin pancake), Sali Boti (lamb dish), Chicken Ruby (their chicken tikka masala).
*SPICE ALERT* - If you're sensitive or want a balance to all the spice, highly HIGHLY recommend getting the RAITA. It's a cucumber yoghurt sauce that you can mix with everything  to cool down the spice; or it's just fucking good anyway.
Etch-A-Sketches available if you bring your kids. Not that I have any kids, but I asked for one anyway.......",1
5,Really nice food and venue. Strongly recommend sharing the plates so you can get a taste of many different things.,1
4,"We were skeptical when we discovered Dishoom is part of a chain (in an area heavily trafficked by tourists like us), but our decision to try it was vindicated. The food, the service, and the vibe were fantastic. The staff went out of its way to answer questions and seemed truly concerned that we were satisfied. After ordering the black daal, a specialty, our server apologetically informed us that the kitchen had run out of the dish. Later the manager stopped to apologize and then offered us a free pudding. However toward the end of our main, she returned with a full serving of the daal.  ""The kitchen,"" she said, ""made more. You should try it."" It was delicious, she didn't charge us for the daal--and she still comped our pudding. 
Yes, we waited 30 minutes like everyone else, but the experience was worth it. (And if you are adventurous when it comes to flavor combinations, try the kala khatta gola ice.)",1
4,"Tasty trendy Indian spot with several locations. 4.5 stars 
Food: 4, Atmosphere: 5, Service: 4
Cost to worth it rating: 4 (lot of food)
Return worthiness: yes
Highlights:
- Lentils: I'm not a big lentil fan but it was their specialty and I'm a sucker for specialties. It ended up being our favorite dish of the meal with such a rich mixture of flavors and lentils just the tight texture not being too hard or mooshy. 4.5 stars 
- Vegetable mix: spicy mix of slightly mashed vegetables was another hit. Great to put on the naan. 4 stars
- Chicken tikka: nice char on the pieces and moderate spices. 4 stars 
- Paneer curry: mild curry and firm cheese. 3.5 stars 
- Sharing style: my favorite at 2-3 plates per person can try many things  
- Atmosphere: bustling with energy for a fun meal with friends.
Midlights:
- Briyani: strong cinnamon flavor overwhelmed it a bit for me though the dried cranberries were a nice touch. 3 stars 
- Sparkling cocktail: liked that they had them but a bit too sweet
Lowlights:
- Crowded: have to go super early or else you'll be waiting a long time. We went at 5:30pm and we're lucky to get a table but on the way out it was like trying to get to the front of the stage at a rock concert.
Some locals claim it's too trendy and there's better Indian around, but we fully enjoyed it and would come back.",1
5,Went for an early dinner. Good food ... excellent staff! friendly and courteous... chocolate pudding with chilly kulfi dessert was superb!,1
4,"Came to Dishoom for brunch while traveling for business before I had to head back to the airport. I arrived around 10:20 am on a Thursday and was surprised to see how many tables were full (some for business and other travelers/tourists). I saw practically everyone in the restaurant with the house chai so figured it was awesome and I'm so glad I ordered it. This was the best chai I've ever had AND there were free refills...say no more. I ordered the akuri (spice scrambled eggs) that came with 2 house buns and a grilled tomato. I also ordered the grilled mushrooms on the side. This was my first experience with an Indian breakfast and I absolutely loved it. The spices (chopped pepper, black pepper, coriander, ginger) really complemented the eggs well. I typically hate ketchup with my eggs but for some reason a little bit went super well with the spiced eggs.
Will definitely make this a regular if I travel to London in the future. Would love to try their dinner too. Dishoom - please open up a location in or near NYC :)",1
5,"This place does not need another 5 star review, but I have to leave one because it is probably the restaurant I've visited the most in my entire life.
The reason why?
Its the favourite team lunch spot for my office. We've been coming here regularly for the last 3 years. Even those in the team who are lukewarm about Indian food are blown away by the flavours and quality of the dishes on offer here.
Dishes to recommend?
- Jackfruit Biryani, super interesting and unique
- Ruby chicken, classic and amazing sauce
- House Dhal, can't go wrong with this, get naan bread to go with it
Pro Tip: they have a hidden ""feast"" menu, and if you have a group of 5 or more and are feeling hungry or not sure what to order, ask for it. There's three different feast menus, at different price points, and the higher you go the more food you get.",1
5,"Iraqi Indian food... So many flavors! 
They've put a lot of thought into the menu, and their own specialty cocktails. I would highly highly recommend trying a bottle of this strange chai-style cider they carry, chai-der. It's interesting!
My fave dish was the Black lentil daal - even better than the chicken tikka and the prawn appetizer! It was sooo good, like a really yummy lentil soup!",1
4,"I've been here twice with groups of friends in the last month, so here are my thoughts: 
Yes, you have to wait, but you can wait in the bar area, which has a good vibe. In fact, the vibe in the whole place is just great and the atmosphere put me in a great mood!
Food was, for the most part, excellent. I was somewhat skeptical before our first visit because oftentimes, buzzy restaurants over-promise and under-deliver. Not the case with Dishoom. My favorite dishes were the black lentils and masala prawns, and the pau bhaji as a starter. The chicken ruby was also a big hit with our group, although not my thing as  much. Everyone loved the gunpowder potatoes as well. This is a place where you really want to get a bunch of dishes and share among the group.
The reason I'm giving Dishoom four stars, not five, is because (and this is controversial), I wasn't wild about the cocktails. I had a Cyrus Irani and a Kalamansi Smash, and both were too sweet for my taste and just not that exciting. They were not gross, and not so bad as to wreck the experience, but I just didn't love either of them. But our friends did like their cocktails, so it's probably just a question of personal taste. However, I did love the espresso I had after dinner the one time, and the chai I had after lunch the other time. 
Once we were seated, and at the bar, service was great, especially given how packed the place is. Overall, highly recommended.",1
5,"Got here a few minutes early and had a drink at the bar. Interior is nicely done and clean. The dishoom IPA got high marks from me as well as the wait staff. Had the lamb samosas, chicken tikka, and mattar paneer which were all great. Would skip the slaw if we went back as it was average.",1
5,"If you are in the SoHo area, are in no rush to eat and want great indian food, this is the place to be. We got there at 18:40 and had 1:15 minutes wait. Was it worth it?! Absolutely!! I DO NOT line up ever for a restaurant back home but if i crossed the ocean to get there what's an hour wait. That said i will wait to eat here and at Mildred's because it's that good and good things come to those who wait!!!",1
5,"We dropped by here on a previous Sunday around 11 am and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Today we had a reservation for 11:15; we arrive about 5 minutes early and were seated promptly. So make sure to have a reservation!
Huge place inside. At 11:15 it was not brunch but only a breakfast menu. That was the only disappointing thing about our visit. We ordered the sausage naan, bacon naan (says on the menu it's famous) and the Bombay breakfast. All the food was excellent but the bacon naan was better than expected. It truly is something not to be missed if you come for breakfast. 
Service was as good as we've had anywhere in London. Fast, friendly, and extremely attentive - really set's this place apart. Highly recommend!",1
5,"Our first meal in London after 20 years away, and we knew we had to have an Indian.  We had no reservation so we had to wait about 40 mins. We had a variety of dishes and the naan breads and chicken ruby were fantastic.  The kitchen was in plain view which is always comforting. 
The ambiance was fantastic and wait staff great. 
Not the cheapest of meals (100gbp for 4) but worth it.",1
5,"Best Indian food, period. The food, service and ambiance are excellent. The lamb samosa is spot on, vegetables is good too. Chicken and lamb chop tikka were done perfectly and the house specail lamb dish is to die for. 
Highly recommend, and will sure be a stop whenever in London!",1
2,"This place was packed at 9pm on a weeknight. There was an hour wait, which I was happy to make with the bar being so conveniently close to the waiting area. 
After a tall beer, I was seated. I ordered the Black Daal, a slow cooked spiced lentil soup. The lentils were well executed, smooth on the palate and soft on the bite. The blend was too spicy and pungent. It lacked complexity and attention to flavor. This became a theme with the meal. 
The naan was soft and charred. Great execution. 
I ordered a lamb dish. It's not that this dish was too spicy that turned me away, though it was too spicy. This dish relies entirely on its spicing. The lamb was cooked too far and didn't have tender meat or the savour of lamb fats. It was just a large mound of boiled, then pulled lamb. The lamb tasted as if an entire rack of spices were mixed with it. The mixture was repugnant. 
Dishoom's spicing is ham-fisted and lacks panache. For someone who loves an intense palate experience, this may be a good choice. If you're looking for adept flavoring, well executed meats, and want to walk away without feeling as if your tongue was dragged through the soot of an ashen battlefield, this is not a good choice. Dishoom is overrated in my opinion.",-1
5,"Hopping restaurant with colorful, lively, jazzy Indian fare (and a soundtrack to match).  This ain't your corner curry house. Second time at this location first time was a few years ago. Got there soon after opening to avoid the otherwise mandatory wait (no reservations at dinner). Started with the Keema, great flavors with a bit of heat. Went with the chicken tikka and two fresh vegetable sides with raita. Chicken was moist and tangy and their raita is one of my favorites. Could have stayed here all night sipping my chai but the line of people outside waiting in below freezing weather to get in ...",1
3,Below average Indian food- not authentic at all! Service is also subpar. Would not come again.,-1
4,Great food and pretty good service. Definitely helps to have a reservation. It is pretty pricey but most in London is.,1
5,"Amazing restaurant. Not only is the whole operation smooth but it's fun. Imagine a place bubbling with people, noise of conversation/music & the sights and smell of some amazing Indian spices. We shared 7 small plates with rice and nan. Not a drop was left between us. It was worth a lengthy walk across the city.
We loved our helpful waitress Kaya! She explained everything very well & her recommendations were spot-on!",1
3,"Long wait, normally 1 hour at least for dinner. Service is pretty good as staff are pretty friendly even it's so crowded. But imo food favlor is over rated..",-1
5,"My friends brought me here during my visit in London and I loved this place. It's a tapas style for Indian food and everything was great! I love being again to try multiple items at once! There was a wait when we got there. You started in the outside like where they give you warm drinks to keep warm and when they have room inside they move you in and give you a buzzer where you can access the bar. We got drinks and the okra fries while we waited. Those fries are like crack, and they come with 3 types of sauce which were all delicious. The lamb skewer and the curry chicken are a must try!",1
3,"Decent flavor, preparation a little underwhelming.
We arrived for brunch on a Sunday morning, and we had the egg and chili cheese toast, along with the chicken liver dish and the bacon naan. In general, the flavor was decent, but the dishes overall, particularly the latter two, felt a little",-1
5,"(to the tune of One Direction's ""Best Song Ever"")
Maybe it's the garlic naan
Flavors, don't know how to explain it
Every single bite explodes
And I wouldn't ask them to contain it.
I said ""Can you recommend a dish?""
She said, ""Anything that you could wish!""
So we ate all night, one of the best meals ever
Best Indian goodies that I can remember
Cocktails good, not great, but I'll ne'er forget her
Dishoom served us up one of the best meals ever.
Wow, folks - my brother said this was the ONLY place he wanted to revisit from his last trip to London, and now I know why - as we lapped up every drop of the House Black Daal with our naan, begging for just one more order, it hit me - I've died and gone to savoury heaven. 
Highlights include: 
-Spicy Lamb chops - served with pomegranate arils and  ginger spices, divine!
-Black Daal - could've eaten a whole serving myself, and asked for seconds. 
-Raita - minty yoghurt, to cool the spicy dishes AND tastes great alone!
-Chicken Ruby - my brother just about lost his mind over this.
The samosas weren't remarkable, and I almost wish we'd skipped them for a roti or perhaps more calamari, but this meal was terrific!
Try their Dishoom IPA - ups the ante on any spicy dish!",1
5,"Waaahhh!!!! Incredible food, incredible staff and service. We need one like this in New York City as well. 
The Meal for Meal thing just touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes. God Bless you owners.",1
5,"My boyfriend and I were looking for good Indian while visiting London, and definitely found it in Dishoom. 
I will warn potential patrons that this place is POPULAR. The first night we tried to eat here, we arrived at around 6:30pm on a Sunday, and there was an hour and forty-five minute wait. We ate next door, and decided to try again the next night. On Monday we arrived at 5pm, and were seated right away.
The atmosphere of the restaurant was very unique, and meant to recreate the vibe of an old style Bombay cafe. The menu is meant to be eaten family style, so we ordered a number of different dishes to share. My boyfriend also tried their Chai tea which he said was top notch! 
We ordered the Dishoom calamari to start which came lightly fried with a very interesting sweet/spicy sauce. It was delicious; could have ordered two servings. Then we also ordered the chicken ruby, lamb biryani, house black daal, and garlic naan. We liked everything except the daal. It had an odd, milky taste, and didn't live up to our expectations of a daal. Every daal we'd ever had before that had been looser with a strong ginger flavor. 
Honestly, there is something for everyone here. It's fun to try all of the different dishes, and the prices are very reasonable.",1
5,"Dishoom is pretty darn great. We got here on a Saturday for lunch and was told the wait would be 45 minutes. So we stood at the bar and ordered a chai (it's bottomless! What!) and just soaked in the ambiance (they do a pretty great job with it).
We were actually seated in 20 minutes- love when they wait is shorter than promised. Our server was really friendly and super helpful.
We ordered murgh malai, chicken tikka, daal and this pretty interesting irani  style lamb curry (i'm forgetting the name). While everything was delicious, I actually think their murgh malai was the star of the show. It was perfectly seasoned, melted in your mouth and had the perfect texture and flavor. It reminded me of the kebabs we get back in Calcutta!  
I wish i was hungrier, or we came in a bigger group so I could try more things! Will definitely come back.",1
4,"Really hip, happening place, bartenders whipped up some nice drinks, made the long wait a little more pleasant. Food was excellent in terms of flavors, textures needed a bit of work, lamb was tender but marinade/sauce was somewhat grainy, cucumber/tomato salad had nice flavors, but could work on how things are sliced/chopped. The Bhel Puri also had good flavor, but rice kernels should be crispier. All in all, high on taste, just work on some refinements.",1
5,"This place was recommended by a friend ... given that it seemed a tad ""trendy"" at the moment I had my doubts
But this place was insanely good and not outrageously priced.   Our server was a bit focused on only one member of our table but we ended up with some very good food.   The paneer was the only disappoint--it was lacking in flavor.  The rest was all home runs including the cocktails",1
5,"I am from India, so I know what REAL Indian food tastes like. I have tried many different Indian restaurants around the world, and none of them have ever compared and will never compare to a legit restaurant in India. However, Dishoom is the restaurant that has gotten the closest to Indian food reality. 
Dishoom also has a very accurate attention to detail. Let me explain what I mean--the small details that are present in the food and the restaurant itself prove this careful attention to detail. Food wise, never before have I tasted a beautiful, perfect blend of Indian flavors and spices put into Indian food--it's a fantastic experience. Restaurant wise, the vibe of Dishoom is lively, fun, homey, and most importantly, truly Indian. 
If one is looking for a lively, exciting new adventurous experience, he or she should come to Dishoom and experience the closest taste to Indian reality.",1
5,"Wow.. I didn't think I liked Indian until I had Dishoom. 
I mean, I've had Indian food before and I live in Toronto where there's a pretty big Indian population and I equate that to having good authentic Indian food but I never l liked it until Dishoom!
Carnaby location is awesome because I've always been able to walk-in without waiting 1+ hr. I've been to this location twice after feeling defeated at the Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations.
The garlic naan is a MUST. Nice hot freshly made with a bit of a crisp on outer edges and not too garlic-y.
Chai Tea was delicious! Just sweet enough for me (I like sweet).
Chicken Berry Britannia biryani was AMAZING! I normally don't like to eat rice but it was soo full of flavour. There was also a hint of sweetness and a bit spicy.
Chicken Ruby was sooo rich and good! Creamy sweet and mild spicy sauce with the most tender chicken. This goes perfectly with the Garlic Naan.",1
5,"WOW!!! WOW !!! WOW!!!! 
I'm so happy you can reserve a table before 6pm, as I have seen so many times a queue outside the Covent Garden Dishoom.. thats lasts an HOUR!! I once ate/finished a 3-course meal whilst watching a woman in a purple coat move as slow as a dead snail just to get in the front door... 
NOW.. even though it is totally worth it.. SO is booking a 1/2 day at work just so you don't have to queue in the cold!! *Just a thought*
We were actually sat earlier than our reservation at this Dishoom. Me and my husband were celebrating an anniversary so they didn't want us to wait, which was extremely nice considering I was thinking about eating myself. We were given a complimentary prosecco and talked through the menu.
The waitress was incredible.. She even handled the fact that I was trying to crack unfunny jokes due to the hunger delirium that had set in.
I thought we may have over ordered due to the excitement but I feel like you can never over order. THE FOOD IS INDESCRIBABLE! (but I will try).. HEAVEN!! comes to mind. I am used to a cheap and cheerful takeaway and there I am eating like a Mahārāja (Googled the word for Indian King). I would have eaten until I exploded it was that good.
We ordered:
Okra Fries
Lamb Samosas
Sali Boti
House Black Daal (MY FAVOURITE. it was like I was eating silk!!??)
Chicken Biryani 
Garlic Naan...
I CAN NOT WAIT TO GO AGAIN!!!
Thank you Dishoom.
I'll never forget this anniversary.. not cause love is a beautiful thing... CAUSE THEIR FOOD IS A BEAUTIFUL THING!!!!",1
5,"A 10 minute wait outside in the cold, 10 more minutes at the bar downstairs, and we were in. Dishoom is a busy, buzzy behemoth, but the wait is worth it. VERY worth it.
Step 1: Order anything that sounds remotely good to you, and you won't be disappointed.
Step 2: Order the black lentils, the chai tea, and the garlic naan, because if you don't, you WILL be disappointed.
Step 3: When you're completely full and feel like a very happy blimp, order more black lentils to eat at home later. Very crucial.
Enjoy!",1
5,If I could eat every meal here I just might. Never disappointed with their choices and their cocktails are amazing. I love India food but this place spoils my local haunts for me a little bit.,1
5,"Worth the hype. Just to note, they don't take reservations, so expect to wait at least an hour. 
Super friendly service! They brought out sherry and chai samples while we were waiting in line outside. The bar area is super cute with the dim lighting and what not. They have a good selection of cocktails and wine.
The food is amazing and perfectly proportioned. Got the calamari, garlic naan, chicken curry dish and a side of greens. Everything was flavorful and delicious. Make sure you ask for rice if you want it.",1
5,"Great restaurant, wonderful food and atmosphere. Due to its location on a super busy street, I would recommend getting there early. I went there twice during my stay - had dinner around 5:30 each time, with no waiting, but by the time I was finished and leaving, there was a long wait for tables; 1 hour or more.",1
5,Best meal we had in London. Put down your knife and fork and eat with your hands ..you will not regret it ..the food here is out of this world.. utterly satisfying ..a roller coaster for the pallet and senses.the Murray Ruby Chicken was the star of the show!! Make sure to order anything that sounds remotely appealing ...the lentils the okra fries.. everything is ridiculous!!!,1
5,"After a long day of sightseeing, lots of walking and waiting in all the touristy places, I was not looking forward to standing in the long lines again. But the tea gave me some energy and we waited for ~ 50mins. My family was getting restless but I nudged them to be a bit more patient as the reviews promised that it was worth the wait. I was hoping that I was not building up the hype ..... as I know for sure the hubby and kids wont flinch to give their candid opinion after all the wait.
 And boy what a lovely treat! The dinner was super yumm and totally worth the wait. We tried the okra fries,  lamb appetizer (I think the name was kebab that was truly the yummiest thing I ate), chicken ruby and jackfruit biryani. The thought of their food itself is mouth watering. If I could, I would fly all the way from SFO for this food.
I wish they opened one branch in SFO too.",1
5,"I'm still dreaming of my little meal at Dishoom earlier this year. I popped in for a quick lunch alone and LOVED everything. I must go back to try more. I am confident from what I had that everything must be amazing.  The mattar paneer was the best I've had as well as the lamb curry and roomali roti. Unbelievable! 
Highly recommended!!",1
5,This restaurant was by far one of my favorites in London! Highly recommended. We had the most kind waitress. Incredible food and staff!!,1
3,This place is pretty good but I wouldnt go to say it lives up its hype. Portions are quite small and prices are not cheap.The chicken was well cooked and decently flavoured. The naan was well cooked and not chewy. Samosas were your run of the mill kind not spectacular but satisfying. We did have to wait for 3 hours to get in and I wouldnt do it again. Chickpea salad was also refreshing . Chicken Tikka Kebab was well spiced but on the salter side. Mango lassi was perfect not overly sweet.  The service was a bit rude dude to high traffic but they could have been nicer.,-1
5,"I would eat here every day - breakfast, lunch, or dinner!  This location tends to be less crowded than Covent Garden, but you still should expect a wait during peak times.
For breakfast, I love their naan wrapped runny egg with handmade tomato chutney.  For dinner, it's all about the black dahl.  There are so many other highlights, but suffice to say that meat eaters and vegetarians will both be happy. And their cocktails are delicious, too!
Service isn't always perfect but the staff do try hard and the place is always packed, so I can't fault them.  I am in London a lot, and I visit this location at least twice each trip.",1
5,"I could go on for ever about how excellent this dining experience was! When we arrived we were informed of the 1 hour wait time which was anticipated, so we sat down and enjoyed a cocktail at the bar. The wait only ended up being about 40 mins which was great.
Once seated our server was excellent and introduced us to the establishment and provided a ton of recommendations which we took and enjoyed immensely. The black daal (by far my favorite), ruby chicken curry, garlic nan, a bowl of greens, paneer tikka, and a fantastic bottle of Ruinart champagne to top it all off! (Which is my favorite bubbles) The ambiance was romantic, yet fun. The servers were all hustling to the jazzy, Bombay music playing throughout the restaurant. 
Even my bathroom experience was great! When you walk downstairs to the WC you actually get to walk past the kitchen and can see the chefs doing their thing. It was a delicious, fun, and unique dining experience. I wish I lived in London to eat at Dishoom all the time.",1
3,"Came here for breakfast because Mother Mash was closed. The decorations around the restaurant is very unique and nice. I ordered the omelette and it wasn't very flavorful, probably cuz there was no cheese. Probably would come here again for dinner/lunch.",-1
4,"Excellent food. A little slow with the drinks, but that's probably a function of how busy it was. Everybody wants to have some of this food! I'll be returning here in my subsequent visits to London. Pro tip: some (most?) of the food is meant to be eaten with fingers, so don't be too quick with the silverware.",1
4,"All-in-all a good dining experience. Prepare to wait as this is an extremely popular place. Had an hour wait so the wife and I posted up at the bar for a couple of drinks and a little starter which you can order while waiting. Wife had a BollyBellini that was interesting. Not the best bellini I've ever tasted but it was an interesting twist which was nonetheless still very good. We ordered the prawn koliwada which were great. Shrimp were nice and plump, cooked to perfection and the sauce had a real nice punch of heat which I cooled down with a Kingfisher, India's most popular beer.
Once seated, about 45-minutes later, we ordered the chicken ruby, the chef special sali boti and the spicy lamb chops. Of course we got some garlic na'an on the side to dip in all the delicious gravies. 
The chicken ruby was spot on. Just the right amount of sweetness and heat. The chicken could be cut with a spoon it was so tender. Probably my favorite dish of our order.
The sali boti definitely had some kick (spicy) and came with a side of the roomali roti which was paper thin. The lamb in the dish was similar to the chicken ruby, so tender! I used the roti to basically wipe the dish completely clean. Very very tasty!
What prevented the fifth star was the lamb chop. While the flavor was still there and the marinade was delicious, the lamb was just not cooked that well. It was medium well, boarding on well. Lots of grey inside the meat when I cut into the center and not nearly enough pink and definitely no red at all. After having perfectly cooked lamb the previous night at The Ninth, this was very apparent. If they had nailed the cook this could've been a 5-star experience for sure.
Service was great. Ambience was bumpin. Price point was fair! Definitely recommend this place.",1
5,"I have been to this location and one other at least three times now but finally getting around to my review. This is my go-to place to entertain guests and meet friends for Indian food. Hands down, always a solid meal.
There is good reason there can be an hour + wait but they have a system to get you to the bar for a drink whilst you wait and even bring out drinks to people in the queue.
The food is the reason people will wait but I also love the atmosphere! Old world India meets British flair. They keep the theme in the menu with excellent craft cocktails and dishes. There is mood lighting, some low seats and traditional tables. Service is fast and friendly.
My favourite dishes are the okra fries (always), lamb biryani, chicken tikka, mattar paneer, garlic naan, chicken ruby and any assortment of the dips. I dare you to find anything you don't like or that isn't packed with flavour. Dishoom is the reason people say London has the best Indian cuisine out of India.",1
2,"Right.....can people please get over this Dishoom obsession so regular people can actually go and eat there. And Dishoom I am totally over your we dont take bookings nonsense.
I get why its good for you but its awful from the customers perspective. Turning up on any given evening to be told its a 2 hour wait and oh by the eay you ahev to queue...and you cant leave the queue....and if you do you lose your spot. Its a nonsense.
get a booking system,,,,get your head our your arse and maybe I will come back.",-1
5,"Just what I needed, another reason to enjoy some of the best food I've found in London, this outlet tucked away in Soho. Lovely setting, nice service, and a busy place for sure.
Chicken Ruby, my new favorite. So amazingly delicious, I could have eaten 3...
Come enjoy, any time of day or night. There might be a wait, but it's worth it!
Enjoy!",1
4,"I would say 3.5 stars but I'm in a generous mood today. Came here with a couple of friends around 3pm on a Friday in order to avoid the crowds and we still had to wait for a few minutes. The food was good but for me nothing to RAAAAVEE about for months to come. The space is gorgeous in my opinion and the service nice enough. 
Would still be back though.",1
5,"Dinner at Dishoom was easily my favorite meal in London! From the creative and well-priced cocktails during our wait to the plethora of delicious dishes that had us adding on to our order up until the kitchen closed, everything was so well executed and accompanied by attentive and effusively friendly service. I would have tried to come back for another dinner before we left but I didn't want to mar the great first impression.
Started with a round of Bombay-style drinks from the bartender's recommendations: Thumbs Up Flip, East India Gimlet, and Sonia's Negroni, and they were all extremely strong and under $10 with pretty presentation. Late on a weeknight, there was still a reasonable (and accurate) 20 minute wait for a table, despite the spacious dining area. Reservations recommended.
We moved to our table and met our server, whose name unfortunately escapes me because she was so helpful in making suggestions and ensuring we had the best experience! Our group generally has eyes bigger than our stomachs and she helped to ensure we made the best choices: the Sali Boti Chef's special is a must-get platter of tender lamb and flavorsome gravy topped with potato chips and served with roti, go big with the full order because it's just that good! They also feature their house black daal, which was a smooth and rich side that paired well with everything. The Prawn Koliwada more than lived up to their name with a plentiful portion despite the petite price and the smoky Gunpowder Potatoes I initially dismissed ended up being one of the highlights of our meal! Standard staples of garlic naan and steamed basmati were fragrant, but almost made me wish we'd saved the room for more of their unique dishes like the street food small plates and grilled lamb chops.",1
3,"Pretty cool place! Really big and spacious seating. 
My friend and I shared the okra fries which were so goood!! Got a little salty towards the end but it was nice to share.
I got the chicken ruby, rice, and garlic naan. My friend got the chef special I think? It was my first time trying chicken ruby and it was pretty good! Slightly sweet and a little spicy. The garlic naan was kind of small but overall the food was decent.
Service was great and everyone was really friendly.",-1
5,Awesome Indian experience. The best Indian food in London. Go at off-peak time for no wait.,1
4,"Good, not great. 
Given the reviews, I was expecting to be blown away.  The food was tasty, but nothing too special.  I wouldn't wait in line for 45 minutes for the food again.
I would definitely wait in line for the bar, though!  The rose and gin drink was out of this world and I'd love to come back and have a second one.",1
5,"Empty plates - should be enough for any Yelp review but apparently the bot wants more.
When we were planning our vacation to London, several co-workers recommend Dishoom and boy were they right.  We've got great Indian cuisine in Los Angeles but this was by far the best Indian food I've ever eaten.  
The other five star people have already said what can be said about Dishoom.  You will wait about an hour (walk around Carnaby Street), their curry is outstanding, so is the Naan.  If you're traveling go ahead and over order AND... eat it all.  They don't know you, you'll never see them again and your gluttony will not be remembered.  Totally worth it.",1
5,"My son found this place on Yelp during our trip to London. I went to appease him, thankfully. The food, service and atmosphere were spot on. We just came back to London and will be going tonight.",1
5,"OMG to die for. Really worth the hype!! Whatever you order will probably be solid. Just remember that naan/roti/rice have to be ordered separately as sides. Our meal here was probably the best meal out of our entire trip. 
They stop taking orders for breakfast at 11:45. Then they take a 15 minute break. You can start ordering off the lunch menu at noon. We got there at 11:30am, ordered house chai and a bacon naan off their breakfast menu as ""appetizer"" then ordered off their lunch menu later at noon for our main courses. 
There is a 12.5% gratuity that is automatically added to your bill. They make it clear that this is optional and you can ask them to remove it. However, we felt absolutely no need to. The service was great and the food was so good that we would have tipped much more!!",1
5,"I've heard so much about Dishoom. They've been on my list for a while. We decided to go our last night in London. The wait was about an hour, which they were pretty accurate about. We decided to stick it out and I'm glad we did. They offer you some light drink while you wait. The first part is waiting outside. Then you can wait inside the bar, which is nice because you can get drinks while you wait. I didn't get one but my girlfriend enjoyed hers. The staff was very friendly as we waited and they have a difficult job, dealing with hungry people waiting. Some people are unfortunately not very nice to them 
We actually waited at the outdoor tables once we made it past the line across the street. After a while we were buzzed in for our table. 
The restaurant has a great look, 70s Bombay. Funky music playing and a friendly staff. We were excited to finally be inside and we were hungry. 
We ordered a variety of dishes. Enjoyed it all. Especially the fish and chicken tandoori. The naan was excellent. The chicken masala we was very good. Great experience overall. And great food. I think one dish we got, a lamb dish, was a tad oily. But overall we were happy. In addition it was very reasonably priced. One of the last expensive dinner we had in London. Can't wait to go back. Maybe with a large group so we can make a reservation.",1
5,One of the best meals I've had in a while. This spot was recommend by a local colleague of mine. I ordered the chicken biryani with the yogurt sauce and cheese naan. Service was prompt and very friendly. Waited about 20 minutes for a table at 6pm on a Thursday. It looks crowded but they seat you quickly. Honestly not a bad thing I could say about this place.,1
5,"We loved this place! We're of Indian origin and we know a little something of Indian food. Dishoom was awesome! Many of their dishes were authentic, and some of them were a perfect marriage of the East and West. We went in on a Saturday. The wait staff were super helpful and kind. They brought us chairs from inside so that we could sit (we were lugging or young kids). We ordered almost everything vegetarian in their menu. Paneer kebabs, paneer roll, black daal makhani, potato chaat, their seasonal dahi chaat, naans, rumali roti, rice, kulfi, okra fries.... ok, we ordered everything. I have to tell you - you must not miss the okra fries. They're we're unique and delicious. The daal was insane. The paneer roll makes me drool right now. The drinks were made perfect. Overall, I know we're coming back! This is a gem! Thank you all Dishoom folks, you nailed it!",1
5,"My family and I love Indian food, and we knew that London was known for its Indian food. We needed a place that was convenient for us to walk to from our hotel. I found Dishoom on Yelp, and it was perfect! It's super close to Carnaby St and Regent St and tucked away in a cute cobblestone walkway that was decorated with lots of string lights and filled with people of all ages walking around. 
Turns out, Dishoom is a VERY popular restaurant, and we were told that the wait for our party of 3 would be about 45 min - 1 hour. So, I recommend trying to make a reservation beforehand. However, we were able to snag some seats at a high table by the bar and order some drinks and hors d'oeuvres while we waited. It was a Friday evening, and the bar and restaurant area were packed with patrons. It was a lively and positive environment! Dishoom definitely seems like the kind of place to come and relax with friends and/or family for a wholesome meal. There's even an ""outdoor"" patio in the back -- it's completely covered with glass window panels so people can sit out there even when it's raining. The patio has lounge seating and a nice garden decor and style, perfect for happy hour or a post-work dinner and drinks with friends.  
While we were at the bar, my party and I ordered some virgin cocktails and vegetable samosas. I had the watermelon sharbat, a yummy fizzy drink that was very refreshing. I really liked that Dishoom offered an array of tasty virgin cocktails! The vegetable samosas were perfectly crispy on the outside. I don't know if the time just flew by or what, but it definitely didn't feel like we waited a whole 45 minutes before we were called to be seated! 
After we were seated, we ordered some more of those delicious vegetable samosas and perused the menu for dishes. The menu has many options and is great for vegetarians! As most Indian restaurants are styled, the food at Dishoom is meant to be shared. We ordered Mahi fish tikka, House Black Dhal, Vegetable Biryani, and the Chole Frankie roll. All the dishes came hot and were packed with spices and flavor. We enjoyed our entire meal! 
For our first night in London, we had great night at Dishoom and appreciated the warm welcome from the staff! We will for sure return to Dishoom next time we visit London!",1
5,What a great meal.  I can't wait to return.   Next time breakfast.   Indian cuisine in a more upscale setting.  Good service.  Nice people.,1
4,"We went to Dishoom around 7pm on a Monday, and it was super busy, about 20 min wait for a table for 2. On a MONDAY! We passed the time in the bar area. The bar has a comprehensive specialty cocktail list, but I asked for a French 75, which was perfectly refreshing for spring.
On to the food! All of the plates are ideally meant for sharing, which is great so you can try a bunch of things. The okra fries were a standout, as well as the saucy ruby chicken. There are different types of freshly baked naan - go for the cheese!
With stylish decor and helpful service, it's easy to see why Dishoom is a neighborhood fave.",1
5,"Wow - great food, flavorful & intense, if the portions are somewhat small & thus a bit pricy. The chicken biryani was perfumed & de.icious (though more onions would be welcome) and paired with the raita was delicious. So what spicy Accra's the board, at least for the spice-phone we ate with so plan ahead on mineral water.  We got there early & waited 15 minutes,by 6pm they were quoting 2 hours.",1
5,The greatest meal I've ever eaten in my life. Start to finish. 200% reccomend. THE BEST!,1
4,"Loved the food, just always been put off by how loud this place is! Definitely not for a romantic dinner date, great for a rowdy after work curry party!!",1
5,"Amazing! I was determined to have Indian food in London and so glad my friends were able to make a reservation for 6 people at Dishoom. It was great we made the cutoff for reservations because when we arrived at the restaurant at 6pm, the inside was already packed (which was impressive because the restaurant is quite big) and a line was already forming with hungry patrons. 
We ordered an assortment of foods to share family style including lamb samosas, dishoom calamari, biryani, garlic naan, a bowl of greens, mattar paneer and chicken ruby to name a few. Everything was so delicious. Very well-seasoned, fresh tasting. The samosas were crisp on the outside, hot and filled with potatoes and lamb on the inside. The curries and ruby murray were creamy, perfect with the biryani and naan. The vegetables were a great balance against the more heavier foods.  Everything came quite quickly so our hunger was nicely satisfied. 
We  ordered a bunch of viceroy's old fashioned which hit the whiskey spot. We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch which was huge and plenty to share between 6 people. 
This place (which has multiple locations throughout London and I believe to be just as busy) is definitely worth a try! Great interior, good service and delicious food!",1
5,"Maybe the best Indian I've ever had. Excellent chicken tikka masala (called the chicken ruby here), and incredibly naan bread. This place is a staple of our London trips, and one of my top recommendations for anybody going to the city.",1
4,"Come early and don't come hungry because you will have to wait awhile before getting a table and even longer to get served. You can fill in this time by perusing their enormous food and drink menu. 
That being said, this place has garnered a ton of popularity and loyalty for a reason. The prices for the food are surprisingly low for the kind of quality you get, and the uniqueness of the menu rivals anything else you'll find nearby. This isn't your typical Indian fare, either. Sure, you have your typical garlic naan- amazing, by the way- your roti and curries, samosas, marinated lamb, chicken and seafood, and don't forget several different types of lassis (not just mango); but you'll also find many traditional dishes known only to those who have spent time in places like Bombay and know that culture intimately.
From personal experience, I can say that the drinks- especially the cocktails are interesting and amazing- and their Baileys Chai is close to my heart. They serve a rich coffee called 'Monsooned Malabar Coffee,' which I suggest getting as a latte for extra thickness. Trust me, if you know good coffee, you won't ask for sugar.
Their chicken and lamb dishes which pair perfectly with their garlic naan or roti, which is a large crepe-like bread you can unroll and tear into as you go along.
So, pull up a chair, order a drink, and wait for the deliciousness to ensue. It's worth trying at least once.",1
5,"This was a delicious meal -- Dishoom jumped out at us on Yelp both for the high rating and the number of ratings.  I don't get the sense that Yelp is a particularly popular app with the Brits (lots of businesses with few reviews) but seems like a lot of Yanks are posting their London eats.  Anyway we had the fried okra, the tandoori shrimp and their version of chicken makhani -- chicken ruby.  The okra had a delicious batter and the shrimp was very flavorful.  The butter chicken was less rich and creamy than others but this made it less heavy, which we appreciated, saving room for their chocolate pudding with ice cream which was incredible. It's worth the wait in the bar for a table. On a Monday night we waited an hour.",1
5,"Died and went to heaven. Absolutely amazing food and such a great, lively ambience! The prawns were one of the highlights, as well as the Chicken Berry Biryani (O.M.G.) Being Indian American, I tend to look at most restaurant Indian food as a heavy, oily mush that is high on punchy and fatty flavors but low on the complexity you see in real home-cooked Indian food. This place is truly the antithesis of ""restaurant Indian food"" - each bite is so delicately balanced, with the flavors expertly crafted & deliberately designed. The unique twist with the slight Persian influence is also something that is truly magical and unlike anywhere else I've ever eaten in the world (including India!). Even something as simple as the Raita was just so carefully spiced and flavored - as a condiment, it truly took the main dishes to the next level. Bravo to Dishoom for curating such a lovely culinary experience that stays authentic to India, but transports you to a new realm of tastes at the same time!",1
5,"Such a good restaurant! We have been twice now and we are only in London for a few days. You must try the Gunpowder potatoes. The Chicken Ruby was also excellent. A lot of Indian restaurants in London didn't have mint chutney, but Dishoom does. I really liked that. The drink selection is great and there are several hand crafted cocktails to choose from. Definitely worth the hour or so wait!",1
5,First time trying Dishoom and I was not disappointed! Best Indian food in London! Can't wait to come back to the U.K. to have this again. Excellent service and atmosphere to top it off.,1
5,"Love Dishoom! We normally frequented their Shoreditch location but decided to try this one and it did not disappoint. The Shoreditch decor is a bit more fun but food wise you get the same quality. 
We ordered a few dishes and it was a much heavier lunch than we expected as potions were large! The chicken tikka is a different take here with a heavy ginger flavour which I don't mind but some may dislike. We love the biriyani here.",1
5,"This is the best Indian food I have had outside of India. They have managed to retain the true Indian food taste while putting a modern twist to some of the their dishes. From the Keema Pav to the Daal, everything was great. 
Definitely try their cocktails as well, which have some interesting combinations.
Although it is quite busy and you might have to wait. This place is worth it and a must visit!",1
5,"On my previous trips, we have waiting for about hour and a half too just to get into this place but the food always has been worth the wait. While waiting to get inside, we got to taste their hot tea which they serve free outside to the lines. On this trip of mine when I wanted to have cup of tea we decided to go to this place just for drinks and desserts. When we arrived here there was no queue outside around noontime. 
Entrance has a Ganesha statue as their other branches. They have various seating rooms and areas and some lounge seating at the back. I had to wait about 20 min to get a table. This time we tried the chai, rose lassi, mango lassi in our group and for the desserts had their malai kulfi and chocolate pudding with spicy ice cream. Everything was excellent - as per Dishoom standards.
Great ambiance and awesome experience. If you have never been here this a must visit Indian food place in London.",1
5,"I love this place!  When I booked a reservation, I was having a hard time deciding between breakfast, which included an Indian take on a classic English breakfast, and lunch, which had a host of other scrumptious offerings.  So I made a reservation 15 minutes before lunch was set to start, which meant we were able to order a couple of nibbles off the breakfast menu, chill for a bit in the truly lovely open-air, relaxing, and warm atmosphere of this almost restaurant lounge, then stay for lunch.  
My favorites were the following:  
- Masala baked beans:  Much more memorable than normal sweet baked beans from a can that are served up, instead perfectly cooked until tender, but not overly tender, with a lightly spiced, aromatic tomato-based sauce.  
- Spicy shrimp:  popping with spiced, tomato flavor, and lightly fried, they're the perfect way to start or accompany lunch. 
- Dal (black lentils):  Really flavorful, among the best I've ever had, luscious but not too creamy, with still a good texture, and a good balance of smoke and spice.  
I love that the restaurant is so accommodating to dairy-sensitive folks such as myself, with menus highlighting the items that can be made without dairy, and those that cannot.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere truly special.  I'll definitely be back.  What a treat!",1
5,"AMAZING Indian food. Dishoom is a trendy, hipster place, but it does not lose out on flavor and quality of each individual dish. The space is much larger than expected, and even has a ""garden"" room under a skylight. The dishes come out when they come out, so service moves quicker. Our server advised 2-3 plates per person and we gladly took that to heart because it was hard narrowing down all the dishes we wanted to try. We loved Dishoom so much that the next day, we stopped by Cinnamon Soho and turned around to head straight back to Dishoom just a block and half away. I was sad to have to fly back to NY the next day, otherwise I certainly would have fit in a third visit before leaving. 
Here's what we ordered and we loved everything!
- Lamb samosa (4.90): Like the description says, they use phyllo dough instead of the Punjabi shortcrust version. I actually prefer the phyllo dough because it's crispier and lighter, making it a perfect appetizer without filling you up with dough. The minced lamb is spiced well with cumin and shines through. Eat it with the mint, tomato, and tamarind chutney!
- Pau bhaji (4.50): Mashed vegetables, mostly tomato, beans, and potatoes. Slather it on the hot buttered homemade buns and you have a little veggie Indian slider snack. We had extra leftover so we scooped it up with the naan, which I actually prefer over the buns.
- Chicken tikka (7.90): Delicious, flavorful, and a good char. I love chicken tikka and this was by far one of the best ones that I've had. The chicken remained moist and tender, which is usually not the case at most restaurants.
- Masala prawns (11.20): If you prefer seafood to chicken and lamb, then this IS definitely the dish for you. It's marinaded in a green chutney thick sauce and grilled to absolute perfection. The shrimps are plump and succulent. I love love loved this dish. I wish this is how my shrimp come out every time I cook it over the barbecue.
- Lamb biryani (9.90): Could use more lamb, but the rice is spot on, like seriously spot on. The rice is cooked in stock and spices and it really is just absorbed in the rice. When it comes to biryani, I always order lamb over chicken because the deep, rich flavor of lamb fills the rice more than chicken could ever. 
- Chicken ruby (8.50): You need a curry dish to go with naan... Dishoom only offers a chicken or paneer one. It's really like the iconic British chicken tikka masala, sweet, tomato-y, creamy, and buttery. About three pieces of chicken and the rest is curry... which isn't bad considering how much food we ordered!
- Garlic naan: (2.50): Standard naan, but not say it's a bad thing! 
- Roomali roti
Overall, the food is to die for. This is by far one of  the best Indian restaurants that I've been to in NY and London. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long for a table during the late lunch hour. First day was only 15 minutes around 2pm on Sunday and the second was 30-45 mins on May Day. Service is hit or miss. The first time, our server was slow and couldn't really take our cues for when we were joking and being sarcastic... the second time, our server was so much more friendly and welcoming. If I'm in London again, I'll definitely make this one of my first visits!",1
4,"The Carnaby Street area is full of wonderful shops, pubs and restaurants, and this place is no exception.  We were seated in an indoor courtyard type area, which turned out to be better than the sidewalk table we originally wanted.  The waiter went into detail explaining the menu, and was particularly helpful explaining possible allergens, as two of us have food allergies.  All of the food was great.  I had the sheek kebab, with grilled corn on the cob.  The kids had grilled chicken and awesome potatoes, and my wife had butter chicken.  We will be coming back.",1
4,"We came on a Sunday evening after 6 and there was a wait for 45 mins for seating 2 people. This location I felt was quite huge as compared to the other two. Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. 
The reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. 
Coming back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.",1
5,"Dishoom is probably my favourite restaurant in London.  That says a lot coming from me, but I think after 3 years in London, I'm able to confidently say so.  Why you ask? The food is always outstanding, the cocktails are great, the prices are super reasonable, the ambiance is charming, and the location couldn't get any better. Therefore it wouldn't be fair to give Dishoom anything less than 5 stars.
Three things I highly recommend: sali boti, chicken ruby, and calamari.  If you're a meat eater, order all three! (I'm drooling now just thinking about them.)
I've been to three different Dishoom locations (Covent Garden and King's Cross), and wherever or whenever you go, you know you'll receive the same delicious food with attentive service. However compared to Covent Garden, I've noticed that this location is surprisingly better in terms of wait times.  As usual though, I would recommend coming a little early to avoid waiting outside in the rain.",1
4,"About the food - Best Vada Pav and Pav Bhaji I have had outside India. Their chai is delicious too. I also had a paneer roll which wasn't amazing, just ok. They had delicious cocktails on the menu. 
About the service - I arrived a little before dinner service began so was seated right away. My food arrived pretty quickly too. On my second visit - Saturday evening around 7PM I saw a huge line outside the restaurant and was told there is a one hour wait. They serve complimentary chai to guests waiting outdoors - pretty cool, yeah?! You can tell that the place is usually packed because they have 3 hosts and 5 servers to serve only 1/4th of the restaurant. 
Interiors - The place Is decorated in a very homely yet chic fashion with old style chairs and tables, stainless steel utensils, pictures of family members on walls and diyas on tables. They have adopted a very interesting style of decorating the bathrooms as well - WC style, for those who know what that means.",1
5,"We were lucky enough to just pass by this place in a beautiful morning & decided to have breakfast. The breakfast was very different & truly yum! 
The juice is squeezed right when you order & the buns are baked after every order as well, I mean does it ever get better than this?
The wi-fi is awesome & service is fast.
The music is really beautiful & the volume is just about right, I mean not all of us like waking up to a loud rock in the morning as they do in many cafes!
The kitchen & restroom must be one of the cleanest I've seen in London which says a lot about a place.",1
1,"Very low quality food, the chicken butter was bad  also the beriany Laham ad well, the only positive thing in this restaurant is the place it self",-1
5,"Five stars for being my favorite restaurant during my recent trip to England! This was my first time in a long while eating Indian food and it did not disappoint. Chicken Ruby was to die for and so flavorful. The okra fries were the perfect starter. 
Although I had read a lot about the long wait, I went on a Tuesday at 6pm and had no wait for a table for 2.",1
5,"Best. Indian. Food. Ever.
So now that that's out of the way, on to the meaty stuff: the review.
Visiting London for work left little room for free time because of my super intense jet lag. My boss and her husband were going to dinner and since she's remote, this was a great opportunity for me to spend some non-working hours with her. They say a connected team works best right?
Located walking distance of the Oxford Circle tube station, it's just the right location. You walk over and stand in a line outside to put your name in for a table. If it's raining, they have complementary umbrellas; luckily we had one from the hotel (see review for the Landmark Hotel). While you're in line, they will bring you chai or Sherry (so much yes). 
After our wait ended, we were able to then go inside and wait at the bar. With three of us, we each ordered different drinks. I opted for the Bollybelini first, Jake had an old fashion, and Liz had a twist on the whiskey sour. Yes, my girly drink wasn't exactly strong but o wanted to try something different than my norm. We ordered a second round of drinks and I had the Velvette Fog which consisted of chai ice cream, coffee liqueur, and vodka. So, it was dessert before the meal. For my last round (yes we ordered three before being seated) I had a big girl drink which was equally delicious. Each drink was 7£-8£.
On to the food: it's family style and sooooo inexpensive. Go for the vegetable samosa - you will not be disappointed. That's what I picked and we agreed on garlic naan. I can't remember anything else because I let them do the selecting but it was ALL delicious. The food costed 50£ total and we had PLENTY of food. It also came out within 3-4 minutes of ordering which was good because we were starved by the time we sat down. 
I would absolutely recommend this to others and already have. Enjoy!",1
1,"Dishroom is stupid,  other restaurant will take yr name and bizz u ten mins before yr tanle ready, bit dishroom need u to wait in line for hour and a half to get in even after they take yr name. If u leave the line u are out. Non senses.  althought they give u a shot of lemonade while u waiting.",-1
5,"Our first time at the newest London location of Dishoom. It's a beautiful space, an oasis in a very busy central London area. The food and service were up to the usual, high Dishoom standards. Hoping the next location is in NYC!",1
5,"Amazing! One of the best Indian restaurants in the world that I've been to! It is worth the long wait -- and they treat you well while waiting.  The lamb chops, daal, and chole were my favorites. Roti was excellent. Really, there wasn't a bad dish. We had apps at the bar while waiting to be seated. Appetizer dishes of calamari, lamb samosas, and fried okra were all good. I loved their pimms cup cocktail!",1
4,"Coming from nyc i am a bit spoiled. 
Skip: 
-prawn and vegetable (potato) samosas: they both seemed a bit soggy and were just okay in flavor. Did not blow me away
Now, must haves! : 
-bowl of greens- now this is delicious! Smoky and perfectly seasoned! Maybe my fave of the night in terms of unexpected deliciousness
-ruby chicken- definitely get, this is perfectly flavored and the chicken texture is great. But i must say that this is a flavor that i very much expected which isnt bad necessarily.
Really enjoyed my time here, even after waiting 40 minutes, that says something!",1
5,"Simply outstanding! 
We went at a good time - no line to get in. Our server was really informative and helpful. The food was wonderfully spiced and there was a big variety. Be careful, though - the small plates look deceiving so pace yourself!",1
5,I imagine Dishoom coming to NY and it doing really well so please hurry it up. I ate here twice on my last London stay and everything was so good and cheap! Also why is the chicken so tender. I imagine Baby ji in NYC is similar or trying to channel Dishoom. Would love to eat here often.,1
5,"The fabled Dishoom! You hear so much about its great ratings and see the long queues outside, makes you wonder if it's worth it at all. Well, I can confidently say that it most definitely is!
Sure, there's a bit of a wait if you don't have a group booking, but the staff are amazing and they serve cocktails and snacks at the bar if that's your thing.
We were seated in the courtyard, which is super colourful and comfortable with patio type furniture. Since it's under a glass roof and it was still sunny outside, it was also much brighter than the rest of the restaurant. I loved the courtyard! 
Our server was very helpful with recommendations and helping with our food selection. They really are very well trained and attentive here.
The food was phenomenal! Perfectly flavourful and lightly spicy, very well rounded and great quality. 
I really enjoyed the entire experience very much, definitely worth the wait!",1
5,"This is a very reasonably priced but utterly delicious Indian restaurant which should be sought out by anyone who wants to have a bit of spice when dining in London.  Dishoom is a chain with multiple restaurants all over the city.  The Kingly Street location is practically next to near Oxford Circus tube station.  It is also near some great shopping locales.
Open for breakfast with a limited menu.  Lunch as well, but the real reason not to miss this Indian delight is its dinner menu and entertaining bar service!  
The menu is massive but a few Not to miss dishes include the Lamb Samosas which are crisp little wedges of lamb and spice goodness served with a squeeze of lime.  The Black Daal with a bit of smoke and spice, a house specialty.  Chicken Berry Britannia with rice has some serious kick to it but is great!  Throw in a few sides of veggies and some Naan and you are ready to go!
Very reasonably priced for a load of food and a night of culinary adventure!",1
5,"London is known for their curries.  What better way to sample t than Dishoom, one of the most hip and happening Bombay style cafes?  Most Brits I know don't queue for food and when you hear that there's over an hour queue on a Friday night, I am highly anticipating the food.  We spent the first 20 min standing in a line and the hosts came offering rounds of sherry and chai.  Then we made it to a second line which we wait at the bar to be called for a table.  Swell business model as most people ordered drinks and appies there.  We got okra fries and they were fried and seasoned perfectly with salt and a hint of lime.   45 min later our buzzer went off and we were seated.  We ordered the chicken ruby which surprisingly the chicken breast meat was succulent instead of dry.  The corn, omg the CORN.  We just ordered it so there would be some form of veg in our dinner.  It was Super unexpectedly delicious.  The spicy salt on the side is quite hot and spicy.  It will blow your head off if out put you out too much on but it was almost too spicy for me and I was sweating but I just couldn't stop eating!  The roti was also done to perfection.  I tried the Dishoom later on my trip in Edinburgh as well.  It was just as stellar.  Hope they expand to North America soon!",1
5,"Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had. I dread going back to America because I know nothing will compare to our meal here. We got here at 8:30 on a Monday night---the wait was still 45 minutes. We set up shop at the bar in meantime and had a drink each. I think the wait ended up being about half an hour which was a pleasant surprise. 
Everything we had was amazing, my suggestion to you is over order. You will be happy that you did because we were not disappointed with anything",1
5,"Amazing food! Especially liked the garlic naan, prawn koliwada, spicy lamb chops, and the All Caps Pilsner. They take reservations prior to 5:45 pm. It is worth going early because the wait for a table can be very, very long.",1
5,This restaurant took Indian food to a new level of deliciousness and creativity. We loved every bite!,1
5,"Excellent service, vibrant atmosphere, comprehensive menu, delicious food!
My wife and I stopped in for an early dinner based off the Yelp! Reviews. We were immediately impressed with the decor and energy of the large space and friendly wait staff. We wish we had a place like this back home... would definitely recommend and consider making our way back!",1
5,"Very impressed with the food and selection of cocktails here. Love the ambience the restaurant provides ! 
All staff were very friendly ! Two thumbs up all around. I would totally come back next time when I m in town again.",1
2,"Definitely, positively overhyped! Overpriced. Overly crowded. Overly noisy. Overly pushy. (It was suggested that, because servings are small, we should order two to three dishes per person+appetizers, rice and nan.) Had we done so we could have eaten for three days!
In fact, we ordered only one appetizer, one nan, one rice and four dishes for three people and still couldn't finish everything. 
There was one dish we all considered outstanding, the ruby chicken. The black daal, a house specialty, was reasonably good but I've had much, much better. All else went downhill from there. 
For food alone I'd rank this place three stars. The other considerations pull this down to two stars. Won't be going back. 
Before signing off I'll say that our waiter was kind enough to arrange for us to move to a quieter area, and that there was nothing that wasn't tasty. We enjoyed the food and the special treat that it was, a nice dinner in honor of my birthday, coming from a friend. Just that we've had much better (other than for ruby chicken!) elsewhere.",-1
4,"I think this place is definitely a hype restaurant, because the line is insane to get in. I came for brunch and I wasn't WOWd by the place, but I did have a good time, therefore I will give it four stars. First, order the chai tea. It is bottomless and the tea has a nice spicy kick to wake you up in the morning. I drank three cups and could have kept going if my stomach wasn't already full. I ordered the bacon egg naan, breakfast lassi, and their akuri dish. The bacon egg naan was good. The naan was light and fluffy and it was interesting eating American breakfast inside a naan. The breakfast lassi had too much banana in it for me. The akuri dish was also a little bland. I also like my food very salty. I wasn't impressed by it, but it was fine to eat. 
Overall, I don't think it's worth lining for hours for the brunch, but I will have to come back for dinner to round out my review.",1
5,"Came to Dishoom in Kings Cross with colleagues after a long day. Everything we ordered - shared among all of us - was delicious. Many of my colleagues have traveled in India so their standards are high, and Dishoom didn't disappoint. Ambiance is hip and fun. Definitely want to go back.",1
5,One of the best places to eat in London. My friends and I had a wonderful time while dining here. Everything on the menu was tasty.,1
5,"In addition to the beautiful flavors crafted here, the presentation of both the dishes and the classically designed interior made this a lovely brunch experience.  I've been to plenty of Indian inspired restaurants (fusion type places), but this spot takes the cake. In short, the flavors are authentic, the atmosphere is lovely, and the staff was a joy to be around.",1
5,"WOW. Probably, the best Indian food we've ever had. So tasty, worth to wait in the line for 45 minutes.",1
5,"We went for breakfast on a Sunday morning. I didn't know that they had a breakfast menu -- it was a very pleasant surprise. 
Food was spot on. I ordered the omelette with a side of sausage, and everything hit the spot for me. I also had the breakfast lassi, which was quite filling. Everything was very reasonably priced as well -- including service, my meal cost £13, which was very good for the quality and location of the restaurant. 
Service was very good. Our waiter was kind and prompt in responding to our requests. 
Lastly, ambience was lovely. Although I've never been to India, it felt like what a local restaurant might feel like. Also a bit reminiscent of Hawksmoor but with Indian influence. I could have stayed drinking another cup of tea, just to enjoy my surroundings.",1
4,"Food was excellent. I ordered the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and rice. It was so delicious, 10/10, everything was perfectly seasoned. I was hesitant to come here because I try to avoid touristy restaurants and was worried this was another overpriced tourist trap but my meal was truly wonderful. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the menu doesn't have much variety of Indian food. I was expecting to see goat or lamb curries, or more traditional Indian or Nepali foods, but the menu is mostly vegetarian, paneer, or chicken. And they only have 2 curries. I'd say this is more of a modern, trendy version of Indian food. If you're wanting traditional Indian/Nepali foods with more variety, I would say this isn't the right place for you. Still, I recommend going for the chicken ruby",1
5,Amazing! Probably the best Indian I have ever had and I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in my lifetime. Loved the roti and it was huge. The lamb dishes were my favorite. Will definitely return when Im back in town. If you love Indian food this is a must try!,1
5,"Had an amazing dinner at this location of Dishoom the other night.  So glad we made a reservation and got there at 6 pm, as about an hour later there was an enormous line out the door!  Started with some prawns, lamb kebab and chicken tikka from the grill.  All were delicious, especially the prawns. Cooked perfectly with the right amount of spice.  For the main course we had the black daal, chicken ruby, mixed bowl of greens, naan and rice.  Everything was outstanding.  The service was great as well.  Can see why they have a line out the door each night!",1
5,"Best restaurant I tried in London. Set the bar a bit too high even, since it was the first dinner for us there. This was just excellent quality Indian food, cooked to perfection... loved the atmosphere inside the restaurant as well. The menu includes some tasty cocktails which paired very well with the entrees.",1
5,"Love the food! We stumbled upon this place by accident but have previously read about its reviews. We couldn't agree more with those reviews! Everything we ordered definitely blew our minds. I have not had the chance to regularly taste Indian cuisine from all over the world, but this place I'd highly recommend! A few locations all over the town but I'd say this is probably the sweetest spot. We had the chance to get table on the pavement so we could bask in the summer weather & benefit from the late sunset. The line got longer by the time we were eating. Would definitely recommend it to people.",1
5,"The procedure to get in was overly complicated (the hostesses at the door acted as if they were controlling backstage access to a Rihanna concert), but the food was well worth it once we finally were seated. The curry was phenomenal, there was a chef's special prawns dish that was light and flavorful, and the samosas were perfect.",1
5,"The best Indian food I have ever. ever. had!!! The atmosphere, service, food, drinks... everything is superb.  The calamari is so unique and flavorful, served with a light sweet sauce... I have never had anything like that before but it is absolutely amazing.  I will be back to Dishoom a hundred times over.. wow!",1
5,I'm the type of person that hates lines. Hate them. It's half the reason I don't go out at night - who wants to wait to get into the club? Not this guy. Well apparently that applies to everything in my life besides Dishoom. I will wait however long we need to and it's always worth it. Make sure you get a little bit of everything but don't forget the raita and the cheese naan to go with your chicken tikka and basmati,1
4,"When half a dozen unrelated acquaintances/friends suggest a single spot for Indian fare in London - heck, I had to try it out! So make my way I did, walking around the streets of carnaby on a cold,rainy day during my holiday season trip to London in an attempt to discover for myself this much talked about ""Bombay cafe"" inspired diner. Maybe it was the cold outside, maybe it was the warmth and bustling crowds inside, maybe it was the wonderful hearty black daal or the friendly waiting staff that brought it over, or was it those slow moving ceiling fans that remind one of simpler times... whatever it was, I think I felt better about life post Dishoom!
Don't expect life changing experiences, but expect to be pleasantly pleased. The menu is interesting  ... traditional favorites come with an interesting twist or too, like a jackfruit biryani but the black daal has no surprises, no twists just rich, feel so goodness ! 
In the end, I am glad I experienced Dishoom and I join my half a dozen acquaintances in recommending this to others!",1
5,"I make sure to go to Dishoom every time I'm in London. The place is always packed so I would recommend a resso. Great customer service. The Keema Pau is my fave. I've also had the Okra fries, Chicken Tikka, Gunpowder potatoes, and plain naan.. all equally delicious! Edwina's Affair is the perfect choice cocktail for any Gin lovers!",1
5,What a beautiful cool and tasty place. The food is excellent. The drinks are made by true professionals. The atmosphere Is super cool and trendy. Next time in London I'm stopping in.,1
5,"Loved everything about this restaurant, welcoming attitude, well mannered stuff, very helpful with the menu, so many options, the food served hot and well spiced, good vibes, nice music, amazing atmosphere.",1
5,"My favorite Indian restaurant in London! I went there twice on my trip because it was AMAZING! I basically ordered all the vegetarian items available on the menu. While we waited for a table, we ordered cocktails  (you can't go wrong with either alcoholic or non - alcoholic beverages) and okra fries which came with 3 dipping sauces. The service and ambiance is wonderful. It is worth the wait! I love Dishoom!! Would go back to London just to have another amazing meal at Dishoom because it is that GOOD!",1
5,Great mix of street Indian food with genuine flavours. Really buzzy casual atmosphere in the day.. And steps it up in the evening. Perfect for people who haven't got the grasp of Indian food yet too.. So any out of towners... Dishoom is a great place to start. Yum.,1
5,"Everything was perfectly seasoned and spiced! One of the best indian meals I ever tasted...hands down. I made the right decision to get take away so I could eat this food ALONE! I ordered the mahkani chicken. I literally ate all of it. Every bite. Extroadinary meal, really.",1
4,"I had a great experience here. A co-worker insisted that I stop by for a meal, and I'm glad I took the advice.
It's in a trendy location in Soho with indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived for lunch, just as the crowd poured in. Our waiter gave great recommendations, and our first 2 dishes arrived before we even finished placing our order  (servers electronically submit dishes). 
Huge selections of food and drinks. It is recommended that each guest order 2-3 small plates and share with the table. Everything we ordered was amazing... the lamb was the highlight as was the prawn plate.
My only complaints were that although there is plenty of seating, they really pack the place tightly. You are sitting very close to other guests and you don't have much table room at all. You feel like you are constantly rushing to finish dishes because you need to make room on the table. The service started out fast, but after our first 2 small dishes, we ended up waiting quite a bit for the rest... but I am going to blame this on the incoming lunch crowd.",1
4,"Really nice restaurant but the line was almost an hour long outside.. in winter. On the other hand the staff was really welcoming and nice, every ten minutes or so they kept coming and offering little glasses of either hot chai or sherry - how lovely. We tried both their chai and sherry and they were both really good.
Finally made it to Dishoom for a bit more Indian in the UK after failing to endure a 45-minute wait for dinner on a Sunday night. But the breakfast--a rarity, particularly for Indian--was pretty disappointing. I was really hoping to maximize eating ...Good.",1
5,This is the best Indian food we have ever had. Everything is well prepared and the service is friendly and attentive. Our son wants to come back again tomorrow .... enough said.,1
5,"INSANELY GOOD FOOD!! The food was amazing, the drinks were tasty and the coffee was strong! I read reviews prior to coming for lunch but was still blown away by how good the food was. The ruby chicken is a must try, as well as the prawns.",1
5,"Great atmosphere, loud and busy but in a good way. Live jazz music which contributed to the volume and the atmosphere. The food was fantastic but it's very easy to spend a lot of money there. There is a very wide assortment of drinks and dishes that will keep you coming back time and time again",1
5,"My last day of three weeks in London and I hadn't eaten a really good Indian meal. Then I ask my host for a recommendation and he strongly recommends Dishoom. It was late, dark and cold and in Kings Cross With bridges canals etc and I had trouble finding the place! When I entered I was  pleasantly greeted but advised that the kitchen was closing in 25 minutes - fine. However when I sat down I  discovered it was part of a (gasp) chain! My expectations descended into near-despair - my last meal in London was going to be a bland affair served on a styrofoam plate!
Then my charming approachable lovely waitress (I can't recall her name but she was serving upstairs on January 9). She assured me I would not be disappointed and I grasped that tiny fractal of hope with all my being! 
I kept it simple with lamb samosas, Chana chaat salad and the chicken biryani and all were absolutely excellent. 
I think it's  worth a trip in business class (not coach) from New York to try the rest. 
Great vibe, great food, great service -wow!",1
5,"We have the best chicken ruby ever. It's not super hot, a little bit sweet, but the flavor was so good. You got to try it and you will never regret.",1
5,"Had to come try this place and I was forewarned about the minimum 1hr wait time if I show after 6pm. It is so worth the wait! Even during your wait in line, someone comes by periodically with a choice of chai tea or a shot of sherry. With the nippy weather, either would make a good choice to help you stay warm!
Once inside, it was a short wait with the buzzer so we ordered drinks. Bhang Lassi...must order! It's a different take from the usual mango lassi, tho they have that also. 
For dinner, we went with a variety to share. So among the two of us, we had okra fries (light & crispy with 3 dipping sauces), chicken tikka (not smothered in sauce like we're used to but very tasty & spicy), paneer curry (little heat, very delicious!), and garlic naan (texture was great and garlic wasn't overwhelming). For dessert, we tried their pineapple & black pepper crumble (more crumble than fruit but the warm custard sauce was the cherry on top) and finally, a chocolate chai (great blend of chocolate & chai). 
The dishes were not huge portions but I've come to learn this could be the norm in London? I was able to do 3 courses as a result which is awesome. 
Definitely would come back and try other dishes of theirs.",1
5,"Worthy of the 4.5 star rating.  The food was fanastic, particularly the daal, shrimp, and the mango lassi, and the place feels like a real institution.  Service was excellent - our server's recommendations were spot on.  We sampled both breakfast and lunch since we arrived shortly before noon.  The menu is cheeky, and provides an interesting history of the restaurant.",1
5,"This is the best Indian food I've ever had, and my best meal in London. 
Would recommend 100% excellent drinks, service, atmosphere, and FOOD!! The veggie samosas are killer, house dishes excellent, really everything was great. I'd go weekly if I lived closer.",1
5,Love the food and the chocolate chai.  It is my one must visit restaurant when I travel to London.  Just try to make it for an early meal because the line does get long.,1
5,"This is the best meal I have had in London.  The place is always crazy busy and doesn't take reservations on the weekend.  The wait is usually quick and you can grab some drinks while you wait.  The service is good and good generally comes to the table very quickly.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but particularly the house specialties and the Ruby chicken are highlights to consider.",1
3,"Yelp to the rescue! Standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square, my dad announced, ""I want Indian food."" On comes my Yelp app! A quick search pointed us to Dishoom in Soho. We were fairly pleased with the fins...
Pros:
- Super affordable! Especially considering its in a fairly popular, trendy neighborhood. 
- Delicious food. They serve traditional Indian dishes with a modern spin. 
- Designed to share. No starters/apps. You order all at once and food comes out as its ready. I enjoyed sampling a little bit of everything our table ordered. 
Cons:
- Disorganized at front of house. We requested a table outside. When the hostess tried to seat us inside, we inquired. The time it took her to check and discover there wasn't an outside table available, we lost our inside table. 
- All staff (front of house and servers) seemed a little harried. Everyone we encountered was a mix of disinterested, rushed and short. 
All in all, Dishoom was just above average. I've had better but I've also had much worse Indian food in the UK. If they could button up service, it would bump this spot from 3 to 4-stars in my opinion.",-1
5,"Amazing is an understatement!! From the salads (maybe the best salad ever) to all of the mains delicious. It was also perfect for a family of 5 that has one gluten free person (gluten free menu) to vegetarians to meat eaters. Everyone was extremely satisfied! 100 percent go there again. Normally a long wait, but we get lucky with an impromptu 11pm entrance.",1
5,"Fascinating atmosphere, good service, delicious food, reasonable prices, inspired menu! 
I got lucky and came here on a whim on Sunday night so didn't have to wait. My first impression was how much of an eyeful the place was. The size and scale of the dining room is impressive, with multiple floors, high ceilings and retro furniture and enhancements. The menu is a wonderful inspired twist on traditional Indian fare, the drinks included. The food was quite yummy but more impressive then the flavor was just how the chef chose to put dishes together. It was a delightful and interesting dining experience. 
East India Gimlet - their specialty drink, so delicious I could drink all day!
Bombay Colada - lovely twist on pina colada
Romali Roti - fun thin bread to eat, this was nice with the matar paneer or anything with sauce
Veg Samosas - pretty traditional and yummy
Chana Chaat Salad - tasty and fresh and healthy
Bowl of Greens was very yummy
Mahi Tikka - Such a delicately prepared fish! I loved this! It was even more tender than ""flaky"" can describe. It pretty much melted in my mouth. 
Mattar Paneer - Paneer was in something of a red tomato based sauce that slightly reminded me of Italian tomato sauces but was very rich and thick with sweet peas in it. This was delightful. 
Fa fa - fun to eat, they brought complimentary
I loved eating here. It was a fun and interesting treat and dining experience. The menu was interesting to navigate with all the twists and turns. The food was perfectly prepared and really yummy. Service was great. Atmosphere was trendy and a bit noisy.",1
5,"I love Dishoom's Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations, and this one is right up there with the other two. You inevitably always have to wait about at least an hour, but they do their best to help that hour pass by quickly. We were served a selection of mint tea, lemonade, and chai tea as we waited outside in the queue. They ushered us into a bar area where we can get some drinks before being seated (good tactic, huh?).
It's always nice to go with a larger group so you can share a variety of dishes. As a pescetarian, I always get the mattar paneer, which is one of the best curries I've had in London. My husband loved the Chicken Ruby. At this location I tried the Pau Bhaji, which is DELICIOUS. Next time, I'm not going to ask anyone to share this dish with me!
If you're around King's Cross and can wait a bit for food, definitely stop by here for some amazing curry!",1
5,"""have you tried Dishoom?"" ""You haven't tried Dishoom?"" This had been going on far too long - it was time to have an opinion of my own about this Dishoom restaurant I had been hearing so much about. It was a colleagues farewell lunch, and when I called to book a table for 11, I was initially told this was not possible - only when I told the lady at Dishoom that this was for lunch did she say that they can take a booking. This only made me more curious.
The restaurant is set on Kingly street, which runs parallel to both regent and Carnaby street. Upon entering the restaurant one is taken aback by just how deep it goes - it is very spacious and almost feels like you have travelled to India 1970. With old school Indian music playing in the background (soundtrack available to purchase from dishoom also) we sat down on our table. The menu came promptly and we were impressed with the diversity of Indian dishes available and the interesting names they had (e.g. gunpowder potatoes, so called due to their sulphuric taste and the special salt used to prepare them i believe). Since we were many, we ordered a bit of everything and decided to share when the food arrived.
The food. All our conversations halted when the food arrived, because we were too busy stuffing ourselves. The black daal is wonderful and the naan just the right balance of burnt and oily. The meat in the Biryani was very tender and the paneer of the paneer tikka was soft and moist. Each dish as it arrived drew eyes and our forks, knives and hands. I'll let the pictures do the talking.
The service was excellent our (none of them Indian, bht not a problem) waiters were polite and knowledgeable. We ordered Kingfisher beer and mango lassis for drinks, which was great as the day was hot. For desert we ordered the Kulfis (ice cream) which were delightful.
I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I have been told each franchise is slightly different, so I'll have to try the other Dishooms - here, the decor is very pretty and elegant, the service good, the food excellent. Decent value for money, I would love to visit again and try tor breakfast menu. 5/5.",1
5,Wow! Been to India 2 times this place is legit! Best Chai I've had outside of India. Drinks are fantastic food is better. If you like Indian food this USA must go!,1
5,"Dishoom hands down was my favorite meal in London. When everyone says you can't go to London without getting curry, I can see why; London's Indian food scene is no joke. 
My boyfriend and I have never eaten at an Indian restaurant before, so we were a little hesitant. With a quick Yelp search, Dishoom came up as the best Indian restaurant in London, so we just had to come here on our last day. Tip - I read how the waits at Covenant Garden are excruciating long; there was no wait and ample seating at this location, so do come here instead! 
Informed by our waiter that every dish is meant to be shared, so order 2 dishes per person, my boyfriend and I shared the lamb samosas, the carnaby special, and the chicken ruby with 2 orders of garlic naan (we originally order 1 order of garlic naan, but it was so good that we had to have another order. It tastes better piping hot when it's super fresh and so worth the hand burns!). Everything was absolutely delicious! I legit died and couldn't stop saying how good the food was with every bite! The lamb samosas wasn't oily / greasy and felt light; it was also flavorful on its own, but tasted even better with the red pepper sauce provided. The carnaby special is great for those who want to sample lamb / love lamb as the lamb was tender and didn't have that gamey aftertaste that lamb tends to have sometimes. This dish was my boyfriends favorite with the thinner naan that the dish came with. My favorite was the chicken ruby as the curry was slightly spicy, but most importantly, the chicken was SO tender and juicy. You can honestly taste how complex this dish is and how much hard work went into making this curry. Ughhhhhh, I wish I had more as I'm writing this review. And yes, I mopped up the entire bowl with the garlic naan without shame. The menu suggests the thinner naan for this dish, but DON'T DO IT. The thickness of the garlic naan is the way to go. 
Dishoom, why did I visit you on my last day?! I seriously wish I took more advantage of the Indian scene from the moment I arrived at the airport in London.",1
3,"Had lunch here. Adorable place which charges fair price. 
I ordered keema pao, which is Iranian starter comes with bread and spreading. The spreading is made of lamb and some veggies. Me and my boyfriend liked it a lot. It's a little too salty for me but my boyfriend feels it's okay. 
Also the lamb fried dumpling we had for starter. I liked it so much, unfortunately I forgot it's name on the menu.
We came in around 1:30pm and had waited for around 30 minutes for a seat there. The place is really popular. I had a Bombay colada with rum while waiting and I didn't like it because the syrup tastes too heavy. 
For entrées, my boyfriend had Lamb boti Kebab and it was too dry. 
I had Awadhi Lamb I liked it so much, the rice is so aromatic, and the lamb is well cooked. 
They dont serve naan bread complimentary, you need to order them separately.",-1
5,"Eat here now!!!! This place is out of this world good. We tried about 6 different dishes between the two of us and not one let us down. The service was great, the food spot on, and the location was really cool!",1
5,"We went here for a last-minute dinner while away on vacation. The restaurant is really lovely looking, the staff were beyond attentive, helpful, and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Without a reservation we were seated almost immediately. We loved the interior design, dim lighting, and excellent and quick service. I might recommend a reservation because it was packed! We got lucky. Very vegetarian friendly. Quick but excellent food and service - perfect meal experience.
Recommend: vegetable samosas and black house daal.",1
4,"The food( which I ordered Kejriwal) is nice, the service is extremely good. The server is so smiley and patient, one of the few best service I had in London.",1
5,"Ask for Sabina she's so cute and sweet, tell her the Arizona American girls sent you! Try Keema Pau, spicy lamb chops, black house Daal, chole Bhatura, mattar paneer... the chili chocolate dessert was delicious as well. I can't be more of a raving fan! Mama is the sweetest little chef, she promised to come to Arizona or California, fingers crossed. The best meal we've had in London!!!",1
4,"Good food. But very very bad service.  Bartender took a long time to take the order but never keyed it in.  Waiters name was Renate. Forgot three out of 7 ordered items.  No interest in customer 
Need to change staff.",1
5,"Another restaurant crossed off my list. 
Let's start with the restaurant itself: the place is superbe, with its copper bar and its room at the back with cosy armchairs and the fireplace. This is definitively a good place to wow someone. 
The food is as good as the place is beautiful. You know that feeling when eating indian that you just ate something really hot and spicy without actually being able to differentiate the tastes (is it chicken? I'm sure that's fish! Funny I thought I order vegetarian). Here is the complete opposite. Tasty dished where you can actually taste all the ingredients. The dished are tapas so it's best to take 2-3 each and share (it's so hard to choose that you will want to share anyway). For 4 people we ordered 8 dished, 2 rices and some naans. That was the perfect quantity for lunch. Why am I saying that because you'll want to keep space in your stomach for desert. The pinapple crumble smelled delicious and the caramel ice cream is just to kill for. 
Pricewise count £25-30 per head. A bit expensive but so worth it. (My colleague's wife - who's indian - said it was the only indian place worth going)",1
4,Not a fan of the Tikka roll BUT the seekh kabab was excellent as well as the plain naan and the chicken ruby.  if ordering the Chicken Ruby you must get the rice and naan.  its so yummy you have to have it both ways.  also. get the nimu pani.  a must.  overall a very nice lunch nd experience.,1
3,"I've been to Dishoom several times and the food is great. The problem is the wait staff. My waitress was fantastic, but I see a bunch of lazy people standing by the hostess counter. I waved someone over finally as my waitress was busy serving other tables and when he brought the check over I immediately put down my credit card yet he ignored me and walked away. He wasn't even doing anything but going back to chat it up with other colleague. Poor team collaboration means poor service to customers.",-1
5,"Great atmosphere, amazing staff and excellent food and drink. Highly recommended and I don't even like spicy food!",1
5,"Awesome ambiance and had a great waiter. The menu was very unique
The food was great! Nice and spicy. Some of the best Indian food I've had in a while!",1
4,"Another fantastic breakfast from Dishoom! 
The newest Dishoom on Carnaby Street has the same authentic (I actually have no idea but it feels it!) feel as the other branches. Some darker areas with moody yellow lighting along with a beautiful glass ceilinged area which is kitted out with sofas and a fire place making it feel like you've walked in to a retro flat. 
We went as a group of six and booked (did you know they take bookings for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!) a table just before breakfast service finishes at 11.45. 
Tbh I thought the service was a little slow and they weren't overly attentive but the food came out in a reasonable time so that's the main thing!
This time I opted for their house granola, fruit and yoghurt with fire toast, breakfast lassi and chocolate chai (just a small breakfast!). I've had the granola before and absolutely love it! It's full of nuts and sugary oats and the vanilla yoghurt and tasty fresh fruit that accompanies it is always the best quality. The fire toast was an impulse as I really wanted to try the pineapple and peppercorn jam and unfortunately the jam was a little disappointing. The toast itself is nice but would be even better with some bacon or egg (not that I could have fitted that in). Both drinks were very filling so be warned.... But also so worth it. The chocolate chai is such a treat and the lassi is so refreshing with a lovely oaty texture. 
Again getting the bill took a little while but overall a lovely breakfast out which is a little different to the usual pancakes or eggs benedict. 
P.s. On the way to the toilets you are able to see the chefs at work :)!",1
5,"Ahhhhh Dishoom! You have been a constant wonder for so long but finally I was able to taste your wonder and spice!
Yes, Dishoom is the top rated restaurant in London, yes it's rumoured to be fantastic but it's only when you actually try their fantastic food you realise why! 
We went for breakfast/brunch and just made it in time (breakfast finishes at 11:45 so don't be late). We were all giddy, even Dan who has been many a time! 
As I am still on my health kick so I opted for the omelette with a side of masala beans and mushrooms! The food arrived quickly and was presented and served on a large tray - perfect for taking some Yelpy photo shots! 
And what can I say, the food was fantastic. The omelette was cooked to perfection and probably the best I've ever had. It was spiced beautifully and there wasn't a bit without a hint of something wonderful. The beans were the standout for me though - they have a kick, that's for sure, but they complimented the omelette and it truly was a taste sensation! 
The mushrooms were good, nothing amazing, just large fresh grilled mushrooms. Still yummy.
The service, on point. The decor, a really bright and colourful array of shadows and shapes - exactly what I imagine an uptown restaurant in India to be like. I cannot fault this place and cannot wait to come back for dinner!",1
4,"Such good Indian food!  I didn't have big expectations for this place. Just thought it was a bit trendy and new and that's why it was popular, but boy was I wrong!  He fish (I forget the exact name) was excellent! Cooked very tender and seems to just melt in my mouth.  And forgive me but I forget the names of the dishes but there was a lamb and a chicken dish that we ordered that also were delicious.  I would come back here for sure!  
We were also greeted by the manger and after chatting with him we were given free vouchers for breakfast!  It's a shame we were heading back to America else we would have gone for sure.  The vouchers ended up going to some friends instead.
One complaint I had was the temperature of the place. Too hot!  I was sweating my bum off and on top of that, eating spicy food!?  Bad combo!",1
4,Great recomendation from a friend of mine. The food was really good. The food is very authentic. Great place for a nice dinner ! Its a ocassion to try a lot of new thing! Lots of appetiser i felt so full but a good full! I will probably come back soon! These just missing some bolliwood dance to bring the roof on firee!!!,1
4,One of the top Indian places in London. It's not as traditional as other top Indian restaurants and I really liked the slightly fusion style of the food. Fun atmosphere but somewhat loud.,1
5,"went for dinner, booked a month in advance, great cocktail selection, edwinda's affair (if i remember correctly) cocktail is the best",1
3,"I liked Dishoom. This is a 3.5 rather than a 3 but... I'm not sure I get all the rage this place seems to command. 
I think, for one, the unreal waiting time is so off putting that the food would have to be at least the best thing to happen to humans since sugar-free chocolate, but alas... it aint! 
I went with a party of 4 and we waited over an hour, and our food was good but average, and the waiters clearly overworked. 
Dunno... so many options in London, dont think I'd come back here. It's more of a mythical place than an actual culinary adventure.",-1
5,This place was a highlight of our honeymoon culinary experiences. So much so that we returned for seconds before returning to the US. Highly recommended. Get the okra.,1
4,We had to wait so long but they make it easy as they offer you a chai or brandy while you wait! Portions are small (at least compared to American) but food was very fresh and delicious. Bartenders were especially friendly and the servers were attentive. I liked their cocktail selection!,1
5,"I have eaten  Indian  food from LA to NYC and Dishoom   tops them all!
All I can say is...Heaven.",1
3,"Did not live up to the hype.
The amount of praise this place has gotten, and the many attempts I've made to get a table. Finally we were seated for lunch at the Carnaby branch.
The restaurant is beautiful, and is large enough to accommodate larger groups. There is a very calming and pleasant ambience. Service is good, although we waited a long time for the food, and the staff feel professional. Ordered extra naan just after receiving our mains, and it didn't arrive until we were nearly finished.
Off the extensive menu, we ordered the Mahi Tikka which was delicate and cooked well but nothing spectacular. The Chicken Ruby was a nice curry, with the chicken being moist and tender. But again, nothing that made us very excited.
We of course ordered a celebrated menu staple - the Black House Daal - which was rich and spicy. It was great to dip the Naan bread in.
The okra fries were very soggy and tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.
 
I do not want to write this place off yet, as I have heard great things about their brunch (which annoyingly ends at noon!). But I am yet to be convinced.",-1
5,Amazing!  This was my favorite restaurant in London.  There were 4 of us and we ordered about 9 dishes to share and we loved 8 of them.  The only one that wasn't amazing (in our opinion) was the minced lamb.  We also really enjoyed their cocktails.  The prices were reasonable and the restaurant has a really cool vibe.  I'd highly recommend dining here.  They don't accept reservations so come early if you can.  We arrived at 6 and didn't have to wait.,1
1,"Over an hour wait. Suffocating inside the restaurant it was very well close to 80 degrees inside. The hostesses were rude. The ambiance was loud. Poorly poorly poorly managed. Half of the tables were empty as we waited for ours. 
Now the good part. I'm kidding. The food was BEYOND disappointing. Both of our lamb entrees were a disgrace actually I can't even attest to the fact it was lamb. DO NOT waste your time or your money. 
#itsucked",-1
5,"Very Celiac friendly. I was impressed. A seperate menu and the GF dishes all come with an allergy flag in them, so you know they didn't forget. And the food was very very good.",1
4,I always love to eat Indian food while visiting London. Dishoom has reasonable prices with lively atmosphere full of families. The dishes are delicious and I love anything vindaloo or curry. I'm totally addicted to their lamb samosas. The portions are good sized and service is excellent. We enjoyed our meal here.,1
5,"We had an amazing breakfast here.  My husband loved the Kejriwal (eggs on toast) and I loved the egg naan roll.  I also really enjoyed the side of beans, they were super flavorful.  
I also highly recommend the chocolate chai.",1
5,Beautiful place on Regent Street. Worth the wait even in this rainy weather. Quality and ambience is top notch. One of the must experience stops in London,1
5,Dishroom is a fabulous restaurant - there are some fantastic dishes and we had excellent service. Definitely worth a visit.,1
5,"Some restaurants just have it all. Branding, atmosphere, value and quality of the food- all unite to create an unparalleled dining experience. Sometimes it's because of authenticity, sometimes it's expertise in one style of dish, but then there are some restaurants are constantly pleasurable, no matter what the dish or what time of day. Dishoom exemplifies this perfectly- their take on Indian cuisine is contemporary, hybrid and fun. Purists might sneer, but what comes out of the kitchen is fresh, vibrant and flavoursome. And although their brunch naan rolls are genuinely worth trekking across town for, their standard menu is just as satisfying. The food speaks for itself, but the environs and service at Dishoom truly never disappoint- and this is true across all of their London branches. 
The newest addition to the Dishoom franchise recently opened in Carnaby, offering a fuel stop that straddles Oxford Street and Soho. I visited with a group and we squeezed in just before the 11:45 brunch cut-off time on a Saturday morning. Staff greeted me immediately with friendly banter and I was taken through the bar to our cozy booth. The restaurant is spread across two levels- the main floor is open, spacious and there's ample seating that spills out into a veranda area. Here, diners sit an airy space, underneath a skylight and encircled by retro fittings. Electric fireplace, mahogany touches and that brown/orange colour combination that was hallmark of the 60s, this level of attention to detail is perhaps Dishoom's most endearing element.
The entire restaurant is designed to emulate a Bombay café circa 1968 and this is achieved right down to the minutia- it's so seamlessly accomplished that it doesn't feel kitschy. Everything is casual and the continuous din of other tables makes Dishoom a buzzy hotspot- and then you get to the menu. My staple is the egg naan roll and masala beans, which I immediately settled upon given our time constraint. 
As always, it was perfectly rendered: a warm, pillowy naan bread made to order in the open kitchen downstairs- it came filled with two oozing fried eggs, freshly chopped coriander and an indulgent lashing of soft, creamy cheese. It's paired with a tomato chili jam- which is a worthy of its own praise- balancing savoury with sweetness and singing with a fistful of chewy naan. The masala beans are always stewed to perfection, a tangy and complex side to mop up with gummy fingers after naan has been dunked into the sticky jam. This is the apex of brunch and has never disappointed.
Every dish ordered in our group seemed to provoke envy- from the house granola, an aesthetic feat with wholesome oats, chopped nuts and bursting with ripe fruit, a hearty dollop of yogurt and a fat drizzle of golden honey- to the Big Bombay, a smorgasbord of breakfast fare with an Indian twist. One diner was compelled to order a second dish after eyeing up my naan roll, which was cheerfully organised despite the fact that the kitchen had moved on to the standard menu. 
The food at Dishoom Carnaby won't disappoint those who frequent other Dishoom branches. The service was in line with what I've come to expect and the décor, ambiance and experience also lived up to my lofty expectations. Servers are occasionally bouncing between tables and need to be flagged down, but their good humour never wanes.
Provided that Dishoom can continue to replicate this winning formula, I'm happy to see more of the franchise around London. After all, they are both killer and naan roll filler- so the faster I can locate a Dishoom in a bleary weekend haze, the better.",1
5,The tikka fish is melt in your mouth good and full of flavor. The dal is rich and creamy. Loved the Pimms cocktail.,1
3,"Tasty Indian food, but not worth the 1+ hour wait. Also the food is extremely over priced for what it is. Portions are small.  My Chicken Ruby was really good and well prepared but I maybe got 4 pieces of chicken with my meal.  It's also ridiculous that they charge you for every piece of naan as well as for rice. Neither of those things are very costly and normally come with an Indian dish.",-1
5,"Woah. 
Let me start off with the decor because it's absolutely exquisite. I felt as though I was transported into Mumbai in the 70s, or should I say Bombay...
The little ceiling fans, the sepia photos on the wall and the steel tumblers for our water were the type of details that made the whole interior perfect. 
The menu is unique and they have your standard fare but also more typical bombay snack foods like pav bhaji and chole bhatura which is really exciting. Their romali roti is a must try - light and really a unique treat. 
The service is wonderful and we had a bit of a wait but the hostess was sweet and even gave us a small glass of chai as we waited. I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes!",1
5,"This place is a hidden gem that you absolutely must go to the next time you're in Oxford Circus. Very hip interior, try to get a table near the veranda in the back. Don't order as much as the waiters tell you unless you're really hungry or with a bunch of football players. The calamari breading was delicious and seasoned well. Our favorite was the Lamb Carnaby Special that had just the right amount of spiciness. The Mutgh Malai (chicken) was tender and mouth watering. Vegetable samosa come in a group of three which was perfect for our group. Overall, an excellent restaurant for lunch or dinner anytime.",1
5,"One of the most interesting Indian meals I have had, and by interesting I still mean good.  To take advantage of Dishoom, ordered several small plates with a colleague.  Started with three snacks, all good.  Far Far, which were almost like prawn crackers but a different shape, were nice, particularly with chutneys.  Okra fries were great, not overly fried but very tender and perfectly cooked.  And you definitely need to order Pau Bhaji, mashed vegetables you eat on accompanying buns.
For the mains, the sali boti, the chef's special lamb dish, is definitely worth ordering.  Great sauce and flavorful lamb.  Black house daal is a great lentil dish.  Paneer tikka was great, grilled chunks of paneer cheese.  And i was pleasantly surprised with Murgh Malai, a chicken dish with big tender pieces of chicken recommended by our server.
A great and interesting Indian meal.",1
5,"So we waited an hour and 15 minutes to get in.  It was well worth it.   Made some friends while waiting in line.  Overall, the food was fabulous and moderately priced.  The lamb special was amazing.  More important was how good the service was.  We had a waiter (Joe) who is Scottish.  Joe was just fantastic as he provided various recommendations that was spot on.  Even more, at the end of the meal, we asked how the chutney was made and he was able to provide us some insights which was great.  I doubt we will ever come close to making it but the fact he went out of his way to help, was very much appreciated.  Definitely coming back when I'm back in London.",1
5,"As someone who was born and raised in Mumbai, I've always learned to settle for what is mediocre Indian food in the Western world. My experience at Dishoom, was, however, amazing! This is an authentic attempt to replicate the Mumbai cafes, and their bustling environments, with graffiti in Hindi and all, without the ugly water and smog stains. For the Hindi readers, and for English ones, there is plenty of wall entertainment in the form of humor and memorabilia that all will appreciate while you wait, or sip a cocktail. The cocktail menu has done an amazing job of replicating Indian flavors, and even bringing in versions of non-alcoholic Indian street drinks such as Kala-khatta into London, without the associated pathogen borne illnesses typically acquired by Westerners consuming them in India.
The menu is creative and does everything from replicate typical Mumbai street food (again without the risk of catching typhoid) to fusion dishes that very cleverly bring out the flavors and tastes of Mumbai.
This is a must visit in London for anyone that enjoys Indian food, and anyone who wants to safely immerse themselves into a taste of Mumbai without needed to get all the needed vaccinations and buying a plane ticket! The only downside is that the place is so good, and so utterly popular, that it is at times very hard to get a reservation, and the weekend brunch and evening dinner lines can extend deep into the street. Waiting in them, however, will not yield disappointment!",1
5,Best place to enjoy Indian food with a bit of twist! Portions are just right too; gives you enough room to try variety of dishes!,1
2,"Good food, tasty but service is horrible.  I waited 15 minutes to place my order.  After I finished, it took 20 minutes to get my bill and then anther 10 minutes for them to come over to process my card; hire more staff!  
I had the bacon naan which was glazed with sugar and very good, albeit a fairly small portion.  The house chai is good too but, again, on the small side and a bit too sweet for my taste.
Only make a visit if you're willing to wait 45 minutes at your table.  Personally for me, it's not worth the lull waiting and poor service.  They also add-on a 12.5% service charge...",-1
5,"Perfect place to bring your date or a friend! 
Drinks are reasonably priced
Tikka masala is delish!
The line is worth the wait. Everyone goes through it don't worry",1
5,"Went to London on a business trip and thank goodness for that or I wouldn't have stepped foot in here. I could never comfortably afford eating here on my own budget (let's just say.. last personal trip here, we ate sainsbury's £3 meal combos every day). My very-well-traveled coworker said we need to go to Dishoom. ""Best Indian food outside of india."" I said ok!
They take reservations only for parties of 6+ for dinner. Too bad, we didn't have that many people. So came here on a Wednesday night around 6PM to see how our luck turned out. Ended up waiting for 45 min for table for 2. They gave us hot chai while we waited!
Appetizer: Lamb samosa
Main: chicken tikka, lamb briyani, black daal, cheese naan
Drink: mango and fennel lassi
Dessert: chocolate pudding and cinnamon ice cream (normally comes with chili ice cream but the waitress allowed me to swap for cinnamon :))
Verdict: Coworker was 1000% right. Best Indian food I've ever eaten hands down. And as a New Yorker self-proclaimed foodie, one of my favorites meals I've ever had in life. That's right, I'll say it! I would spend my own money to eat here again.
Everything was amazing. Service was amazing. Atmosphere was very cozy and modern Indian-esque. Yes it's pricey but I think it's a very good option for some splurging! Worth the wait and maybe even meeting up with some strangers to get your table count to 6 for reservations! ;D",1
5,"If you are visiting London, you must visit Dishoom. Non-tourist-y and a local favorite.The food is authentic and perfectly prepared.  Ask the waiter for advice in ordering, they will not steer you wrong.  Arrive early to avoid the line. I recommend getting a drink from the head bartender Fabio.",1
4,"I love Dishoom. I've been to all four of them now and I still don't have a favourite! But they're great! 
For breakfast I've had the sausage in naan and the full breakfast. Both were delicious and filling! I also really like the carrot and ginger juice and an added bonus is that the chai is refillable for free! 
For dinner I think I've had most of the menu - a particular highlight being the Sali Boti and the Murgh masala chicken. The meat in both the dishes were so tender and tasty, literally melted in my mouth when I ate it!
The service is always great and the atmosphere and decor are exquisite! Love it!",1
5,So good!  Really enjoyed all the dishes and the cocktails.  A must dine spot when in London.,1
5,"Wonderful Restaurant. We had the chicken ruby, samosas, super yummy!!! Great. Service. Seemed like a really popular place. The Dishoom IPA was really good as well. Would definitely recommend!",1
5,"It was a very simple equation: good service + nice table + great selection of dishes= excellent dinner.
We literally ordered almost all the menu as we wanted to try everything.  The choice is large but you will always find something that you will like.
Personally, as I already been to dishoom twice before, my ultimate favourite is still the black dal dish but the chicken kebabs are a must. I also have an obsession over the Rose and Cardamom lassi that compliments so well all the spicy food we had.
I really appreciated how helpful was the wait staff and that they could accommodate us without reservation. It is also  noticeable that when you order food at Dishoom, you get your food quite quickly which is always a good point.",1
5,"We went to the restaurant but it was full and there was a two hour waiting queue of people in a line. 
We called to make a reservation the next day but they didn't had available seats before next week. 
We just popped by at 16:00, at was lucky to get a table because we came very early. 
It was worth waiting for. The food is very good in decent portions easy to share. Some are very spicy but you can see that in the menu before you order. The waiter is also very helpful. 
A place to visit again",1
5,"Unlimited Chai, the best breakfast in London with a Bacon Naan Roll, and awesome decor.
What's not to love? Seriously good. I prefer breakfast/brunch here than dinner but chilli squid and some specials are good also.
I'm not sure I can think of many places with as much charm, humour and ultimately; identity that I've been too. DIshoom seems to be effortlessly cool whilst being elegant and casual at the same time. I like most of their food, but I love the interiors of their Bombay Cafés even more. 
There are 'rules' of the house and an authentic jukebox filled with proper indian tunes that can be played (apparantly).",1
5,"What can I say, this place is worth the hype!! Been here twice on my trips to London, and highly recommend. Most recently, I came for dinner on a Friday night, and Dishoom was packed. However, the restaurant is pretty large, and we had only about a 20 minute wait before we were seated. We grabbed some drinks at the bar, where the bartender recommended some great drinks that had an Indian twist to them - saffron, mint, etc. Definitely try them out - even if they sound questionable, Dishoom really knows what they're doing. 
I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well - they've done a great job recreating the 1960s Bombay cafes. Theres a cute lil story on the menu - read it! and then read the rest of the menu, because there are SO many delicious options, it'll take a while to pick. A unique dish that I haven't seen at other Indian restaurants was the Roomali Roll, which was great for a light dinner. Full of flavor and spices, I almost wanted another one! I love paneer, and this dish had a nice soft roti wrapping the delicious paneer. 
Overall, just a great restaurant, and as I write this review, I almost wish I could go back to Dishoom for dinner tonight! Definitely go check it out and eat some great Indian food in London!",1
5,"Amazing! We came here for a friend's birthday and she was more than pleased with her dinner. They were friendly and accommodating, we even arrived 30 minutes before our reservation and were seated early. The food is amazing, I would recommend getting dishes to pass so that you can try everything. Don't skip the dessert!",1
5,There was a wait but it was worth it!! The place have this business yet casual laidback atmosphere. My girlfriends and I enjoyed the food and loved the service there. Would go back on my next visit back to London :),1
4,"Great place! W
e had a lovely lunch and it was perfect also for the kids of our friends.
Careful and polite staff and good food",1
5,"YUMYUMYUM. Dishoom's been on my radar since it received the honour of being the highest-rated business in the UK on here and I finally managed to convince the bf to come here! He'd been avoiding Indian food after a bad experience he had, but had been slowly getting back round to enjoying it. And he certainly enjoyed it too!
We knew we'd probably have to wait for a table as every time we'd passed the restaurant it was busy both inside and outside, but it was totally worth the wait! We got to sit in the bar area with a Kingfisher beer while we waited too, so it didn't even seem like that long at all.
The restaurant has a really cool, retro 60s vibe as it was inspired by cafes in Bombay (when it was still known as Bombay) in the 60s. It seems pretty laid back and so, while it could technically be classed as a fine-dining experience, it's definitely not stuffy. The staff were really friendly and knowledgeable when I asked about spice level. Despite the Chicken Ruby sounding seriously awesome, I wimped out and went for the Murgh Malai as it was marked (M) for mild. I have no regrets about this whatsoever though, as the Murgh Malai was amazing. Loads of flavours going on, the chicken was seriously tender and I had to slow myself down eating it cause I was stuffing it in my face! Mr Debs let me try his lamb kebab and it was tasty as well. The basmati rice and roti we shared were a nice accompaniment, the three chutneys we got were tasty as well, although the chilli one was pretty hot! (I tried it as a dare, the spice was punishment for me and Mr Debs' immaturity level and my own idiocy haha.) The mint and coriander chutney was by far my fave!
And now for dessert! I ordered the chocolate pudding after being advised by our server that they could swap the chilli ice cream for cinnamon (smart move, Dishoom) and it was lovely. Velvety smooth, indulgently chocolatey and the cinnamon ice cream was fab! I also got to try the bf's strawberry Memsahib's Mess and it was yummy as well - it tasted really fresh and the slight rose flavouring made it a really delicate dish.
They're opening in Edinburgh fairly soon and I actually cannot wait!!!",1
5,"This is a very good Indian restaurant. Every dish we had was excellent. The service was good, and the food came pretty quickly. Most places have good food and okay dessert but Dishoom's dessert was just as amazing as their food. I would definitely recommend the chicken ruby, the masala prawns, and the vegetable samosas. Even my kids who don't particularly like vegetables ate the samosas. If you want to kick the pepper up a bit get the chili on the side. Their naans are also a  delicious side to get with your meal.",1
4,"I didn't care to queue for 1.5 hours to dine here because it is new and it is Dishoom! The offer of 50% off the food bill is also very appealing. Upon queuing outside, I drank 3 complimentary chais - happy me! then we waited inside at the bar for some time. The place was very busy and is large. More dinners can be seated in the conservatory.
We were shown to our table for 3 and we promptly ordered some starters; prawns, calamari, lamb chops and chicken tikka. The chicken tikka was served luke warm and we informed our waitress whom offered to rectify the situation. We understand that during the soft launch week, there are going to be hiccups, which is why they offer 50% off the food. We also were served the chicken ruby wam and informed the waitress. From then on, the manager wanted to ensure we personally received piping hot food and replaced the chicken ruby for us.
We enjoyed some new dishes only available on the Carnaby menu, such at the Chole Bhatura and the Sali Boti. I really enjoyed the Sali Boti as I liked the crunch of the sali crisp-chips with the tender lamb in gravy.
We left in a food comma and were unable to find room for dessert. During the soft launch, the take away option is not available (for the obvious reason) The Manager did not charge us for some of the items due to the food not being served hot. This is why I love Dishoom - they always put the customer first and take pride in customer service.",1
4,"Really good Indian food! Food is worthy of 5 stars for sure however I'm taking one off for the rather slow service and these fact you have to queue up outside, rather than them just taking your number so you can go for a drink and return when table is ready.
It's a bit different to your normal London Indians so you won't see the usual jalfrezis and tikka masalas on the menu but everything we tried was so good! My favourite dish was the chicken ruby, one of the best curries I've had and went really well with the garlic naan. Would highly recommend this place!",1
5,BEST INDIAN FOOD IVE EVER HAD!  Been looking for a comparable spot in LA and haven't matched it yet.  Black Dahl is AMAZING!!  We basically said 'what do we not want to leave without trying?' And the staff did not disappoint!!  Can't wait to go back when I visit London next!!,1
5,"Outstanding Indian food in London.  Cool, hip, trendy.  Absolutely loved the variety and dish melted in our mouth. Now that I'm back in the states I'm still salivating at the memory of our fabulous meal.  Hands down the cheese naan was the best naan I have ever had.  Make reservations in advance if you can.  It's quite busy.",1
5,"This is the best Indian food I've ever had! We arrived late and walked right in but were pressured to order as their kitchen was closing. Everything we ordered was well flavored, not too greasy, and delicious: lamb samosas, chicken tikka, some lamb special, basmati rice, and chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. We loved their orange chili sauce! I can't wait to visit London again, and I can't wait to come back to this restaurant!",1
5,"Dishroom Carnaby in Kingly Street delivers great, bold flavours in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, just as you would expect if you have ever been to one of their other branches before.
I know Dishroom for quite some time already, yet I had only managed to go there once since moving to London five years ago. Finally, when walking around Kingly Street in Soho before Christmas, I decided to have a quick dinner at the latest Dishroom restaurant.
The place is huge, much bigger than it looks from the outside. The interior is cleverly designed with different rooms with distinct colours and features. Overall, Dishroom Carnaby is a modern, colourful restaurant hat blends a classy style of tables, chairs and couches with modern elements and bit of fun. I was sitting in the room where mirrors mimic windows. I really liked the tone of the light, and the window-mirrors added something oddly comforting  and weird to the atmosphere. 
I was warmly welcomed, and then after a very short wait, a lovely girl quickly showed me my table. Staff are really friendly, one waiter in particular was very professional and funny. However, at times there was a bit of a wait until I got the attention of the staff around me. 
What surprised my was how quickly my food arrived. After a brief conversation with my waiter, I ordered a lamb samosa. It was a palatable parcel that I enhanced slightly in flavour with the various chutneys. Without a question, following my waiter's recommendation was a great start to my dinner.
As main, I went for the Carnaby special, Sali Boti. While I am not always the biggest fan of lamb, this dish was a triumph. The meat was tasty and tender, the sauce was a beautifully rich gravy and there were also different textures that made the plate more interesting to eat. The pancake-thin buttered roomali roti bread on the side was perfect to finish off the sauce. 
I decided to add a rose and cardamom lassi and also a tap water. The lassi was surprisingly nice and great to balance the slightly spicy food.
This was a brilliant and delicious dinner, and I did not have to think much about what I wanted, as all the plates and drinks were recommended by the funny and knowledgeable waiter. 
For dessert, I treated myself go the Dishroom Chocolate Pudding. I must admit, I thought it was an absurdly spicy warm chocolate, but it was also absolutely delicious. The strong chocolate taste in combination with the spicyness confused me a little bit, but I did indulge in it and the ice cream also complemented the chocolate well.
To sum it up, my dinner was quick and very tasty. I enjoyed every minute at Dishroom Carnaby, the only detail that did begin to annoy me more and more was the background music...",1
4,"Went for brunch during a recent trip to London as I have heard so many great things about Dishoom. First of all, the décor is like stepping in to a fairy tale. The bottomless chai is the only way to go in the morning (stronger than most I have had but so good!) and although the portions are small, they are very filling. I am looking forward to going back for dinner on my next trip!",1
3,"This is the 4th Dishoom to have recently opened near Carnaby street.  Dined here during the soft launch with somebody who had never been to any of the Dishoom branches and was keen to finally try the much hyped place.  We did not need to queue as we arrived around 9pm after peak time.  The service was incredibly slow we initially ordered some starters at the bar, 50 minutes later we were still waiting for the food to be served at our table, clearly this is unacceptable even during a soft opening so management deducted the cost of the starters from the bill.
The food when it finally arrived was disappointing, the fish tikka was cold, the calamari and prawn starters lacked flavour.  The falooda dessert was served sprinkled with pistachios despite our request for nuts to be left out due to a nut allergy.  My dining companion was unimpressed with our meal at Dishoom, when asked would they return to any branch of Dishoom the response was a definitely not!
The only thing worth returning to Dishoom for is the breakfast bacon and egg naan with chilli jam and the drinks selection at the bigger branch in Kings Cross.  There are too many other options around the soho area to waste time having a full meal at Dishoom.",-1
5,"The black lentil daal is one of the best foods I've ever had. Generous portions, good atmosphere and service. Also very.yummy food and smoothies. Now if only the queues were shorter",1
5,"I could wax poetic about this place. It has the old Bombay charm and the food has been consistently good. I've been here on most of my visits to London. The gunpowder potatoes, okra crisps, pav vada, paneer-mango salad, choke bhature are all to DIE for. For the meat eaters, the beri chicken biryani, lamb chops and lamb boti kababs are highly recommended. 
But their dessert is the best of everything. Start with the rose flavored Memsahibs mess, a delightful rendition of the Eton mess. Also the pineapple-pepper crumble just melts in your mouth. We also had a bowl of the Kashmiri chilli ice cream and it was the perfect end to the meal. 
This place makes me immensely happy.",1
5,Oh so so good! My teacher's assistant during my study abroad trip to London told me that my London trip would not be complete without coming to this restaurant. Completely agree with her! Amazing food! Be wary of what you are ordering because some do have 'a kick' but it's such a great place.,1
4,"Dishoom offers wonderful modern Indian with a twist.  The decor in the front was not as nice as the King's Cross branch; we should have checked the back room.  The service was very quick and attentive, and the food was flavourful and tasty.
Vegetable Samosas were crispy and spicy, Bhel had a good mixture of different textures and flavours, Dihsoom Calamari was tender, but Prawn Koliwada was nothing special.  Chicken & Pomegranate Salad was very fresh, full of flavour, and definitely my favourite.  Sali Boti was exquisite and came with two pieces of wonderful Roomali Roti.  The tender chunks of lamb were slow-cooked with lots of spices and herbs, and the gravy was aromatic and buttery.  House Black Daal was again creamy (dairy) and flavourful.  Chole Bhatura was pleasant, but we didn't like the fried bread at all.  Awadhi Lamb was perfumed with cardamom, was buttery/milky and contained tender chunks of lamb.
The prices were very reasonable and the service was friendly and efficient.  The best place to enjoy a romantic Indian in town.",1
4,"This is the best Indian food I had so far in London,  and the service was impeccable, servers are prompt, really good  food as well,  the Mango lassi is a meal by itself.",1
3,"Food and ambience is one of the best but there is bit of arrogance in the staff. This is what happens when the owner are not actively involved. We had bad experience of hospitality with one of their manager Dylan. We felt as if she doesn't care as the restaurant is already very busy. 
Good food and ambience is short lived but not the experience. I will never go again.",-1
5,"The food here was so, so good. I happened to arrive as breakfast was ending, so I had to sit and wait for lunch to begin. That wasn't great, but the waiter gave me a snack (puffy chips, which were great!) as I waited. The restaurant itself was beautiful, and the wait staff was very nice. It gets really crowded on weekdays for lunch. I ordered naan and the red curry. The food was INCREDIBLE. Highly recommend!",1
5,"Dear Yelp.  Thank you!  From the authentic, off the menu cocktails to the amazing food and servers.  We have a new go-to in SoHo.",1
4,"I came here without a reservation on a Sunday evening. I don't recommend walking in. The wait was not unbearably long, but the bar and restaurant were very crowded. Had their take on an Old Fashioned while I waited, and it was killer - partially due to the bay leaf/green tea reduction they mix in. 
Once seated, service was excellent and shockingly fast considering how busy they were. After ordering, I couldn't have waited more than 12-15 minutes for my food. I ordered the chicken tikka, which was very different than the traditional chicken tikka masala (and the menu was clear on this point). It was a dry seasoning rather than a sauce, a bit spicier. Still very good, though I thought the portions were a bit light for the price. I didn't fall in love with this place, but I enjoyed my food.",1
5,"I love this place. I was in the London/Luton area for 7 days and I found myself at Dishoom on 4 occasions.
Alessandra. She is just amazing. Not only did she provide me with an endless palette of delicious cocktails, but she was so welcoming. I would be lying if I said I didn't go back to see her. She was so pleasant to converse with and it made traveling alone for business feel a lot more like a vacation.
As for the food... you really can't go wrong. I made it here for brunch on a Friday morning, as well as dinner on 3 other occasions. The Murgh Malai and the Lamb Boti Kabab came as recommendations by the service staff. Fantastic. So perfectly seasoned and cooked to the perfect tenderness.
I would go back here in a heartbeat.",1
5,"Potentially the best Indian food I've ever had.
Fun atmosphere and ambiance, attentive service - just make sure you get there before 6pm to put your name down because otherwise they make you queue outside before you can even put your name in! We put our names in around 5:45pm on a Saturday and were seated in about an hour. 
We ordered:
- Veg samosas - very small, so great to start. All 3 chutneys were excellent.
- Vada pau - Didn't need the bun it was served on, but the potato pancake inside was delicoius
- 2 orders of Chicken Ruby - it was so good we got a second order after we were already stuffed! 
- Chicken tikka - flavorful, tender, juicy. Oustanding.
- Sheekh kabab - we originally ordered the lamb boti kabab but the meat was so tough and inedible we had to swap it out. They were very gracious about it. The sheekh kabab was a much better option. 
- Black house daal - Pretty tasty, but honestly I recommend getting 2 orders of chicken ruby and skipping the daal.
- Bowl of greens - literally a small bowl of tasty greens with some sauce so you can pretend to be healthy.
- Lamb curry that was served with roti - really good, but again, the chicken ruby was the star.
Highly recommend!",1
5,"Unbelievable!!!! So amazing!! Best Indian food ever!! We came because of yelp and we waited for 30 minutes, sat outside, and food was just amazing!!Jatin served us and he explained everything to us and made recommendations, of which we followed. The place was cranking busy, but we felt like we had individual treatment! Would definitely come back!",1
4,"This place made me feel nostalgic, bringing back memories of childhood and home. 
I find it really hard to find delicious Indian food, so I was so looking forward to coming to Dishoom. After all, it's one of London's top rated cuisines and had seen Dishoom recommended multiple times.
I had the Pau Bhaji, Black House Daal, Roomali Roti, and House Chai. These are all house and signature specials and rightfully so. The Pau is buttered like my mom would and the bhaji makes my mouth water thinking about it. The black house daal is so savory and perfectly paired with the handkerchief thin roti. House Chai was perfect as well as I'm someone that usually scoffs at people who think they've had chai... This place warmed my heart and brought back some great travel and home memories. 
The only reason for the lack of 5 stars is that I was seated in the underground room and came alone, so the ambiance was lacking for me.",1
4,"The best Indian restaurant in Soho. Every dish we tried was excellent. The waiter suggested a few dishes that sounded interesting. We wound up trying all of them and cleaned our plates. They don't take reservations, just wait in the que. We went on a Sunday dinner time & waited an hour for a table. Generally I would have left but for once my patience paid off!",1
4,"Plenty of reviews already but for anyone who is familiar with the Cheesecake Factory in the US, Dishoom for me is like the Indian restaurant equivalent. Delicious food, consistency, good service and heavily themed restaurants with a queue out of the door.
I'm not a fan of waiting around when I'm hungry (it makes me grumpy) but we came for an early dinner and were seated straight away. Previously we queued for the Covent Garden branch when it first opened and attempted to go to the Shoreditch branch but decided against after the woman at the desk gave us a withering look and told us it would be a two hour wait.
You know it's a heavily tourist visited place when the waiter starts to explain to us what a samosa is. Yes, we know already thanks, as does anyone who lives in the UK.
Overall a good reco. You could probably choose anything on the finely tuned menu. Nothing scary or too spicy or weird so it's very safe but very satisfying and the prices are reasonable.
The interior is great too with a retro themed vibe and nice casual, bustling feel.",1
4,"Delicious & definitely worth the wait if you're in London. We arrived at about 5PM on a Saturday and waited about an hour. Luckily, this restaurant has ample bar space so we were out of the cold & able to grab drinks within 5-10 minutes. Their Bombay colada is really good but super low alcohol. They have a Dishoom IPA in bottles, very hoppy but delicious & worth a try. No draft beers, is this a london thing?
For Appetizers: Okra fries- do it if you're a fan but they're just like any other okra fries. Nothing to write home about. Skip the samosas - they're just average. 
This location's special was the Sali Boti - a lamb curry - it's really flavorful and good. 
The dhal is really, really excellent. I'm not a huge dhal fan but I wanted to lick the bowl clean. Definitely order it.
We also had the Chicken Ruby which is your basic butter chicken - absolutely to die for!
Get the roti over the naan - you can get naan anywhere, the roti is super soft & just good. I wish I had got the roti's
Not many great dessert options so we skipped it.
Service throughout is great from the host staff whom are friendly, the bartenders whom are lively & the waiters who are hard pressed for time but don't rush you when you are dining. 
Rule of thumb - indian food is simply just better in England so you can't fail.",1
5,"As a long-time fan of Dishoom, I was very excited to hear they'd opened a new branch. They're expanding at a fair pace right now, and it's impressive to see the quality is just as high in their newer spots. 
Came here with some Yelpers for a brunch treat and ordered a fair amount of food between us. Everything was top-notch and I was particularly impressed with the naan and cheesy toast. None of the flavours are overwhelming and the chocolate chai is yummy - though it could be more chocolatey for my taste! 
Friendly staff, comfy booths and a stellar location. Still top of my London list!",1
5,"AMAZING!!!  Food is great! Highly recommended for anyone. They have kid menus and they have entertainment for kid while they wait for food. The wait to get a seat is totally worth it, it is no longer than an hour usually. Waiters are great!",1
4,"Great place to go when with company or for a special occasion. Decors lovely and food is equally nice. Don't take advise from the waiters on what they recommend as I did that twice and absolutely hated their choice. Their 'pau bahji' is undoubtably one the best in town. They should just serve that as a main. It's a thick saucey' type of vegetable curry with a hint of lemon which you dip the soft bread into. Their biryani is gorgeous. They can serve up mocktails for all Muslims even though it's not on the menu and considering the foods halal. Priced a bit high but given the location (behind Regent Streets Hamleys), it's not a total surprise.",1
3,"During a 20 min wait outside the restaurant, we were offered a cup of hot masala chai ( and Sherry). The lady outside the front door was completely rude and lacked the basic ethos of customer empathy.  We understand that the  restaurant has created and maintains a buzz but they need to be aware at the end of the day they need to treat their customers right. 
The wait is quite stretched, still lesser than the branch at Convent Garden. After entering we were informed since we were  initially advised a 45 min wait and we had waited for only 20 mins we would have to wait for the remaining 25 mins and were given a buzzer and shown the bar. 
Apart from the above, it was an overall nice experience.
We ordered two cocktails the Bombay Manhattan and the Old Viceroy's and a mocktail called the Kala Kattah Sharbat. The drinks were nice and the bartender was extremely friendly and chatty. I must say the cocktails were pricey approximately £10/drink.
After about 25 mins we were escorted to our table. And we ordered Bhel, Prawn koliwada, Channa Batura, Spicy Lamb Chops (which was very greasy and fatty), Paneer Tikka, Awadhi Lamb Biryani (which had a slight sweetness and not a lot of flavour of the spices) and Vada Pav. The food was good. This was the first time I have ever been served biryani without any accomplishments like raita (a yogurt dish with tomatoes and onions) or gravy. Lack of it left the biryani feeling very dry. 
As we left the restaurant around 9pm the crowd reduced and there was hardly any waiting time. So if you want to eat here and do not want to wait in a long queue either get there before 6pm or after 9pm. I personally prefer their Kings Cross Branch.",-1
5,"Sunday breakfast was good choice in cold weather. We start with "" house chai"" which was tea with milk, ginger, pepper I guess that makes you feel warm. The bread they make in basement v.soft. We had scramble egg with chilli/coriander and red beans. The house tea was free refill !
The waiters recommended to us to try their lunch next visit. We had a coupon, if we collect 5 stamps we will get free breakfast",1
4,"This place is really great if you're in the mood for some Indian food that is a bit fresher than your typical curry. This place prides itself in having original Indian food but concentrates on the grilled variety, with fresh ingredients delicious and great drinks!
The atmosphere is something that I really love because it is light, quite modern but very cozy. I have to say it is a nice change from the typical 'tacky' decor of many Indian restaurants. The music is really good as well, and you are able to buy the CD! 
The service is great and the staff friendly, but since you cannot reserve a table, there is usually a huge line in the evenings especially on the weekends so be prepared to wait a while- but they care for you so much that they offer you Indian lemonade while you wait! 
Definetly recommend the gunpowder potatoes!",1
5,"Dishoom is unbelievable. The staff was super friendly, it had a great atmosphere. The decor reminded me of ""the wonder years"" 1970s vibe clashed with modern day hipsters. I had a spicy chicken curry that was excellent and their cheese naan was a great compliment. My only regret is that in didn't take any pictures because I knew the food was so great I just couldn't wait to dig in! I can't wait to go again next time I'm in London.",1
3,"Great place for a business brunch although dinner is absolutely difficult to get in. I like the Covent Garden location more because it truly evokes the Irani restaurant feel. Back in the day, post colonial India and especially in Bombay, Iranian immigrants to India would setup and run these cafes with amazing food and atmosphere. Dishoom Covent Garden is throw-back to this. The Carnaby St. one is a more chic. I think the food is quite good and a moddish take on Indian staples not found in most Indian restaurants, and is reasonably priced. Would highly recommend this.
Get the bun-maska with masala chai. Its the best version of bread, butter and tea on this planet.
And if you are a foodie, watch this video on Irani Cafes for a nostalgic trip down memory lane

5,"Really enjoyed this restaurant. Came to London for vacation and was told that I must try Indian food and this was really a great meal. Love the favors of all the dishes. Restaurant decor was 70's, there was something interesting to see in each direction. They have a shelf in the center of one room with old photos and books, giving it a real homey feel. We had the paneer, rice, okra chips, calamari cheese nan and prawns. It was a blast of favors in my mouth, enjoyed every bite. Although Indian food is quite heavy the plates aren't huge so you can certainly try a few things.",1
3,"It's a good place for an introduction to semi-authentic Indian food. The haleem is my favourite dish, and possibly the only thing I would go back for.",-1
3,"Came here for lunch with high expectations. I must say this place is overhyped and the food is good but not superb. We ordered the fried calamari and lamb special and murgh malai (chicken thigh) with garlic and plain naan. The fried calamari was quite special with a kind of sweet and sour sauce. Lamb curry was pretty average. Chicken was tender and better than expected. The naan was however, quite disappointing. It was overcooked which made it crispy. The more disappointing part is that all of the naan and the roti that came with the lamb curry was all lukewarm and not hot. Feels like they have been out for 15 min or so. All in all food was ok, price was reasonable, attentive server and food came on quickly too, but definitely would not queue two hours for it like many have. We went during lunch on sunday without booking for 3 people, and only had to wait for 10 minutes.",-1
4,"This place is packed. My friend and I came here one day and it was over an hr wait time for 2 people so we decided to come back another day. We tried making reservations but they were booked. So we went back the next day with another friend, and the wait was just the same. Since the line waiting outside was significantly shorter we decided to put our names down. We were able to get inside and just chill at the bar there. We finally got seated at a small round table, but not the most convenient area. It was where the bus boys and waiters would cash out checks. We tried the chicken tikka, garlic naan, lamb briyani, and paneer tikka. Overall, food was really good and the price wasn't too bad.",1
5,"I was a little skeptical going to an Indian resteraunt because I usually do not like Indian food. However, Dishoom completely changed my opinion about Indian food. The food is absolutely delicious and ever plate we had was to die for. Every dish was unique and had very different tastes. I went for lunch and did not have to wait. The room was beautiful and our server tried very hard to make our experience good.",1
5,"This was our favorite restaurant during our trip to London. The food was phenomenal, the waiter helped with suggestions and combinations (though suggested more than we needed), and even offered a free raita side to help soothe our tongues from the heat of an unexpectedly spicy dish. It's an extra plus that it's a charitable restaurant as well.",1
3,The food is okay. The nanns andcurries are not as good as what I expected. But the service is good and the decoration is really funny.,-1
5,"I think I've had the best Indian food I've ever had here. 
Food - Everything is good and meant for sharing, so order a bunch to try. The portions are actual quite large. They sounds like tapas, but is more like Chinese family style portions. The dishes are all flavorful and the meats are tender.
Drinks - The cocktails are amazing. They have interesting concoctions inspired by Indian flavors and are just divine.",1
5,"Best indian food we've ever had. We had the house black daal, awadhi lamb biryani, the calamari, the prawn, and mattar paneer. I would recommend all of them very much!!",1
5,"Very good for the price! There is always a line and shuttle everyone down to the bar, but the drinks are delicious. The food is tapas style and provides some really lovely Indian food. Definitely want to go back.",1
4,"This place is great as all dishooms are. 
Helpful tips- Get the bollybellini and make a reservation for 6+ people ahead of time. For parties less than 6 get there when dinner time for the restaurant starts to avoid waiting in the que :) as far as food everything is so good",1
5,"Atmosphere: 5 - probably one of our favorite places during our London stay. Very chill - the waiting protocol is sound and it works! They served us tea and munchies while we waited.
Food: 5 - Amazingggg The drinks were nice and strong - I had the Viceroy's Old-fashioned which was delicious. We also had the Bau Bhaji, Dishoom Calamari, Paneer Tikka and Chicken Ruby with a few sides of naan. Everything was perfect but my favorite was the calamari -- cooked perfectly, didn't even have room for dessert :(
Service: 4.5 - Quite slow but I was pretty sure our server was training and we also had nice drinks to hold us over so it was alright. Otherwise the manager (?) made his rounds and asked us how we were doing which is always nice. 
Overall: 4.8 - Highly recommended. Very cool part of London - heard the breakfast was amazing as well.",1
4,Best Chicken Tikka Masala (they call it chicken ruby)  I've had in my life.  Service was super slow and a bit inattentive but food is outstanding.,1
5,"Absolutely amazing!  1 hour and 15 minute wait, outside...which they clearly warned us.  They served Chai Tea while waiting.  Service was great, and this Food was absolutely delicious!  My favorite the Chicken Ruby.  The best Indian food I have ever tasted, in a cool setting with great people!!",1
5,"Was told that we HAD to go here for a meal ... 
WOW   talk about glad I as dragged along 
the decor is fab   the food is even better .. 
our table of 4 most likely ate a weeks worth of calories at one sitting from so many dishes we lost track of who ordered what lol
please do yourself a favor  ,. eat here and bring an appetite 
you can thank me later",1
5,"OMG this place is awesome. Greatest service I have had in a long time. Amazing specialty drinks Chai Mojito, 1948 Sour and others,  gotta try them. 
Menu should be sampled like tapas; get something from each section. We followed the advice of our waiter and loved it all.
Great prices to for everything",1
2,"Considering the wait, I expected a much better dining experience. I love mango lassi and the one I ordered tasted like something out of a can. The black lentil daal the specialty of the house was very bland and uninteresting. We also the Jack fruit biryani which I did not like. The vegetable samosas tasted like something from the frozen microwave section at the grocery store. They were not crispy at all and tasted reheated. The garlic naan was fine but very small portions. Given the reputation from other reviews I expected much more, especially given the price.",-1
5,"Amazing food and service. We waited for around an hour and a half but it was worth it! Chicken ruby, chicken tikka, veg samosas, garlic naan, black daal - highly recommend all of these!",1
5,"Everytime I eat here, I find a new reason to love it.  So now this is edit 4 to this review.  Reasons why I love Dishoom:
1.  Black House Daal:  seriously the best lentils you'll EVER feast on.  I can eat a whole portion myself.  I crave these and keep coming back for more!
2.  Mattar Paneer:  How can they do this dish so perfect?  I just don't get it!  This is always my go-to dish at an Indian restaurant, and it's always delicious.  But Dishoom really takes it up a notch!  
3.  Their cocktails:  They have a really fun cocktail menu, and I've never been disappointed.  The worst is when you get a £10 cocktail and can't even taste the booze...well at Dishoom, you don't need to worry about that :)  
4.  Breakfast:  Yes I said it - Indian breakfast!  Their KEJRIWAL is to die for.  Try it - you won't be sad. 
5.  MEMSAHIB'S MESS:  Don't ask questions.  Just order.  But don't plan on sharing it.  Keep it to yourself
6.  I've now tried everything on their menu (yes I have), and I have zero complaints.  
Make a booking to avoid a long queue!  Their portions are a bit bigger than a ""tapas"" sharing portion, so don't feel like you need 3-4 dishes/person!",1
5,"I got back from London a week ago and I am still thinking about this restaurant...
Dishoom was one of the most delightful dining experiences I have ever had!  
The food, service, price, atmosphere...everything about this restaurant is great and I can't wait to go back when I am in London again.
Menu:
*Pau Bhaji
*Lamb Boti Kabab
*Chicken Ruby
*Black House Daal
*Roomali Roti
*Biryani
*Raita
Drink:
*Mango&Fennel Lassi
We arrived at Dishoom around 6pm on Sunday evening with no reservation.  The hostesses were able to accommodate us without any problem and sat us at a table for two in the front section of the restaurant.  (On their website, Dishoom states they leave room available for walk-ins so when I was unable to get through to them via phone I felt assured that we could get a table without having a reservation.)
Our server was excellent and gave us great recommendations while pointing out Dishoom's signature dishes.  We ordered a bit more than we could handle but I didn't want to miss out on anything.  My favorite combination was the Biryani with the Raita.
One of the managers came by our table to make sure we were enjoying everything. I told him we were leaving in the morning and would be sure to visit again for their breakfast.  After we spoke he came by our table again and offered us 2 free vouchers for breakfast!  So lovely!  On top of that...I asked him about the nice smell in the restaurant and was curious what kind of incense they were burning.  He told me he would find out...he arrived at our table with an entire box of incense and gave it to me as a gift!  SO LOVELY!!!  I was genuinely moved by his generosity and for going out of his way to make us feel so welcome. 
Dishoom's atmosphere is vibrant, cool and comfortable.  The open kitchen downstairs invites guests to view the energy and skills that go in to the food and adds an element of excitement to the dining experience.  The back rooms of Dishoom are stunning.  The fireplace and couches are the focal point of the area and give off a ""cafe"" feeling of ease, comfort and community.
I do not know when my next trip to London will be....but I do know that Dishoom will be a part of it.",1
5,"This is the latest restaurant to be opened by the Dishoom chain and it is so nice inside! I'm not sure if it was just me but I felt transported to the 70's. The gold and brown décor and the lounge feel they have carefully constructed makes for a really nice cool atmosphere. While there are a lot of tables you never feel closed in or claustrophobic and the music is pretty good there too. 
We went shortly after it had officially launched, around 6pm on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get a table right away. When we left around 7:30pm the queues were massive so please keep this in mind if you want to go there for dinner. They will allow you to book tables for parties of 6+ but anything less than that then you might be in for a wait. The bar is good and the cocktails they serve are delicious but this is definitely not the place to come if you're in a rush. 
We definitely ordered too much food but they were lovely enough to pack some of the things we had left into takeaway containers for us. I would especially recommend the chicken ruby curry, the cheese naan and also the biriyani. All of the food we had was delicious, the only thing I wasn't too fussed on was the daal but that might just be my personal taste. 
Service wise it's a bit of a mixed bag as while everyone is very professional and friendly, they are always really busy so getting your bill, paying the bill etc can sometimes take a little while. If you're not in a rush then this wont be a problem but can get a little annoying if you have places to go afterwards. 
If I could eat here everyday then I would as price wise it's reasonable and the food is consistently delicious.",1
4,"Great Indian food! I usually go there for lunch and dinner for the curry, naan, and other larger, sharing dishes. Decided to try breakfast this time - got the omelette and naan wrap - and it was good",1
5,"Great place to eat! I took my parents from Japan there and they loved it! I've been here multiple times throughout my uni. The dahl makhni is to die for, and they also have a pretty decent salad. If it's your first time, try the biriyani and get a cocktail!",1
5,"This was far and away the best meal I've had in London.  The atmosphere is absolutely perfect for dinner, the bar menu is creative and wide ranging, the staff is extremely friendly and attentive, the music is spectacular,and finally the food was 100% perfection. My dinner companion and I wanted for nothing, and when we said we had to leave by a certain time, they had our food wrapped and bill paid immediately. I would eat here twice a week and it will be a reason I come back to London.",1
5,"Lovely dining experience.
Food is great, atmospheres is friendly, young people will like it even better.
Indian cuisine at is finest (at least from a north american point of view)",1
5,"The food and the service were excellent. We ate with our two children (ages 11 and 15). They enjoyed it as much as we did. The Chicken Ruby, a curry, was delicious. We also enjoyed the spicy lamb chops. For dessert, try the chocolate pudding. They can make it with chili pepper or cinnamon. All I can say about it is yum!
Most dishes on the menu are a la carte, so you mix and match to put together the combination you like. Our server was helpful as we were not familiar with the menu items. We would definitely eat there again!",1
3,"I had found this place due to a recommendation online. It was a very nice atmosphere. However, the food was expensive for no reason. I had ordered the chicken tikka masala. It came out unexpectedly without sauce. In ordered to get rice or bread you had to pay extra. Honestly it was adequate Indian food but in London there is no need to eat Indian food adequately.",-1
5,This is a must go spot. Food is amazing. Unlike anything you have had before. We started with the chili cheese toasts which were phenomenal. Cheesy with a little heat on perfectly toasted bread. We had two lamb dishes each of which were perfectly spiced and prepared. The mango paneer salad was unusual and refreshing. You must go!!!,1
5,"It's a moment like this that leads to many upon many stories.   I came in here with two local friends, based on a recommendation.   Seeing that there was a long wait, I knew we didn't do wrong.   Our server was spot on with recommendations and everything else we could want.   In fact, he should probably be promoted.  We kept ordering drink after drink after dish after dessert.   Everything we had was splendid!",1
5,One of the best Indian places I ever had! The chicken ruby with garlic naans was delicious!! Yum yum,1
5,"This was the last meal we had in London before heading home and I must say it was the best meal as well. The flavors deviate a bit from traditional flavors one might expect but they are done in a really great way.  
We had two orders of the Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Chicken Ruby and of course the cheese naan.  Our server was nice and super friendly.
There was a bit of a wait, but it's managed quite well.  They try to seat you in the bar area and get you set up with drinks straight away.  We had to wait outside a bit but they brought us out warm chai to drink while waiting which wasn't for very long.
We'll be back here next time we're in town.",1
4,"The food was good, but not exceptional from an Indian palate perspective. Overall the place balances well on service, price and ambience. I think their best dish is Kaali daal. Their biryani, both veggie and Chicken were mediocre. The chicken tikka definitely hit the spot. Unfortunately the beer was not very cold :(",1
5,Always a pleasure coming to Dishoom. And breakfast/brunch is always the best.,1
5,"Pretty cool vibe. Tasty food. And great service! Was in town and I randomly went into this place for dinner. Could be great for date night or just having dinner out. Either way, great spot!",1
5,"This place is amazing, however, due to this it gets pretty busy/crazy.  The service is good but at times it gets nuts so take it in stride as your drink may take a few minutes...well worth the wait!!!",1
5,"Worth the wait, which is passed easily by sitting outside enjoying a cocktail or two! We ordered the fried okra, calamari, shrimp app, and vegetable samosas. We couldn't get over the tastes of all the food. Then we moved on to the chicken ruby, which was full of flavor and delight.  The naan and the roti was a good paring. We also ordered the lamb boti, mixed greens, corn on the cob. We loved the chicken ruby and ordered it  two more times because we eat a lot and we really enjoyed the tastes of ginger, tomatoes, coriander, cilantro, cumin.... you can taste all of that in there so delicious!!!",1
4,"Fun and spicy Indian restaurant and bar. Firecracker shrimp and shrimp masala were amazing, but rest of meal and service was great. Fun lively bar scene too, mid-Soho. Great value",1
4,"I'd never visited Dishoom before a friend suggested moving our scheduled lunch here, as they had just opened. It was good, indeed we came back the next morning for bacon-and-egg naans, which is something I'd happily do again (perhaps once the light mornings of Spring roll around, London is far too grey far too often in Winter at 8am - and those crisp, bright mornings should be spend wandering around a park instead).
The food is 'upmarket' Indian which is great, but without stretching to haute cuisine I find it hard to see how 'good' the dishes can be, particularly when you still can find a layer of oil on the top. That being said, there was a nice selection of mains.
However, the breakfast naan is to die for. It is perhaps my top-rated single item breakfast in London, such a good mix of flavours and textures that I'm not sure exactly how to relate it to you. If the menu description of fresh naan ""graced with a little cream cheese, chilli tomato jam and fresh herbs, and wrapped around one of these first-rate fillings"" sounds at all appetising to you, then please do check it out. The chai is milky and sweet (perhaps a touch so for my tastes), and coffee acceptable but not stand-out.
Perhaps my main issue is one of expectation, with Dishoom being touted as the best thing since sliced naan, which it unfortunately wasn't. I very much appreciate the decor, the smells wafting up from the kitchen and the smokey incense - perhaps these will draw me back here, or to another Dishoom, in the near future to sample further.",1
4,"Totally worth the hour and a half wait. Dishoom has a great bar selection to start off with, and the sharing-style food plates are perfect for two or an entire family. Definitely some of the best Indian food I've had!",1
5,Very different from Indian food stateside. I'm not saying it wasn't good. It was. Just different. More trendy I guess. There were only 2 Indian beers on the menu whereas in Los Angeles you usually have a choice of 5 or more. But the food at this Dishoom in Soho was very very good - just not what we're used to. Cheers!,1
4,"Indian food is a must do while visiting London.  With so many amazing reviews, I wanted to give it a shot.  We stopped by around 7 and the wait was 1.5 hours!  We had to stay in line outside and couldn't leave to wander around.  It's hard to resist since there are numerous bars nearby.  The staff is really friendly and they even serve complimentary tea while waiting.  Once inside, you're handed a pager and you wait some more.  The bar is busy and drinks are good.  Once seated, the food comes out fast!  The flavors were as expected and all delicious.  The only thing I found odd was the rice was basic steamed basmati rice.  This is different than what I'm typically used to in the US with spices that make Indian restaurant rice so delicious.  Anyways, I'm not familiar with the other Indian places in London as I'm sure there are many good ones.  But, this was really good... but not sure worth the 1.5 hours wait.",1
5,"My husband and I really liked Dishoom at Carnaby. We had lunch rather than dinner to eschew the lines. We were very thrilled with both the service and foods. The waitress thoughtfully asked if we had food allergy. We ordered house chai, which was refillable until 5pm. What not to love about this?! We had the pau bhaji, mahi and cheese naan. They all are tasty. We sat in the patio area, with cozy decorations. We highly recommend this place to any traveler!",1
4,Is it ridiculously expensive Indian street food? yes and sure you could go to Wembley and get the exact same thing for like 1/4 of the price. But does it stop from going? no. It is good food and great cocktails even if you are getting slightly mugged. Plus the funny advertisement in the women loos slightly cracks me up every time.,1
5,Delicious Indian fusion food in an adorable setting. Definitely try the okra fries and chocolate chai.,1
5,"Arguably my favorite Indian restaurant in the Western Hemisphere :). My baby brother recently started university in London and I helped him settle in. Dhishoom is just what we needed after a long day of shopping and unpacking! Waited an hour for a table, but fear not. Enjoyed a chilled wheat beer followed by a whisky sour made with real egg white by the bar. We were hungry so ordered the okra fries and calamari. Both were delicious and served with a variety of chutneys. Once we finally got a table, we settled for Romali Roti (very rare to find outside of india), seekh kebab, and saali mutton (similar to a mutton curry) Everything was spot on delicious :)! Our server was also friendly and I loved the atmosphere. Overall a memorable experience!",1
5,"Went here twice during recent trip it was so good.  Great atmosphere, better service and phenomenal food. My wife and I ate here for $80 (converted from GBP) and left food on the table. That included two alcoholic drinks too. Great value for western Soho.  I will warn that a lot of the food has some kick to it. Be sure to not necessarily trust the markings on the menu on spice. Talk to the waiter and they'll help. Lastly, order the bowl of greens. Good stuff.",1
5,"Got of the tube at Oxford Circus and did a search on Yelp for nearby Indian Restaurants. This restaurant came up and the reviews where good. Walked over and was told they had a bit of wait but they had a large bar area, where we could order drinks while we waited. The wait was not nearly as long as they quoted. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was fantastic, and the service was impeccable. Will definitely be returning the next time I am in London.",1
5,"Second time here and it's fast becoming a favorite. While there isn't much atmosphere to speak of, the decor is great (seventies chic) and staff are very nice and quick. the food though is the attraction (of course) and every dish is bursting with favour. You'd expect a place like this (and part of a ""chain"" - there are at least 2 or 3 others peppered throughout London) to serve dumbed down version of Indian food. In fact, quite the reverse with some very tasty interpretations or adaptations of Indian staples.. Definitely try the Chole Bhatura or the Sali Boti (the house daal is a must) and for drinks, go for the lassi. 
Enjoy",1
5,"From the moment I arrived, the service, environment, and overall experience was absolutely incredible! With a great variety of foods and drinks, I have to say that they definitely know what they're doing here! It is a must-try!",1
4,"I was not unsure what to expect, I certainly didn't expect to really like the food so much though!  I am not a huge fan of curries, so when people suggest going for an Indian, I'm quick to resist.  However, a friend really wanted to visit and I'm really glad we did.  I got the Murgh Malai and it was delicious!  We also tried Chicken Ruby (it was good, but not right for my taste buds).  The lamb samosas are really yummy (and I don't like lamb!) and the chilli cheese toast is just a bread with some cheese.  The Paneer roll is alright, but there are better dishes to try from.
Also tried the chicken biriyani - a bit spicy for my taste buds.  The chocolate dessert with cinnamon ice cream rather than chili ice cream is DIVINE!
Service can sometimes lag a bit - but overall a good experience and I would definitely go again!",1
5,"Tried this on a whim. So delicious. The garlic naan was fresh, the texture and baking perfect. They only serve one slice here which is appreciated. I ordered the chicken ruby, which was very tasty and spicy but not too spicy. The meat was tender, melt in your mouth. Would definitely return!",1
5,"Really phenomenal food, service and atmosphere.
Came here on a Saturday night at 8pm.  Wait was 1 hour 15 minutes.  We heard so many great things that we decided to wait.  There is a long line that forms down the street which you must wait in.  Then, after some time you are granted admission to the bar and given a pager, after which you receive your table.
Atmosphere is amazing.  Met some really fun people in line and the hostesses bring out chai, lemonade, and sherry to keep you going.
The food was for the most part spectacular.   At the bar we tried the mango and rose lassis, both were unique and flavorful.  We ordered the vada pau, bhel, and paneer roll appetizer.  The paneer roll and vada pau were fabulous, bhel was just ok.
For dinner we had the black daal with white rice and cheese naan.  All were exceptional.  
For dessert we tried the chocolate pudding based on our server's recommendation and it really wonderful.
So to sum up, totally worth the wait and some of the best Indian food I've had anywhere.  Solid 5 stars.",1
5,"Waited about 30 minutes at the bar for a table. Had a cocktail and okra fingers, oh my! Those were delish. For our main meal, we share the lamb special, black daal, mattar paneer, and marinated chicken thigh. Everything was wonderful. Especially the lamb. Dessert was naughty chocolate chai. We need to recreate that at home, it was so good. If I lived in London, I would be back often. As it is, I might need to stop again before we leave.",1
5,Everything about this place was wonderful. Our server Marius was great and all of his recommendations were on point. I highly recommend eating here or just coming for drinks. I could not be happier with the meal or service.,1
3,"I don't know what the fuss is about... This place is at most average. The naan was oversalted and burned, mahi masala lacked flavor, chicken tikka masala wasn't great (untrimmed fat on the chicken, not grilled all the way through and not flavorful), samosas were thick and too crispy. Chicken biryani was good but I honestly had better. Maybe this is the standard fare in the UK compared to the US but there are so many much better restaurants than this one! Look elsewhere",-1
5,"YUM!!  Came here with the family early on a Monday night, and only had a 15 minute wait.  All the items we got were delicious.  We started with the calamari and spicy prawns, both delicious.  For the main course we got the murgh malai for the kids, Mahi tikka, dishooom tikka and chicken ruby.  All accompanied by a couple orders of naan and rice.  The chicken ruby was our favorite.  All in all a fantastic meal, a bit pricey, but worth the splurge.  When we walked out we saw quite a line waiting to get in, glad we came before the rush.",1
5,Food to die for!! Plus great service gel the hostess to the waiter. I visited on a recommendation and I'm in food heaven!!,1
5,Great for brunch. The portion sizes are generous and the food is very tasty. Masala chai is good but not the best.,1
2,"Very average food. Appetizer was fried squid, very greasy, 0 taste. Paneer tikka was dry, should be juicy. Murgh malai was the best of all dishes but just ok. Naan was great too. 
Ambience is great and I liked the commander cocktail a lot. Food should really be better.",-1
5,"this place gets really busy but came highly recommended. I booked a reservation for a work lunch and was not disappointed. 
The waitress recommended that we order 2-3 items PER PERSON, which is crazy. We ordered 1 per person, plus raita as a side, and it was great.",1
4,"As soon as I stepped in, the atmosphere was so nice and the decor has a really nice theme and constant. It was like stepping back in time! The service was exceptional and quick, the waiter was so attentive and made sure we were always ok. I highly recommend their cocktails and chais, couldn't fault any of them and the food was all really nice. It was a shame they were out of the dessert I wanted but will just have to take another trip to try it.
Would definitely go again.",1
5,"Fantastic service, food, and setting. Staff were extremely helpful with recommendations etc!",1
5,"Fantastic food! The bar area was great as well. I had a martini with saffron gin. We had shrimp for appetizer, chicken for dinner along with rumali roti (the best I ever had...). For dessert, I had the pineapple with pepper and crust on top with warm pudding on side. I thought this dessert was very imaginative and showed a lot attention to detail to the food they served.",1
5,"Busy place but worth the wait. Got our name in right before they started the queue and still waited about an hour outside. Once we were seated we were greeted and ordered and the food started arriving quite quickly.  We had the lamb boti kabab, gunpowder potatoes, kachumber, and garlic naan.  Perfect amount of food for two people.  Can't wait to come back and try out other items on the menu!",1
5,This was some of the best Indian food I have had. The service was knowledgable and attentive to our concern for how spicy the food was. A big surprise for the kids was the kuhlfi dessert pops at the end - a must for s family night out!,1
5,"Amazing food, amazing service. I will probably come here at least once every time I visit London.
My favourite dishes were the black daal and the chole bhature. Do NOT miss out on these two, they are perfectly spiced, filling, and simmered for hours. Mmmmm.
Allergy note - I have severe allergies to nuts, peanuts, and shellfish, so I am very cautious when I travel and don't normally eat Indian. Am I ever glad I decided to go inside and ask! Not only is the menu almost completely free of nuts/peanuts (a few exceptions in deserts and I think one dish, but no oils, cashew milk, etc.) they are also very careful about marking down your allergies. When I came back for brunch, they even had a little toothpick that said ""allergy"" to mark my food :)",1
5,"Seriously amazing. The server asked about allergies before we placed an order. Our food came out with little flag toothpicks that read ""ALLERGY"" on them. The food was absolutely amazing. We started with veggie samosas and the bhindi fries. I had the black daal, steamed greens, and the Roomali roti. Yep, I ate it all. My boyfriend loved his chicken (he's from India so I feel like his vote may count more than mine). Everything tasted so fresh and full of flavor. Wonderful experience!",1
4,"The breakfast here is worth the wait...if there's a wait. Or, you could just make a booking (unless it's for dinner...unless you have 6 or more people...and you're patient). Either way, it's worth it. Naan rolls!",1
5,"Great.  Chicken tikka amazing, same with lamb house special and biryani.  Can't go wrong with anything here.  Get all three types of naan.   Going back this week.",1
4,"We were visiting from Canada and had to go here after hearing about it from coworkers and seeing Yelp reviews. Supposedly it is one of the best Indian restaurants in London, however, it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had. Nonetheless, it was very delicious and had a nice atmosphere.",1
5,"Good service (even waiting in line was enjoyable with chai tea and sherry). Every staff member was happy and helpful. Decor and vibe were comfortable, hip and unique. The food...hands down tasty and well done. I will be back London and dishoom!",1
5,"Great vibe, amazingly friendly staff and awesome food. Loved the lamb chops and salli boti. Appetizers are not shabby either. Overall...a must go if you are in London.",1
5,We were back this July and made a point of returning to Zuma. The food was still great.,1
4,"Zuma has maintained it's consistency in food quality through the years. It's delightful to be back, to witness the robata grill being fired to its full glory! Seafood and meats galore, grilled to perfection in a wonderfully delicate and exquisite taste! We had the black cod, amazing Chilean bass, baby chicken, king prawn, skewered meats, maki rolls and the juicy Iberico pork- everyone is just happy!",1
4,"The sushi and dishes here are spectacular. Black cod is a must and the soft shell crab sushi was amazing. Every sushi I ordered was just so deliciously and beautifully presented. One star down however - this was because I called in and asked if I can wear trainers. The staff on the phone suggested I do not wear them (so I switched to heels). Upon entering the restaurant, I saw a couple of men eating near the bar wearing trainers themselves!",1
2,"In short, over-rated.I apologize if I'm gong to be brutal here. 
So I have been told, that Zuma is amazing. Likewise, the way Zuma treats their customers, you'd think they have something to give.  So,  I was totally excited to dine.afterall I'm such a Japanese food freak, I was all set for this dinner! 
My husband and I arrived first,  he said that Zuma finally got our reservation in and they had us booked in a private room. That was really cool.  But since the rest of the party didn't get in yet, we decided to hang out at the bar. The place looked like any other modern Japanese Fusion restaurant you'd find in Vegas & New York, w/ an open kitchen concept to the diners the tables were set lower but it's inter-mingled with the bar.. making it look packed. To me, its more a mess.
Others may perceive it as cozy, & bustling. To me,  its just crowded & a total cluster! If you're claustrophobic,  avoid the place at peak hours. I got myself a non - alcoholic cocktail drink called Norisan, made of fresh mint, passion fruit,  pineapple, shaken w/ orange. But honestly, it's just orange juice w/ some crushed ice mixed w/ some crushed mint leaves. Lol. That's how it tasted to me. 
A couple of photo shoots here & there, our friends started arriving. The bars main focal point was the impressive display of different saki bottles.  You'd think that was the only alcoholic drink they serve. Lol.
When everybody finally assembled together,  we asked our host if our table was ready. They told us they'd check on it. 5mins passed, nothing.  15mins.nothing. So my husband decided to ask again.Now we are all thinking maybe they made a mistake in giving away our room to someone else. 
2 minutes after the second time my husband checked, we were lead to our private room. It had a nice wooden table. They handed each of us our own menus & we all decided to order & share it w/ everyone. We got Edamame, Miso Soup, Wagyu Beef, a Sashimi, Sushi & Maki Roll assortment, soft shelled crabs, eggplant salad, etc. Photos attached.
To me, the edamame, salad & miso soup should've been served first as they seem to be a first course dish & the rest would've been best served all at once.  But instead, they served them one at a time. With a crowd of 6, it was a bit awkward. Not for nothing,  it would've been ok if their servings were enough for 6, but when a dish comes out good for 1 or 2 people,  a restaurant should be thoughtful enough to think ahead.  But not Zuma I guess. The plates went from one side of the table back & forth. All of you can request them to do that next time you dine to avoid this. 
They offer you two types of water, still or gas.  We got both. My preference was still.The server was in a rush to kick us out towards the end of our meal that he poured seltzer into my glass which totally ruined my water. Extremely a huge faux pax!
My miso soup was ok. It tasted like a regular. Nothing exceptional.The Edamame were just medium sized. We get plumper Edamames in the US. The Wagyu Beef, I was excited to try,  but they were tasteless.  I'm wondering if they didn't season them for a reason except drizzled peppers on top of them? So not impressive.  I'm very particular w/ my steak. The only steak so far that impressed me the most came from Ruth's Chris & John Howies. Other than that, I make my own & my kids rather eat the steak I make than to eat outside at a restaurant. This steak was a fail. As for the Sushis & Makis, we are from the Pacific Northwest & we've traveled to far & wide where Sushis almost a staple.. conveyor belts of Sushis graze airports & restaurants like a fast food joint. I've tasted the best sushis in Washington & Japan. This one was just mediocre. But I can say the seafood they used was of exceptional quality.  That is commendable. But that does not say much of its flavors. Likewise, the eggplant salad, it was ok, but nothing memorable. It didn't leave anything in my palate wanting for more.  You have to put a zinger!
But there is one dish Zuma did right & tasted wonderful! That's the Soft shelled crab! It was perfectly fried, cut, soft, crusted & seasoned,  perfectly presented w/a side of lemon as it should be for every seafood, & a dipping sauce.  It reminded me of the flavors of the ocean w/ a hint of garlic & a touch of citrus,  totally satisfying in every bite. I would totally get just 2 orders of that & a bowl of rice & I'd be happy at Zuma. 
For what could've been $100 worth of a dinner in the US or at any Sushi place, we spent €350 w/c is equivalent to $485. So be prepared if you want to spend that much. If it is just to scratch off a bucket list, think twice.. I'd say totally NOT worth it. Explore the world,  there's better places to get better food out there,  you just have to discover it yourself.",-1
5,Cool / fancy place to have some great japanese food! Everything we ordered was delicious. Kinda pricy but worth it. Make a reservation.,1
4,"Excellent service, lovely ambiance and very lively. The quality of food is great. Love the outdoor sitting.",1
5,"This remains one of my fave restaurants ever and every time I come to London, I'm there. The service is top notch and the food is interesting and fresh. Whenever I'm in a city with Zuma, I'm happy but nothing is like the original experience.",1
5,"London is not exactly known for having great Japanese food (sushi especially), but Zuma really defies that idea. The atmosphere is sleek and stylish, with an open kitchen and contemporary decor. The employees cater to you as soon as you enter, with the welcoming hostesses quickly checking our many shopping bags. The great service only escalated as our waiter led us through the menu. We absolutely loved our meal! Each dish was innovative and delicious, with such unique flavors. The fish was so fresh and we found ourselves wondering how anyone could possibly think that London lacks a quality food scene. One of our personal favorite parts of the meal was the tempura popcorn- you've never had anything like it! Our experience at Zuma was truly memorable, and made for a wonderful first dinner in London.",1
5,"Strictly on food, our favourite meal of the trip. Stunning surroundings, too. It's tucked away behind a hotel. We enjoyed everything that we had but that didn't stop us from looking longingly at the plates moving passed us. Seating options include the cocktail bar, the grill bar and tables. Reservations are a must.",1
4,"Finally came here after a university friend had recommended this restaurant to me about 2 years ago. As I just found out Zuma is a sister restaurant of Roka, which is also really good - it is no surprise that they have quite high standards. As much as I love the food here I have to admit that the taste of tuna has changed over the years.. this might be an environmental problem but the fatty tuna here just does not taste like the one I have had in Japan. Either way, it was a very pleasant experience as I popped in during the holiday season without a reservation and still was able to get seated rightaway. I had the seared beef which I could highly recommend and the yellow tail sashimi which also was a delight! The lobster as a main, what else could a person ask for, the most satisfying low carb meal I have had in a very long time - happy new year folks!",1
4,"Fun, expensive. Fresh and well executed fish, pricey. Loud, boisterous, casual, and quality but high prices! A snack for two can set you back almost $200. But nice location.",1
5,"We tried our luck and came in without a reservation, we didn't book in advance but you know how it's,it's all about contacts, it's annoying but that's how it works be with the right people and you will get a table anywhere!
As usual service was great, delicious food, best restaurant in London!
Black cod, yellow tail the stars of the night, softshellcrab roll superb , great cocktails, Zuma always leaves you with that je ne sais quoi, always leaves you wanting more I'm coming back soon very soon ha :)",1
5,"Everyone about Zuma is 5 stars. Food is incredible. All of it. Recipes you never thought would be great (spinach and peanut butter) are amazing. Staff, service, location and atmosphere are just 5 stars. Amazing.",1
5,"I rarely give 5-star reviews. If there were 6 to give on Yelp, I'd give them that. 
It's that good.
We last Sunday night, & although we had tried to book a few weeks ago it was already full. I understand why now. The Hostess was lovely & accommodating, & offered to try to seat us at the sushi counter 45 mins later, & would come find us at the bar. That 'can do' & friendly attention to service permeated our evening: the bartenders were attentive, friendly, and so efficient that the replaced half-empty bowl of edamame was like a sleight of hand. And the bar was packed!
While waiting to be seated, I was perusing the insanely good collection of wines in their glass wall case, & as I was about to take a picture of some very rare Petrus, one of the staff came rushing up saying ""No, no sir!"", & then with a smile, opened the case & said ""you'll get a much better picture up close!"". Nice!
Five minutes later (after about 20 waiting), the hostess found us and sat us.  The Sommelier came over to talk to us (a charming young American with an excellent pairing knowledge), and helped us make a great choice (sadly, not the Petrus). Then, the food.  I can literally blather on for hours with food porn descriptions, so let me just say: if you just stick with the specialities (although its ALL unbelievable), you cannot go wrong. Get it all.
Zuma was a terrific experience! If you love great food & wine & want to be wowed by some, while being treated like royalty..go to Zuma.",1
5,I love this restaurant very much! This is one of my top places I go to in London. The food here is absolutely amazing and really do enjoy it with family!,1
5,"Well for starters, this place has absolutely amazing food, an upbeat ambiance of total excitement, lots of patrons having a great time either dining, lounging at and around the bar area or waiting for a table, and an insane number of employees all working feverishly hard to keep everyone happy. The patron mix is varied, younger, older, European, Arab, visitors and locals alike all seem to love Zuma.
     We've now been 4 nights in a row (without reservations) on our 5 night visit to London from Honolulu.  Got seated twice without a wait, but you'll want to make reservations. We ordered different dishes each night to see if it were just a few that were amazing.  All 15 dishes we tried had flavors that definitely rival the greatest restaurants around the world. You will not be disappointed. Sushi rivals Nobu & Morimoto even though the sushi portions seemed slightly smaller.  The fire grilled meat & seafood (Robata) are done perfectly every time. 
     If it's just two of you get a pair of the 15 seats that surround the grill and watch the cooks in action. You will be very impressed by the level of detail that goes into each dish. The menu is extensive, each dish is a unique creation of well paired flavors.  It was impressive watching the head chef check the temperature of each grilled entree and inspect every dish before releasing it. By far one of the best restaurants in London.",1
5,"Fantastic. It is hard to get a better restaurant than Zuma. Everything from start to finish was top notch, esp the service and the food. It certainly is an expensive dinner but worth it. The bar is also nice to have a few drinks at.",1
4,"Zuma is giving a good and reliable experience, prices are reasonable compared to other first class venues. We enjoyed the giant shrimp, the lamb and stakes, sushi and sashimi might be better.Ambiance is great but the service is not in the same level as the food and ambiance reception is not paying attention, waitress forgo to bring dishes and drinks ( apologized but no compensation. )In sum good but not excellent",1
1,"I'm japanese, so maybe my opinion is too hard. 
This restaurant is same like  FRIDAY EVERYDAY.
Foods are good and atmosphere are good , however never better than like a restaurant Wagamama, or normal franchises restaurant.
But if you want to eat Japanese dishes in huge cafeteria, here is the best place !",-1
1,"The food was very good; the wait staff was excellent.  The restaurant manager made the whole experience disappointing and overall 1 star - perhaps even 0 stars.  
To sum up the horrible experience - My wife and I stopped in about 6:45 PM on Tuesday with no reservation.  The receptionist indicated that they could seat us, but they needed the table back at 8:30 PM.  We indicated no problem.
We told the waiter that we had a time limit, he assured us there would be no problem.  This was our first time at Zuma, and he wanted to make sure we enjoyed the meal and the service.  He also indicated we would have time for dessert.  This was all true.  We finished our meal by 8:00 PM and finished dessert well before 8:30 PM.  We asked for the bill, but then waited.  After about 20 minutes, one of the restaurant managers came to our table and indicated that their 8:30 reservation had arrived - politely expediting us.  What it did was infuriate us.  Why didn't she coordinate with the wait staff?  We had asked for our bill but were waiting for it.
After paying for the meal, I requested to speak with the restaurant manager.  First the reception manager, Agnes Moravecz apologized.  She indicated that it was all a mistake.  She offered her business card and told us she would help us with any reservations in the future.  She handled it well.  
I asked to speak with the restaurant manager.  The woman who expedited us came by and told us she was one of the managers.  She didn't offer her name or business card.  She didn't really listen to our complaint nor did she seem to care at all.  I told her that she really put us off and she seemed to become quite defensive and literally pushed us out the door.
We will not be visiting this place again.  Further, we will spread the word about what rotten management they have.
If you are looking for excellent Japanese food nearby, try Kurobuta or Nobu.",-1
4,"For a sushi lover like me, I expect extremely good sushi if I know they're known for their sushi. The sushi at Zuma is good although my favourite at this place is their amazing popcorn! Don't know they prepare it, but I haven't tasted anything similar before! It's perfect as a little appetiser snack!",1
5,"This was my second visit to the acclaimed Japanese restaurant in Knightsbridge. 
There is a lot of energy to absorb, whether sitting at the tables or at the sushi bar, watching the art and science of the chefs, or being warmed by the robata. grill. 
I was by myself and was lucky enough to get a seat without to much of a wait, maybe because it was a Sunday evening
Of course you would expect excellent sushi and sashimi and you will not be 
disappointed.It
 is fresh and delicious as it is beautful to look at. I had the seared black cod wrapped in a leaf for my main and it was melt in your mouth wonderful. This is one place were you can really just take one slow bite at a time to savor the flavor. The other interesting thing here is the vast selections of sake, served warm or cold. The sake sommelier will help you match the right sake to your meal.
Finally, I will warn you this place in not inexpensive. While the atmosphere is casual and the dress is informal (but well heeled), the meal will soon add up. Also note that this is a favorite for athletes and celebrities, on my first visit the paparazzi were camped out front waiting for some footballers to leave.

4,"The food is delicious and so is the service, but there is something missing, I don't really know what. Maybe a cozier atmosphere.",1
5,"Brilliant Japanese cuisine with a great atmosphere and a fun bar with little need for reservation. 
Alternatively you can book to a private room where you get the amazing food complemented by a secluded room ideal for the family or a celebration of some sort.
Expensive food as to be expected in Knightsbridge area but the cost is met with brilliant tasting food.",1
3,"Good food. Good drinks. But if you prefer vegetarian options, skip this place. The Dubai Zuma has way better options.",-1
5,"It is not easy to get a reservation (by telephone only), so, don't give up. Also, I found it a little hard to find at first, located nearby Harrods, tucked away in a mostly residential city block. 
This is another brilliant restaurant space designed by Japanese interior designer, Takashi Sugimoto (a.k.a., 'Super Potato'). Brilliant gastronomy, service, and design equals Zen, and then some at Zuma. Without question, my favourite Japanese restaurant in London.",1
4,So yummy! The lobster sashimi was amazing! Atmosphere was really nice as well as some excellent service. Will recommend to everyone!,1
1,"Simple enough: just a social place. You pay great price but get just above average food in return. Not worth it, if u want have good Japanese food, don't go here. I spent 90£ on 3 crapy dishes (lobster miso soup, Wagyu beef dumpling, fried squid) and 1 dessert(flourless chocolate cake with pear and ice cream). The sashimi was the only thing actually taste ok here. Also, the service is not good at all (especially those girls at the entrance, do they know how to smile and welcome guest?)",-1
5,"Amazing Asian food.  Drinks are amazing, great vegetarian hot dishes and sushi. Also, a very fun place.",1
3,"Was super excited to try out this place on my visit to London. However, I was a bit disappointed when I got there. We were seated towards the very back facing a wall with an emergency exit. We asked if we can switch tables since there were 3 available tables in the front of the restaurant. Our waitress told us she would call the supervisor, but that never happened. She came back to us less than a minute later telling us that the tables have been taken up already, when clearly they were not. We did not get to enjoy the atmosphere of the place at all.. Also another thing that threw me off was that our waitress was speaking over our open bottle of water that we had ordered. She had stopped at another table before approaching ours and began speaking into the bottle as the cap was in her other hand. I honestly expected more from this place.",-1
5,"Wow! This place is hip and positively up beat! We got there at 10p on. Monday and the place is packed. Definitely make a reservation. We got in nevertheless but it was nail biting. We had the the skewers, some sashimi, some sea bass, seaweed salad, and off the menu dessert. All fantabulous! Great service from Ronan. Overall A+. We will definitely be back when we are in London. Our receptionist was accommodating ... I wanna give her a drink :-)",1
1,"This review is for the sushi and service at Zuma.  From reading other reviews, it's clear I should have ordered from the Robata grill.  Though, the service still leaves an incredible amount to be desired, considering the price point.
Let's start with the sushi.  At best, it's ""not bad.""  Typically, the sushi rice should be about room temperature to warm -- mine was cold, as if it had been in the fridge.  The fish should be chilled to cool, but mine was room temperature, as if it had been taken in and out of a cold area too many times in the evening that it was no longer cool or firm.  The botan ebi was mushy.  The toro was not marbled at all, and I'm confident at most places, they would simply call it tuna.  The sake (salmon) was ribbed and stringy. 
I also ordered soft shell crab.  It was good. Honestly, probably the best part of the meal, but the bar here is low. If you've had one fried softshell crab with a wasabi mayo, you've had them all.  They did not mess this up, and it was good. 
Now let's switch to the service -- three complaints -- 
1) The sushi bar was not full, is claimed to be first-come, first-serve, but they refused to seat me without making me wait for 30 minutes.  When they did seat me, they put us in two seats that had been empty the entire time I was at the cocktail bar.  I have no idea who they were saving them for since again, it's first-come, first-serve at the sushi bar. 
2) The waitress was very nice and took my order promptly, and the food came promptly, but it took multiple requests and a lot of waiting to get a bottle of still water. We were mostly through our softshell crab by the time a bottle of water finally arrived. I stopped short of going up to the cocktail bar to order my own.
3) At the end, the waitress brought the check, and had tacked on a ton of food and drinks I didn't order.  It was our check, but like it had been merged with someone else's.  When I pointed this out, she basically made me review my own check again, instead of realizing I hadn't ordered half the things on the bill.
In the end, go to Nobu if you want sushi. It's cheaper and the service and quality are substantially better, across repeat visits. I should come back and try the robata grill.  For the price (which is very expensive) and reputation of this place, none of the above should have happened or been tolerated.  One star.",-1
5,"Every time we attend Zuma, it's an amazing experience. We love the sesame and pepper steak, the sushi- you cannot go wrong, and the watermelon martini is the best in London. Make your reservation early, it's almost impossible to get a table without one. The ambiance is noisy on a weekend so when you make reservations for a romantic date, ask to be away from the and chefs area.",1
4,"Zuma is somewhat hidden, but it's reputation clearly makes up for it's out of the way location. The place was packed at 6pm!
I like the atmosphere and the food is delicious and aesthetically pleasing. I ordered the Asian Cooler Cocktail, by recommendation of the bartender, l and absolutely loved it. My only issue was my order of sweet potatoes. They were undercooked and didn't have much teriyaki sauce at all. But I tired my friend's beef and it was to die for so maybe one of the chefs was just having an off day in the kitchen.
I would recommend Zuma to anyone looking for delicious food in Knightsbridge.",1
5,"One of the best Japanese restaurants in London by far. Staff is amazing, food to die for, menu is innovative and classy, good wine list, good cocktails, great atmosphere.",1
5,We just went for a drink and bar food but food was wonderful and service was outstanding! It's non-alcohol but a drink called Bishonen was delightful!,1
3,"Somebody needs to say it, this sushi is way too expensive!!! The place is clean and beautiful, however the food is not that great compared to the price.",-1
5,"An unforgettable night was had here for a friend's ""hen do"". With her wedding approaching, we took her out for a girl's-only night of fun.
The food, service, drinks, everything  was absolutely incredible and impeccable. We were there for about 3.5 hours on a Wednesday night, and though the place was packed to the gills with people, not once did we feel rushed. We were allowed to sit and enjoy as long as we pleased, and were constantly looked after. No glass was left unfilled, no drink left empty, no dirty plates left to linger on the table. Every bite was a piece of heaven!
Absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend for a special night out or just to meet up with friends.",1
5,"My absolutely favourite! I love love Zuma. The atmosphere, the flavours everything about deserves 5 stars!",1
5,"One of my top 5 japanese restaurants in London.  It's expensive, but you totally get what you pay for. Generally need a reservation to eat here, they have private rooms (need 6 people to get one)  you feel like you have stepped into a fashion night club, quite noisy, low lighting, stunning decor and an upscale crowd.
The service was wonderful, pleasant and efficient even though it was a busy night, amazing wine & sake selection, the food was more than great,  chopped scallops with a wasabi dressing, the famous (Nobu's) Black Cod was excellent, Wagyu beef plate we had was absolutely tasty, juicy and most important, tender, the sashimi moriawase was standard + and the presentation totally top notch. 
Highly recommended",1
5,"This a bit out of the way place has just amazing Japanese food. The outside of the building was quite unappealing, but once you get into the restaurant you will see they did a nice job of decorating.
The food is fresh and everything tastes delicate and decadent at the same time. I have never have had a bad experience here in terms of food quality or service. I have only eaten in the main dining area - I have never eaten at the bar.
Favorite Food:
-Wagyu Beef
-Rock Shrimp
-Black Cod (this and Nobu's are my favorites)
-Edamame (they don't overcook or undercook it - just the right amount of crispiness)
-Sushi and maki - All of it. Seriously the freshest sushi I have ever had in London 
I would also recommend having someone make a reservation a little a head of time.  
Now that I think about it, I like this branch over the Zuma's in Istanbul and Dubai. The staff doesn't have the attitude I saw more of in the other branches. Ex: The Dubai branch charged us a ton for ordering chili sauce and chilli pepper flakes because, as they put it, anything else you put on the food would ruin the quality of it. I totally get and understand the concept, but they should have told us they would charge us a hefty amount... eh, to each their own I guess.",1
4,"The food here is really, really, stupidly good.  There was basically nothing we ordered that wasn't absolutely top-qaulity in presentation and taste:  the black cod was as good as everyone says, I am still thinking about the steak tartare (seriously, I'll be back just for that), the fish was all top-quality, and even the dessert (green tea banana cake) was special.  Next time I'm in London, I'll be back.
So why only four stars?  Because the service was worse than awful.  I've been there twice at the sushi bar, and both times (different) servers seemed really irritated to have to bring people food, take orders, get drinks, etc.  Both nights (with different people) we were forgotten about for stretches of time, and both nights there were really odd pacing issues with the meal that didn't seem attributable to the pace of food from the kitchen.
So, while this place is worth a trip--the food is that good--the service keeps it from being among the very best of the best.",1
3,"Honestly the food was better at Nobu. The king crab legs, one of my favorites, were lackluster. That said, the scene is better here. The cocktails were awesome though. The Hentou (sp?) Sour was amazing.",-1
5,"We were a party of 10 people, it was a Wednesday, and the joint was packed and in full swing. Our group didn't have to wait much to be seated (reserved for 7pm), and once we were there the army of attentive staff just kept it all coming with impressive efficiency.
Zuma is all about the 'family style' arrangement of food, and the host of our particular group did just that as he proceeded to order a large selection of dishes for everyone. Once the first platter arrived, it seemed to never end as we were brought plate after plate of beautifully presented and masterfully crafted seafood, fish, and meats. My glass never stayed more than half empty either which was comforting, as the sake (they have many to choose from) was a delight.
Since I didn't actually do the ordering I have no idea what the dishes are called but there were a few notable things you should look to try when you go.
-Chopped scallops with a wasabi dressing of some sort
-Black Cod (i'd heard of this in other reviews, and my god is it good)
-sweet corn tempura dish kind of looks like popcorn and is highly addictive.
-The sashimi is also top notch
The only thing that was slightly unpleasant was that we were effectively asked to make way for the next reservation toward the end. As far as I'm aware they give you some sort of warning beforehand about this, but after an enjoyable night with a hefty tab mounting it's not so nice to have to go stand at the crowded bar again when all you want to do is sit back a bit and carry on the conversation.
However, all that aside, Zuma was an experience I highly recommend and the food was really quite excellent. Go check it out.",1
3,"I know a lot of fellow Journalists love this place because of the diversity of food and - as the Lords who run my Journalistic Manor are kind when it comes to my expense account - I have eaten here on a number of occasions, but mainly because it appeals to the victim I have chosen to eat out with and pump for information. Therefore, working on the basis that the snitch is always right, until they spew out the goodies, I have been accommodating.
Would I choose to eat here by myself or with a friend? No!
Why? Well, to be very frank, the cuisine is not always constant. Whether the owners have a dose of 'Change the Chef often before he get's lazy' or whether that character is fickle, I have no idea. I haven't attempted to grill him to find out. I only take the bright lights to put in politicians eyes, besides, Chefs are usually already conditioned to heat.
I am presuming that the restaurant was named after Zuma Beach in Malibu, California and the owners have spent time there watching the Beach Babes and not enough time watching the staff - or perhaps too much time watching the staff nick the silver, because every time I have been there, I see new faces, but same type of menu. Which I should mention always looks superb on paper: asparagus tempura, crispy fried squid with green chilli, wagyu beef, black cod with miso, and sushi etc.
I am prepared to say, in defence of the place that anything that hasn't been well cooked is not usually my cup of Twinings, therefore, perhaps my comments could easily be put down to seeing too many people eat Sushi. Then again, being a person who likes consistency and good service, I do try to be objective. In that department I must say they really never came up to my standards. But, as I could say the same about Horror Films with giant crabs in them, you can swallow all my criticism with a light grain of salt.",-1
3,"Consider this half of a review. I didn't eat at Zuma so I can't tell you about the food or food service. 
But as a lounge it has a swank decor, plenty of space, low lighting and an upscale crowd. This is the kind of place where you dress to be seen and while you're at it, take a look around yourself. 
It's definitely a good place to go for a pre- or post-dinner drink, especially if you want a sophisticated feel and large beverage choice. Not for the weak-in-the-wallet types.",-1
5,"AMAZING SUSHI!! I was beginning to give up on sushi in London and this has redeemed my faith.  The sashimi small plates are INSANELY DELICIOUS!! The seaweed salad is some of the best I have ever had and even the tempura (which I only ordered because my friend wanted it) was unique and delicious! Our service was incredible, very helpful and great recommendations. I was there for lunch and can't wait to go back for dinner. A MUST try!",1
4,"I came at the ""wrong"" time on a Tuesday, I wanted to see the place while packed but I was shopping and decided to pop in for a quick glass of wine. I was still very pleasantly impressed. The doormen were also helpful while I looked for places during my monthly Knightsbridge visit. I will report back again on my second visit when I have time to experience the full ambiance.",1
4,Love this restaurant. The idea of it is pretty cool but as a first timer it was quite confusing that all the food comes at different times. The concept is that everything is shared which is very unique. The desserts are AMAZING. The chocolate fondue is the best i have ever had.,1
5,"Zuma opened in Knightsbridge in 2002. I was young(er) back then, but I knew amazing food when I tasted it. My opinion of Zuma has changed only slightly in the past decade, swayed by occasional visits here and there. Either the food has become even better, or my adult senses have developed more attuned receptors.
The restaurant bills itself as serving 'contemporary Japanese cuisine', but for some odd reason the place itself always reminds me of Africa. A weirdly jolting contrast to make, but for me that's a positive. The tables and chairs are all chunky light-coloured wood, the walls bear matching panels, there are green potted plants peppering the dining area and the base of the bar is formed from uncut stone, like an organic boulder of granite that grew naturally at the heart of Raphael Street. These rustic elements are juxtaposed with a lot of glass and the suave cosmopolitan clientele. It is hard to find a table here in the evenings, booking is definitely recommended, while at lunch time you may be asked to wait on busy days.
This was the case the other day, but we made it back to find the largest table in the place ready for the three of us. We weren't positioned in the main dining area, but from my seat I had a clear view of the kitchen, aromas and all.
We ordered the Crispy Fried Squid with Green Chili and Salt - hands down the best crispy fried squid I've ever had. Not only in taste and texture, but also in its consistent excellence (I always order it). The batter is light enough to taste the squid underneath and fine enough to form an irresistible crunch. The seasoning is sublime. It tasted so good but I was unsure about exactly which ingredient was doing all the flavoursome work. Upon asking the waiter, I was told that the fried squid is tossed with shichimi pepper, a Japanese mix of anything from red chilli pepper, Sichuan pepper, ground ginger, black and white sesame seeds and even roasted orange or Yuzu peel. A juicy squeeze of lime and I'm telling you it's perfect (we ordered a second round).
We also ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi in Ponzu Sauce with Crispy Garlic. The fish is soft and supple, while the flavours are strong and refreshing.
The Thinly Sliced Seabass with Yuzu, Truffle Oil and Salmon Roe was equally fantastic, with that distinctly appetising scent of truffle emanating from the plate as soon as it arrives to your table. Again, the fish is of the highest quality and so each piece melts in your mouth. Each slice is so delicate and dainty but altogether the dishes accumulate to ensure you are full in the nicest of ways.
An absolute favourite of mine is the Aubergine with Miso Paste, which probably pips Chutney Mary to the crown for best aubergine small dish in London. I will also definitely be re-ordering the new-ish Mackerel Roll wrapped in thin slices of cucumber for the delicacy and freshness of its ingredients. It's a roll without rice, which makes it lighter and more refined to taste, so that you really enjoy the soft mackerel meat and the contrasting crunch of the cucumber. It is served marinating in a dish of pickle juice, which adds a subtle tangy flavour. Such a fine and enjoyable dish.
Two other delicious rolls are the Dynamite Spider Roll and the Salmon and Avacado inside out roll. The former comes stuffed with tempura soft-shell crab and a dab of chilli mayonnaise on top, adding a luxury hint of creamy spice to the crispy interior - another must-have dish.
I haven't really come across a non must-have here, and I look forward to returning again and again over the next decade to sample even more of their dishes and try something from the Robata grill. Presentation, service, decor, food - it's all crème de la crème. Zuma is the place to go to for exquisite food and a buzzing ambiance. Expect to have to book, to pay the price for the quality, the name and the location - then nothing can disappoint you. Just enjoy.",1
2,This place is a bit pretentious and overpriced for the quality of food.  I remember being thoroughly disappointed by the food.  The place is great for the atmosphere and people watching.,-1
3,"Dear London: if this is the best Japanese you have to offer, New York totally owns you in this category (as well as some joints in California as well). That's not to say that the food wasn't good here - it was definitely above average - but given the exorbitant cost of food here in the UK, you have to live up to some pretty high standards to make the cut...and I've been to places in NYC that cost less than half of what I paid tonight that was a better overall epicurean experience than this was.
We did the omakase because...well, you figure you're going to get the best the restaurant has to offer. Courses often came out two at a time, which was nice because it meant we weren't waiting for the food to come out. The first two courses were very delicious - tuna tartare on a rice cracker and the sea bass in truffle oil. The former is something that is very simple but works well, as most of the tuna tartare I have had is plain. This was lightly seasoned and had very thin cuts of scallion with it, adding a nice little twist. The truffle oil on the sea bass was a revelation (it's not something I've had anywhere else); the mushroom-infused marinade worked very well on the sea bass, and the side of ikura worked well to add a touch of saltiness to the platter. The other fantastic dish was the tempura-style langoustine with a vinegar-based dipping sauce. Regular tempura is akin to beer battered fried food, but this was done very lightly instead, with the crispiness looking more like fuzzy threads coming off of it...but it works because it doesn't dominate the dish and allows for the langoustine's flavor to come through. The black cod wrapped in banana leaves (or was it lotus?) was done well for a fairly standard Asian dish; I liked the accompanying citrus dip that took the edge off the heavily baked-in miso marinade.
That said, I took issue with a couple of the main dishes that were served: the wagyu beef and (very unfortunately, since this is crucial to a good restaurant) the sushi/sashimi combo. I've had amazing beef at shabu-shabu and cooked over a stone, and that is delicious. This beef was clearly cooked as a full filet and then subsequently cut up...as such, instead of all of the pieces being a tender medium-rare, a quarter of them (towards the ends, and even some in the middle) were closer to medium-well and well-done - definitely not the aspired result. The accompanying sauces were banal - a standard sesame-soy dipping sauce and a mayo-based dipping sauce that didn't have that needed kick. The sushi was disappointing because we got all of 2(!) pieces, and one of them (the yellowtail) was probably the worst quality I've had at a high-end Japanese shop. The other (a piece of aburi sushi) was absolutely delicious, which makes me wonder why there's so much inconsistency. The sashimi was equally inconsistent: the semi-fatty tuna was very good, and the mackarel was on the better end of what I usually get in this fish, but the rest was unmemorable: the sea bass was way too chewy, the salmon didn't have that fresh buttery taste or deep flavor you get from the truly fresh stuff, and the grouper (with some kind of vinegar jam on top) was bland. Bland ain't grand; it's forgettable.
Dessert was a bit on the large side (six dishes served in a huge bowl of ice; Zuma does like serving lots of its dishes on ice) and was a microcosm of the inconsistency of the main course. The best was the chocolate lava cake filled with chocolate caramel; this was absolutely delicious, with the caramel adding a nice layer of flavor to a dish that is usually chocolate on top of (and inside of chocolate). The banana cake with regular caramel was also quite tasty, although it tasted a little too much like banana bread with caramel syrup added to it. The coconut pudding with fresh fruit was tasty, but the problem here is that the consistency of the pudding was different: it was quite thin (almost liquid-like) at the top, but quite a bit more viscous at the bottom. As for the ice creams served, the vanilla was bland (I think someone forgot to add sugar or anything that would make it sweet), the green tea was green tea (i.e. unexciting without being paired with anything else, like red beans), and the coconut was the best, but the flavor of the fruit was muted (probably the same deal as with the vanilla).
Service was pretty decent, but for 96 pounds a person + 20%(!) tax + 15% 'optional' gratuity (why is it called optional when every place I've been to adds it automatically?) + 4 pounds for edamame (the most expensive edamame I've had, and not noticeably different at all) + 4.50 pounds for flat water(!!!), I could've spent the money better elsewhere. The food was alright, but if I did come back, I would save money by picking individual dishes instead of going with the tasting menu. Pick the dishes that are good, and not only will you not be disappointed, your wallet will feel better as well. That's what I call a win-win.",-1
5,"This is one of London's most well-known restaurants and a favourite for work dinners, nestled off the main street of Knightsbridge and buzzing with a trendy bar and delicious modern Japanese plates meant for sharing. We ordered a selection of plates for 5 people, but didn't get sushi except for a sashimi platter and instead went heavy on the cooked meat. Some takeaways: the spicy edamame much better than plain edamame (wasn't too spicy, but very good flavour), the aubergine dish was quite nice, but the creamed spinach was missable. As for the seafood, the crispy fried squid was good but nothing spectacular, and same for prawn tempura, whilst the sashimi selection was very enjoyable and well presented.  And the meat was the highlight, especially the grilled pork skewer and the seared steak. The chicken wings were tasty but had very little meat, and a pain to eat because it's nearly impossible to eat with chopsticks. I also had a watermelon martini that they are famous for, and I highly recommend it. The service was mediocre, as we had to ask a number of times to get forks, initial drinks, and drink refills. But overall a great experience and I completely understand its continued popularity.",1
5,"Oh my word. 
So, a little bit of context. We were in town for a few days and, being Japanese and having lived in the Middle East for far too long, I really wanted good Japanese food. We scoured Yelp reviews, TripAdvisor reviews, Time Out reviews for hours until I saw a couple of Asian reviews for Zuma and figured ok, let's give this one a shot (I'm sorry, white folks, I love you but you don't know sh*t about Japanese food). 
In fact, we vetted Zuma for so long that we timed ourselves right out of a reservation! Our concierge mentioned that we might be able to get a seat at the sushi bar if we went at around 7 pm, so what did we do? We waltzed in at 9 pm on a Saturday night. Well, long story short, although they told us we could get a seat at 10:45 (at which point we had a brief and intense discussion about how badly we wanted this food; conclusion: pretty badly), we went for drinks, came back, and got seats promptly at 10. Not bad. 
We had a hilarious waiter, who was not shy about telling us exactly what we should order. In most cases, we took his suggestion, and were not sorry that we did. In our normal ridiculous fashion, we ordered a ton of food:
Thinly sliced hamachi (like carpaccio) with green chili and garlic
Seared tuna with chili daikon and ponzu
Sea bream, chu toro (semi-fatty tuna), salmon sashimi
Wagyu sushi (let me just take a moment to add that my boyfriend was talking to me as I put the first bite in my mouth, and had to stop for a full two minutes because I was definitely no longer paying attention--this is easily one of the best things I've ever had)
Unagi nigiri
Lobster sashimi (oh lord, so good)
Grilled jumbo tiger prawns (when this came to the table, it was so large I thought it was the lobster)
Roast lobster (this was actually a mistake; the waiter heard roast and we meant raw, but we took it anyway. Very good but a tiny bit too heavily spiced)
And then, when I thought I could take no more, they came with a plate of chicken yakitori on the house--I actually begged them not to give it to us because I was so full, but they put it in front of me and of course I ate it. After, the waiter blessedly came by with some green tea, winked at me, and said, ""Good for digestion."" Good thing he did, because I might not have been able to walk out of there.
No, it's not Japan. The fish, while incredibly, unbelievably fresh, is still not as good as what you can get in Japan. But that's like saying that you don't like your Riedel wine glass because it's not the holy grail. 
Next time, I'd like to try the tempura, which looked slightly too heavy on the batter but otherwise good and some of the other grill dishes. We will definitely be going back. Oh, and one other thing: they have fresh wasabi. That's an automatic win in my book.",1
4,"I love places with a clean kitchen and clean bathrooms! 
If you dont want to spend money shopping in Knightsbridge, go to Zuma and some some money there.... 
I think Roka (sister restaurant) is a bit sexier, plus it has that posh bar downstairs. The food is definantly a bit better at Zuma though. Love the small plats place where you can eat a bit of everything, especially when everything is yummy. I didn't have any think I didn't like, great ingredients, cooked well, enjoyable.... Sushi is one of the best in London. Service is good.",1
4,"I love Zuma but the London branch, which was the first one I've ever been to, is a bit too dark and crowded with old men and professionals (if you know what I mean) at the bar...nothing against them, I don't mean to judge anyone. but not really my cup of tea to hang around these people...",1
4,"Ok, so I came back two times already. 
With the grill finally working, I must say, I absolutely loved the grill! You can watch the chef  grill skewers as you eat, so it's a posh, fun atmosphere.
Even if you don't like grilled foods - you can count on the fresh sushi and if not that, then guzzle their brilliant ""Zuma"" cocktails or plethora of sake.",1
5,"London isn't known for their food... but this restaurant is stellar. The service is attentive and a little pushy to order from each of the three kitchens, but we had such a fabulous time. The food was delicious and really special. The tuna tataki was one of my favourite dishes! Also, the spicy (you can handle it) garlic edamame is so amazing. I'm craving it as I type this! It's a definite must when you visit london. Make sure to make a reservation! We sat in the lounge area and it was quite comfortable, I actually enjoyed it more than I think I would have at a normal table or at the bar. xx",1
5,"This place is absolutely sensational, no doubt about it Zuma is one of the best Japanese Restaurants in London. If you are looking for Japanese Cuisine and you are close to Hyde Park you have to come here.
First you will be blown away by the Japanese decor which transports you to another world and many moons from busy London, so relaxing.
I ordered the tori no tabasaki which is basically chicken wings but flavoured with lime - delicious. I followed this with wagyu no sumibiyaki (elegantly presented flavoured beef). I washed this down with my usual warm Saki, I always end up drinking too much of this stuff.
I really fancied the banana cake but was full from my main. Next time I will definitely save space for cake.
Zuma is highly, highly recommended!",1
5,"Great food, great crowd. Somewhat expensive but worth it. Do not miss the softshell crab! You need to reserve a table a long time before you plan to go there.",1

 Zuma is a restaurant for special occasions. It is part of a small world wide chain with subsidiaries in Hong kong, Istanbul, Miami and Dubai. You might be able to get away with a semi-affordable bill when ordering carefully, but in the end you will want to splash out. Zuma invites to decadence and gluttony, and at this night, for my birthday, I was part of it.
 In London, Zuma is located in a very ugly building not far from Knightsbridge tube station and doesn't look like much from the outside. When you enter it however, you feel like you have stepped into a night club or into one of these bars I never go to because I refuse to pay 15 pounds for a cocktail and I usually don't confirm with the dress code.
 Surrounded by the young, rich and stylish I was glad I had dressed up for this special occasion feeling like a real Chelsea girl, wearing something rather short together with very high heels in the form of my almost virgin golden Sergio Rossi stilettos. Sipping my Saffron and Poppy Seed Martini (10.50) I was waiting to be spoiled.
 I really liked Zuma, in fact I liked it about 1 million times more than the only other posh Japanese restaurant I have been to in London, Nobu Berkley Square.
 LIKE
 1. Lovely staff: Even though we didn't have a reservation the lovely people at the counter found us a place at the sushi bar within 10 minutes. Friendly and forthcoming they had nothing in common with the pretentious waiters at Nobu.
2. The menu: I liked the fact that in addition to some astronomically priced dishes they do have a good selection of dishes costing less than 10 pounds.
3. The wine: There are also quite some wines for under 20 pounds, which allows you to maybe order a couple of dishes more
4. The food (see below) was sublime. I loved the fresh and exquisite ingredients, the exotic and well-balanced sauces and the inventive take on Japanese food without losing the traditional touch.
 DISLIKE
 1. I really wanted some cold sake to go with my Japanese delicacies, but they were out of the two cheapest sakes! (19£ and 29£ respectively for 300 ml). We did not go with the next expensive one (40£) but had wine instead. Wanted sake though!
 2. The Sushi Counter: the person who designed this should lose his/her licence really. The broad stone surface gives you plenty of space for all your plates but underneath  this is a completely different story. Even I with my 5.3 ft had no idea what to do with my legs. Not only was there absolutely no space, the inside surface of the counter was ragged, which not only destroys stockings but also hurts! This reminded me of the story that I once heard about McDonalds, where they intentionally use tilted chairs so that the customer does not feel to comfortable and doesn't want to linger. I wonder if similar incentives were in the mind also of the people behind the Zuma interior design?
3. Why don't they put prices on their website? I really don't like this, people should know what they are in for. And while I'm at it, did I mention that I HATE websites with music?
 Anyway, the most important thing is the food, here we go:
 Suzuki no osashimi (12.60)  thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, salmon roe and truffle oil  one of my favourite dishes
 Tokodai wafu asperagasu (5.80)  beautiful fresh and with delicious wafu sauce and sesame on top.
 Shitaki Mushrooms (4.80)  tender and garlicky this was a rather generous portion for not quite 5 pounds.
 Chicken Yakitori (5.80)
 Yellow Tail sashimi (8.00)  boring compared to the other dishes.
 Unagi Nigri (8.80) however, was all the better.
 Aubergine (8.60) something
 Inaniwa Langustine Noodles (14.80)  this was one of the specials, the chilled noodles with the sweet langoustine and the ripe mango were very pleasant indeed.
 Wagyu Beef Sushi with Black Truffle (27.50)  loved the raw beef melting in my mouth together with the subtle truffle flavour. Expensive but worth it :)
 Banana and Green Tea Cake with Peanut Toffee Sauce and coconut ice cream (8.80)  weird combination but worked somehow. While I didn't pick up the green tea flavour, the soft and juice banana cake was all the better with the sweet and salty peanuts.",1
5,"One of my top 5 restaurants in London. 
The food, atmosphere and people are perfectly aligned.  It's the only place I have been in London that has it's own sake sommelier, who on each visit has recommended something uniquely outstanding.
The food is excellent and the calamari is the one dish on this planet I would travel across oceans for.",1
5,"WOW! 
Killer amazing scrumptious food and perfect mixed drinks. Sit and be entertained by the chefs, relish in the ambiance, glance around at the beautiful people...
only downside is when the check comes. Doh!",1
4,"Zuma is not a place for a casual meal.
Zuma is not your average sushi-carousel lunch joint.
Zuma is a lean, mean, dining machine.
And you know all this because Zuma's still there after many years of business.  Although I used to not fully understand why sushi has to be so expensive, Zuma changed all that (along with Gari in NYC) by showing me that eating sushi is an experience.  Try the unique, off-the-wall items and soak in the atmosphere.  Last time I was there, the service was pleasant and efficient even though it was a busy night (even with reservations, we had to wait for our table -- of course, this may be because we were late...we may or may not have gotten lost) but relax.  They take good care of you.  So come, eat lots of amazing food, and walk away happy.
I cannot wait to try Zuma again.",1
3,"Amazing sake selection - if you're into that sort of thing. 
Stopped by here after a show, and I was a bit taken aback from how trendy/cool this place is. Felt a bit under dressed compared to the scantily clad women prancing around in sequins. 
Super crowded and it's def a place to go if you have money to buy all the expensive drinks or if you're a gold digger. =)",-1
5,"Zuma is one of my all time favorite upscale sushi chains. With a presence in most major international cities its a go to when traveling and craving sushi in a upscale setting. I prefer Zuma over Nobu, Bond St, and Blue Ribbon three of the other most recognized upscale sushi chains. This location is very busy so make sure you make a booking in advance, we went on a tuesday night and were able to squeeze into a couple bar seats after ordering a few items and bottles of saki while standing. The service is great as expected from a restaurant of this caliber. 4.5 for the food and 5 stars for the scene. Many celebrities frequent this place so you never know who you will run into. Great fresh sushi, the lobster was also fantastic and the saki list was impressive. If they have butterfish available that is a must try!  Zuma deserts are also always a must!",1
4,"Without a doubt, pretty amazing.  You walk and and you just want to hate the place - it looks too trendy for it's own good and you'd often find yourself tripping over a Ferrari or two parked out in front.     But the food revives it and begs you to come back for more.
You need to get a few things out of the way first:  It's going to be so loud that you'll struggle hearing people at your table.  It's going to be so busy that you're going to fight to walk to the loo and you probably won't get seated on a Tuesday without a booking.  The portions are not going to be big.  And you're going to pay.   But it's worth it.
To die for:  Spicy Lobster, Wagyu Beef and the lamb chops.  Probably the best prawn tempura sushi roll I've ever had.  Anything from the robata grill is cooked perfectly and simply flavorful.
Hint:  Escape a bit from the massive crowds and book a private room in the back, which is slightly separated with perforated wooden blocks.  But you'll have to take your shoes off before you sit...",1
4,"I think I've made my view on sushi in London clear.  You can't get good sushi without going to one of the fancy places: Nobu, Nozomi, Roka.  Add Zuma to that list.  
Finally made it to Zuma after living in London for year.  Don't have any ""pull"" so had to book a few weeks in advance.  8pm on a Wednesday and was very busy, with not even a place around to bar to stand.  Wasn't seated til around 8:20 which didn't bother me but it's something to note.  
I'll start with the meal: I was craving sushi rolls so ordered a dynamite spider roll and a spicy tuna roll. Both were exactly what I wanted and were far above average for sushi rolls.  Next we ordered sweet potato with teriyaki but wouldn't order it again.  Next up was beef tenderloin with sesame and it was excellent. Can't remember the rest of my order but I was very happy with the food and would go back for it.
Now I'll get to the clientele of this restaurant.  It was a mix of businessmen, and old men with young women.  Basically, don't go to this restaurant with anyone ultra-conservative (although I wouldn't really expect them to want to go anyway). The ambience was quite nice though, dimly lit and not too too loud to chat (although I suspect the noise level would increase on the weekend)
So all in all, I wouldn't say that Zuma stands out as any better than the other high end sushi places.  But if you've gotta pay a certain price for good sushi, you might as well as this to the list.",1
4,"This place is Knightsbridge at its best!
The food is delicious and unique. Yes, it's expensive, but you totally get what you pay for here. I've been here for lunch with a group (we dined in one of the back private rooms, which was a great, personalized experience) and for a date (we dined in the main restaurant, which is louder and busier but has a great vibe). Go for sushi and lots of it - don't bother with much of anything else because the sushi is just that good!
The bar is also awesome. I've been here for just drinks and it's a great time. The barmaids are attentive and make excellent cocktails. Plus, there is a good selection of wines by the glass. 
A few notes:
- You generally need a reservation here, so make one!
- The bar closes pretty early (before midnight if I remember correctly) so get there early and head out afterwards
- Get a private room if you are 6 people or more - totally worth it!!",1
5,"Decided to visit Zuma on a Friday night without any reservations. It took about 2 hours to get a seat at the table, but you can sit and the bar and people watch. The crowd alone is interesting to attract an audience. If sitting at the bar please try their take on popcorn made of tempura and sweet corn (it was wonderful). We had the tasting menu and it was amazing. A bit too much food but the sushi was incredible and every dish was interest. I would place this place above Nobu in NY when Nobu was at its height. It is expensive so be prepared to spend.",1
4,"went here many years ago for a birthday celebration. having amazing sushi, wagyu and cocktails was a gimme at these prices. that being said the service was great and the surroundings immaculate. 
recently returned for a drink and late night bite, arrived around 1030pm and with a little bit of persuading (said we'd be less than an hour) was sat at a table for 2. stuck to the nigiri ~ toro, salmon, mackerel, kingfish. expensive as shit but was beautiful, like butter. traditionally made. jiro would be proud. peace.
ps. great people watching. yourself included.",1
5,"Best fish in London!! I really enjoyed it. I think they could upgrade the style of furniture. If you look for clebrities, that's the place to go. Pricey but worth it",1
5,"This place was amazing! One of the tops restaurant I've ever been to for sushi in London..  Atmosphere was great.  Waiter/waitress are very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and will offer their opinion.  I like that ^_-.  Beats going to some restaurant where  when asked what's good here will say ""everything""? or "" I don't know"" and they always have this stupid look on their face when doing so.  Sake was good.  I especially liked the Edamame.  Edamame was seasoned with this special sauce that just was so good!
I give this place 5 Stars! and I would definitely go back again.  In fact i'm planning on returning sometime later this week. but this time with reservations!  you should make reservations in advance or you might have to wait for at least half an hour and will be seated at the grill area.   Which can be a bit hotter.  If you prefer to be in a  warmer environment then fine but if your body temperature is normally hot maybe booking reservations in advance is the way to go or you will get seated at the grill area-Just a heads up**",1
5,"FABULOUS sushi and Japanese fushion food. 
I came here with 5 other friends for lunch and had a fabulous meal. We all had some cocktails, which were delicious, then ordered a lot of food to share. The sushi was to die for, some of the best I've ever had in London or New York. I also enjoyed the variety of interesting dishes on the menu. The popped corn was not to be missed - it's basically corn kernels tempuraed and served with salt. 
The service was wonderful, as to be expected in a restaurant of this calibre. 
Lots of ladies who lunch and well dressed international business types. Quite pricey, as to be expected. Lunch (with a few drinks each) set each of us back about £100.
I'm a fan.",1
4,"I love Zuma.  I have been there a few times and I have loved every dish and every cocktail I've tried.  I don't love the prices so much, nor the 19-year old prostitutes who hang out at the bar, or for that matter the man receiving a blow job in the ladies bathroom last night, but all-in-all, gotta love Zuma.
The Saffron and Poppy Cocktail is to die for, as is the Rubabu which is rhubarb-infused sake with vodka and passion fruit.  The cocktail with Johnny Walker is also fab.  I would go there just for the salmon and tuna tartar and the drinks, but order as you wish!",1
4,The Japanese cuisine is kind of a new passion for me. I'm keen on exploring the new exciting and appealing taste of the meals. You should forget about the high prices and simply enjoy the delicious main courses and desserts. I find really good the Yuzu lime pie and the California Maki with crab and rich flavour of avocado.,1
3,Food served was average and the service was also not up to the mark. The sushi served was good.,-1
4,"Zuma amazes the palate from start to finish and was one of my all-time favourite lunch and dinner spots during my time in London.  I feel very confident in recommending any dish on menu but particularly like the pork belly and agedashi tofu.
Go.  Enjoy.  Bravo!",1
5,"Zuma is a very, repeat very nice place for an enjoyable evening
Place is crowded when we got there around 9pm and despite having a reservation need to wait a little while.
Bar / lounge scene is worth it just for that.  Definitely a see and be seen scene.  Great decor, music.  More on this later.
But first we had a private dining room, which was very nice.  Great service.  Our waiter made some great recommendations and generally helped us out.  We got the sake sommelier to hook us up with some nice sake.
We started with some sushi, fresh and very nice.
We had a number of the grilled items for sharing: seabass, squid, several beef dishes, chicken, tofu, vegetables, etc.  All were spectacular.  I especially liked the chicken - very tasty, although done a little rare as is common with Japanese places.
We split the chocolate desert and the banana cake.  Both were outstanding.
So after dinner we met some friends in the bar/lounge area and just hung for awhile.  Lots of fun, nice place.  Too bad they close up a little early.
All in all I add Zuma as a must go to place in London.  I love Japanese food and this place has a great take on modern Japanese in a fun atmosphere.",1
4,"Very creative sushi dishes, and of course a not-to-be-missed ""scene"". ;-)",1

I give four stars because of its creativity of the menu.
It's a bit pricy.
If you like Sake, try Zuma's cocktail with Sake. I think it's quiet unique.",1

- Great food and drinks
- Sushi and sakes are great. They've 40 different sakes in the menu. 
- Service is excellent
- Dress code is, 'dress to impress'
I highly recommend trying the black cod!! It's a must. Also try unagi bo zushi!",1
4,"I REALLY wish I could give this place 5 stars. The sushi and sake are to die for. But, the only setback was how incredibly rude the hostess/ ""person that sits at the front desk"" was!
So it was raining VERY hard the night that I came here. Our hotel was just a block away so we thought we could make it without getting too wet. We were wrong. So we came in with wet jackets and slightly wet hair. We didn't look gross, though. (God forbid we wreck their scene of ""hot' people) We just looked like we got caught in the rain.
So as soon as we got in, the beautiful, blonde, hostess sneered at us sarcastically saying, ""May I help you?"". We had reservations, of course, so we told her our information and she reluctantly searched for our reservations. After about 3 minutes she found our reservations, looking annoyed that she even found them. She then said, ""You guys should get rid of those wet jackets..."" and paused. After 5 seconds of awkward silence she sighed and said, annoyed, ""I can take them..."".
At that point I wanted to shout dramatically, ""Do you know who we are?!?"". I didn't, of course. I guess I came in with a sour attitude to start with because of the crazy weather, but still!
Other than that small incident, our waiter was amazingly friendly  and the owner of the restaurant even stopped by our table to see if we were enjoying our sake.
To make a long story short, I would definitely come here again, despite the bi*chy host. :)",1

 On entry the interior is modern/plush and there is a bar section to the right, where apparently lots of hot women go to snag a wealthy man - you men are soo lucky :-)
 My date knew the owner as a friend, so he managed to get seats in the section where the cooks are opposite cooking. I wasn't too sure whether I would like the food, but boy was it amazing! I had crab and spinach for starters, steak (small pieces) and black cod (you have to try this), finished off with warm chocolate cake and icecream - heaven!
 The service was excellent as the woman who served us was very friendly/approachable. Zuma is probably the best place I've tried so far. It is expensive but a very fashionable/trendy place and definitely worth a visit...",1
5,"What an amazing place... the decor is stunning and the food is incredible.
You do pay quite a lot- but it worth it. The only thing I did not find that great were the desserts.
We sat in the bar area which seemed a little more casual then the rest of the restaurant.",1
4,"Fantastic Japanese fusion restaurant in London.  It's won several awards and rightly so.  Great sushi and tempura, and then the black cod and wagyu beef are their specialties. The bar is excellent as well - recommend the Passion Bellini or Watermelon Martinis.
Be sure to book at least 3 or 4 weeks in advance for a weekend, and beware that you'll get moved in and out of the restaurant pretty quickly - staying for longer than 2 hours is difficult.  You also pay for what you get, but well worth a viist.",1
5,"This place was recommended by my trusty concierge at the hotel. He was able to secure a table for us at the last minute. 
When we walked in and saw the decor and the kitchen area, I was a bit worried - it looked like a typical fusion place where they make anything from sushi to teppan-yaki, yaki-tori, with no specialization. 
But as soon as we got food, my fear disappeared. Wagyu beef plate we had was absolutely amazing - so tasty, juicy, and tender. Our server was a Japanese girl and she knew very well about what the restaurant offered. She was fantastic.  After a bunch of yummy dishes we had, I wanted to have some typical closing items in Japanese meal - steamed rice, pickled vegetables (tsukemono), and miso soup. 
Although the menu did not have pickled vegetable, our server managed to get some for us (was good, too). Along with hot green tea, I was a happy camper. 
After all, I would give them:

5,"After a bit of a random disorganised day, two friends and I hung our heads as Harrod's closed in front of us, withdrawing all hopes of a hot chocolate on a cold winter afternoon. Stocking up on some emergency supplies (caramelised popcorn for one, sausage roll for another) which we devoured, I brought up none other than the qype app on my iPhone (possibly one of the best things about the iToy!), to look for some emergency sustenance and prepare the foundations of plan B, since plan A (hot chocolate at Harrod's) had failed miserably. In the nearby listings, something crept up to the top. It had 5 stars. Out of 5. This was the average from 35 reviews. I figured Hey, this has got to be good! And proposed it to the boys. A few seconds of umms and errs quickly morphed to us all walking over round the small lancelot street to get to raphael street where Zuma hides. As we turned the corner, it looked like we might have gotten lost in an alley. Then we got to the doorway. Golden light streaked out, warming the stone that lined the walls. We walked into the warmth, spotting the beautiful hostesses who were welcoming despite our lack of reservation. We could be seated at 20:00, she said. It was 18:30. I turned to my friends and explained (in french) we'd have to wait for an hour and a half. We all shrugged. And raised eyebrows when the hostess continued our conversation in fluent French. A nice touch. We spent a very happy hour and a half at the rather crowded bar, where we watched lovely waiters handle bottles in ways you didn't think bottles could be handled, pouring double or triple beers one-handed, and generally shaking and stirring things up like nobody's business. I had a kiwi bellini. I think. Not that it matters. It was delicious, layered in flavours, and generally to be had again, and again, and again. Well, maybe one again short of that, given the £12 price tag At 20:00 sharp (I was very impressed with the timeliness) we were seated. Mesmerised by the sushi masters, it took us a while before we opened the menus and drooled over the contents. Ordering was quick and painless, the food arriving incredibly quickly. We shared all dishes, being mediterranean. And frankly it's the style of the place. Every single one of them was SO delicious! A complete symphony. The sweet, the tangy, the spicy, the crunchy, the smooth melt-in-your-mouth salmon teriyaki, crunchy spicy fresh and perfect calamari. So perfect, in fact, we ordered another later on and when the kitchen somehow lost track and made a third, our waiter brought it to us, laughing, saying he was sure we'd appreciate it more than anyone else. We did. We SO did! At the end, you had to roll us out from the food we ate. And we had wine. Given our bill came in at under £100 for each of us, with the wine, and we were quite stuffed with the most delicious food we had every had (well, the best seafood, that's for sure), we thought it was an absolute bargain! We'd all go again at the drop of a hat, should anyone find a good enough excuse. Or a poor one. Any excuse, really. I just want to have my eyes roll back and my mouth be stunned at the delicious melting softness of that salmon teriyaki. Truly. You have GOT to eat there. Even if all you can afford is one dish. It'll be the best thing you ever had. I promise.",1
2,"This place was a disaster!  I was looking forward to a posh sushi fusion lunch with friends celebrating a birthday.  The first server was aloof--it only took 20 minutes to get my drink ordered.  And from then on it was like trying to hail down a black cab at rush hour in the City on a rainy day--waving them down to take our food order because we only had the table for a limited time, hailing them to refill empty wine and water glasses--it was exhausting.  When the food did come out they plopped it down wherever they pleased and people had ordered specific dishes so we were passing plates to and fro.  Not to mention when they did bother to place a soup with the right person that they basically reached in front of someone to set it down.  
But it wasn't just a problem with the service--it was a problem with the kitchen too.  I ordered a salad with asparagus.  Well, it came without the asparagus--so again had to hail them down and with my chopsticks toss my salad to show them there was no asparagus!  
My friend who had been there many times complained to the front of the house and we had a free dessert.  
The food was good--the aubergine was quite memorable, but the experience was so bad it left a sour taste in our mouths.  
Oh, and not to mention they put an extra pound on the bill to give to the charity of their choosing.  WTF?
It was also weird how many young kids were there on a Sunday, which also was a mega buzz kill.",-1
5,"This place is absolutely amazing. I've been a total of four times and never been disappointed. 
I could go on all day about what to eat, but I've never really had anything bad there. A few winners, however, are the Black Cod, which is absolutely incredible as well as the Wagyu Beef, which is also perfectly seasoned and so juicy. 
The massive tropical fruit dish at the end is also a winner for dessert and is a perfect way to cleanse the pallet. The decor is awesome and the waiters and chefs have always been fantastic to me when I've been there. 
I've heard getting a table here is a bit hard. I've been lucky enough to always go with footballers, which means instant service and great treatment. If it means anything and shows how much they care, Cesc Fabregas, Philippe Senderos, and I all went in one day for an unplanned lunch and, despite the restaurant being completely full, managed to put a table together for us. Service with a smile...",1
5,"Absolutely fantastic.  Really, some of the best food I've ever had.  We tried a range of things on the menu and everything was amazing (even the mysterious looking fresh tofu), but the showstopper of the night was the marinated black cod.  Also, all of the beef dishes were incredible.  Too bad the service was poor and the hostess a little rude (this was partially our fault, as we were late for our reservation - even so, the scolding we received was a poor start to the evening).  Despite the mediocre service and the escalating cost (those small plates really do add up!), I hope they open a New York location soon!",1
4,"Zuma=the best sushi in London. This is a quality Japanese restaurant,that I save for special evenings and special people :) A Japanese dining experience only to those who can truly appreciate the delicate flavours, the scents, the taste that lingers on your tongue, and the beautiful presentation of it as well! the restaurant is very stylish and beautiful, the staff are so kind and knowledgeable, and the food.oh the 
food.organic
, delicious, authentic Japanese dishes  I'm transferred to Japan the minute I set my foot in there, amazing!",1
5,"Go early, drink wine and feast on freshly cooked food. It's more of an experience than a meal.
 Take it all in and make sure you order some champagne, you will see why as your drinking it.",1
4,"as a visitor to london, i was impressed and highly recommend it
great decor, atmosphere, and food (both sushi and robata grill). service could be better. 
the restaurant and bar were full on a wed night.",1
3,"I have eaten in zuma more times than i care to remember. This restaurant is a definite hit and miss. The standards have slipped, it used to get it spot on each and every time,unfortunately those days are gone.
The sheer amount of waiting staff is amazing especially when you find it a struggle to get any attention from anyone during the meal!
In my experience the weekends are terrible for the food as it becomes a total mess. You can also come across attitude from the door reception which is shocking considering the sushi bar has a no reservations policy.
Very expensive to take the gamble especially considering the higher standard of  london restaurants for the same price (and indeed much cheaper).
A see and be seen restaurant rather than a culinary revelation.",-1
5,"5.30 I arrive from work. Sitting at the bar with a girlfriend, drinking the amazing rhubabu (rhubarb, passionfruit, sake cocktail) Over the next 2hrs, a steady stream of 'working girls', clearly of eastern european origin, arrive and leech onto the first sad soul who will give them the time of day (and a drink) They're easy to spot- usually two come in together, buy one glass of sauvignon blanc to share, and then find a man. Usually old and fat, or young rich and socially inept.
 Possibly the most amusing place for pre-dinner drinks anywhere in London.
 Dinner is best at the grill bar- often a little too hot for comfort, but way better atmosphere, and cosier, than the dining tables. The salmon and tuna tartares are divine, as is miso black cod. Actually pretty much everything i have ever had here is lovely... As you would expect being in the heart of knightsbridge, it is not cheap, but I think money well spent.",1
5,"This is our first visit. Having chatted to friends and reading through the critiques we had been stop hopeful for dining here. The service was pretty superior. Very attentive. The atmosphere was satisfied yet inviting.They go the other distance to confirm their guests are happy.This became the most beautiful snack That I have ever had!I recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves cooking. Very accomodating staff members, and always there when you really need them.
The sushi culinary chefs are fantastic simply serve the finest sea food. I've encouraged this eating house to quite a few, many folks and none of them happen to be unhappy!!",1
4,"The quality of food at this fashionable and very popular high class Japanese restaurant is indeed brilliant. Zuma offers traditional Japanese dishes with a modern take on them like various sushi, sashimi and tempura, as well as some exclusive specialties such as black cod, wagye beef and foie gras, all prepared to an exceptional standard.
 Judging by the food, it's certainly one of the best Japanese restaurants in London. The only drawback is that it's very noisy. There are lots of people crowded around the bar in the evening and, needless to say, the lounge and the dining hall are always full. Overall, this place has a club-like atmosphere. There were six of us at the table and I could barely hear the person next to me, not to mention those on the other side.
 It's probably a great place to start a big night out, but if you're looking for something calmer, Miyama or Shogun, or even Nobu and Matsuri, are perhaps better choices.",1
4,"When my friend told me we were unable to get a reservation at Zuma, I was crushed. But here's the catch, there's sushi bar/counter seating! 
It was Thursday night, fairly packed (with the pretty people), but getting late for a London restaurant, probably around 9pm. We gave our names for the sushi bar and they said it could be up to a half hour wait. We decided to give it a shot and hung out at the bar. We immediately noticed three or four empty counter seats, but didn't say anything. Sure enough, within ten minutes, we were sat. Weird, right? I'm still not sure what the hell went on there. 
The counter was beautiful and had a great view of the grill. Our waiter was super friendly but I think partly because he was gay, and within minutes figured out my friend was as well and proceeded to flirt with him. The service still wasn't amazing. It became too personal and forgetting my drink isn't okay just because you're too busy batting your eyelashes at my bestie. 
The food was small and overpriced, but delicious. We only ordered apps/small plates. What stood out was the hamachi sashimi, pork skewers, soft shell crab and the giant grilled prawn. The sauces which come with the grilled pork and soft shell crab were amazing. The grilled prawn was just good, but cool because it was so big! For dessert we had a delicious green tea and banana cake. Very yummy! 
Next time I'm in London, i'd love to go back and try more!",1
4,"A very smart Japanese restaurant ,with popular bar.
Top end prices, but bar and restaurant have that buzz.",1
4,"Been there 2 times, one of those London's fancy-fusion style places. Food i good, prices high, quite noisy. 
Good place for a friend's dinner. Good location, very close to Harrods and nice interior as well.
Would go there again why not, food very tasty good service though high prices.",1
3,"Oh dear, I'm going to get shouted at by all the other reviewers who have given Zuma such rave reviews. I think this place is awful - but I don't want to score them lower than 3 stars as there's no reason why someone like me (not a professional food critic) should affect their overall rating. And after all, not all the other people can be wrong about Zuma, I perhaps just had a one-off, awful experience....
 So, in my opinion: Where Roka is fun, buzzy and serves incredible food and good portions, Zuma is a too-packed, too-noisy, too-huge hanger of a restaurant serving tiny portions of (imho) sometimes quite poor food.
 The sommelier is one of the most patronising I've met, who clearly thought 2 women were incapable of choosing their own wine. Don't get me wrong, I like to be helped and guided, but I don't like to be told 'Sauvignon blanc is awful, I'll give you something you'll like' as he snatched the menu away from us and flew off to patronise the 300 other diners packed like sardines alongside us.
 And as for the loos....not sure how to write about those, but anyone else got any comments on the 'clientele' and goings-on in the loos?!
 I really wanted to love Zuma, but I didn't. But I've been back to Roka twice now, so this moany old bag will shut up about Zuma and spend my pennies at Roka instead.",-1
4,"Great bar scene, fantastic food and amazingly fresh & tasty sushi. Some dishes can be overpowered by overly salty sauces, but on the whole amazing. The best dishes are the sea bass sashimi with truffle oil, the crispy squid (which is usually light and not oily, but recently has been inconsistent) and the cubed beef tenderloin in spicy soy sauce (ask them to put the sauce on the side as they put too much on).
 Fantastic drinks, and good desserts too. Always a good scene.",1
5,"Fantastic in every way. Great bar, good cocktails and the restaurant has an extensive menu. Quality is consistently high.
 It's a party atmosphere but tables are sufficiently far apart to allow privacy. Good for corporate entertainment, celebrating with friends/family and for dates.
 Always makes me feel good.",1
5,"Japanese restaurant that's the place to be at the moment, close to the City and Harrod's. I meet up with my friend Marco here when he can break free from the office for the occasion.
 The black cod is to die for!",1
3,There are probably 50 restaurants in LA that have food at least as good as here.  Big fish in a small pond.,-1
4,"Seems to be a very trendy place.  We came on a Wednesday night, and it was totally packed!  The quality of sushi fish was excellent, and the special ""tapas"" style dishes were an interesting take on Asian fusion foods.  Out of the dishes we ordered, the black cod was (imo) the most unique in terms of taste.  I don't know if I would give a place like this two Michelin stars (I was told it had two) because while the dishes were interesting & the presentation very well done, no dishes really stood out to me besides the black cod.  Honestly, my old neighborhood sushi place in SF had more choices of fish (and amazing quality as well).  Maybe one Michelin :D ? I guess it also matters that the sommelier was quite awesome.  5 stars for the sommelier and the service!",1
4,"I had a good time at Zuma. Food is not as great as you would expect from this caliber place but service and atmosphere were great. I would recommend if you like Asian food and have a fun, hip night out in London.",1
4,"We came here twice in 4 days...definitely a fan! Can't remember the name, but the eggplant dish on the first page of the menu (I think it's a feature item) is absolutely amazing. Awesome spicy tuna rolls too, and fantastic drinks - we tried the watermelon martini and the lychee one. For such a busy place, we were amazed at how fast all our food came. Knowledgeable and friendly wait staff. Great experience - food wise, Ozumo in SF could learn a thing or too from this place!",1
5,"What a wonderful restaurant!  The staff are friendly, the space is soothing on the eyes, and the food is incredible.  They bill themselves as contemporary Japanese, which made me a bit worried that everything would be a little too fancy-pants.  But the dishes were creative and simple and very tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try a few more things.  This is a great place to go with freinds, family, and co workers.",1
4,"beautiful. great place to go to when in london. the food is spectacular, the concept exciting. slightly pricey but worth it.",1
4,Decor is awe inspiring.  This is what an upscale restaurant should look  like.  Who said food in London is garbage?,1
5,"Where to start? I walked in and expected to not get seated because the front bar area was packed; however, a very nice hostess checked the sushi bar for me and I was seated immediately. 
It was mesmerizing to watch the sushi chefs and I was fortunate to be seated right in front of the head sushi chef.  There was also a woman working behind the sushi bar, and that was really cool to see. It was fun to watch this chef, because he had such a precise rhythm to his work and you could tell that he was really into it.  
It's so hard to say - which was better - the food, or the service?  The waitress that worked the sushi bar was so great!  She was extremely kind and very knowledgable about all of the items on the menu.  She helped me with my choices and told me that I made excellent decisions - one of which was the Wagyu Beef Tataki. It came somewhat covered/sprinkled with scallions, which I hate, but I simply pushed them aside. I was informed by another server that they made the cooks re-do the dish because it wasn't done properly the first time.
I got a 6-piece chef's choice sushi. The head chef prepared it and I must say, it was delicious.  This was the first time I noticed a distinct ""flavour"" to the sushi, where usually you just know that there is raw fish and seasoned rice. But this was different - the fish *tasted* really good and the rice was done really well, which is very important, in my book.
I think you will just have to go there yourself to experience it - it's quite hard to explain!
I highly recommend this place. For all of the right reasons - the food is superb and worth every penny.  The service was wonderful, warm and genuine. I can't wait to go back again another night!",1
5,Great local sushi bar. Great atmosphere and people. But not cheap,1
5,This is the place for people who have got expansive taste in food and women... If you know what i mean,1
5,"I've been there few timesthere is a very good atmosphere, I think it's one of the best restaurant in London",1
4,"I recently had the opportunity to lunch at this beautiful establishment. The experience was nothing less than perfect in every way: food, service, ambience and the total dining gestalt. WOW- this was the best spent money for the most outrageously delicious meal that indulged every taste bud and visual experience. I highly recommend making a reservation as quickly as possible for the luxurious and elegantly beautiful. The service was perfect, the choices for each of the courses were magnificent. My meal at ZUMA definitely takes a top billing in my many gistatory experiences.",1
4,"Zuma is the best Japanese restaurant where I have ever been I went there one time, it was full and I had to eat in the entry but the quality of the food and the busy atmosphere of this place are unforgettable. I hope I will go again, to test this modern and creative Japanese food and maybe to see this time a celebrityand I have also to test the bar and coktails.",1
4,"I headed to Zuma on Friday night and thought it was fabulous. It does have quite a nightclub atmosphere (this may be different during the day) with heaps of people clustered around the bar, but the food was all brilliantly executed and the cocktails were fabulous which scores them big points in my books. If I went again I would try and get a seat in front of the Robata Grill as it was fascinating to watch all the chefs at work.",1
5,My favourite restaurant in the world! Great lively atmosphere and amazing food! The sparkling sake is amazing and the lobster too!,1
4,"My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to be treated to a meal here by my generous boss. He eats here nearly every night of the week when he is in town so he ordered for us. The stuffed king prawn was absolutely mental, I still have dreams about it now and the wagyu steak is a MUST have - cant believe food can taste this good! We also had the pleasure of trying the sole and some other dishes I cant remember now but it was all amazing. Of course this place is really mega expensive and we didnt pay (our meal for 3 with wine was £400) but if you want to treat yourself you will not be disppointed and you will enjoy the ambiance the service and of course the incredible food.",1
5,"A fantastic restaurant with a great buzzy atmosphere. The bar area isn't very separate though so when you're sat down you can still see people stood around drinking. Maybe the area is a bit more separate when the place isn't quite so busy. It's not really a problem though and you may get a table right at the other side. The food was gorgeous, though my favourite Japanese dish - black cod - was no where to be seen back when I visited. (They do have it on the menu now though.) The salads are gorgeous - a real taste explosion in the mouth. You can also have more of an informal meal and sit round the grill. Service was good.",1
3,"I love this restaurant. The quality of food is excellent, and the price is fairly reasonable for it's quality. We had shasimi, sushi, and also tepanyaki. It's a night to remember.",-1
5,"this restaurant really is a reason to go to london. nice food and good cocktails, but VERY expensive
super daumen hoch:)",1
5,"Zuma is where we go for our extra-special-sod-the-wallet celebrations. Ayako, my wife loves it for the truly excellent modern Japanese food (generously overlooking the fact that the chef is German) while our daughter loves it for its high-class buzz and celebrity pulling-power (Russell Crowe et al). Service is exemplary; the waiters are brilliant at explaining the frankly rather complicated menu and recommending dishes - so that you end up with a smooth and seemingly endless feast that has to include: asparagus tempura, crispy fried squid with green chilli, mouthwatering wagyu beef, black cod with miso, superb sushi and sashimi (very unusual in London) and anything with wasabi mayonnaise. Everything should be shared and is, except, unfortunately, the bill. The wine list is long on spicy or smoky wines that go well with Japanese food, like the Franz Haas Traminer from Alto Adige. The sofa seating behind the bar is a good place to chose to eat and watch the parade of London's fashionable young things",1
5,i love this place it is amazzzinnnnnggggg,1
5,"Great Vibe, brilliant cocktails and mouth watering food. Need I say more? For sushi aficionado's who enjoy eating with other people who appreciate the quality as much as you. The open kitchen is also a nice touch.",1
5,"Misato is easy to miss from the street, but it'd be a shame if you did! In a city where large, comforting portions in a thoroughly unpretentious setting can be hard to find, Misato is a breath of fresh soup. They have a large menu with udons, curries, katsus, tempuras, udons with katsu and curry in it, you get the idea. 
Here's what you should do. Come hungry, with cash, and be prepared to wait for just a short while, maybe 15 minutes. There are many tables and they move quickly but it is very popular, for good reason! Order some tempura for the table and crack open an Asahi Super Dry, or a ramune for the kids. Then enjoy your plate of crispy katsu drowned in curry, or your hearty bowl of udon or soba. Leave with a full belly and satisfied grin.",1
4,"Honest review from going to this place for over 6 years.
Food:
The is generally quite enjoyable with a good variety of Japanese style dishes, although the authenticity of the restaurant I wouldn't say is high, some dishes have their own more unique taste, rather than authenticity Japanese. I suggest dishes with teriyaki sauce, although abit sweet. Ramen/Udon dishes are also a solid option, the sushi tends to be abit dry but overall good. Quite cheap, dishes costing generally £4.50-£7 for mains, £2-£5 for sides.
Atmosphere/Facilities:
The restaurant is often quite busy, more so on evenings during Thursday-Sunday. In the summer the restaurant tends to get quite hot and humid if you need to sit more deeper inside the restaurant, I recommend trying to get a table near the entrance during the summer. The restaurant appearance of the restaurant is dated and would benefit from a refresh such as making all the walls more brighter and the tables/chairs being updated. The toilet is downstairs that could also do with the same treatment as it's quite dark the locks on the doors aren't strong/stable
Staff: The are generally friendly, some more talkative than others, but always at least polite. The staff can often be busy so you may need to wait to get service. I would say the more polite staff is the male cashier.
Overall Misato is a cheap spot in Chinatown you get what you pay for, good taste, although not highly authentic, nevertheless give it a shot, you may enjoy it like I have over the years",1
4,"Good portions, fast service and the price was very reasonable for the area. I recommend this place if you're looking for a quick meal.",1
5,"Stumbled upon this little Japanese hole in the wall. Once I saw Katsu Don on the menu, I was hooked! And sure enough it's spot on with ones I've had before! I tried the sushi and that not bad either. Cheap, good eats, good service! Authentic with a great price point!",1
3,"Good simple food, I ordered udon beef and was a good portion the broth was yummy but the beef was ok",-1
3,So that's what the line was for! Everything is dirt cheap. Don't recommend the fried chicken but the chicken Katsu was decent. The tea was excellent as they gave us a pot so we got our fill. Service was incredibly fast and polite.,-1
5,"The prices are cheap. I had the chicken katsu curry and it was so good. The portion was decent. I must also add, the service was quick. There can be queues at times, especially during peak hours. This is quite understandable as their food is really legit. I love their home made salad dressing. The only thing is, they do not accept cards.",1
4,"Simple. Inexpensive. Delicious. 
Come here to get your fix for Japanese comfort food. This small joint in the heart of London offers big portions of quality food for more than affordable pricing. 
It was my GO TO when I lived here and now that I am a cross the world I come here every time that I am in town. 
I had the chicken teriyaki ~$7. Salad, chicken with homemade teriyaki sauce and white rice. 
Salmon and Tuna roll ~$4 for 8 -10 pieces of delicious fresh fish! 
The restaurant is very small, around 11 tables, expect a 30 minute line at all times. 
The bathroom isn't the cleanest but good enough. 
I will keep coming back! 
Cheers!!",1
5,"It's always busy, but no matter how busy or how long the queue is they're always very FRIENDLY and their food has always remain a top quality and big portions for a little price.
Compared to Eat Tokyo this is so much friendlier and staying small has really pay off.",1
4,"The food is remarkable with low price.
They only accept cash, which is annoying
The service and surroundings are OK.
Don't forget to bring cash， and you usually have to wait because it is not big enough",1
5,"Quick, cheap and delicious. Large plates make it one of the best values in China Town.",1
3,"I hadn't been to Misato for years and was a little underwhelmed with my return. I ordered the following:
- Curry beef udon
The curry arrived with a neat mound of curry paste in the centre of the bowl which needed to be stirred in which I thought was a nice touch. I like dishes that are left incomplete to encourage an interaction with your plate for the added sense of freshness and satisfaction that you have in some small way contributed to your meal. The taste however was a little sweet for me with nowhere near the amount of savouriness it needed. The half boiled egg it arrives with was also boiled a minute or two too long resulting in no added creaminess which could have helped.
The beef slices were tender and the noodles also nicely spongy however so it does have some redeeming features. The staff were also fast and efficient so I may come back in future (perhaps in another few years!).",-1
5,"Misato..i visited here I guess a lot of times since it first opening. It has my local favourite restaurant...you can't beat the price here for Japanese foods. That is why they always have a long queue. They still do big plate of dish and rice cost £4.50. I like tori karaage, avocado Maki sushi and chicken or Salmon teriyaki rice dishes here. It is always taste good and satisfy me.",1
3,"This place isn't particularly expensive but the quality definitely isn't the best. I ordered a beef udon bowl and it's soup was ok at best. It wasn't rich in flavor. The beef cuts were grainy and were essentially over cooked. However, the low price does justify it a little. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to a date here, maybe as a last ditch affordable restaurant.",-1
4,"What a great discovery in the heart of Chinatown. A fast and casual Japanese restaurant serving sushi as well as noodles and rice dishes. The restaurant is small and I wouldn't consider the food top quality but people come here for a no frills dining experience - everyone knows the drill, which is to order, eat, pay and leave because you know there's always people waiting. I came here with a friend on a Friday night and only had to wait a couple minutes. The staff aren't the friendliest but they're definitely efficient. 
My friend and I got the chicken katsu curry. First thing I noticed was the portion size - it was huge! There were about ten strips of chicken next to a heaping pile of rice and some side salad. The chicken katsu was crispy and juicy, and the curry sauce was so flavorful, it tasted like it had been cooking overnight. I was so content after my meal and the best part is, it only costed me £7!
Misato will become my go-to spot. Definitely come here if you're in the area and craving some fast and easy Japanese food.",1
5,"Excellent food and very reasonable prices, service was very nice, tourist friendly...hidden gem!",1
5,"This is one of the best Japanese restaurants in London because of its tastes, price, and portion. It's relatively cheaper than other Japanese places and yet are generous in portion!",1
5,"Awesome food and even more awesome a price! Is it the most authentic? Well not really but hey you won't find authentic at that price point and certainly not in china town. 
I cannot recommend this place more! The curry beef udon, pure yumness!",1
3,"This place wasn't TERRIBLE, but I honestly thought from the reviews that it was going to be some kind of underground experience where the sushi was low key mind blowing. We ordered nigiri (they called it something else on the menu but this what we call it in the States) and the rice was cold and chewy. They were pulling it from a fridge and plopping some raw fish on top. It was cheap, sure, so I suppose you get what you pay for. Not mad about it, but would have def gone somewhere else for sushi and paid top dollar for legit nigiri. I think you're better off going elsewhere for a few bucks more.",-1
5,"This place is my family go-to restaurant for kinda-quick, delicious and filling lunch/ dinner. If you go at lunch, probably 2:00 for less queuing, and if you decide to go for dinner, go at 5pm or 7pm to avoid that traffic of people all wanting a piece of that cheap but delicious food. 
Donburis (less of a rice bowl, more of a rice plate because it's too much to fit in a bowl with the salad, meat and rice). The bento boxes are good but if you go to Misato and want to get your money's worth and feel full and satisfied go with donburis. Bentos are like £11(?) Donburi's like Gyudons cost £6.50 and go up from that. Ramen is alright, nothing really that authentic IMO, broth is clear but meat is lacking when it comes to the ramens, and I wouldn't recommend getting udons as your noodles. 
Staff is an it overworked (dropped a piece of tonkatsu as they brought out my dish) but they're still polite if you're not a total poo towards them. 
The place is quite small and so you'll share tables unless you're lucky. And the place is cash-only as I recall. 
Drinks are a bit overpriced, ramune drinks (carbonated soda that tastes like lemonade but with a marble inside that reminds me and every east-Asian whether Chinese/Japanese/Koreans of their childhood).",1
2,"Had high hopes for this place as it always seems to have queues outside all the time, so finally decided to try it but went a bit earlier to avoid the queues, and it worked and got a table straight away.  
We decided to try a sushi platter to share to start off with and followed by the beef udon, and my companion the Pork Katsu Curry Udon.  The drinks came pretty quickly, a beer and a aloe vera.  Then my companion was served his dish and he had almost finished his meal before I was able to get the attention of any of the waiters who were busy running around at the back of the restaurant or sorting out payments at the front of the restaurant, and at no time look over to where I was sitting and waving for their attention.  Finally, caught an eye of one waitress who said she would check.  Then a long wait before my meal came.  And what a disappointment. The beef was so shredded that it looked like it was the left over bits. The texture was really weird and tasted strange.  I did not enjoy it at all. Also the soup was much too salty.  
I then had to ask several times for the bill.  After the third time, it finally came.  When I went to pay, I gave them enough to pay for the meal without the service charge and the girl who had just returned from her break, asked if everything was ok, and I said not really, although the sushi was good. 
I have never had a bad Japanese meal, even very cheap ones, so the experience here was very disappointing.  A pity.",-1
5,"Loved this little Japanese restaurant. Got the chicken katsu curry with rice, pork katsu curry udon, salmon teriyaki with rice, and shrimp tampura. All were really great, and cheap. Each dish is about 6-7 pounds. Highly recommend.",1
4,"Exactly as advertised: cheap and cheerful. These kind of restos just have a special place in my heart. I just love the hole-in-the-wall-ness and the fact that everyone piling in is there for the good eats. I find that in these cases, everyone queues nicely, politely. You sit, order, eat, pay, and clear out because you know there are people waiting for your seats. There's no pretence, it is exactly what you see, and the event of sit-order-eat-pay repeats itself hundreds of times a night. The servers know their roles inside out, and everything runs like clockwork. 
I had katsu curry and rice, although their bentos looked good too.  Food was hearty and tasty. I was perfectly happy and full by the time I left.",1
5,"Once you eat here you understand why there's a line outside. The fish is so fresh it melts in your mouth like butter. Inexpensive, no flash and all substance. Make it a destination!",1
5,"Misato was a total discovery.
I was stumbling around Soho, checking the same restaurants, high prices and wondering, where can I get some decent Asian food?
Misato is everything you can ask for. Japanese inspired cuisine, with HUGE portions and really low prices.
The menu is quite wide, rice based dishes, sushi, sashimi, rolls, curries... There are vegetarian/vegan options. Just so you have an idea of how big the portions are, please check the photos.
The tofu balls filled with rice, are absolutely spectacular, sweet tofu and well cooked rice on the inside (but really filling beware), and the tofu steak rice is also amazing, it comes with a generous amount of white rice, an amazing sauce in the middle and grilled tofu with a big side salad. The dressing is mayonnaise based, so if you are vegan please ask for this to be aside.
My friends have ordered Katsu Curry more than once and the amount of chicken is ridiculous, I will say this again, I hope you are hungry when you get there!
Cheap, good, filling. My favourite 3 words when it comes to a restaurant :)",1
4,"What an affordable price!!! walked in for dinner at around 7:30 on Monday. There was a queue 8 to 10 people were already waiting. But we waited only 15min. The rotation of the customers must be quick since many of them come alone.
Went for pork ginger which was quite nice. A little bit sweat taste.I liked it!! And only 6£.
The stuff were no Japanese though...by the way.
It's bustling with people, cramped and not really comfortable. So suitable for quick dinner ,dinning alone or when you are budget-conscious.
I'll come back soon!!! It has a wide range of menu so I have many of them to try ; )",1
4,"Easy place to find in chinatown at the end of the street.
Came here around 6pm but got sitted right away after 5 mins
Ordered the Katsu Chicken bento. Very cheap price and large portion. They give you a big amount of rice which was ok but a tad too mushy for me. Also there was a large portion of chicken katsu that was pefectly crispy.
My boyfriend ordered two plates of sushi but they were quite small sized so I would not reccomend ordering sushi plates because of that.
Overall nice staff and cheap place to go for good asian food in london",1
3,"Went in for some sushi and chicken katsu on a Saturday evening-6:30pm. It was pretty busy, the line was outside the door. Waited about 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad considering the line. The food was pretty tasty and reasonably priced. I wouldn't mind coming again for a quick bite.",-1
4,"Good food but seems to be bulked out a little by rice. Ordered takeaway to take back to my office last night (sad I know...) and was happy with the price, but not that happy with how long it took. The Katsudon was ready and bagged and happily steaming away inside it's cellophane wrapped bowl, but the sushi was nowhere to be seen. It was only 10-12 minutes later that the sushi roll turned up.
However, the food was good, a good amount of wasabi was provided as well as a bowl for mixing and dipping (rare!). The egg in the donburi had cooked maybe a tad more than I had wanted and there wasn't quite enough 'stuff' to go with the rice, but it was a good meal.
I'll head there again for takeout as it was some good food. But I'll make sure that I order just one dish at a time. Warning if you're getting takeout, there is a chair but you'll be bumped every time someone walks past (which happens often). Standing is an option but there really isn't a place to wait.",1
5,I had a pork katsu rice for 5.50$! 10% service tax made it 6.10$. The food was pretty good. Large portion!! Service was nice but they were understaffed so it took a while. I would totally come here for lunch again. Good for the yummy and pockets!,1
5,"I love this place! When I was still a student back in secondary school, I would also struggle trying to have money to pay for meals particularly in Central London. My friends recommended me Misato. Misato is a Japanese restaurant located by Chinatown which offers cheap dishes with big portions. For most dishes the price for one dish is under £10 - although you need to consider the 10% service charge with the meal. It has quite a variety, and the place is usually quite busy because of its popularity. The restaurant isn't very big, but I personally enjoy the food there so I tend to come there a lot when I can - particularly if I'm aiming to be cost-efficient with food.",1
4,"Portions are huge for most meals (the cold noodles are a little more manageable), and prices are very affordable, especially for central London.",1
4,"Misato- the place is quite small but the service is quick. Sushi & Sashimi are great value. We ordered and were served in about 8 minutes. Quick, fresh, delicious. Highly recommend!",1
5,"We were looking for sushi in the area and after Google failed we decided to go with the favorable Yelp reviews. You must try the curry anything here. I had the curry pork Katey and I wish I lived here so I can come back. The soup my fiance has was good but not our cup of tea so to say. We also ordered the eel, salmon and tuna nigiri and should have ordered more. The cold sake is one the best I've ever had and no, the alcohol is not blowing this review out of proportion. Enjoy",1
3,"Great price for a large amount of decent but average food.  There is nothing special about the dishes like a unique take on these traditional dishes, which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars.  Chicken curry katsu is just chicken curry katsu. Rice is rice. Salad is letuce + dressing. I could have put this dish myself. Also, the curry tasted like the bullion curry bricks you can buy in the asian grocery stores...not the made from scratch goodness. This place is worthy of a second visit though.",-1
1,"According to local Londoners, the line for this place is usually out the door, but I guess I just got lucky when there wasn't even a line.
I got the chicken katsu teriyaki, mainly cuz it was recommended by yelp-ers. Poor decision -- the chicken was breaded pretty heavily, lots of fat too, and just drenched in sauce.
Large portion size, if you liked the dish.",-1
4,I stick by my old review - this is still an extremely reasonable priced  resturant with reasonable quality food. Where else in London can you get a Sasimi bento box for under £10 that fills you up and send you off waddling home - especially this central?,1
3,"Super affordable casual dining in Chinatown.
This place is great for the price and portion, but the food isn't anything spectacular.
They have simple bentos, rice plates, noodle dishes, and sushi.
CASH ONLY.",-1
4,"So, I've heard a lot from several sources about Misato, but hadn't had a chance to try it until yesterday. That's mostly because whenever I'm around in Chinatown I don't usually have a Japanese meal in mind (even though I love it). But yesterday I was out with some budget-conscious, sushi-loving friends and we decided to give it a try. 
It was past 9pm so there was no queue. The local itself is small and rather plain, doesn't look pretty or anything. But it's not the wrapping, but the gift itself, so... The staff were very polite and took our orders quickly. The food came in giant plates. I had Tendon (tempura veggies and prawns over a bed of rice and a side salad) and was quite good. The bento box the girl next to me had was the biggest I've seen in London.
I wouldn't classify this as gourmet food, but it wasn't bad at all, either. Very good price/quality ratio, specially considering it's Japanese food, which tends to be on the pricier end of the spectrum. We spent about £10 each and were really satisfied!
I'll probably come back some time again :)
P.S. It's cash only, so remember to bring some before going in (there's an HSBC nearby on Gerrard St).",1
3,"This is not a sushi restaurant. They have sushi but the Yelp reviews/search results were misleading. Very easy to get in and out, very attentive service, but the food was only average and the sushi options were so limited we wound up getting other food. The salmon teriyaki was edible but not something worth paying for - but to be fair, it was cheap. Fine for locals wanting cheap quick mediocre eats but not worth the trip for tourists.",-1
5,A good and cheap Japanese restaurant in London! I ordered the vegetables tempura with steamed and it was as good as the one I ate in Japan!,1
3,The stand-alone feature of Misato is that it offers mighty portions of Japanese food at budget prices despite its location in the centre of London. It's also nice that it provides salad with all its meals. The set-up is very basic with simple furniture and amateur-like employees. The china or bento box is also plain white and the cutlery or chopsticks without any design and actually reminds me of aeroplane quality. Everything is fine but lacking personality and a touch of class.,-1
3,"IMO, this place is overrated. It is okay and very much akin to many of the mid-range Japanese places where I live. I've had much much better versions of the few dishes I had here (I had the katsu, pork ginger, popcorn chicken (though it was not called this--I forgot what the actual name was)). I am willing to give this place another try, however, as the sushi looks very good. If you are from the SoCal area, I'd just pass on this place, if I were you. If you are a local, this restaurant might good to go to if you happen to be in the area.",-1
5,"Are you a student? Are you broke? Are you always hungry? Do you always complain about portion sizes and prices?
COME HERE FOR A £4.50 CHICKEN DINNER!!!
I love this place so much like this place fulfills all of my needs. I can get CHEAP and YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD and BE FULL and NOT BROKE!!! That is pretty much all you need to know. 
But if you want to know more, they have quite an extensive menu and everything is considerably cheaper than other establishments considering how expensive London is! Like, this place is cheaper than McDonald's, LOL. I have a relatively big appetite and I'll admit, even though I finish all of my food here, I could still definitely eat more. But the important thing is that I won't be hungry here, I don't get bloated but I am full! At a great cost! The place is quite ""hidden"" but it's worth the search! It's along the right side of entering Chinatown from Shaftesbury. Food comes out super quick and even though there's a mandatory 10% service charge, it's still well worth it. I have had their Zaru Soba, Tori Karaage Rice, Tori Teriyaki Rice, and Tonkatsu Curry Rice! Curry Katsu is more expensive, it's like £6.50 but it's still way cheaper than elsewhere. Also, all of the rice comes with a side salad which is AWESOME and wow...their cherry tomatoes? Only one, but so refreshing and awesome from all of the heavy comfort food. Nice touch. 
Okay, so you definitely can't beat value. Taste wise, it is also super good. Their wasabi is really weak though, which surprised me. But, that's pretty minor. I probably wouldn't recommend ordering the Zaru Soba (£5.00) since it isn't really filling but it's a solid tasting dish (dipping sauce could be better). Tori Teriyaki Rice was REALLY good though, their chicken is crisp on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. They cook their chicken really well! The teriyaki sauce was also fantastic, just enough sauce and subtly sweet. Same goes for the Tori Karaage, which was battered perfectly! Outside had a nice crunch and was crisp while the inside still remained juicy and succulent. The rice is also amazing too, like it's nice and sticky and short grained!!! Great texture and taste, it is seriously some good rice. Tonkatsu Curry was  pretty good, but the meat itself was lean at parts. But when you eat the fatty parts...YUM. It was nicely battered and crisp with your standard curry, which was pretty good. I wish they gave you more curry though, since portions are massive LOL. Food tastes essentially like japanese comfort food, and everything is really well cooked! You really can't beat the price and the quality of the food.
Portions are bigger than a human head and you will definitely be full and happy here! They don't skimp on ingredients and the food is really well cooked, despite how constantly busy this place is! There's always lines at your standard dinner/lunch time so if you're not looking to wait, try to come a little later or earlier than the typical meal time. However, the wait wouldn't be really long and they're super efficient and quick. Their take out is also fantastic, great packaging (they use plastic tupperwares and it pleases me greatly) and portions still!!! Anytime I'm in London and hungry, this is the place I ALWAYS go to. I brought my friend from Nagoya to eat here and she loved it and I quote, ""it tastes like I'm eating real Japanese food back in Japan!"". So, I guess this place is pretty authentic too, LOL. 
Also, MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH! This place is cash only!
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!",1
4,"Fresh succulent sashimi, sushi at reasonable prices. Soba just average. Recommend for different  Asian cuisine within Chinatown.",1
4,"I was about to give Misato only three starts but because it is so hard to find a decent food for 'normal' price in London, I decided to go higher.
As the reviews have already mentioned, this is nothing special, the sushi is fresh though and probably the best thing on the menu. Curry is okay and I would not order any of the soups again. Although I have to say they don't taste like full of sugar or salt as usually in other restaurants that are considered to have better seasoning in their food. 
Their drinks are quite fun, you can get some stuff that is a bit different than anywhere else and are cheap as well.
So if you are in the area, quite hungry but angry at the society for pricing other ramens around 10 quid a portion, this is a great place to go to.",1
4,"A  good place to eat sushi while abroad. Like most hole in the wall places back in the states, cash only but an ATM is right around the corner ( HSBC bank). Service is quick and very friendly. Don't be surprised if there's a line out the door as it's a popular spot.",1
5,"This place is delicious, cheap, and has humongous portion sizes for London.
It does not seem like much from the outside, but inside you are guaranteed a yummy meal (or two if you have leftovers) for £6! If you are at the M&M emporium, it's across the street, quite small and could be hard to miss. 
I've only ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry because it's such a great deal. I would highly suggest going to Misato for lunch, as you'll surely be filled till the next day. My friend ordered their soba noodles which looked fine as well, just not as much food if you're looking for quantity.
My only slight complaint is they add a strange gratuity or tax? I wasn't sure, and no one at the cashier explained it well so I just paid. Overall, this place is so inexpensive it really doesn't matter much. The service wasn't the most attentive, so you may have to call someone over to your table a few times. 
This place is quite popular but small, even when my group went for a meal at 4pm.",1
5,love this place! decent affordable prices for big tasty portions. their chicken katsu is good! meat is tender and tempura isn't super oily. one of the cheaper alternatives in Chinatown London. highly recommend,1
5,"Once upon a time there was a student studying for hours in Senate House Library. It became very late and she became very hungry, suddenly craving Japanese food for dinner. Using her trusty Yelp app she found a place called ""Misato"" that was not very far so she walked to Chinatown to go eat there. And the rest is history. 
Seriously tasty food and shockingly inexpensive! The katsu curry is absolutely perfect in portion and flavour, very authentic (even the little salad that comes with it!). I could literally rave about the breading on the pork cutlet for days. I was so hungry when I got here but I left extremely full and satisfied. 
I also ordered cucumber maki sushi as a side and that was also wonderful. 6 pieces for only £2.50! I would come back here just for the sushi alone.
Came here after the dinner rush so there was no queue and got a seat immediately. Despite the dinner rush being over all the tables were full so it took a little bit of time for the food to finally arrive. Also, I'm pretty sure I saw a sign that said cash only so bare that in mind! 
This is now my ""go-to"" place in London for Japanese food. Especially considering the hit or miss of the surrounding places in Chinatown, you can't beat the prices or the quality of Misato.",1
2,"Long queue and rude staff. Although, the food is cheap and it still tastes decent.",-1
4,"I walked into Misato after seeing the good reviews on Yelp and i wasn't disappointed. 
First of all, i know some people noted the place didn't look like a million dollar or went simple with decorations etc  but come on, that's the point. If you want to lower the prices, that's first thing you cut. And i'd rather they don't do cuts on the quality of the food.
We came quite early in the evening so we didn't queue. The staff was nice and efficient. We were served fast which happened to be extremely convenient for we were starving. 
We ordered sushi makis, sashimi and a Tori Soba for me (soup noodles dish with fried chicken).
I was surprised the makis were as good as the ones i'm used to at my favourite Japanese place at home. The sashimi were a generous portion of thick cut salmon. All these dishes were really cheap (6 makis starts at £2).
The Tori Soba wasn't exceptional but the chicken was reaaaally well cooked. I regretted not taking the curry udon. 
All in all i was satisfied and i'd happily return to try out more things. 
Note that it's not your full-on traditional japanese food restaurant.",1
5,"This place is so worth your money. It was the perfect place to go for drunchies and, as everyone else said, you get a LOT of rice. I got the chicken curry Katsu and it was so good. The curry sauce was amazing and the breaded meat was delicious. My friend ordered tonkotsu and we poured the tonkotsu sauce over the rice. Try it! I just love the sauce on its own. For 5 people our meal was £29.15 including the service charge!! So worth it",1
4,"Stopped in here for an impromptu dinner, and so glad we did! This is what Yelp is all about: finding a hidden gem that you would never hear of otherwise, and supporting a local business too. 
This place can best be described as ""cheap and cheerful"", like a Japanese greasy spoon. Generally a young student-age crowd due to the incredibly low prices. It was £3.50 for six piece salmon and avocado rolls, which actually tasted super fresh and were generously portioned. The huuuuge pork Katsu curry plate came with large spoonfuls of Japanese rice, a big portion of meat and a small dressed salad, all for £5.50. 
Service is quick and impersonal, but tap water refills come free and often. Expect a wait at dinner time of around 10-15 minutes, which you'll spend lined up in the narrow entrance hallway. But it's well worth it for a filling, tasty, and cheap Japanese meal. Looking forward to trying the udon next time!",1
4,"Stopped by because I was in the area and had not much cash on me. I'd been meaning to check this place out, but never really was motivated enough to walk all the way over there. 
The place is kind of hard to spot, as it's a small door squished between some larger establishments. It is in the ""heart"" of Chinatown, but like aaaall the way down the street. The interior is pretty humble and simple. At around 7:45 on a Wednesday night, it was still quite packed and I waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. I ordered the curry pork katsu-don as soon as I sat down, because that's what I was craving, so didn't even look at the menu. (The server was like ""... LOL ok????"")
It took some time but wow, the portions are indeed very large. I usually eat a TON for someone my size and rarely find things filling enough that I can't find room for dessert, but that's exactly what happened! It was so good that I wiped my place clean. 
The pork cutlet itself was not as thin as I expected, but it wasn't the most tender, either. Granted, you do get quite more than what you pay for. A small downside is that the curry seemed a little cold... maybe because it was mixing with the salad? Everything was running together, but that was understandable.
Overall, good place to drop by if you're on a budget! Heads up that it is cash only.",1
5,"insider tip from a good friend of mine.
people are queuing outside no matter what time - speaks for itself (;
great prices, awesome food.
probably the best chinese restaurant in China Town.
we definitely come back!
*cash only",1
3,"The line (queue) builds up as the evening settles in. Price is very good, only paid £15 for two people.
Got the sushi bento and a ramen bowl. Not mind blowing awesome, but not bad either.
Not sure why, but I had a little trouble finding this place. It's more on the edge of Chinatown, rather than right in the middle of it.
They don't allow drinks from outside, though that's a typical rule. My friend brought in some boba and the waitress was like, ""Say what?!"" But in an asian way.",-1
3,"Slapdash and fancy-free is my first reaction to this popular and busy Japanese cafe in the heart of Chinatown. Like many it seems, we were seduced by the numerous positive reviews.
While there's certainly speedy service and the food portions generous, it's nothing extraordinary. We each had a teriyaki rice dish with chicken and salmon respectively. Perfectly edible if bland. 
The accompanying salad leaves drizzled with mayonnaise were an odd choice; some Asian greens in garlic sauce would have been just the ticket. 
Still, for a bill that came to less than £20 for two meals and a beer, you can't complain. Just don't expect to linger - queues of hungry customers are waiting, and you'll be told to leave.",-1
5,"Was out one night with a friend and looking for a place to eat that wasn't too outrageously expensive. A quick search on Yelp recommended this place, so off we went. 
It was a bit hard to find as they have no name sign or anything outside, we walked past it a couple times before going by house number. But once we found it, it was amazing!
The food selection was good and the prices are more than reasonable for central London. The portions were huge, the staff was nice and the atmosphere was pretty okay for a cheap place to eat. Will definitely go back.",1
2,"We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table at 6pm on a Saturday night. The line just got longer and longer as the night went on. I had high hopes for this place but was sorely disappointed.
We three dishes and two of the dishes included extremely cold food. The Karaage Chicken was unbelievably cold. It was as if they made it hours ago and then let it just sit there collecting dust waiting for a customer that ordered it. The batter was soggy and it was just disgusting! The Sashimi Bento came with a couple of fried shrimp dumplings that were also cold and soggy.
This place is pretty cheap but.you get what you pay for! When the waitress took our food away she asked if we wanted to pack the chicken and I almost told her no your chicken is disgusting!
Katsu CurryKaraage ChickenSashimi Bento",-1
5,"For only £6, the chicken katsu curry really hit the spot. It was a cold rainy day and a plate (the size of my face!) of warm curry was perfection. They gave a very generous portion which I feel could easily be split into two meals. But I ate the entire plate in one sitting because I simply could not stop eating - it was that good! The chicken katsu was perfectly crunchy and there was a lot of it too. The side salad was good. The rice was good. 
Damn, everything was great. I will definitely be visiting again!",1
5,"Excellent Japanese food and absolutely affordable. Cherry on the cake, staff was friendly and smiling. I would totally recommend.",1
5,"I was with a friend attempting to try Shake Shack. Put off by the horrendous airport check-in queue, we decided to head to Chinatown at her request to try a small Japanese place she'd heard good things about.
Thus we found ourselves at Misato, a tiny Japanese cafe looking place with nary any indication it was a shop, apart from the A4 piece of paper in the window showing the name of the place. This in no way hinted how amazing the food would be once inside.
There was a small queue when we arrived, around 8-10 people and seeing the size of the place, we expected to have to wait ages. Luckily!, as we arrived, a table opened up for 2 people and we were shooed right in. So get this, if you want a table quickly, go in small groups of 2. Otherwise like the unfortunate people with 3 or more in their party, there is a long wait due to the limited number of group tables. As we ate during that 45 mins, the queue only got LONGER.
The food itself is brilliant on two levels. First, the value for money is astounding. The Unagi Nigiri (That's the Sushi wraped in Eel) which is normally a little pricy in other places was £2 for 2 pieces of reasonable size. 6 pieces of sushi ranges from £3-6 from California rolls to salmon. My jaw dropped. Not to mention the main dishes were served in giant portions for £4-9. Katsu curry, Bento boxes...I cannot fault the value here.
So a place that does cheap sushi probably tastes cheap too right? Wrong. I've eaten in quite a few sushi places of varying quality and I can honestly say this place serves the most tasty sushi in the whole of london. It wasn't bland, dry, nor too cold, plus had the right amount of vinegar in the rice, good amounts of filling and the Unagi Nigiri was so succulent...and the california rolls to die for. I just don't know how they do it. 
My main arrived, the Chicken Teriyaki and again, lettuce smothered in delicious mayonaise (I think Kewpie) a mass of real breaded chicken, big rice portion and again, delcious Teriyaki sauce. I'm just salivating thinking about this meal.
For sure I'll be back, and will be in a group smaller that too. I mean the important thing is that I get in. And once in, I shall feast like a king on a budget.
Seriously, if you're in Chinatown and in a small group. At the risk of making this place even more popular that it already is, consider Japanese. Consider Misato. Just look out for the A4 piece of paper in the Window and no actual name where you'd expect a shop name to be :)",1
2,"If you're looking for a budget-friendly place that serves huge portions, definitely come here. If, however, you're looking for more authentic Japanese food, don't. This place definitely caters to the former.
A couple friends and I came here on a Friday night and the place was packed. Thankfully we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes before being seated. They also hand you the menus to look over in line, so we ordered pretty much right after we got seated. I wanted something light so I ordered the Tofu Steak (grilled tofu & sauce, w/ salad) and asked for the salad dressing on the side. When the dish came out I was already a bit disappointed. Not to be picky, but they didn't remember to put the dressing on the side. Ok, fine. Whatever. Maybe the dressing will actually taste good? Unfortunately not the case, as it tasted super watery. The dish also came with a mysterious brown sauce (which I assume was for the tofu). Curious, I dipped my chopsticks in and gave it a taste. It literally tasted like diluted soy sauce. Not a fan. By this point I had pretty much given up, so I was actually pleasantly surprised when I tasted the grilled tofu since it was decent, although - again, this seems like a trend but - watery. Nothing special to say about the salad either - I mean, what can you really say about lettuce and a tomato?
Overall I was not impressed. The service was fast and I appreciated that they constantly made sure our water glasses were filled, but honestly the food was so subpar I can't even justify the incredibly low prices (mine was 4 pounds). I wanted to love it, because it would've meant good food for low prices - which is definitely a struggle in London - but I just couldn't. I will not be returning.",-1
4,"Oh, I can't believe I have not done a review of Misato yet. Let's start! 
This is how I imagine my grandma would cook if I was Japanese. Massive portions, fresh and tasty food enjoyed equally by Asians and Europeans. There is always a long queue in the street, that says it all. Although you do not usually have to wait more than 15/20 minutes.
Do not expect the nicest place ever, though, this is not about style, this is about real food and the restaurant could have easily gotten a new look one decade ago. The toilets are clean, but damn, I guess you better wait a bit and use the loo somewhere else where you do not get oil de parfum just by going downstairs.
The main dishes are great, but I would recommend you a bento box with a bit of sushi and a bit of rice with meat or fish, they are just delicious (and the best option if you can't decide!).",1
4,"You have to try this place if you're in Leicester Sq for any reason. We actually spotted this place on Yelp so popped in. The menu is so, so cheap - we definitely over-ordered assuming this meant the portions would be small but oh how wrong we were. The bento boxes were huge and so, so tasty - I went for the pork ginger and the box was quite honestly the size of a laptop. It was so yummy and the beer was only £3 too!! A special mention to the waiter who had baked his own brownies that day and gave us each one for free! Only downside is it is quite packed in there and the food came out quite staggered - but it's a minor gripe.",1
5,Got 5 stars because of the food taste and value for the money. I got the curry udon katsu and my son got the sautéed ginger pork (can't remember the name). It was great. Very small and obviously popular. We hit it when there was no line but later saw a line that extended into the street. Would eat there again!,1
4,"No frills, no pretensions, cheap quick and filling. The food isn't remarkable or memorable but you get a fair meal for a fair price in an area of London not known for bargains. If you arrive early, the line for a seat isn't too bad and you can order while you wait for a table. Tip: if you order sashimi ask them for thin fish slices, seems the chef was in a hurry and sliced the sashimi top thick.",1
5,"Great location, delicious food, fair price. Can't ask for more from the experience. Would definitely revisit.",1
5,The girls who work here are so hard working. It's a small restaurant but my goodness their food is amazing. I got the pork Katsu curry udon. It was amazing! And we got the egg pancake like appetizer. That was good too. My husband and I were so cold from the weather and wanted something warm to eat. Perfect place and price was not bad. Definitely come here for good food. Line was constantly out the door.,1
4,"So I am a huge fan of Japanese food, I am also a huge fan of bargains. This place is a real find and I will definitely go again. It's not the best tasting japanese food i've ever had, but it's delicious and the portion sizes are fantastic. 
The waiting staff are so friendly and very happy to help, the food was out quickly, which was brilliant because the lovely smells can induce real hunger pangs whilst you wait. The fish was very fresh and was set out simply and very humbly. The food was delivered as food, not a masterpiece on a plate, but if you don't mind that (as I don't) it's barely a problem.
For value and a reasonably tasty bite to eat, I'd recommend this place.",1
3,"Portions are a great size, in fact it could be argued that a standard rice dish is too large for all but those with the biggest appetites. 
We had the chicken teriyaki rice dish along with an order of the Sake Maki roll. Between the two of us, it was a fine meal. 
I did not care especially for the quality of the chicken in our dish (very fatty, etc.) and the sushi was acceptable yet plain. 
Our experience was really hampered by the service. We waited about 25 minutes for our order to be taken although food did come out quickly after that. Once we finished our meal I was still a bit hungry and wanted a second roll as well as a beer. The language barrier was so thick between the staff and myself I ended up receiving no roll and all and a second person coming around to inquire about the beer since the first person forgot to ask which I wanted. On top of all of this, my communication with the staff was very rudely conducted over the heads of the guests next to us since the tables are oriented against one another. 
The in my opinion the only redeeming quality of this restaurant is the fantastic volume of food you receive for only a few pounds.",-1
2,A little and busy restaurant. Service leaves a lot to be desired. Was asked to move for a bigger party with no thanks or kind gesture to follow. Food is good not great-does the job.,-1
5,Delicious food (had the salmon teriyaki bento box) and friendly and pleasant staff. Lovely wee spot for something yummy to keep you going.,1
5,"The sushi looks and tastes wonderful, while the latest is fresh and comes with a great heaping mound of rice to take up all that wonderful curry flavour.
The prices are more than fair for the venue and the food. Service is quick and snappy and knows how to run a restaurant. While I was hoping for more variety in their house salad, the lettuce is wonderfully crisp and the mayonnaise and curry sauce pair well together.
A more proper rating would be 4.5, with a deduction for the salad plainness, I will round up for the price.",1
4,"This is the classical place in the classical place you see from outside and say ""oh, I'm never going to eat in such a place"". It seems a japanese restaurant run by chinese people in the middle of ChinaTown. But because of the great reviews on yelp (especially coming from Hannah, Jing and Katie) I still wanted to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did it!
Come here around 9.30 on a Sunday, and there was still a queue, but... how can I say.. they have the typical asian attitude combined with Londonese hurry, let's say the you won't wait a lot in queue!
No experimentation in the menu, mixed sushi, some bento boxes and a bunch of hot dishes like chicken and pork Katsu. Stop. Awesome, the only thing I usually hate from asian restaurants (it's a problem I saw in several of them, thai, chinese, japanese, you name it) is the size of the menus. And the lower the quality, the bigger the menu! 
We ordered sushi, sashimi, and chicken katsu. Now, it must be said that the quality per se of the food is not excellent, but if you compare the quality of the food for the prize that's where it gets the 5 stars!
Now, on my personal list this actually got two different grades, a 4 stars for the sushi  (good, but that's it) and an awesome 5-stars for the katsu, so.. if you want a quick and big portion of katsu don't look further, otherwise you can still consider it as an option but nothing more than that. Unfortunately the service is... a bit rushy! yes they are going to bring the menu while you are still in queue, yes they are going to to ask for ordering while still in queue, but you know, it's central london, I ckind of understand that!",1
2,"Food is cheap but so is quality.. Don't understand why there is such a line for this place and raving reviews ?! I'm confused... Yes it's cheap but that's about it 
I was far from impressed... I give it two stars for being good value but food is below average. Not somewhere I will be going again. I am a foodie and this place is very basic.",-1
4,"Food was pretty good, nothing too fancy. Good place to go before the theater.  Quick service and pretty reasonable.",1
4,"In a Nutshell: A popular Chinatown-based Japanese spot with excellent value, friendly service, and decent food.
Don't be intimidated by the outdoor queue (there will most likely be one) as tables clear fast.  Misato is relatively worth the wait, mostly for its value in Central London- hefty portions of rice and noodle-based mains barely approach the £6 mark.  
I had the Tempura Udon- big fatty juicy noodles in broth with fried shrimp and vegetables- and I thought it was good but not great.  My friend and I shared an eel and sea bass nigiri, which tasted fine (though I wish the eel tasted a bit fresher).  
The most delightful part of my meal- besides filling my then-starved belly- was trying a Japanese drink I never heard of, Calpico, which is a sweet yogurt and milk based soft drink.  I want to think I'm moderately adventurous, so I thought ""why not,"" and I'm glad I did!  If you like sweet drinks I'd recommend you try it (cost £2).
Would I go back?  Yes..though I would try the katsu curry chicken next since many have raved about it.  
Check it out.
3.5/5",1
5,"This is without a doubt, one of my favourite places to eat in London.
I've gone here several times, every time that I've visited London as a matter of fact- I make sure that it's a stop on my trip. And, I am never disappointed.
Just don't bring a big group.",1
5,A gem in London. I was having a horrible time in this city after visiting Paris first and this made my day much better. Quality udon soup and yummy salmon and avocado maki that is inexpensive. Highly recommend!!,1
5,"This place is cheaper than Michael Jordan.  Yet food is tasty and comes in large portion.
Definitely go for katsu curry.
You will not find better calorie+taste / pound ratio around the neighborhood.
Great for broke travelers.",1
4,Food was delicious and prices were great. It's crowded but they do a good job herding everyone through. You feel a bit rushed but hard to complain.,1
5,"I was on a lone late Sunday wander in Soho headed for my usual haunt of Wong Kei only to find it mysteriously closed for 'refurbishment'. Being still hungry and, having originally been dead set on a giant, juicy plate of Singapore noodles, I found myself lost in a sea of unfamiliar Chinatown eateries, casinos and unorthodox revellers. It took me a few moments to collect my thoughts, but then I remembered: what about that tiny Japanese place that I had read about somewhere on the social media train? Always a queue, I had heard. But maybe at 9pm on a Sunday, there might just be a free spot for one.
Walking down towards Leicester Square, I kept looking out for Misato as I thought I'd missed it, but stopped in time. Menus printed on A4 paper and placed inside plastic wallets in the window. A spot visible through said window! I went in and after a quick look at the menu, instantly ordered a can of Sapporo beer, some miso soup and a katsu curry.
The soup was warm and comforting, and the curry just giant. The portion size was reminiscent of dishes I'd cook up during my student days. Two breaded cutlets of pork slathered in Japanese curry sauce, with a dressed salad and an extremely generous heap of sticky rice. All were pleasing to this ravenous kid recharging his batteries after a hectic weekend.
The bill? £11.50 including tip. Some may baulk at the 'optional service charge' suggested at the foot of the bill. I've read many a review shrieking about waiters asking for tips and customers refusing through their rigorous, dogmatic obligation to take offence wherever humanly possible, but let's be honest, these are people earning tuppence trying their luck. So what? I paid it anyway and left.
Five stars. Will be back with a friend next time.",1
5,Great amount and not too pricey. Great if you are a budget backpacker same as me. Go their earlier (around 6) if you don't want to wait too long. Also check the map first because it is so easy to miss the place.,1
3,"If anyone knows me, they'll be able to tell you that Japanese food is my favourite cuisine of all time. I genuinely spend like 30/40% of my time at Yo Sushi. I wish that was an exaggeration. 
I decided when I was in London I'd grab a quick dinner before seeing Book of Mormon, and with this restaurant being just around the corner, and with takeaway being an option, I decided to go for some chicken teriyaki. 
The restaurant inside isn't very big, but it was relatively full. The menu offers little but I've often found that menus who offer little do what they do best. Unfortunately this wasn't the case here. I didn't wait very long for my food, and when I got it I went and sat in Leicester square to people watch as I ate. The chicken was cooked, but that's probably the best thing I can say about it. It was alright, but I probably wouldn't go back. The teriyaki sauce wasn't very sweet, but the rice was nice and fluffy, so I suppose there's positives and negatives. 
Alright if you're in a rush, but I wouldn't return for a sit down meal. Also it should be noted that they don't accept card!",-1
3,"It is very cheap with such a large quantity of food. We ordered Katsu curry, and it was huge.",-1
5,"As a Vancouver sushi snob I can't recommend the sushi dishes, but the rest of the food was fine, especially considering the crazy cheap prices. GIANT portions of salmon, curry and katsu! They also have cheap plum wine and other Japanese sakes and beers!
Definitely worth the lineup if you are looking for something casual and satisfying.",1
3,"I actually kinda like this. The udon I ordered (beef) was a good portion, and i was stuffed at the end. It was like 5.50 or 6 pounds, can't quite remember, so it was a bargin. There was actually a line to get in...and i came for lunch on saturday. So i'm guessing the other stuff is good? Though my friend said her fried pork rice plate was a bit bland. The tea they have is real nice. My udon was quite soft, just the way i like it :)
The sushi was okay, nothing special.",-1
5,"Finding this place is exactly why I use Yelp. Having moved offices to the area, we've all been looking for new and better places to eat. A couple of us had a hankering for proper Japanese katsu curry (and not the cheap mess you get from the likes of Wasabi), so we asked Yelp. 
Most of the top reviews paid homage to Misato's katsu curry, and it did not disappoint. I took away 4 (four!) containers for £6, which made up the salad, rice, sauce, and chicken. It was great that it was separated as you could mix it as you like; the chicken wasn't soggy by the time you got back to the office so retained that amazing crunch from the coating. The sauce was a little sweeter than I expected, but I can't complain as all katsu curry is different depending on where you try; and I'd thoroughly recommend you try this one.
I didn't sit down at the restaurant itself but it was busy, with a great atmosphere, and very friendly staff. It seemed small but bustling, in a good way, and pleasantly decorated. I did miss the entrance going past as there is nothing more than a piece of paper in the window, but once you're in, you're set for great katsu. We were most pleased!",1
3,"Misato is a casual Japanese restaurant in China Town, it is a very popular venue for the Far East students in London as it is known for its very affordable price and massive portions. It is perhaps one of the cheapest Japanese restaurants in London if you excluded the likes of Itsu and Wasbi. While far from top notch, the pork katsu curry here is solid, very smooth and consistent in texture, plenty of mild sweetness and spiciness. Don't order starters or side dishes unless you are a big eater as the portions here are almost twice as much as most other restaurants nearby.",-1
4,"Misato is a small Japanese restaurant with cheap looking interior and relatively inexpensive food. However, the quality is good and the service friendly and fast. Definitely a good tip for a quick good quality meal before a show",1
4,"Misato offers huge portions of delicious Japanese food at great prices.  I ordered chicken katsu curry (£6), and made sure to arrive extra hungry because the portion left me full until the next day!  A heaping plate of steaming rice, crisp and juicy chicken katsu, topped with savory Japanese curry and a side of lettuce.  However, their other menu options are equally well-priced, including the sushi.  Definitely worth a visit if you are extra hungry and in the area!",1
5,"Love this place, because the prices and dishes are great! We got udon, teriyaki chicken rice, and a ***load of sashimi and nigiri, and it was about 20 each including a bottle of red wine! Wow, completely unheard of in London. Do bring cash and expect to wait a while during busy hours.",1
4,Great tiny restaurant near Chinatown. It is quite cheap and the staff is nice. I recommend the main courses : huge quantity for a good price ! The sushis are quite good but there is wasabi everywhere. As soon I get back there I will take a course !,1
4,"Great little family joint.  The price is fantastic and the dishes are generous.  The fried seafood app is basically a deep fried shumai.  The pork katsu curry is the dish that kept me coming back, it was fantastic.",1
5,"My favourite Japonese restaurant. Sake teriyaki rice is the best dish for me. It is a grilled salmon with teriyaki sauce on a rice dish. Delicious, and with salpico, the typical refreshing juice they usually have in Japanese summer you pay like 10 pounds for a meal including service. I do not think there is a better option, although I would avoid if you get stressed with queuing and are going to be meeting people at the restaurant. I would suggest you meet somewhere else before going to the restaurant, since they do not allow you to sit down while waiting for other people. Everyone needs to be there. I do not mind, since it is a minor price to be paid given all the pros.",1
4,"A good cheap eat
The food was quite nice, but I've had better Japanese food elsewhere. Staff were friendly, if a little busy. The restaurant itself is fairly plain looking. However the price is where this place really excels - very cheap (for London).",1
5,"This place helped me through my poor times as a student, and the prices (at least until i left london) never changed, the portions shrunk a bit though...
I usually go at 12 when they open because a 5 minutes difference could mean having to wait in a gigantic line up",1
5,"I found this little gem through Yelp, which is why I love using it now. 
It's a little place, easily missable on Wardour street near Chinatown. When I got there, it was fully occupied and we had to wait in a queue outside just to get in. I waited for like 10 minutes to get in. I think it's easier for groups to get in since the tables really prefer groups over singles. The decor wasn't that impressive, nor should it be. Simplicity is key to this place.
For only £6, I ordered the Chicken Katsu curry and it was really great. I love Japanese cuisine but I admit I've never been to Japan so I wouldn't know how the real thing tastes like. But this place offers big portions and for that I was excited. Prices are really great (compared to other Japanese restaurants I tried)
I definitely recommend anyone to try it and I will definitely go there again!",1
5,This place is an absolute gem in an expensive city. Very good value for money with large portions. I lived in Japan for years and the curry here is better than any that I ever had. The sushi was fresh and I couldn't believe how cheap it was.,1
4,You will be surprised at how much food you get with the price! I don't think I have ever visited any Japanese restaurant so generous. I love this place. But always a lot of people queuing so be prepared to wait.,1
5,"Fantastic Japanese food at great prices in central London. Hidden away on the edge of China Town is this small Japanese restaurant, if your not careful you will walk past it (I know I have a few times and I know where it is). They have noodle, sushi and bento boxes on their menu, so far I have only tried their noodle dishes which are delicious and cheap. 
If you go at a busy time you may have to wait for a table as it's such a small restaurant with only few tables inside. It is most definitely worth the wait and I'm looking forward to my next visit.",1
4,"If you're looking for a super stylish, modern Japanese Restaurant - then this is not it. But if you're looking for extremely yummy food that's cheap and comes in big portions, then this is your place! 
Came here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a Queue outside the door already. Luckily, it was a sunny day and we only had to wait for about 15 Minutes until we were seated.
The restaurant is fairly small and has no decoration or anything that might entice you to take your time while having your food. However, I felt that it's part of the charm - basic wooden tables and chairs, crammed together to seat as many people as possible. 
The waiters seem a bit stressed and rather reserved, but friendly. There's a really big selection of Katsu Curry dishes and nice Bento Boxes, as well as Sushi and Udon. I had the Salmon Teriyaki Bento and he had the Chicken Katsu Curry. My bento box was big, with a more than generous piece of juicy, perfectly cooked Salmon, a big serving of rice, salad, to makis as well as two pieces of fried pork and a seaweed salad. His chicken Katsu portion was ginormous (yes, that is totally a word) and could have fed two people. The food is really tasty and it's great value for money. Is the food worth the Queuing-outside-the-door? Yeah, I'd say it is - as long as you don't expect an amazingly unique dining experience, but really solid, tasty Japanese staple food.
Will definitely go here again!",1
4,"Misato never lets you down, over years it has remained one of the most consistently good spots in town on value for money, better than high street sushi/ udon and lots more.
It has a feel of an authentic Japanese canteen and you really wouldnt know youre in the middle of Chinatown!
Expect long queues.",1
5,Food was great and the prices were very affordable. Portion size was well fitted! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone craving a good meal. Ambiance is not the best. But the food and price are on point,1
4,Not really a fan of the mayo salad in combination with the katsu curry but I guess thats how the brits roll over here. Personally I am used to the ginger dressing over the salad but this is probably the cheapest meal in the area and was pretty good except for the mayo salad ewww,1
5,"My boyfriend and I found this place on yelp while we were in London on holiday. We're big fans of Japanese cuisine, so we have very high expectations when we go to a new place. Misato fulfilled all those expectations and more. The food was absolutely delicious and it was incredibly priced for the quality. The only negative is that we don't live in London permanently, but we will most certainly be back on all our visits from now on.",1
3,I am not really a fan of Japanese cuisine but a friend persuaded me to eat here and I was pleasantly surprised. It was very busy and we had to wait for a table. I liked my meal and the service was fair given the busy period. Portions were quite small. I would eat here again if looking for Japanese food but  would not go out of my way.,-1
1,"I cannot believe that people are giving this restaurant good reviews. To paraphrase Vizzini, I find the assessments ""inconceivable""!
It was easy to spot the restaurant. A long line. Does long line = good? That was our mission. Luckily, while waiting in line, we got a good look at the food. I pressed my face against the glass, steaming it up, and stared down the food as it passed into unsuspecting customers.
The tuna had an off-color. Not good. The soba arrived wilted and sad. It wasn't even on a bamboo plate. Not good. OK, I thought, can you really ""see"" unpalatable-ness? Maybe it will taste good.
As we progressed in our line, we got a good view of the cashier's area. In the area was where they apparently prepared drinks. I saw filthy water cups washed by simply wiping them with rags. The large novelty sake bottles were re-filled from sake-in-a-box. They also prepared some other concoction by mixing instant powder.
I suppose this might be part and parcel of any restaurant operation, but it was disconcerting seeing them do it so nonchalantly in front of customers.
The food. I ordered sashimi. The salmon wasn't bad but the tuna was. It felt like someone had defrosted it. My friend ordered tonkatsu rice...
Now imagine, if you will, that there exists a planet beyond our solar system made entirely of eggs. Suppose the inhabitants crafted a ship and landed it on your tonkatsu. That's what happened. A huge UFO of an egg was plopped onto the tonkatsu. Really? 
The breading on the tonkatsu was far too thick. The worst part is I could TASTE fish oil in the breading. In other words, they probably have a huge vat of oil and just throw everything in it. Yuck.
Yes, it was cheap. But would you pay even a cent for crap?",-1
4,"Cash only. Not unexpeceted at a place like this, but still annoying.
As other have said, massive portions of Chicken Katsu Curry (with rice and salad) for a really small price (under £7). Wish it came with those little red pickles, however. Really solid Japanese homestyle comfort food and great for winter time if you've never tried it. 
Big food, big flavours, small pricetag. Go late (like after 9) and there is no queue.",1
1,"It wasnt what I expected. Food didnt look nice, chicken didnt taste as chicken, I would not recommend this place at all.",-1
5,"This place is great. The amount of food that they give you like other people have said is quite large. For less than £10 you could very easily feed yourself quite comfortably. The food itself is very good and I eat the Tempura Udon most times I go and it tastes great. Drinks aren't the cheapest things in the world but it's a small price to pay for such a good restaurant. The atmosphere is what you'd expect, mostly Japanese people however you will find the occasional tourist. You might have to wait for some time before being seated but even at lunch I haven't waited for any longer than 15 minutes. There aren't many tables but they do clear quickly. In my opinion this is one of my favourite places to eat in London.",1
4,"I love this restaurant. I really, really love it.
Why the 4 stars rather than 5 then? Well, this simply comes down to the lack of air conditioning (at least the last two times I visited). It is very warm in London right now and it was very warm in Misato yesterday. Almost too warm to eat, except...
Well, except that the food and service in Misato is always excellent. So are the prices. As some other reviewers have said, the restaurant is not a sandblasted, ultra modern place. It looks more like a slightly student-like place in terms of its appearance. But the food is outstanding, the portions are large, they come quickly and the price is great. 
The food is also very nicely presented in traditional Bento style. I had the curried pork steak yesterday, with rice and salad. It was so tasty I almost miaoed. Yes, it was that good. On the other hand, it was probably not the wisest thing to eat on such a warm day when there was a lack of air conditioning.
Anyway, the food (the curries and noodles especially) and the service are excellent. I highly recommend visiting Misato when you're next in Soho China Town. 
Really delicious!",1
5,Went there with a friend and luckily did not have to wait in any queues....enjoyed the katsu chicken curry with rice. It was awesome and a massive portion for only £6. They also have lovely plum wine,1
4,"Who doesn't love a huge helping of katsu curry (breaded pork) and rice with veg for under £7?! There is no such thing as too much of a good thing.
Any foodie who appreciates good value for money and a love for Japanese curry should experience Misato. My advice would be to arrive early, i.e. 12pm for lunch and 6pm for dinner - trust me, there is usually a queue to get into this joint.  Also they are cash only and we all know how rammed atm machines can get around Chinatown, be prepared and bring your pennies.
Misato will not disappoint. If it does, then I would question your taste palette!",1
2,"Came here for lunch as it seemed to have good reviews. That was a mistake. The portions are huge and the price is cheap. However, that is it. The soba was tasteless and the soup tasted like something out of a packet. The katsu was borderline. The rice was not japanese rice and a bit bland. Come for the prices and portions, not for the quality.",-1
4,"Ah, Misato. What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a pokey little Japanese place that serves fantastically unpretentious food in gargantuan portions.  For those times when you just want a decent meal and couldn't care less about the trappings of fine dining, this is your destination.  It's a shame there's no option for brown rice, but ho hum! 
I really recommend the Katsudon, a massive slab of pork katsu topped with a frankly terrifying amount of wobbly egg... stuff, sitting on a bed of rice, served (slightly hilariously) with salad. It looks weird, but ZOMG the taste, and you really can't argue with the price. Come hungry! Oh, and come early! The queues really do extend out the door during busy periods.",1
2,I've been waiting for twenty minutes and I haven't seen the menu yet. I understand it can be busy but this is just unsat. Maybe this is just an exceptional circumstance but it's no extraordinary day to be like this.,-1
4,"If you can ignore the grubby stained walls, grim floors and cramped space then you won't regret it. When I walked in I was initially taken aback a bit but I trusted my friend's judgment. She had eaten here before and loved it. And I can see why. The service is quick and the food came out after about a ten minute wait, if that.
I ordered a chicken cutlet bento box and it looked gorgeous. I tried to eat it all but it was a bit too much food. Too much of a good thing? Love when that happens. The added bonus was that it was cheap. And that left me cheerful.
While I was sitting there a lot of people came in so expect a bit of a wait if coming after work. Luckily the servers turn the table pretty fast so I doubt you would wait long.",1
4,"This tiny place is an amazing restaurant to eat at with a few friends. Its REALLY cheap with nothing more than 8pounds a dish. Their rice dishes are EXTREMELY generous! I had the inari sushi today and it was DELICIOUS! 2.90 for three large pieces. I also had the chicken hamburg curry on rice. This dish was alright. VERY filling but it tastes like something I can make at home. My friend had the seafood udon.. nothing special again.
However, with the prices, I am not complaining! haha 
great AND fast service!",1
4,"One of the best Japanese places if you want to have katsu curry and rice or any other bentos for lunch/dinner. Very generous portions at very reasonable prices!
 However, that comes at a cost. There will inevitably be very long lines for this popular establishment for weekend lunch and dinner, often an hour's wait in the street outside. Also, the tables are packed together. Good place to have lunch among friends, but a horrible place to bring a date!",1
5,"Food is good, it's value for money and service is great.  Tried the chicken curry katsu and love it!",1
2,"Very torn here because there are so many great reviews and I've only tried two things from the menu so maybe other things are good. The lady eating next to me raved about her order and said its her favourite meal and she eats it every week. The Chicken katsu curry was massive but also not very nice. Chicken was brown, very fatty and heavily breaded with a very thick sauce that we didn't love. Portion size is huge, it could easily feed two people and yes it's very cheap. But I'd rather have nice/food. Maki rolls are ok, just plain nothing amazing. They don't do hand rolls which I was really craving. For such cheap prices i wouldn't except the meat or fish to be of any good quality which put me off. Side note, the staff were amazing, incredibly nice and helpful. My 5 year old left his museum map on the table and started crying 5 minutes after we left when he realised he forgot it. We ran back and they fished it out of the bins for us even though they were so busy. Very nice people!",-1
2,"Having lived the better part of the past six years of my life in Japan, I was looking forward to enjoying some familiar favourites at the highly rated Misato. What I got instead was a confusing derivative loosely based on Japanese food.
Our party of three overzealously ordered enough food to feed five people from the lackadaisical staff who only acknowledged us when we drew their attention. The portions were quite generous, despite the fact that half of the large plates were taken up by shredded lettuce slathered in dressing. 
The katsudon with its bland, overcooked egg, lacked any type of onions, was not cooked with the pork cutlet and was served on a plate instead of a bowl (the ""don"" in ""katsudon"").
The katsu curry was edible, but the pork was dry and the curry sauce was quite sour and definitely not the same slightly sweet flavour of a Japanese style curry.
The pork and ginger rice dish was passable, approximating the flavour of the sauce well, but the preparation of the pork seemed very lazy. The slices of meat were far too thick and rigid.
Perhaps the most offending item was the tori karaage, which was a disastrous, soggy, greasy mess of overcooked meat.
Fortunately there were several dishes that helped save the experience. The tempura was acceptable and the tofu steak was enjoyable, though you have to question the difficulty of lightly frying a piece of tofu.
Perhaps I am being a little harsh, as the generous portions meant that we all left with very full stomachs, and this kind of food is perfect for a quick, cheap and filling meal for lunch. However, if you're looking for a Japanese food experience, look elsewhere, because while this was a very filling meal, it was also a very unfulfilling experience.",-1
5,"Fav. Japanese restaurant in London so far.  Why?  Because it's cheap, portions are HUGE and the bento boxes are amazing.  It's not fancy food or a touristy restaurant- just straightforward, affordable Japanese food. Cash only.",1
4,"A good evening is generally accompanied by food, or at least that's the rule my friends and I abide by. Slight issue was money - neither of us had much. So cheap and cheerful was the brief. And Misato was the solution. 
I met my Korean/ NYC friend, Crystal (great name huh?) outside and I have to admit, during the couple of minutes I'd had sneaking a peek at the menu before she arrived, I wasn't too keen. 
Although I love Japanese food, I'm more keen on the sushi and the rolls as opposed to the big udon soups and noodle dishes. And whilst I have a special spot for Katsu, I associate it with Wagamama's and therefore only eat it there (yes, yes, ridiculous, i KNOW). However, I jumped in and opted for the Tempura with rice. whilst Crystal opted for the Katsu with egg sauce. 
Tempura was standard and for the price, decent enough. What caught my attention though was the egg sauce on the Katsu. Firstly, egg sauce just sounds wrong and this wobbly, semi solid 'mess' looked absolutely rank if I'm being honest. I eventually plucked up the courage to sample a bit of the gelatinous, globby gloop and to my surprise, if you can get over the weirdness of, it's actually pretty tasty. 
Service was quick and efficient and the lychee juice was the perfect option for a sticky evening. 
Bill came to just under £20 for a giant meal and drinks (1 beer, 1 lychee juice) and yes, I'd def go there again for something cheap, casual and easy (sounds a bit like a description of some tacky pick-up joint...)",1
4,"If you like Wagamama and fancy bigger portions for a lower price then Misato is the place for you. Having said that, apart from the menu, the two couldn't be any more different.
 Misato is a tiny little Japanese restaurant, only slightly longer than it is wide, hidden away on Whitcomb St, right next to Leicester Square. It is instantly recognisable in that there is nearly always a queue which often stretches out onto the pavement, past the shop front and blocking the doors of its neighbours. If you weren't looking for it, you'd miss it.
 The menu is varied, from sushi and bento to katsu curry, and it all looks great. The portions are big and unless you're very hungry you're unlikely to polish off a whole curry as the volume is simply overwhelming. Some of the dishes are a little too salty for me but for the price you pay, which can be as low as £5-6 a plate, it doesn't hurt much.
 The staff are great, but unless you go when it is a bit quieter, it can occasionally feel like they are rushing you out to get the next customers in, and with the restaurant seating maybe only 40 at a time, it can take a while to get to the front of the queue, but I would advise anyone to stick it out.
 My only other criticism is that it does get very hot in there sometimes due to the lack of air conditioning, but hey, good food, cheap and cheerful with a great atmosphere. As long as you brought good company, you're in for a lovely time, and a filling meal.
 (I've also updated the info to reflect its actual location on Whitcomb St, not Wardour St!)",1
4,"Excellent! Cheap, abundant, and great quality! Bento boxes are Amazing, especially the salmon teriyaki! We will be back!",1
4,"My girlfriend took me here for a quick spot of lunch. Good value for money, largely sized portions and quick service, and also appetising. It focuses on quality and quantity but lacked in presentation, it is not a place for a romantic date but a good place to come to if you're in need of a satisfying meal.",1
5,"Wow. Even if I wasn't a student I would come here because the food is fresh, filling, amazing tasty!! Yes perhaps venturing to the bathrooms would frighten more than one but the food is just great. And the best of all it's still not popular with the tourists despite being in the heart of Leicester square. Arrive early to avoid queues.",1
4,Best priced Japanese curry in Central London. Their soups aren't so bad for the price.,1
3,"Got takeaway from here last weekend, as it was super crowded with a queue out the door. I was a bit disappointed that they could not prepare the udon noodle soups for takeaway - but perhaps that gives me a reason to go back! Instead, I had the chicken katsu bento and it was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the small portion of seaweed salad (wish there were more of it included). It's reasonably priced and the food is good. Will definitely try it out again - eating in rather than takeaway though.",-1
4,"My my, it was a rainy March evening when my friend and I stumbled across this restaurant. It was recommended by an employee in Waterstones Bookshop. 
First off, the place is tiny. The line from the hostess extended down to the steps outside. We were waiting for about 15 minutes I believe. All I remember was being so hungry but for some reason I remained patient. 
I ordered the tofu steak which came with white rice and salad. I also ordered a miso soup to warm up from the cold. Food was incredible! What made it even better were the HUGE portions. You receive a plentiful and you'll definitely satisfy your hunger. 
I will definitely come back. Probably for lunch on a weekday next time so it's not so crowded.",1
3,"can have BIG heavy meal with CHEAP price! but normally its bit salty and sweet- need lots of water after few hours!
 One annoying thing is, ONLY CASH!",-1
3,"I stumbled onto Misato when I saw the crowd outside. I thought, ""this must be good,"" and jumped into the queue. As it turns out, the food isn't amazing, but the portions are very large and the prices are low. A sushi dinner goes for £7 and most of their cooked foods katsu, teriyaki, etc. are under £5. I tried their sushi and was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. Not amazing, but not half bad.
This is a real student joint. Not date material unless your date is sixteen. Unless you're sixteen too, I'd say the whole thing is a bad idea and you should probably just stay home. But if you're a student or low-budget and dating someone age-appropriate go for it.",-1
4,"I make frequent visit to Misato ever since i discovered this place, which was like 5 years ago. Misato does good quality food. You will be amazed when you see how long the queue is during lunch and dinner time. Don't go in a big group because it would take you forever for a table as the restaurant itself is tiny.
Nonetheless, the portion is HUGE at Misato in comparison to other Japanese restaurants in London. I love their Curry Katsu Rice and Terriyaki Chicken Rice, they do good Tempura Udon as well. However, the sushi sets aren't the best food that they serve! Hot dishes like noodles and rice, are better quality-guaranteed compared to the cold dishes, e.g. sushi.
Anyway Misato is a good economic-choice if you want to spend less for some promising authentic Japanese food.",1
3,"The clients were mainly young Chinese and Asian when we had dinner last night. It was poring with rain, so we didn't have to wait.  If you want the basic Japanese, this is it.  Don't expect fancy, sophisticated meal here.  The best dish is Pork Cutlet Rice.  The portion is big and the pork lean and tasty.  But ask them not to put dressing which is basically mayonnaise. I was going to order Chicken teriyaki, but was told that it was deep-fried (menu said grilled), so I changed my mind. I have never heard of deep-fried teriyaki (teriyaki means grilled and basted with glaze) in my life. The popular dish we saw was the Chicken Karaage Rice.  It looked huge but had guey sauce on top - in Japan, it comes without the sauce - and I think it's way too heavy for me.  The price is very reasonable and we are happy to eat Pork Cutlet again soon.",-1
3,"the food is served in large portions, is very cheap for what it is, and is tasty/satisfactory. nothing about it will blow you away, but if you are looking for filling japanese staples which are less hard on the budget than usual, you'd do well to go here. 
i had a salted salmon bento box and my boyfriend a mixed sashimi bento. both came absolutely piled with food, and we both felt they offered good value for money (£8 each i think). the katsu plates at the table next to us were absolutely ginormous and were being devoured by students who ignored the salad part of the plate and powered through the chicken/pork and the rice. 
the staff here are brusque, bordering on surly. i don't mind quick, efficient service (which, for the most part it was), but i don't think it takes any extra effort to be polite with it, and i think they could perhaps amp up their politeness a level a touch. 
i've also read that queues can form outside this place. yes, it is good for what it is, but honestly if there was a queue, i wouldn't wait in it!",-1
4,"It's really a very generous portion for this reasonable price. My stomach literally showed after ate a half of it, however, my hands uncontrollably keep feed the SATO CURRY RICE to my untamed mouth. However, try not to go there in normal eating time like lunch or tea time, because there will be a long queue before you can get in this crowded little space.",1
5,"I give it five stars for quality and price. London is one expensive town, but if you can get the biggest serving of rice and A LOT of chicken (i got the chicken katsu with curry) and salad on the side..... all for £4.50 + everything tastes good, well then London just got a little bit cheaper. I just about died when i saw the prices as well as when i saw the servings! This place is generous. But beware, the line is a long one! I suggest eating half and taking the rest to go- it can't be healthy to eat an entire plate in one go!",1
5,"Ahhh, it has been nearly 4 years now since I lived in London, and I still think of Misato's Ginger Pork. Swoon. My boyfriend would also get the Chicken Katsu Curry. It was cheap, and the lines were always long. 
Anyway, I guess there's not a lot of value in reviewing places you haven't been in 3 years and say, 8 months.",1
4,"Not much to say, good Japanese food and above all, affordable offering generous portions. The only thing I wish not so many people knew about it, it s always full! Well done Misado!",1
3,"delicius and cheap...there's something wrong, no courtesy, bad staff and  not enough modern to be a suchi bar close Leicester Square!!!",-1
3,"Cheap and filling are the best words to sum up Misato. This is a great option if you're looking for a large filling meal for under 10 pounds in the West End. 
Misato serves the usual homestyle Japanese/Korean food including katsu curries, bentos and noodles, but for a price that is extremely reasonable. There are definitely better quality restaurants serving this kind of food all around the West End (Tokyo Diner comes to mind), but few other places do it for as cheap or as quick. Service is bare bones, but its mostly what you can expect in Chinatown and at this price point. 
The place fills up quickly on evenings with tourists and the student crowd from Asia, so be prepared to wait in line if you don't come early!",-1
5,"If I want Japanese or a cheap and cheerful meal in Soho, this is almost always where I come. There are almost always queues out of the door and the service reflects this with an emphasis on speed often making it a little brusque. They also won't let you sit down until your whole party has arrived so no sneaky queue tactics. I usually go for a bento box as they are excellent value and provide a bit of variety so you don't have to choose between sushi and a full meal. Not only are the portions massive but the food is also pretty good. Most people are young and pretty cool and you get the impression that they're all also regulars. Definitely one of my favourite London restaurants.",1
4,"Huge portions of decent Japanese food, great location, unbelieveable prices. What more could you ask for?
 Sure, the restaurant's pretty basic, but tables aren't crushed together to the point of discomfort. Service was also prompt and polite.
 The only downside with this place is that they don't take reservations, so there is almost always a long queue out the door of people waiting for seats.
 The day I was there, I ate the teriyaki chicken rice which was accompanied by a generous portion of salad. The sauce was delicious, and there was a lot of meat and a lot more rice. I ended up giving one third of the chicken to my dining companion because I simply couldn't finish!",1
5,This place does the best one plate meals! You are guaranteed to either not be able to finish everything or feeling very full up after eating. Affordable and well worth it! Be prepared for a long wait as this place is massively popular!,1
4,Would you believe this hole in the wall was our favorite restaurant in London.  My husband's tonkatsu plate was huge and delicious.  $10 for dinner was a bargain.,1
5,"I've been going to this place for years and i still love it. it's a casual restaurant but its really good value, the food is good and the portions are huge. You usually have to join a line to get a table but it moves quickly.",1
4,"Lovely little Japanese restaurant with speedy service, friendly staff, authentic Japanese atmosphere,  tasty and very affordable food. Left more than satisfied spending just £5. Highly recommended.",1
4,"I lived in London four years ago and still miss this place. Especially now that I've widened my digestive tract for American serving sizes, and I can't find a decent katsu curry place near where I live.
There are lines/queues out the door typically and limited seating, so don't come in with too big a group nor too many expectations of ""dining"" or ""service"". But of what I've sampled it's cheap and yum - though I've never had anything other than the katsu curry.",1
3,"There are always queues for Misato, which is a good sign really, because people are willing to stand outside for more than half an hour to have a meal there. Make sure you go somewhat early, to save the aforementioned queuing and you'll have a nice cheap meal that the hoards of students so obviously enjoy.
I like sashimi and miso soup here, as its very fresh however I'm not a fan of the chicken katsu curry as although the portions are really generous, the quality of the meat is not so great, which is why I stick to fish. Service can be abrupt but it's a cheap eat and you can't really expect them to bend over backwards when they are rushed off their feet non-stop.",-1
5,"I don't know how many times I walked on Wardour St and never noticed this tiny gem. I'm so lucky a friend of mine told me about it and actually brought me there.
 The place is small and obviously always crowdy, so be ready to stand in a long queue. The menu is simple and honestly you don't have a lot of dishes to choose from but the price and the amount of food is unbeatable. I ordered a Sushi bento and was enough naive to add a small bowl of rice... I seriously had some trouble finishing it!
 The food is very good and, having been in Japan, really authentic. They use wasabi in the sushi rice and this little detail tells a lot about how really japanese this place is. It's difficult to spend more than 15£ because people cannot understand how cheap this restaurant is until they go and eat there. Moreover, there is no service charge, but leaving Misato without leaving some kind of tips would make you feel very, very bad.",1
5,"This is my absolute favorite Japanese restaurant in Central London.
Food is tasty and portions are very generous. I almost always order the sushi bento, which has lots of sushi, salad, seaweed and dim sum style bits and pieces. I am addicted to the sushi bento! I tried other dishes, too and have never been disapointed.
Prices are very good however from the 01/01/11 they have introduced a discretional 10% service charge, which I don't agree with as the service isn't anywhere good. It is a canteen syle place and you are in and out very quickly. The waiting staff doesn't give you lost of time to look at the menu, they mixed up the order a couple of times and most of them hardly speaks english. The bill is on your table as soon as you finished your food.
There is a long queue most of the time, but it's something I accept as part of the experience.",1
5,"Loved the FOOD...
 Its very economical and after waiting in a LOOONGGGGGGGG Queue? It's Worth the wait...
 YUM!
 Try my fave Beef Rice, Torikara Age Rice, Pork tonkatsu
 While waiting for your food try ordering edemame beans...
 and Asahi Beer Perfect!
 Hope to see u there!!!",1
4,"Pointless review as this place doesn't need any, you can tell by the people queueing up outside even if it is not the place you would want to go in at the first glance.
One of the best value for money in central London I think. I'm almost going there once a week.
Pros:
 - Enormous food portion
 - Good sushi and good hot food (but fried, jap though)
 - So cheap!
 - Shy and reserved but nice staff
 Cons:
 - Busy so take time to go in sometimes (don't have to do the queue for take away though)
 - Not the nicest place, a bit small and dirty, packed
 - Cash only
 At the end, definitely a good place to eat. Maybe not for a romantic dinner, a party or to invit your family I guess.
Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
4,"I know and am very fond of Japanese food, having travelled to Japan very often some years back. The problem is that it can be quite expensive in London.
 We were all the more surprised to discover this establishment in Chinatown, while vaguely thinking about eating Chinese. A cursory glance at the menu (and prices) drew us in straight away.
 Pretty basic and no-frills, but at that price, I don't give a damn.Yakitori starters, followed by sushi and sashimi starters, with plenty of Japanese beer were very enjoyable indeed.
 Seemed to be a lot of students there, which reinforces the cost-effectiveness aspect.
 I don't understand comments from other Qypers who mentioned rude staff. Japanese people do not do rude. And they certainly didn't when we were there.
 Four stars for value.",1
2,"Two good things about this place are that the price is inexpensive and the food comes in a large portion. Other than that, I couldn't think of a reason to re-visit.",-1
5,"This is an awesome place for big eaters like me. Even better when I bring my girlfriend along as the portions are so enormous that she can only finish half of hers and I get to eat her remaing portion as well. So dinner always mange to fill me up and get me belly busted taking a full on one and a half portions. I suggest trying the Chicken Katsu Curry and add an omelette on top! The ultimate combination! The restuarant is a casual sort and offer quite a cheap night out. 
Do try to go earlier or later than normal dinner time as there is always a queue (quite long) in front of the shop. You will be reuquired to wait for between 30-45mins depending on the crowd. As a rough gauge, dinner for 2 with drinks cost about £15-20.",1
4,"I hadn't been here for years and was had a good meal with my Japanese wife and friend. It's cheap for sure and you get tons, it's almost like the Japanese noodle king (bethnal green road). I think for 3 people with a drink each was under £20 which in London for satisfying food is pretty amazing.
 What impressed me most was the quality of the Ten Don. Usually this is quite an expensive dish, and even for somewhere in the region of £6 it was good enough to go back again for. I wouldn't be against paying double for that in another restaurant.
 Meals starting around £4.50 and going up by a few pounds, you're pretty much spoilt for choice since everything seems affordable, and looking around at other tables, everything seems to look pretty tasty too!
 I'd only say 4*s because it's the kind of place that you come away feeling like you've just eaten cheaply, and although I don't want to spend lots of money on every meal, you don't really come away wanting to tell people about the place.. I guess it depends, but I'll be going back in the not to distant future I'm sure!",1
5,"love the beef udon and beef rice! they don't charge for 10% service fee and very nice staff ! always long queue and only cash available, but its worth after you tried their tempura!",1
4,"Great value Japanese in the heart of Soho - no fancy frills, just basic dishes at affordable prices!",1
5,"This was one of my favorite places in London to grab a quick bite to eat. I had a lot of sushi to eat for maybe half of the price I would regularly get anywhere else! I love this place, this place is very small and easy to miss so be sure to keep an eye out for it.",1
5,"I love this Japanese restaurant. A Japanese friend of mine once brought me here and we returned many many times. It gets busy at times, so you might have to wait, but it is worth the wait! In London prices, this is on the budget side of prices, you can get great sushi bento boxes, but they also serve lots of other bento boxes, noodles, rice, etc. etc. Portions are HUGE and being a girl, I could never finish everything on my plate. The staff is nice and friendly. Place is simple, but is def. a great eat. Not for a special romantic dinner or a first date, but for a simple lunch or hanging out  perfect.",1
5,"This place really doesn't need any reviews as the queue speaks for itself- any weekday a queue snakes out of the door even when it's raining! 
Why, when there are so many excellent japanese places in this part of london? The main attraction has to be the prices- standard for many of the Ramen places but exceptional when you have sushi and sashimi options, tempura and chicken in addition to the Tonkatsu set and other ramen house classics.
I often go for one of the bento options- nicely presented compartmented boxes with a couple of salads, some chicken, some rice and then your option - sashimi or sushi. All the portions are big no matter what you order and the price of a main course ranges from £6 for a large rice-based main course to just under £9 for a big bento box. And all this just a stone's throw from Leicester Square where everything is poor quality and overpriced!
So you arrive, and size up the queue. It'll take about 25 minutes to get inside. At least another 10 to order and then 10-15 for the first food to arrive. Should you wait? And it's starting to drizzle... 
Of course you should! You won't get better value for your money or better quality japanese food locally!",1
4,"Expect huge portions. If you are tiny, you can probably share a portion of rice with a friend. Taste-wise, the food is ok, nothing spectacular, but you don't really go to Misato for the taste. You go for the portion and the portion alone. For less than a tenner, you leave Misato with a happy tummy. Don't expect five-star environment or service. The place is tiny and the queue is long. Not a first date kind of place.",1
5,"This place is BY FAR my favourite Japanese restraunt. The staff are friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and the food-the reason we go to the restraunt obviously, is just AMAZING! Purse friendly. That is all I can say.",1
5,Amazing value for money. Excellent sushi and portions are massive. Definitely worth the visit.,1
4,"If you're hungry and want a huge plate of good cheap Japanese food, this is the place to go. However, you won't be welcome to sit long after you've finished eating! A little gem in the heart of London",1
5,"Now, I guess most people need to have their mindset refined before visiting Misato - it is a truly no frills restaurant. Imagine a restaurant version of easyjet and you are about there.
 Misato serves fairly decent food, true, you cannot sit there for long before their staff give you the bill, shortly followed by the stare, but for the price charged, I would not honestly expect more in the central London location. Their selection is not bad and the food comes pretty quickly so it does the job - granted the queue can be fairly lengthy if you arrive late, but for those that like cheap Japanese food, I cannot pick a better place in central London.",1
4,"One of my favourite places to have a satisfying and filling meal in London. Quality Japanese food at western sizes, and at great value! If ravenous, go for the chicken katsu, which is massive. They also have pretty good bentos. The crowded atmosphere is like any unstuffy eatery you'd find in the big Asian cities like Hong Kong or Singapore, but then again, the crowd, as many reviewers have said below, speaks for itself.",1
5,"Best japanese in london by far. If you want sushi on a roundabout go to kulu kulu, but if you want the authentic taste of back alley japan, this is it! The katsu curry is huge!!!! I dare anyone two eat two of these bad boys..... The shame is, that because I'm a bloke I will always go for the curry. In truth, the sushi is really good, the bento boxes are really swimmingly good, and their tempura is excellent. Washed down with a couple of kirin's this place is a perfect place to go before a heavy night out, or even a light lunch.",1
4,"This place is a good place for lunch but you have to be there earlier than other people. There is such a long queue usually. The queue goes right outside the restaurant to the pavement. If you manage to get a table, you'll know how good the food is. I would recommend anyone to wait. The food is great and it is not pricey as well. The staff there are friendly and helpful and it gives you a great atmosphere. They have hot dishes like noodles, rice and also sushi.",1
3,"If you are feeling seriously hungry and you want japanese, Misato is a pretty good bet. If you can get in, that is. It is cheap, tasty and the portions are HUGE. You'll be clutching your stomach before you leave the restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you want to linger over a romantic dinner - it's pretty much a japanese greasy spoon. I can recommend the bentos. Try and get there early though - the queues usually go some way down the street!",-1
5,"i haven't gone here for years but just happen to go pass this review page for the restaurant. when i did go there i always end up fully satisfied.although there is a wait for seating as this restaurant is quite well known.I don't understand why they don't relocate to a bigger space or maybe this is their marketing technique to lure people in and see what the curiousity is about. well they're right to be curious. the plates are very generous. i usually get the breaded chicken katsu curry and it just brings tears to my eyes because i would never waste one bit because it is that good. also on the side i would get californian roll. a very good place to bring a date,wouldn't be such a group hang out as there isn't usually enough space and you wouldn't really be seated together if you were.the staff are sooo friendly and very calm!still i reckon they should move elsewhere or at least bring another chain in!",1
5,"Misato is a cute Japanese restaurant which despite its basic layout, cooks excellent Japanese meals. Within the main streets of China town, in the centre of London, lies a small sized Japanese restaurant that owns queues, of customers, that end outside its door. The traditional cuisines provided such as pork kato curry, chicken teriyaki or katsudor are absolutely amazing. The menu has a trademark salad and I always wonder to myself, how do they concoct such a tasty salad crème? What's the recipe ? Give it to me! Another bonus is the price that is as cheap as £6.50 which is a bargain considering how large the plates are for such quality foods. You definitely get your moneys worth here as well as your traditional Japanese cooking. What I would suggest is to avoid the busy hours and come in advance such as 1pm or 5pm. No matter what day it is, the food is always in demand because its dishes are 'totemo subarashii' (super duper) and you can even get take away.",1
1,"The STAFF are UNBELIEVABLY RUDE!!! Ive been to this restaurant several times before because the food is very good value for the portion size but today I vowed that I will never go to Misato again. The staff must have some basic English yet they behave as if theyre mute, they dont seem to know the meaning of the word MANNERS as they do not greet customers and youd think theyd get shot if they were to manage a smile and a hello, instead they can just about mumble How many? as they point to the table. When you order theyre not attentive, the waitress today didnt have the common sense to think that as there were 2 of us that wed both want drinks, so several minutes after my partner got his drink, I brought this issue to her attention and she just rolled her eyes, didnt apologise and then just dumped the drink infront of me. Then when my partner had just about finished his meal the waitress quickly grabbed his plate away before he barely had the chance to put his chopsticks down! Keep in mind this wasnt peak time, it was mid afternoon and there wasnt the usual long queue and lack of seats. Then to top it all off, when the bill came the waitress gave us the wrong change and when we approached her about it she just slapped it onto my hand, again no apology, no thank you, no goodbye etc etc. If the staff were somewhat nice then I may have just left them the 5 Pounds as a tip but theyre not even worthy of 1p!!! If youd like to experience the epitome of WORST STAFF SERVICE then by all means go to Misato, otherwise spare yourself the misery and go elsewhere.",-1
5,"The hype is real! This place is so worth it. The ambiance, drinks, and food = incredible. Famous bathroom and millennial pink interior. I can't wait to go back!
Simon and Valentin were wonderful hosts. They made incredible recommendations and Valentin's drinks are THE BEST.
Literally want to move to London. This was our final meal before flying Home and we are both so smitten. 
Highly, highly recommend!!",1
5,"11/5 dining experience. Hands down. 
Sketch was worth every single penny. During my recent trip to London, me and my girls knew that we had to have high tea. It was almost my birthday and my friend had recently just gotten a promotion, so we were in the mood to spend $$ and celebrate. Enter Sketch. 
Sketch has 5 different dining rooms, each with their own ""special"" experience and theme. Room 1: The Glade - Enchanted forest themed, specializing in lunch and cocktails. Room 2: The Gallery - Brasserie/All Pink Everything, specializing in afternoon high tea and dinner. Room 3: The Parlour, specializing in all day dining + live music and cocktails, Room 4: The Lecture Room - a Michelin star restaurant, specializing in lunch and dinner menus. Room 5: The East Bar/Pods/Bathrooms - a small modern space themed bar, also the bathrooms. 
We dined in Room 2: The Gallery for high tea. Immediately upon walking in you're taken aback by the beautiful pink decor and cute watercolour art on the walls. There are servers walking around in different uniforms, each with their own specific duty - ""caviar man"", ""tea expert"", and ""champagne lady"" to name a few. 
Our tea lady/main server came by and explained the menu to us. She asked if we wanted to upgrade our teas to a champagne tasting, and at that point, we said ""sure, why not?"". And so we upgraded. 
For teas, they had a large selection of delicious teas from around the globe. Along with the champage, we each got our own pot of tea. I sampled two different ones: a Sri Lankan Earl Grey and an Indian Chai. To be honest, I can't pick between the two. Both were the best teas I've ever tried. No joke. Added a little bit of milk and sugar to them and was truly blown away. And to think this was just the teas. 
On to my favourite part: the food. First, we had an appetizer: sea salt and butter breadsticks with caviar and quail eggs. I have never had caviar before, but I have to say, I was impressed. I see why people eat this stuff all the time. Paired with the creamy quail egg and breadsticks, I was in foodie heaven. Second, the mains: unlimited finger sandwiches, cakes, and treats. I can't even remember everything that was there, but I do know that I love everything that I tried. My two favourites: the curried chicken sandwich and the salmon and cream cheese roll. I had to get more of these because I loved them so much. I have much more of a savoury palette than sweet, so I preferred all the sandwiches to the cakes. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the cakes. The blueberry cake was my favourite! At this point we were so full and we had completely forgotten that we had a third course: scones and more cakes. We all opted for the plain scones, paired with butter and your choice of strawberry or plum jam. I'm not the biggest fan of jam, so I just stuck to the good ol' butter. I wish I had more room for this because it was SO good. 
One of my favourite parts about this experience? The bathrooms. You go through a pair of doors and up the stairs. When you look up the ceiling is covered in neon-coloured square lights. The bathrooms itself... are eggs pods. With each egg pod being one bathroom stall. Truly one of the best (and fanciest) peeing experiences I've had to date. 
All in all, I loved every single minute of dining at Sketch. Everything from the attention to detail to the beautiful decor, to the delicious food and presentation to the classical band playing classic tunes, everything was absolutely perfect and now no other high tea experience will ever compare. 
PS: Make a reservation because this place books up months in advance!",1
5,"After seeing this restaurant on Instagram, my girlfriend and I decided to make a reservation here a couple of days before our stay in London. Once we read reviews off here, we decided to go with Afternoon Tea at the Gallery. 
Visually, the space is beautiful. Upon entering, it's dark, quiet, and you'd never guess that the inside of this restaurant has whimsical themed rooms inside of it. Inside the Gallery, the walls are full of art, placed upon pink walls. Pretty much everything in the room was pink, but it wasn't anything overwhelming. The waiters and waitresses were dressed in suits and costumes while a couple of violinists played every few minutes. Of course, you'd have to visit the washroom - it'll likely be the most interesting one you'll ever visit. The ambiance of the restaurant was busy, but enjoyable. 
In terms of the food, it was pretty decent. We went with the cheapest option possible, giving us endless amounts of tea. We both opted for matcha and chai tea, which you can't go wrong with. What I didn't know is that if you enjoyed any of the cakes or sandwiches, you could ask for more at no cost. I was delighted to find this out because I assumed that I'd only be given the portions given initially! When looking at photos of the food from reviews, I thought I would be hungry leaving, due to the portion sizing. I can tell you that I left full, and satisfied. 
If you're interested in eating at Sketch, I would definitely recommended having Afternoon Tea at The Gallery. If you end up doing so, make sure you take many photos! I'm sure you'll never see anything like it again.",1
5,"Top experience @ Sketch Tea Time! Service was impeccable and the quality of the food, tea and flow of this event is well worth it!",1
1,"Worst, worst, worst!
I definitely do not have anything great to say about sketch.
My husband and I came here back two Saturday nights ago; we were both super hyped about dining here. Unfortunately the evening was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.
We arrived for our reservation at 10:00 p.m. and were promptly sat at our table. The server handed us our menus and said that she would be back.
We wanted to start our meal with a bottle of wine which we had to wait for the sommelier to come over to actually order(mind you we already were set with what we wanted) 
Finally it came time to order our meals. My husband tried to order the steak and was told they were out for the evening; he proceeded to ordered the lamb, and yet again we were told they were out of it! Why was this not told to us prior to placing our order?! We definitely would have left immediately. He ended up having to order the bone marrow(not great and lacked flavor)
I ordered the tortellini and was not overly impressed by the preparation of the dish(pretty Bland)
The final straw of the experience at Sketch was the fact that my husband had a half glass of wine in front of him and after we were finished paying the bill the bus person took the glass away without even asking if we were finished.
Sketch definitely has a lot of work to do before reaching the standards of a high end restaurant.
I come to London often and will definitely not be returning to this place.
Thanks for a horrible evening.",-1
5,"Advance reservation is recommended. We walked in the first time hoping to sit, quickly realizing that Sketch was booked for the weeks to come. Then we happen to be shopping in SoHo on the last day before leaving London, so I decided to try my luck again for any cancelled reservation. The host and hostess there were kind and were accommodating where possible. Second time around we were able to grab a quick bite in the forrest themed side of the cafe and really appreciate it.
Sketch has two rooms, one being the renowned pink room, the other being what I call the Alice and Wonderland themed room, both are extraordinary! We visited between 3pm-5pm when they offer afternoon specials. We ordered two sets of combos, one with regular cones and the other with sandwiches. The first came with tea but the second did not. In terms of tea, we had rose and earl grey, both were phenomenal. Rose was lighter than earl grey of course, which was perfect for me since I don't usually drink tea. It was refreshing and we asked for additional hot water to reuse the paddles and tea pouch. 
Sandwiches were unique as well. The four sandwiches were a mix of devil's egg, smoke salmon, cucumber, and curry. The small plate was filled with delicate creativity and the taste blended well. The cone on the other hand sounded like a standard afternoon tea side but was not nearly as impressive as the sandwich to me. The cone was a bit dry, though they provide a few fruit jams to go with it. Would certainly recommend the former combo than latter here.
Atmosphere and service needless to say was impeccable. Really gave us a comfortable while also classy afternoon tea feel. The pricing was also affordable in my opinion for such an experience. We paid around $50 for two people but were able to try a number of delicates while spending quantity and quality time with gourmet decoration in the view.
Highly recommend for anyone!",1
5,"I personally think this place was worth the money. I came for afternoon tea. I was a solo traveler so I just made a reservation for myself which didn't seem that weird. Definitely make a reservation. I booked my in advance and I also booked the earliest available which was nice to walk around and take pictures easily. The attention to detail is amazing. From the hop scotch entrance, the menu, the bathroom... everything is so thought out and stylized. The bathrooms are so cool, they are a must to go in. The afternoon tea food was small but I was surprisingly very full when I was done. You also get some additional things like a biscuit and egg thing that were good. You technically get unlimited food but what they gave was enough, and I had about 3 pots of tea. The passion fruit one was yummy. If you're visiting it's a great spot to go to that feels very chic!",1
3,"I had to come here after seeing gorgeous pictures of the dining hall for dinner. I made reservations online about a week before, and that whole process was super simple.
The atmosphere did NOT disappoint. The dining area is every bit as magical and beautiful as social media makes it appear. Normally I wouldn't try to take pictures of a dining area, but I was giddy and I just had to! Luckily, the staff is used to this and other patrons were doing the same thing; I wasn't reprimanded for my actions. 
So why the three stars? The ambiance gets 5/5 stars. The food and service is three stars at best. I got peppered steak and it was super dry and tough. It did NOT taste that great. It wasn't bad, but  I was really hoping for something better. I got the mac and cheese as a side, and it wasn't terrible--just different. I liked the creamy texture, but there was some sort of curry powder in it, and it took some time to get used to. My husband got the bone marrow, and he didn't think it was great.
Our server was a little odd. She forgot about us, and then she'd remember and hover--AS WE ATE. Awkward!
If I could, I'd skip dinner and come here for tea. The tea is in the same area as dinner, and I'd rather have subpar tea than a supbar meal for dinner.",-1
2,"The ambience is nice, but the food is bad. We had lunch in glade. The only part we enjoyed were the desserts. The appetizers were especially bland. The fish was not fresh at all.",-1
4,"You have to go for the ambiance alone! We went for high tea, as that was the only open reservation and we booked 3 months ahead of time. My advice book in advance or stop by in the morning to see if they have any last minute openings. The food isn't amazing but that's not why you go to Sketch! Don't forget to check out the bathroom",1
5,"My friend has been raving about Sketch and how much he loves it everytime he comes back from visiting London. So on our recently short weekend in London, we made a reservation and came here for dinner and it did not disappoint. It's very modern and lavish with a very trendy twist. When you arrive, the walls are all covered in very modern and beautiful art.
If you are looking to come here, I would highly suggest you make a reservation prior to coming. We came over a weekend and reservations are super important as they were people being turned away at the door.
We ate in the Gallery Room that night, which has it's high and vast ceilings in a beautiful pink, with matching furniture. The walls are covered with vibrant and witty art work- the whole ambiance is a lot of fun but still very chic. The food we ordered was delicious and there are a lot of healthy options to pick from. The menu is also very cool, it looks like a modern cullinary pop up book. Make sure you remember to order some cocktails as they are very tasty... they have a few bar areas and each room is decorated vibrantly and differently- it's a visual feast and it's no wonder Sketch has some Michelin Stars under its belt. It's a great and beautiful restaurant/ bar/ lounge / club. 
Before your experience at Sketch is over, be sure to stop by the bathroom- they all look like eggs. If that sounds bizarre to you, just take my word for it and go see for yourself when you have the chance to eat and drink at sketch. Can't wait for my next trip to London, Sketch will for sure be on that list of to do's!
Gallery Room- Michelin *
Lecture Room- Michelin **",1
4,Quirky and fun atmosphere. There are different themed venues within Sketch. Had afternoon-tea here and I couldn't stop taking photos. Don't forget to stop at the restroom to see the playful egg-shaped cubicles.,1
5,"1000th Review!!!!
When in London we knew we wanted to do an afternoon tea, I did some research and found the cutest place and knew we had to try it! The place I found was Sketch and I couldn't wait to go.
At the entrance is a hopscotch so you can hop your way in, me being uncoordinated thought it best I keep both feet on the ground lol
We walked towards the hostess desk for the Gallery to be shown to our seat, and when we walked in the gallery, I knew this was going to be a great experience, beautifully chevron floor, lush velvety pink benches and chairs, white linen tablecloths, soft pink walls, funky hand painted art on the walls, it was everything I expected it to be but so much more, and that's just from walking into the room, the experience just kept getting better.
Service was impeccable, everyone looked sharp in their uniforms.
We did the afternoon tea for 58 pounds. It came with unlimited choices of teas, I wish I remembered the names of the teas, but I did try a vanilla tea and Darjeeling black tea (one of my favorites). 
The afternoon tea comes with a lot, we started out with caviar and quail egg and cheese bread, next a beautifully presented tray came decked out with little finger sandwiches and sweets, everything was too pretty to eat, but don't worry, I did eat them. My favorites were the chicken and egg sandwiches. And we learned the sandwiches are unlimited, what? That's crazy!  Then we were treated to warm scones with fresh clotted cream and fig & strawberry jams. Is there anything better than a warm scone with fresh cream and jam? I think not!  But wait we are not done yet, but sadly we were full and asked if the dessert from the trolley could be packed up to go.
Everything at Sketch exceeded my expectations, I truly was tickled pink by the entire experience.  Even the egg pod bathroom lived up to the Instagram hype.",1
3,"I went here for the first time about a month ago.
LOCATION: It's in Mayfair, which is a nice area of the city. 4/5
ATMOSPHERE: The ambience is amazing. We were in The Gallery (so I can only really speak for that), which is the most famous room of theirs (they have four main rooms). There's pink furniture and decor everywhere, and interesting/cool art on the walls. It's also very clean and pristine. I love it. Also, the iconic bathroom is super cool. So if you don't know about it, check it out if you go because it is an experience -- egg-shaped toilet stalls, colorful lights -- take an iconic mirror picture. So yeah, the atmosphere is definitely supreme. 4/5
SELECTION: So we went during dinner time when they serve their ""a la Carte"" menu, and not their famous afternoon tea menu. So the menu is fairly small, but I do appreciate the few labeled vegan options. However, I wish there was more, or at least a better/more unique variety, rather than a salad, a soup-type dish, and a tofu dish. Also, I was going to order the salad, but was told that I couldn't unless at least one other person ordered it too, I guess? That was a bit of a disappointment, but I dealt with the soup-type dish -- more on that below. 3/5
WHAT I GOT: I got their ""Green Le Puy lentils, button mushrooms, snow peas"" dish. It was basically like a soup. It comes out as a shallow bowl of lentils, mushrooms, and peas, but then they pour some sort of broth thing over it right in front of you. It was alright overall, but definitely not anything worth raving about. I liked that it wasn't oily or salt. And, the ingredients tasted fresh and good quality. But, it was very small and not filling. They make it seem like a bigger portion by serving it in a larger looking bowl, but it's actually super shallow, so it's literally like half a cup's worth. I know it's a nice, fancy dining establishment, but it's a ripoff to pay £20 for no more than like half of cup of veggies. They should at least put like some grains in it or use a deeper bowl to make it more sustaining. That's my opinion on the dish. 3/5
SERVICE: The staff seemed nice, but their service was kind of awkward. First off, when I went to the front desk to say that I had a reservation, the man said to wait five minutes and then come back to ask again. I came back five minutes later and still had to wait a bit, but then we were finally seated a few minutes later. Ok, so that wasn't too bad, but then it's confusing when you're seated because you have a waiter/waitress, and then a drink person to take drink orders. But, they don't really explain that. Anyways, after figuring that out, the waitress we had would either hover around our table or disappear throughout our dinner, which was strange. Or we'd be talking about the menu and she'd keep coming over, like asking if we had questions and whatnot a bunch. On to the drinks guy: one person I was with with ordered a Pimm's. Normally, you'd expect that when you order a Pimm's, you get the drink with the Pimm's, lemonade, and fruits. However, a glass of straight Pimm's, the straight liquor, came out. We tried Googling it, and found that the only thing it could be called was a Pimm's Cup, so we looked for someone who looked like they maybe knew about drinks better, and found a young guy. After explaining the situation and the different names and all that, he seemed to understand what we were expecting because about 5-10 minutes later it finally came out as expected ... I mean, whenever I've been to pubs and whatnot in the city, there were no questions asked, and a Pimm's comes out properly, with the lemonade and fruits mixed in. Maybe we're missing something and at nicer places you have to call them Pimm's Cups? Anyways, that was our experience with the staff/service. I'd still go back for afternoon tea though. 2/5",-1
5,"Ok this place is a MUST go to for dinner.  It has two distinct rooms to eat in, the library and the gallery, 5 different and unique bar settings and the food, cocktails, and,wine list are superb.
Additionally the bathroom are a series of pod in a surreally lit room 
I really can't recommend this place enough for experience alone 
Portions are a bit small, but still filling and the desserts were a flavor parade 
If you are in London you check it out",1
5,"This place is MUST go when visiting London! (VERY Instagram worthy photo opportunities throughout the entire restaurant)
Let's start off by walking into the restaurant playing hop skotch while admiring the wonderful display of artwork. Sketch has 4 different rooms with completely different themes. My friend and I had afternoon tea in the Parlour Room and it was beautifully decorated with witty artwork and pink everywhere!
The service staff was great and the atmosphere gave me a comfortable yet classy afternoon tea feel. I loved that the owner had two things he was passionate about (art & high tea) and combined it into one of the most unique places I have ever been.
Make sure to stop by the restroom before you leave! When you open the double doors, you enter a white room with a staircase up to egg-shaped bathroom pods!
If you are looking for a unique experience in London, this is the place to be!",1
4,"My girlfriend and I came here Monday for dinner while we were in town. Overall it was a pretty good experience. To be honest, it was more of a 3.5 star than 4. 
Things got off to a rocky start when our waitress assumed I was male (spoiler: I'm not!). She profusely apologized which made it 
more awkward as other tables began to look over. Also, the bathroom situation is more weird and uncomfortable than cool. They are these bizarre white pods. The bathroom attendant tried to usher me over to the men's side, making things again extremely uncomfortable.
I guess women can't have short hair in the UK.
Anyway, on to food/drinks. 
I had the invisible cocktail which was delicious. It was more sweet than I usually care for, but delicious none the less. My girlfriend had a carafe of wine, to be honest I don't know which one, but she enjoyed it none the less.
For appetizers, we had the white asparagus which was pretty good. The best part was the herb veloute sauce it came in. We also had the Potato and Thyme bread which was yummy as well.
For dinner, I had the Aubergine and black garlic tortellini. It was delicious! The baby aubergine and zucchini that accompanied the tortellini were delicious. My girlfriend had the Veal Milanese and a side of mashed potatoes. I tried a bite of the veal which was tasty, but the mashed potatoes were dry and I thought I would choke trying to swallow them. 
Overall, I'm glad we came here. The decor and vibe is fun and trendy (we sat in The Gallery room) but the food is nothing to rave about. Although I will say it was one of the better meals we had while visiting.",1
5,"Absolutely LOVED the interior. I was sad when I couldn't book a spot for the afternoon tea but at least I got a glance of the room on the way to the restroom. 
The brunch room is Alice in wonderland themed, I was in love with the velvet chair and the beautiful green decorations. They were playing ""live"" music from this automatic piano the whole afternoon, it reminded me of Westworld.
They had a good selection of cocktail, I went for the Bloody Mary and it was really good! The food was good too, I had the risotto and the boyfriend had some kind of pork belly dish that was really delicious. The beef tartare was just okay. The service throughout our time there was superb, the servers were friendly and attentive. 
Will definitely try to book the afternoon tea if I ever come back to London!",1
3,"Arguably could be the coolest and most beautiful restaurant I've ever been to, with themed rooms and plenty of space to walk around.
The food and drinks, however, are quite rough around the edges. My wife and I were very excited for the food to be just as great as the place is stunning, but it's quite the opposite. Everything was dry, oddly-flavored, and ridiculously expensive. The drink selection is interesting... but that's about as far as it goes.
So if you're coming for the food, do yourself a favor and switch it to just come for drinks or tea, just to experience how incredible the place itself is.",-1
5,"Sketch deserves the award for most adorable restaurant in the world. If I had a little sister, I'd take her here everyday. This would certainly make me broke though, so thankfully she doesn't exist.
From the couches to the walls, the dining hall is absolutely covered with cutesy pink decor. My favorite part of the restaurant, however, is actually the bathroom. The egg-shaped cubicles are these futuristic pods reminiscent of the movie Alien.
Oh, and the afternoon tea itself? Absolutely brilliant.",1
4,"Sketch is beautiful and an experience for all your senses. I would recommend trying it at least once. After much anticipation I finally had lunch at the Glade. It was like being in a beautiful painting. It has a forest theme, which can be seen everywhere from the walls and ceiling to the carpet which actually looks like grass, to the food. 
The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the portions are really small and I think it's a little overpriced. However, the ambience makes up for it and the food is tasty. There were 2 of us and we had the 3 course lunch. I had the spaghetti courgette for starters, which was a great combination of flavors. For mains I had the steak which was a little chewy. It could definitely be improved. The dessert was by far my favourite. I ordered the chocolate biscuit which was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend it! My brother had the red fruits with red fruit sorbet which was refreshing and tangy.
Do go to the bathroom on your visit- one of the most creative designs I've ever seen! Overall a great place for a Sunday lunch.",1
4,"I've never been to such a cool spot in all my life. Think ambiance multiplied a thousand times over. The French really know what they are doing when it comes to decor for an upscale cocktail lounge. The artistry and immaculate details that make up Sketch are mind blowing. Then when you walk to the bathroom thru the double doors you enter a white room with a spiral staircase up to cosmic eggs  that you open the door to with birds chirping in the background. It was surreal. The pink gallery room where you dine is surrounded by paintings all around with humorous ""play on word"" art. The service is impeccable with a twist of French flair and panache. The cocktails and food are secondary to the atmosphere, it's probably the only time you wont care how good the food or drinks are(they actually weren't all that good ), its that rare of a place.",1
5,"As a designer I love to doodle and draw, naturally Sketch caught my attention because of the Gallery art and pastel pink decor. While in London, I knew I had to stop here for a tea party, since I first saw the gorgeous interior that resembles a Wes Anderson movie set of the Gallery, and the bathroom of individual giant egg shaped potty's with bird sounds once inside, resembling Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: Space Odyssey from yes, an Instagram post by Kimberly Gordon of Selkie & Wildfox. 
All about the aesthetically pleasing presentation and tasty. It's not cheap, but it is worth it, particularly for a birthday or date ideal, very charming.
I arrived a bit early so I had a cocktail in the lounge, also cute lots of neon as I awaited.
I went for afternoon tea, I had the Oriental Beauty Tea, which was subtle and complimented the sweet deserts, pastries and finger food sammiches. speaking of design, the menu was adorable, and tells a story of each course, and item. The plates may seem small but I was full by the time the cake came out I could hardly eat it! favorite sandwhiches were my favorite.
I would highly suggest reservations are made ahead of time up to possibly two weeks in advanced, as this place books fast and might not have openings.",1
4,Only had a drink but it was delicious. Fun place with great vibes and music.expect top prices.,1
5,"I don't even drink tea, but I drank it here for Instagram. The tea set was ADORABLE and I don't understand tea, but it tasted great! I'm getting ahead of myself tho!
I loved my experience at Sketch. Everyone who knows me knows that I am incredibly dedicated to my Instagram, so I was clearly excited to be able to go and dine here. The place was so artsy and perfect. The furniture, the art and just everything was so well-designed. I loved loved loved it. To my surprise, the food was also great, which is pretty unusual for pretty places like this one. 
Overall, great experience. Loved the place. If you go there, don't forget to visit the bathroom!",1
5,"Went with some coworkers while in town for work.
This place is AMAZING. There was a bit of a hiccup with the service at the start (we just sat there for a bit) and had to be a bit direct about wanting to order drinks and such.
The drinks were EPIC. The whole group loved their drinks and some of us order more than one :)  I had the lamb mixed with this deconstructed lamb stew/rice (but like a mash? Not an actual stew)... it was amazing. I wish I had ordered two :)
The ambiance is super cool. They have new designers come in every so often, and every room (incl. the bathrooms) are really unique. 
Would definitely take people here in the future",1
1,"My friends and I were visiting London for a week. Decided to check them out for lunch. All the pictures on line looks cute. We made reservations 2 weeks in advance.
Arrived at the restaurant 10 mins early. The host said that we were early and will not be able to seat us until our reservation time. Our reservation time came and went. They seated everyone else who came after us. Kept apologizing for overbooking. 40 mins into the wait, the host pointed to a small table by the entrance occupied by an old couple. Said as soon as they were done with their meal, they will set it up for 4 people. They did not look like they were closed to finishing. At that point, we gave up and left.",-1
5,"Is Sketch Lecture Room & Library really Michelin starred? It is and is truly deserved. Sketch is amongst the very best I ever tasted. (May be until the bill hits you where it really hurts but it is so worth it if taste matters to you as much as it matters to me). 
Just get the preset menu, forget about taking notes and trying critique individual courses. Taking notes would be an inappropriate distraction from a sensual taste experience. The drawback: My fellow Yelper cannot get detailed recollections, because describing heavenly taste experiences in words is not so easy - and probably impossible for me to express the wonders in words. 
Of course I also had wonderful company; friends from Boston whom we seem to run into in different countries. Remarkably, one of these friends has a seafood allergy - what a curse. But Sketch handled it better than any other place. 
We skipped the wine pairing. I was tempted (as always) but not everyone in our party was enzymatically capable. Hence, we got a Sancerre rose bottle (or two) which worked well through out dinner. 
WINNER!",1
5,"A must when visiting London!
One of my best adresses in the city. 
So original, go check out their photos and you will understand.
There are a few rooms with different ambiances. A restaurant, a bar, even cool washrooms.
Worth seeing. Beautiful design.",1
4,"When I thought of doing high tea in London, I imagined stuffy atmospheres with a crowd that wasn't my own. When I was told about sketch, though, I knew I found my sweet spot and dream spot to have my first appropriate high tea.
Sketch was Alice in Wonderland meets high fashion meets acid trip art...and it all went incredibly well together. We made a reservation for tea (this is a MUST!) and were seated in a corner booth that oversaw their entirely pink tearoom. From the couches to the paint to the waitstaff's outfits/uniforms, there wasn't a surface that wasn't touched with this color. With that and the quirky artwork on the walls, it really set the tone for what would be a unique experience.
We did the tea with a glass of rosé to add some bubbles to our meal. Admittedly, I was nervous about the menu because there items on it (quail egg and caviar, to name a few) which I never imagined myself eating, and I was so surprised by how every sandwich and dessert I had I liked. And not only did I enjoy every bite, but I left feeling beyond full; like, top button undone full.
The most important item to have liked would have been the tea and, needless to say, it was incredible. I had a black tea that had notes of vanilla to it and another tea that was lightly infused with rose buds. The latter was so good I ordered two pots of it. 
Overall, it was a brilliant high tea and I can't wait to fly back to London and return to Sketch!
Oh. And the bathrooms are like an episode of Black Mirror - slightly eerie but very intriguing. Can't say I've ever peed in a giant bird's egg before.",1
5,"Coming from West Covina, California I can definitely say that I have never been to such an amazing/ artistic breakfast/brunch place. The whole experience was so unique and enjoyable. Why? Let me tell you why. It all started from walking through the streets of London, seeing all these name brand stores and finally getting to the cute artistic restaurant ""Sketch"". There were multiple rooms and through each room it was a different theme. All the waitresses and waiter has assigned uniform dresses and informed us that the theme of each room changes as well as their uniforms. Please do not get me started with the restroom, it was the most beautiful restroom I had ever seen, I went in there multiple times just to take more photos. It literally looked like walking into Heaven, which is funny cause it was a restroom. 
In the restaurant, there were 4 different rooms and each room had a different theme. The room we were in was more edgy, I was say. But, the room that caught my attention was definitely the pink room. The pink room was so cute, everything pink. The couches, the tables, and even the desserts! Not only was the place AMAZING, the people had such great service. If you ask me if i would go back, it would be an absolute YES!",1
5,"Not just a beautiful place to dine, but delicious food as well! My sister and I came here for Afternoon Tea and were fortunate enough to dine in the gorgeous David Shrigley's Gallery. We were obsessed with India Mahdavi's pink velvet chairs. They were so comfortable to sit in too! Their tea sandwiches and pastries were all absolutely delicious. My favorite was their caviar and quail egg dish. Probably the best Afternoon Tea experience we've ever had. Service was amazing and everyone was so nice. My sister and I had such a fun time at Sketch and would love to come back.
Reservations are highly recommended since Sketch can be very busy! You won't be disappointed!",1
5,"This is one of those bucket list places for me. When I was looking for places to go in London, I found this place because of all the amazing photos of their bathroom, pink tea room and entry way. When I walked in, the tea room and bathroom took my breath away. The service here is next level as they have multiple waiters to assist with setting up the tea. They also have an upgraded tea with caviar and champagne. My brother and I chose the upgraded tea and were promptly given champagne and our caviar. The tea options were great, they had the traditional teas as well as others that were different. The plate of snacks they give you is ample with the coronation chicken salad being my favorite. The waiter also slid us a few more sandwiches at our request. If you are in London, do yourself a favor and give an afternoon to Sketch",1
4,"This place is pretty interesting.  Lots of douchey people and it has a very club atmosphere.  It is most definitely an Instagrammers dream.  The bathroom is amazing, lol.
The food and drinks were good, but not worthy of the price.  But hey, you come here for the total experience and it is pretty cool.",1
4,"Food is 3.5 but the atmosphere and decor is 5!! The whole restaurant resembles Alice in wonderland, with the pink decor, cute tea cups and waiters representing the characters in the story. 
The tea biscuits are meh for the price you pay. I love their sandwiches but didn't like any of the dessert - they also don't have the scones until the last.",1
4,"This place is awesome. It has 4-5 different rooms with completely different themes, purposes and rules. Obviously, don't forget to check out the bathrooms (women are on the right and men are on the left, btw). We came here for afternoon tea and since we were here during the week of the royal wedding, it was a bit of a special edition. We opted for the champagne tea - note, everything (except the caviar and alcohol) are all-you-can-eat so don't be afraid to ask for more. Also, try as many teas as you can while you're there. 
All the food was fantastic, we were even served a small piece of the same royal wedding cake that Meghan and Harry had at their wedding just a few days prior! The service, however, was a little bit spotty. It took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come by our table after being initially seated. The waiter never came to check on us, only to serve us our different courses. He also forgot to bring the additional food that I had requested (I ended up being full by the end so gave up on asking for it). It ended up being about 250 pounds for 2 people (quite pricy IMO). The courses were spaced rather far apart and with that, and the waiter hardly ever coming by, we were there for about 3 hours in total (maybe 30-60 minutes longer than I would have liked). There's a couple other places for afternoon tea that I want to try, but I'm just hoping that we had a stroke of bad luck for our service and that wasn't the standard for this place.",1
4,"First time to London.  Great place for food and drinks and WOW what s celebration.  We had drinks, Appetizers, main course and dessert.  Service was splendid",1
3,"As my friend describes it, this place is violently pink. 
I made a reservation during the Mayfair Flower Show, and the exterior along with the characters of the staff gave it a Alice in Wonderland feel. The afternoon tea was 80 GBP, and with the additional glass of champagne, the whole thing came out to 120 GBP per person, which is a bit crazy to be honest, but I figured this is probably going to be my first and last time here. The service was good, and the staff were in character. The afternoon tea was quite standard, but with the added caviar for starter. 
The toilets was another thing, it was very unexpected. Firstly you can't tell which side is for men and which side is for women when you enter. The toilets are in this egg shaped containers that has jungle music playing inside. It is the strangest experience, and I can't say I enjoyed it. 
Frankly, I think this place is only good for the instagram pictures, so if you want to pay an arm and a leg for a good gram, this is the place to go!",-1
4,Really cool place to visit ! Alice in wonderland themed ... food was tasting ... service was good ... had a pleasant afternoon with friends. Bathrooms were completely different.,1
5,"A very enjoyable experience. Visually, the interior (of the ""lecture room & library"", which is the 2 Michelin star restaurant) was surreal with interesting modern touches, while still having substance in the decor. The bars on the lower levels are not up to the same care of decoration. 
The food was an excellent, a multi-course tasting menu, which was in the modern French style. Some dishes were more experimental in their flavors (eg. saffron ice cream), but there was a cohesive substance within the recipes that made the majority of courses work. My favorites were the salmon and foie gras dishes. The food reminds me of Abac in Barcelona, but not quite executed with the same level of orchestration. It was very good; truly an exceptional experience.
In addition, the service was very friendly and hospitable. At the end of the meal, I was given a miniature menu, which included a long list of ingredients used for each course. This was a very nice touch! I highly recommend trying Sketch for dinner.",1
4,"Afternoon Tea Review:
Afternoon Tea at Sketch is certainly an experience. It's an incredibly fun, yet super relaxing way to spend a few hours. My husband and I laughed at the artwork on and off the whole time. It was great to sit in a room that had on and off live music (string trio).
The food -- 
I will say that I was very happy that once our waiter knew I was pregnant, Sketch made adjustments to all of the food items that can be risky to consume (caviar, undercooked egg, smoked salmon, and pate). I didn't ask them to do this; but when they came out with the food they clearly explained the substitute sandwiches and even put cauliflower rice balls on a spoon so I could pretend to eat caviar. Cauliflower is not caviar, but it was a kind gesture! 
I'm not sure how much you can escalate tea sandwiches, but this level of the 3-tiered serving platter was the most enjoyable for me. The presentation was perfect, yet nothing really blew my mind. I liked that you could get more of the sandwiches that you liked best. The deserts were fabulous -- even if I found some of them too rich/sweet for my taste buds. I should have saved more room for the scones. If you have a sweet tooth, this is a MUST experience. 
Yes, the bathroom was insane. I will say that I got completely nauseous walking in there after being in the pink room for almost an hour -- the sudden change in lighting and the mirrors over the sinks made me feel incredibly dizzy. It wasn't just me and my pregnancy -- my husband felt the same way. Just a warning!",1
3,"Overrated & not that good. Don't book & pay for the pink room... you can see if from afar if you need. 
Go to the brunch room with the more green aesthetic - it's pretty great. 
Definitely go for a drink one night to check out the weirdo bathrooms -- they're currently decorated for spring in a quiet absurd way... also theres bird music while you're peeing...",-1
5,"Overall: 5/5.
Atmosphere: 5/5.
Tchouki: 5/5 (originality 5/5, presentation 5/5, flavor 5/5). Might strike some as a tad sweet, but must order for the clever presentation and creative combinations.
Tiramisu: 5/5 (originality 5/5, presentation 5/5, flavor 3.5/5). Must order simply to see a traditional dessert rendered in an ingenious and beautiful way.",1
5,"Completely bonkers concept.
A
Visual treat. I love how each space is an entirely different aesthetic and mood. 
Capable and professional staff.
If you seek a feeling of exclusivity, this place is for you.
The bathroom ""pods"" are a trip and you should visit them.
Try to see each room if you can. A wild sensorial ride!",1
4,"Let me start out by saying 1) I love afternoon tea 2) I'm a chocoholic 3) I love creative&innovative  decor.  The food was a 3.5 stars for me, while he atmosphere and ambiance was a solid 5! We came with a reservation booked 2 weeks in advance. 
AFTERNOON:
After you are seated you get a mini booklet of the teas, sandwiches and desserts you will get during the afternoon tea. 
+ 1st course: their take on a egg and toast with caviar 
+ 2nd course: 3 tiers  of sandwiches and dessert. The sandwiches were very artfully presented and quite yummy. The dessert were too fruity for me, as I mentioned I'm a chocolate and not a big fan of fruity desserts, as they are too sweet. Everything was raspberry or strawberry.  
+ 3rd Course: Scones with 2 different jams and butter. The butter was too hard to spread the other fruit jams were okay. 
+ 4th Course: Cakes from the Trolley. They had a chocolate shortbread cookie that I enjoyed. 
Overall, I wished that had include more variety in their flavors. It seems like there were two different dessert tiers - the other one looked better, to me. They should inform their customers of other options if they do. 
You have the option of trying as many teas as you like, but as a results the teas are less potent than I would like. 
SERVICE: 
Service was alright, not very attentive. As it does take awhile to flag someone down once it gets really busy. But everyone was really polite and friendly. 
AMBIANCE: 
Very princess and girly like theme. Everything is pink and white. But the highlight of this location is actually their restroom. The bathroom ""stalls"" are actually individuals pods with spring scent and sounds. The bathroom is spotless since there is a cleaning lady there the whole time cleaning after your ever move. haha. It's not very obvious, but the bathroom is separate by male and females. The blue light leading up to the left side is for males and the pink lights on the right is for the females.",1
4,"Interesting place.  Seems so unassuming when you first approach it and then you enter in and it's a whole other world in there!  I almost don't want to spoil it for people, but there are several options for rooms to lounge in.  I was in a room at the back left which was themed like a forest as though I was going hunting or something.  The place is really big.
I came for drinks one night while in London and certainly didn't expect this.  They have coat check, and then you're pretty much free to wander around.  I have no idea what is up the one staircase as I didn't go there, but when first coming in, there's another room to the right that is a really great lounging area.  They had a DJ so it was a bit loud in there so we headed to the back.  Across from the room we were in was a room that looked like a pink 1950's American diner.  Past the doors through that room on the other side was the most unique bathroom I've ever seen.  I won't describe it, just go see it for yourself.
Fun place to get drinks.  Maybe I'll try the food on my next visit.",1
2,"If you're looking for afternoon tea, I'd probably look elsewhere, we had a ""Sketchy"" experience.
I was really excited to eat at Sketch. The decor was hip, modern, and cool!  The bathroom alone made the trip to the restaurant one to remember, but just being a ""cool"" place doesn't excuse numerous transgressions. 
I waited forty-five (45) minutes just to have a couple extra finger sandwiches delivered. I could have walked to Fortnum & Mason, bought some of their sandwiches, and walked back in the time it took me to get finger sandwiches from Sketch. No less than four times did we ask our server for them and each time both of them said, ""We're sorry, they are on the way.""  
When I bit into the pistachio cake, the first bite was great!  The second bite was a painful like biting on a pebble because they failed to remove a cherry seed!  Yes, I bit down on cherry seed. Have you ever bitten something hard and not expected it?  Perhaps an olive seed, or maybe a fish bone in your trout?  At least with olives and fish, I tread carefully. I didn't tread so carefully because I was eating cake. I received an apology from the restaurant and they said it's never happened before. Thanks. I guess that makes my jaw feel better.  They had an opportunity to provide some extra customer service and fail short.  
The variety of finger foods was mediocre. The food looked great, but the taste wasn't on par with what I'd expect. Even my lunch companion didn't care for several of the selections.  The visual appeal was there, but the taste fell flat. It was like taking home a girl you'd think was an absolute ""ten"" from the club at night, and then waking up with a ""four!""
I have no problem helping charities, but they automatically added £1 to my bill to their charity of choice. Why don't you have the balls to ask me if I'd like to donate instead of sneakily adding it to my bill?  Maybe I would have given more, I tend to be pretty generous, but if you try to sneak it in under my nose then you are deceitful and despicable.  I won't be back; plenty of other, better, places for afternoon tea.
The live string-trio was great!",-1
5,"Beautiful Beautiful Magical Restaurant 
Always want to find an excuse to return to this incredible place",1
5,"A magical experience from start to finish. A phenomenal place to people-watch -- to feel like you're breaking the fourth wall in a contemporary rendition of an classic movie, reminiscent of Breakfast at Tiffany's. I was seated early; the staff was not fazed by the fact that I was dining alone (my brief trip to London was a solo endeavor). During the course of my dinner, I was approached by a myriad of waiters, sommeliers, and a gentleman who I took to be the the floor manager. Each member of the staff was courteous, respectful, and helpful. I had the homemade bread, the bone marrow, Sketch's velvety-smooth take on a classically intense penicillin, and for dessert--as per the manager's suggestion--a chocolate creation paired with a cappuccino. A masterpiece the whole way through. Thank you, Sketch, for a beautiful evening!",1
5,"Had a delicious afternoon tea here! The entire venue is gorgeous, but the Gallery room is just so pretty. We were one of the first people in and our waiter was so attentive. Their tea selection was amazing and my husband (who doesn't usually drink tea) enjoyed every tea we had.",1
5,"This tea service was very pricey but it was also very classy. There was a huge selection of teas: Black, green and white with various infusions of fruit or flowers. The forbidden romance was my favorite. The staff is very attentive and courteous. The sandwiches and desserts were absolutely delicious! By the time we got to the scones we were stuffed and there was still sponge cake after! The bathroom is a creative work of art",1
3,"The best thing about Sketch is the pink dining room and bathrooms with a very Fabu bar under the loos.  Meal was average and service was Eastern European rope learning. Quite bad and impersonal except for the William whom made the evening aok. Coming from LA we joked that this place would
Only last 24hrs back home. The automatic £31 tip on the bill was insulting which I took off and gave William a twenty. Best thing the pod bathrooms, except a date to be there for at least forty minutes with most slimming mirrors in the world.",-1
5,"Vibrant. Colorful, casual and elegant to match. We loved it. When we arrived we felt welcomed into a top london spot. I felt intimidated but then welcomed as a VIP. Super friendly people all around! Beautiful restaurant and bars with food to match.. down to back converse on waitresses. Diver sole with bright green sauce amazing. Sea bass with black bean sauce unusually wonderfully and flavorful. Top 5 spot for me in all my travels, enjoy and go!",1
3,"Booked our anniversary dinner here as it is renown as a special occasion type of place. We arrived right on time for our reservation and were shown to the first table in the Gallery - not the best location given the traffic from the main corridor but decent for people watching. Loved the playful decor juxtaposed with elegant dining furnishings. 
Service was prompt throughout food service - we had water and drink orders put in immediately. He had a glenfeddich neat and I the Chattahoochie mezcal cocktail which was absolutely divine and had me buzzing through the appetizers. He got the chantilly lace lobster bisque which he graciously shared with me since my £24 scallop starter was underwhelming in comparison. His soup was heaven and something I would return for on its own - without a doubt it was creamy without the heaviness you might expect from so much butter. Again, the scallop scored high marks in presentation but was cold, underseasoned and lackluster. 
As it was the day to commemorate our wedding, we chose the duck to share. This was brought out in a cloche and unveiled for our inspection before being broken down. The plates were modest portions but delicately prepared with cranberry jus, and accompanied by a side dish of israeli couscous and other dark hare meat pieces. 
We ordered the napoleon dessert and waited nearly 10 mins before someone informed us it was no longer available; this ended up just fine as we were rushed to return to relieve the babysitter however it showed up on our bill. This had to be remedied and all in, we had to chase down someone to pay as this was extending long after we had finished our last course. 
As a result of this unceremonious ending, I docked a star for service and another for price points on some of the less than outstanding selections.",-1
5,"Definitely the highlight of my London dining experience. It was honestly such an amazing experience to have afternoon tea here. I'd encourage everyone to go at last once. My friend and I decided to do the simple afternoon tea (around 60 euros per person). 
Immediately upon being seated, you're given a great menu with many teas (I had THREE pots during my time there). After that a waiter comes up with an egg dish and grilled cheese cracker, and of course a spoon of caviar!! I was so shocked and felt like royalty. 
Of course then we got the platter itself. The food is unlimited but we honestly couldn't even finish what we were given. Everything was DELICIOUS. I especially enjoyed the chicken and salmon finger sandwiches and the scones. There's honestly so much food (and it keeps coming) that I left feeling stuffed. 
The ambience is also super cool! Everything is pink and there's some real cool artwork all over the walls. And be sure to visit the restroom, you'll be in for a (not so) surprise.
HIGHLY recommend going - you'll leave super full and happy :)",1
3,"I'm sure tea here is lovely but would not recommend breakfast. Service was fine but the food was overpriced and wilted/sad. Bloody Mary not worth £15.
You're not seated in the nice pink tea room but rather in the front of the restaurant. 
I'd come back for tea but not for breakfast.",-1
4,Came to sketch for the afternoon tea set. The place is really nice and unique. When we came there was also live music in the gallery (pink room). The food was okay considering the price though.,1
4,"Went online to make a reservation, hardly any open slots but arrived to the restaurant to find two tables in use. #fauxexclusivity Anyhow, it was definitely interesting to take in. The decor is quite dizzying. The flowers in the entry hall were beautiful. The bathroom up the stairs is hard to navigate without feeling your way as it's all mirrors. Stick to the pods. The food was mediocre; it's definitely more about ambiance. I ordered a relatively new item on the menu; it was a cereal cake with raspberry and soya milk. The most ridiculous thing to try to eat! Our server asked how it was as they were still testing it out; I hope it's not a permanent menu item. Staff were a bit frazzled but friendly. Overall: the various dining rooms are worth checking out.",1
2,"We were given this event as a lovely gift...
It is a unique take on English tea
Unfortunately, it was a disappointment
The fun, quirky nature was lost due to the staff's snobbishness
The restaurant was unwilling to accommodate guests since everything is pre-fixe and seating is pre-arranged
We were rushed from the minute we were seated, even though our reservation was for two hours and the restaurant was empty
Food grois served, which I do not eat and was not able to substitute out
The egg and caviar we're delicious and the server was charming and did a great job explaining the dish
Sandwiches were made well in advance, so the cucumber was soggy
Scones (American biscuits) are warm and fluffy)
Three string quartet was a nice touch
*The Restrooms: They are located through a set of  unmarked double doors (of which there  are four sets, and God forbid you ask for help - rude!) at the top of the stairs (also unmarked). There are men's and women's sides (also unmarked). They are incredible, though! They make up for the whole pretentious visit. I'll leave it at that.. (see photos)
Overall, the experience was overrated. Spend the cash on a traditional, high end English tea. Save this for a kids party or a baby shower unless you absolutely love mod toilets.",-1
3,"All 3 stars for the ambiance and decoration of the restaurant. The pink interior was definitely picture worthy.  However, the dinner there was simply mediocre. We ordered the ravioli, lobster, and ribeye. The lobster came with an interesting purée that complemented the lobster very well. Other than that, everything else weren't too special, nor good. Afternoon tea here is probably more worth it, but probably won't be coming back for dinner here.",-1
2,"I understand that coming from Seattle, I'm largely a stranger to unique European experiences such as afternoon tea. But this dining experience was literally SO far below our expectations that it was baffling. We only had a few days in London and we searched all over months in advance to make reservations at spots that seemed worthwhile to us. We thought it would be fun to dine in an art gallery after visiting the Tate Modern, and in that regard we were right. 
The gallery atmosphere of sketch is absolutely mesmerizing, with not a single detail ignored. It features the witty and comical art of David Shrigley on the walls and within the dining fixtures themselves, brightly-colored pink chairs, and the famous toilet pods (which I'm convinced are a large reason for many of their visitors' 5-star reviews). The atmosphere is incredible and warranted at least 2 stars. But unfortunately the rest of our time at sketch fell flat. 
We did the champagne afternoon tea, which we didn't realize only came with a single glass of champagne. That's fine, but based on the dramatic price increase we didn't realize that. (Maybe because we are heathens who normally drink cheaper champagne, but nonetheless it didn't feel worth the additional £34 or whatever it was.) The three tiers of savories and sweets for the tea *looked* absolutely beautiful, but there were only a couple of items that actually wowed us with their flavor while the others seemed like whimsical placeholders that tasted dull and unimpressive. 
Service was questionably slow and disjointed, which made no sense because we often saw wait staff just hanging around chatting with one another. We placed our tea order about an hour before we received it...long after our 3-tier snacks were consumed. This was frustrating. Flagging someone down was nearly impossible even though it was a Tuesday and the place was relatively empty. There was a live strings trio playing music that did NOT fit the vibe of the establishment at all. And that kind of helps to sum up our whole experience...I couldn't decide what vibe or what identity sketch was serving up to me, and I think somewhere with such a unique image should have a well-defined concept with background music that matches, service that is at least satisfactory, and food that blows you away. 
£300 later we were still hungry and largely unimpressed by the food and tea we had consumed. If you simply have money to blow I guess I can still recommend checking it out for the theatrics, but otherwise I would pick somewhere else.",-1
1,"Four of us had dinner at Sketch a few weeks ago in London. We all had the tasting menu. Two of our party were very sick later that evening and the next day. The two people who were sick had nothing else to eat in common, and had only met that night, so it seems unlikely that anything else would have made them sick, other than the meal at Sketch. 
We emailed the restaurant to make them aware that two in our party were sick and appear to have had food poisoning. They referred us to an independent consultant. That consultant asked what else we had eaten and if we had been to a doctor. As we noted earlier, both people had eaten other things, but not together, so it is extremely unlikely that it was anything but Sketch that made them sick. We made this point to the consultant. And noted that neither person went to a doctor for treatment. Though one of the people sick is a pharmacist. So she could clearly take care of herself. The independent consultant determined their investigation was inconclusive. Which is a disappointment. 
A restaurant of Sketch's caliber and reputation should take responsibility for its actions. We have no problem paying for a good meal. And the food was good and experience nice.  Other than their getting sick. But we don't want to pay to get sick. I'm disappointing in how the Restaurant disclaimed any responsibility. They should at the least have offered to refund the meal.",-1
2,"I was sincerely disappointed with my visit here; and it was one of the places I was really looking forward to during my stay in London. Perhaps I can give it another try when I return for dinner on my next visit, but my first experience was not a pleasant one. 
The staff was exceedingly pretentious and unhelpful when I politely asked for directions, to look at the menus, etc. I had a few drinks and some food with my traveling companion in the bar (which was BEAUTIFUL, and earns the stars I gave!). The service was terrible; in fact, we were too polite to say anything, but the French guests next to our table walked up and demanded that the waiters attend to us, as they noticed how we were being ignored amidst the other guests. It was super bizarre, as we always bend over backwards to be nice to waitstaff, and were excited to be there. 
It took 2 hours for one drink each as well as a few small foods (nuts, etc.). 
The only thing that will have me return to this place is for a meal in the main dining room; I hope the second chance eradicates the bitter taste in my mouth.",-1
4,"Definitely a unique high tea experience to try at least once while in London. 
Before my trip, I booked a reservation a few weeks in advance for Saturday afternoon tea. I also did some research to confirm the correct room to book since there are several options on the website. The notable pink room is 'the Gallery'.
For the classic afternoon tea, it doesn't seem like the food would be very filling, but you can request more of any of the tea sandwiches, cakes, parfaits etc. and the staff makes sure your tea cup or glass is full. 
My favorite bites of the high tea were the caviar accompanied with bread sticks to dip in an egg-shaped cup with yolk in Hollandaise sauce; the curry chicken sandwiches with colorful garnishes on top and the pistachio and hazelnut mini puffs. The tea pot, cups and sugar bowl are amusing to read with random words or phrases and the pictures in the menu are quite cute.
After a filling meal, it is a must to visit the iconic egg-shaped bathroom stalls - just be sure to walk up the correct staircase since there isn't a clear divider between the mens' and womens' stalls.
The service was quite slow, but very polite and courteous - a lot of the waitresses were speaking French too. What was also nice was that there was live music playing in the background from a female string trio. 
A little pricey experience since it is at least £65 per person depending on which high tea option you select. Also as a heads up - they already add around 12% gratuity to the check prior to paying.",1
2,"So the ambiance was nice. The bathroom is very cool. The service was excellent. However, the food was horrid. If you decide to go to Sketch, just know you are going for the decor/experience. 
Despite that, Sketch is still a restaurant so I would advise them to redo their menu. The chips that came with my fish tasted like they had been forgotten in the back of the freezer for the last decade. The couples on either side of my table were equally displeased. From my perspective Sketch is trying to offer too wide an array of food. They have British, French, and Italian items on their menu. I would suggest they simply pick one type of cuisine and stick with it. The waitress was lovely and I felt bad she had to endure the customers to my right berating her about how bad the food was. 
So, if you have 40£ to spend on a subpar meal than you should absolutely go to Sketch and get a picture of yourself with their fabulous decor!",-1
5,"Worth every penny.  4 rooms, all distinctly and unique in their own way.  Have come here twice now for afternoon tea, once in the Alice in Wonderland themed room and once in the pink room.  The pink room is largest and my favorite out of all the rooms - with its modern and cheeky decor and huge vaulted ceiling.  What I love best about it is that it's essentially all you can eat - but they serve you so much food that you might not even take advantage of it.  Of course you MUST visit the bathroom here... the most unique and insta-worthy I've seen to date!",1
2,"Came here for dinner. Reservations at 9:30pm. We arrived early on purpose to have pre-dinner cocktails. Hostesses were friendly, helpful and polite. Went to one of the 3 bars/clubs for drinks. Sat immediately, they were super busy so drinks came a little slow but they were made well and all was good. We were sat for dinner on time. And that was about it for the rest of the night. Our server was not great. We ordered cocktails and they took 30 minutes. I saw them sitting in the counter for quite some time. But our server was nowhere in site. Someone else brought our drinks. 50 minutes into our visit our appetizers finally came. By this time we were perturbed, yet still no server. We ordered a bottle of wine. Sommelier poured for us most of the time. Still no server. I finally had to find someone and complain about the service. Our server checked on us once. Other people brought out our entrees. why have a server when 5 other people pretty much did her job. One person too many on the team that was completely useless if you ask me. This place was a disco, at best, that just so happened to sell decent food. Who was the Michelin critique who judged this place? Because I'd like to know how many drinks they had before having dinner and giving their rating. It's not worthy of the prestige that is awarded a Michelin Star. It was average at best including food and below average in service standards/time. Very disappointed, and even If i were 19-21 looking to go clubbing, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",-1
5,"My absolute favorite in London!  If you like art and food, this is the place for you!  Personally I prefer savory food, so my best friend and I picked the lunch option at the glad room.  32£ for 2 course, 40£ for 3 course lunch.  When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by its decor.  Service is perfect, classy & elegant.  I do recommend to dress up a little, cocktail attire would be perfect.  I had the foie gras appetizer, lamb stew for main, and red fruits, red sorbets for dessert.  Everything is phenomenal!  If I live London, I would go every month!",1
4,"There's nothing like sketch, I wish we had this restaurant in North America.
Fast, prompt service, really courteous servers.
Amazing decor, pink everywhere.
Individual pod washrooms and great smelling candles. 
Drinks are 5/5!!!",1
5,The tea was amazing. The decor is fabulous. Def a must do in London! We also went out for drinks there and the dj was great.  We had a great night,1
4,"A must when in London. Great ambiance, service, and yes, food! This review is for the Gallery. Cocktails are super tasty, we sampled 4 and none disappointed. Wine list is extensive but to the point. Very happy with the Malbec we chose. I had the lobster bisque, can only describe it as rich yet sublime with a superb (live) presentation. Rack of lamb was a perfect dish as a whole, all flavors and texture were complimentary to each other. For dessert, I had the panna cotta, which was good but not what I expected in terms of consistency and flavor profile . You would like it if you enjoy sugary sweets -think bubblegum and cotton candy. I highly recommend any of the Sketch establishments, all are a treat in quality.",1
5,"If Kubrick and Wes Anderson had a love child it would look like Sketch. The bathrooms look like something out of 2001 Space Odyssey meets Clockwork Orange, meets Eyes Wides Shut (french maids and velvet curtains), with the aesthetic eye of Wes Anderson. 
There is a nice balance of hard and soft elements, naughty and nice, festive and dim, elegant and dangerous. The service was spectacular, the food was also elegant, delectable, perfectly presented. The ambiance was inviting. The decor perfectly picked out. Overall, there was great attention to detail. From the design of the menus, to the lighting, the color of the booths, the bathrooms! YES the bathrooms....Afternoon Tea at Sketch is not complete unless you include indulging in the trippy pod-bathrooms. 
Sketch is unlike any other place I've ever been to. There was beautiful live music that showcased both classical and current songs on cellos and violins. The food featured cakes, warm scones, caviar, finger sandwiches (that were made vegetarian upon request). They had many types of teas and you could try them all if you so wished. The servers were highly knowledgable about all of their dishes and made the act of serving tables an art, rather than a job.The overall price per person was not cheap, but considering the service, the quality of the food, the abundance of dishes, the creative ambiance, and the wonderful afternoon, the price is well worth it!
I recommend making reservations ahead of time. We were unable to make one and got lucky with a last minute cancellation. I will most definitely be coming back to Sketch, and I hope to bring everyone I know there. I lived in London for 9 years in my childhood, and had never heard of such a place, revisiting London after 20+ years, Sketch will now become a permanent London memory and must-do experience.",1
3,"My fiancé and I got the afternoon tea and were welcomed by a gorgeous flower display in the entry and the fabulous maitre d'.  The first half of service went swimmingly, accompanied by a violinist duo strumming pop hits.  The tea was prepared fabulously and savory bites were all extremely delicious, the custard cheese egg and the mushroom sandwich being my favorites.
Unfortunately, the sweet bites were all too sugary for my palate and they kept coming.  I wish the savory hadn't been outweighed threefold by the cakes and sweets.  When it came time for our final gluttonous duo of desserts, it seems the staff had turned over and we were left without service for an unfortunate 45 minutes.  We were trying to flag down members of the staff but perhaps the lunch crew was intent on leaving or setting up for dinner service and kept busy-bodying past us.  By the time we had finally flagged someone down, our appetite was long quelled and we were late for our next rendezvous.  Considering the cost of the meal and the high number of waitstaff, I was expecting a more streamlined experience.  We had the last desserts wrapped to go with little apology for having been forgotten and they weren't very tasty the next day. 
I would give sketch another chance since it was so promising for the first half of service, but would definitely request more savory bites and less desserts next time.",-1
4,"""This is the first place I've ever been to, where as soon as I came in, I wanted to figure out who I could bring here so I could torture them."" - Quote from my husband.
Sketch's afternoon tea is ridiculous, but in a good fun way. I had a great time, and despite my husband's initial above statement after being seated, I know he did too. 
I ordered the afternoon tea option that included the infused tea champagne (£79) and he had the Exotic tea (£78.) The glass of Earl Grey-infused champagne was really good, but sadly no refills -- though the tea and main course offerings are endless.
We're served a creamy (comte?) cheese with petite breadsticks to start. The cute dishes have words and phrases on them. 
I'm taking in the infamous pink room and began to see a pattern of funny characters, from the interesting wall drawings to the rest of the staff themselves. I'm feeling all 'Twin Peaks.' 
There's this guy, see. Dressed in a ridiculous pink full tweed suit. He's their caviar mascot, it seems, handing you a scoop of their caviar for your plate before happily twirling off. Dr. Jacoby. Yes; he's like a young Dr. Jacoby. 
Next comes a guy that reminds me of the Giant from Twin Peaks, who would sometimes serve as well. We couldn't understand a thing he said, and you know: I felt like he knew it lol I know the gals next to us couldn't understand him. I'd like to think he was telling us clues 'the owls are not what they seem.' 
Later, I notice a patron across from me has his head unfortunately placed next to one of the drawings, and I can't help but get a picture of him. 
And then the main courses arrive! Curry chicken, cucumber, smoked salmon sandwiches at the base of the tiers. Above that, the Battenberg cake, chocolate caramel cake, pistachio Petit Choux, and at the tippy top, homemade marshmallows and rhubarb cheesecakes. It was good; I tasted all the desserts not finishing them. I'll say that I enjoyed the sandwiches more (the curry chicken was my favorite) so I ordered more of them.
Next course are the scones, with clotted cream and jam (his favorite thing always.) And last is my favorite dessert, the Victorian Sponge cake. 
There's a two-hour time limit to afternoon tea noted when you make your reservations, which I recommend doing as far in advance as possible. A notable thing to mention is that my husband loves tea. The variety is excellent here, and he ordered a few pots over the course of the meal. Two of the pots he had are from tea bricks (pu'er tea) and are normally £25 each serving there, but you can have it during afternoon tea. I felt it tasted like dust and prefer the pu'er we have at home.
One last thing: I couldn't not talk about the RESTROOMS. It really capped off the experience of Sketch. Through the room's pink door, up the pristine white stairs (a bar is in middle of the floor) you'll find the restroom pods. Men's = left staircase; Women's = right staircase. The pods are placed in no particular order, and sinks are found along the walls -- hiding behind pods. I felt like I was in Labyrinth for a moment, expecting Jared to come around the corner any moment as I searched for a sink. Everybody was taking pictures, which is kinda funny if you think about it.
You have to come; just to say that you did!",1
5,"I almost never give 5 stars reviews but this place absolutely deserves it. 
Coming from a place like New York, where you get more than 1000 fun choices to lunch and dine and you can be amazed by some of the things you see, this place blew my mind completely.
Let's start with the staff, everyone was so polished, polite and their outfits were on point. Our waitress Cloe was a sweetheart who kept making sure we were 100% happy with everything that was being served. 
The sandwiches, desserts and were unbelievably good. But I must say that the ambience and decoration of the place is absolutely breathtaking. The bathroom was my favorite spot in the entire place! if you haven't been please do you'll never regret it.",1
1,"Very disappointed by this place. Went for an afternoon tea and the food tastes very bad, like what you get in a very (very) cheap place.
Sandwiches are really awful, sweet stuff is just ok. 
Tea selection is not good either. I don't recommend this place to anybody, mainly considering the price. It's only for pictures, but not even worth the money or using your time to make reservation. I would say it's a waste of time and money.",-1
5,"You've probably seen this place on instagram and remembered about it, mostly because of their very IG-Material bathroom. Now the question is: is it really worth it? And my answer is YES, Absolutely! I loved this place the second I arrived. It's very girly, modern and artsy. Each room has its very own energy and atmosphere. We sat at the pink gallery for dinner. With started with some fresh bread and butter (the bread was not the best, but i'm french si I have very high expectations haha). Then I had the lamb and it was VERY good! We didn't have anything to drink (besides water of course) but the drinks section looks pretty good. And of course, I highly recommend going to the bathrooms for a little surprise ;)! 
One more thing: their plates, bowls etc are all very fun with quotes in/on it",1
5,"If you're ever in London, this spot is a must. Let's just say it is an instagrammers dream come true. From the entrance, the main pink tea room, to the pod bathrooms- you'll be taking pictures of something- guaranteed!!!
A bit on the pricier side, but you will get your money's worth.
Had the standard afternoon tea. The waitress helped me with the tea selection, which was nice. To start, they give you a piece of bread, caviar and egg. Pretty interesting combo, but good nonetheless. The sandwich selections are nice- not your traditional cucumber and mayonnaise sandwiches. And then the sweets- omg so pretty and yummy!! I was so full I couldn't even touch the top pudding and marshmallow. Don't forget the cake and scone. I will say, I wish the scone was a bit better, it was on the dryer side, but the jam and clotted cream made it.
And not to mention the live music performance by a mini orchestra.
Make sure to plan ahead with reservations!",1
5,Sketch is everything! The decor and atmosphere is absolutely amazing. The Gallery is where dinner is served and very picturesque. I ordered the Ribeye and it was juicy and seasoned very well. Though I was not a fan of the macaroni cheese (I'm from America and ours it different) I also tasted the fish and chips and onion rings which were also tasty. I recommend that any and everyone done here at least once.,1
4,"Our first night in London and we had to check out Sketch! Such a unique concept and it really lived up to it's hype and our expectations. We had dinner reservations in the Gallery and got seated right away. The hostesses are so kind and greeted us with a smile. Our waiter also took good care of us and recommended a few of his favorites. For appetizers we ordered the soufflé and scallops. The soufflé was excellent--very rich, but also refreshing. The scallops were OK. This was probably my least favorite thing we ordered. For our main course we decided with the bone barrow, steak tartare, and sea bass. We loved every single dish. They're all my favorite and I recommend trying all three of them. All I could say was WOW and my stomach was definitely happy! All of our dishes came out fairly quick too. The only downside to our experience, was that, it took forever for our dessert to come out, but they made it up by not charging us for the dessert! It also gets a bit noisy and overwhelming, but our experience was still enjoyable. The restrooms are by far the coolest restrooms I've ever been to! I was amazed by the unique concept. Overall, such a fun experience and the dishes were all memorable and melted in my mouth. I would definitely come back!",1
5,"Recently came here for afternoon tea in the Gallery. This place books up quickly so I suggest getting an online reservation as soon as they open up the dates which are usually a month out.
There is a set menu starting with caviar and champagne (if you choose for additional cost) then moving onto assorted finger sandwiches and pastries served with your choice of tea. You will also receive fresh scones served with cream and jam. These were probably the best scones I have ever had! Lastly they bring you a slice of cake. It was A LOT of food. Make sure you go hungry and give yourself after you finish before your next meal.",1
5,I received a beautiful hightea experience from my husband for my bday. It was a great experience. Loved it. Will do this again very soon.,1
1,"I don't know what to say other than that I was seriously underwhelmed by this place. 
Yes everything is pretty and yes the toilet looks like something derived from science fiction but when it gets down to the most important bit (the food)... Sketch disappoints. On a major scale.
Aside from the stunning interior, not much else makes having tea here any more special than any other place.",-1
5,"Afternoon tea (59 pounds/person) was exceptionally dreamy and pretty much lived up to every pink dream I've ever had.
The ambiance was worth it alone, but we really enjoyed the food and tea as well. 
Perfect London experience!",1
3,"My friends and I were on a short vacation to London and made sure to add this to our itinerary after doing some research. Overall, we're glad we got to experience Sketch- but will most likely not return. 
Decor: The restaurant captures your attention as soon as you walk in with hip and modern design. It'll make you want to immediately pull your phone out and start taking pictures. We had the Christmas Afternoon Tea which was held in a beautifully decorated and very pink/purple room. 
Service: We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. We were all so excited and were busy taking pictures until we realized that 15 minutes had passed by without anyone coming to our table. We finally flagged someone down and they briefly explained their menu. This was a constant struggle- the staff was running around but it was so hard to get consistent service. Maybe they do this on purpose since there is a 2 hour time limit, but we were so confused how such a high rated place could be so slow on service. We passed our two hour time limit and a manager came to tell us we had to leave soon. The funniest part is that we had been waiting for almost 30 minutes for someone to come to our table so we could get a check. However, the waiters and staff that did attend to us were friendly and helpful. 
Food: The most disappointing part was the food. The display of the food is pretty so you will definitely get an ""insta"" pic, but the taste was subpar. The chicken salad sandwich was our favorite, but even on the second round we weren't impressed. The bread of the sandwiches tasted stale as if they had been out for a long time. They sell the unlimited food idea, but it is so hard to get your money's worth. 
Toilets: It is odd to say the toilets were a highlight of a restaurant experience, but it was. 
Special Occasion: We were celebrating our friend's engagement so they did surprise us with a place that said congratulations with a candle. It was just a piece of dessert already on the afternoon tea menu, but the thought was very kind.",-1
5,Such a great posh dining experience. Do be prepared to spend some cash if you are planning on drinks and dinner. We made reservations in the gallery for dinner. Our evening began with bar service followed by a two course meal. Service was very knowledgeable and friendly!,1
5,Went here last year because I knew it was a London staple. Remember to book early to get the afternoon tea! I put it off and could only get a time at night. Would 10/10 recommend showing up drunk/buzzed and checking out the egg bathroom. Also pink everywhere and fancy (but expensive) dining.,1
4,Sketch is definitely a quirky and fun place for afternoon tea! We came during the Mayfair flower show so it was extra festive. Afternoon tea was pricier since it was during the flower show event. However the experience was worth that price. We were so full from all the sweets and food they endlessly offered. The service was impeccable and attentive. Don't miss the bathrooms and other rooms in sketch. The artwork and setup is out of this world!,1
5,"This place totally exceeded my high expectations! It's trendy, chic and super unique. Every room was different, exciting and interesting. The bathrooms are obviously the best part, but the drinks from the cocktail bar underneath them are very good as well! I got wrath, as they have the 7 deadly sins as a them for some of their craft drinks. I showed up randomly, so I wasn't aware that the pink room is strictly for afternoon tea or dinner sadly- (which is a splurge if you just want a glass of wine in that room) but you can still admire it. The green room was just as unique, with different drink options and great service. I enjoyed all the different costumes the staff had in each room as well. They also have a charging station where you can leave your phone while you enjoy your stay if needed. 
Location is great, it was easy to find and I definitely can't wait to go back!",1
5,"Great night out in London! Food was excellent, staff was a bit uppity in a not welcoming way, but the drinks were strong! The design of the place was extremely unique like someone let their wife do whatever she wanted design wise, ie an entire pinkish purple room (including the lighting, walls & seating) lol shaggy grassy carpet in the bar area with moving mirrors with red laser-beams being reflected and bouncing from mirror to mirror. The bathrooms are extremely unique seeing is believing! Everything is very 60s Barbarella style! I only saw three of the rooms, but it all seems to be in good fun! Alex the bartender, in the room by the bathroom was awesome and he made our night!",1
2,"We really wanted to like the place. The price didn't matter because we were paying for an experience. It started off pleasant because we came at a time where it wasn't the peak hours. Once people started coming in the service became non existent. Funny, because there are tons of servers. For the price you expect better service. I do not understand how service people can be so snooty. It is always better to treat people kindly, rather than act like you'd rather be elsewhere. It took us 20 minutes to try and get the bill and we were sitting right in front of the bar where ALL the servers walk by. We hailed someone down and she just forgot, even though we are right in front of her.
The ambiance is different than the typical high tea. It's more modern and of course looking at the bathroom you can tell. The bathroom is co-ed - I say this because it does not have a wall to divide between male and female and you need to guess which side is which. Let me help you not guess. Follow the pink lights ladies and follow the blue light guys.
The food was presented beautifully. Of course you will always have favorites but of the many choices we only really liked two items. The mixed drinks were delicious.",-1
2,"Food is mediocre, service is not bad. They put donation on your bill without notifying you. The place is overall a instagram spot rather than a restaurant.",-1
5,"Sketch is an experience from start to finish. All the way down to the bathrooms, this is easily one of the most entertaining places to dine in London. 
Sketch was designed by a modern artist. Their are several different ""themed rooms"" you can dine in and like all of London, they operate heavily on reservations. I went for afternoon tea and sat in their most popular room...it's a ""whimsical gallery"" with a whole lot of pink. Their is no detail that goes unnoticed. The wall is covered in quirky art, the acoustics are perfect, pink and rose gold everywhere and the waitstaff dress like they're citizens from the hunger games universe. 
And I almost forgot...The Bathrooms. These are seriously from the future. Left is boys and right is girls but its' all the same room. You basically do your business in a space pod. Also, their are french maids hovering around cleaning up. Pretty immersive if you ask me.
Okay, not to the dining. So it's expensive but you go for the whole experience. Afternoon Tea is 58£ a person. Most other fancy tea places were about 35£+ so it's really not that crazy of a price but know before you go.
What you get: Unlimited tea, sandwiches and sweets. Go hungry but don't eat so much you ruin your day. I was very conscious of doing this since we had sites to see! All of the food is brought out on a beautiful desert tray. Personally, I liked the sandwiches more than the french inspired sweets. The sandwiches are amazing. And of course, the tea is great as well. If you're wanting to add a little extra you can pay a 20£ (ish) extra per person and get champagne added to the experience. They also have cocktails you can order a la carte. 
Overall one of the top three things I did on my recent trip across the pond.",1
5,"It might be basic but I loved this place. #noshame
After getting multiple recommendations to go here from my girlfriends and seeing the instagram photos on here....I knew I had to book a reservation to check it out. We went for brunch in the Glade room and it felt really whimsical and Alice-in-Wonderland-y. The couches were a little low but otherwise the room felt open and comfortable. 
I got the 9 Conduit St. black croque which was a croque monsieur on some sort of amazing black bread and the burrata and my boyfriend got the Black Pudding and Pork Belly. All of it was delicious and I thought the prices were reasonable -- but we were cognizant not to order drinks since cocktails were ~€20. I'd definitely come back to try the afternoon tea, though! 
Also, yes, the bathrooms are fun. Check them out and really, you can't take a bad photo in there.",1
3,"It's very overrated, the bathrooms are very cool and I think that enough to go there and the high tea area is beautiful. I had regular brunch and it wasn't that great",-1
5,"Beautiful restaurant, fantastic food, tasty cocktails & smoothies, superb service,...I don't know what else to say about this restaurant! I just love dining in here. Have to go when you are in London!",1
5,"The interior at the place is EVERYTHING! I thought I was in some kind of Alice in Wonderland or something. Starts from a hopscotch at the entrance to the egg shaped bathroom. Never seen anything this. I was there for dinner at the Lecture Room. Ordered the tasting menu and everything was delicious! 
Absolutely adore this place.",1
5,"The prettiest bubble gum dining room, walls filled with bazar sketches, and the most futuristic bathroom I've ever seen!
This is a must try if you find yourself in London, the decor will keep your eyes wandering the whole meal. Seriously loved this experience!!",1
4,We had a lovely afternoon tea here. Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant. The experience was awesome and worth the (incredibly) high price of tea for two. One of the hosts had terrible body odor that wafted through the room and did impact the ambience of the afternoon. All in all it's an experience I would definitely recommend - the tea room is gorgeous and the desserts were out of this world.,1
4,"Such a fun and quirky place. I made a reservation online for the Glade room so I could eat brunch instead of having high tea in the Parlor room. The place is very Alice and Wonderland and perfect for those people who love Instagram! The food was pretty good, but not great, in my opinion. The bathrooms are the crazy part of it all. Each bathroom ""stall"" looks like a huge ostrich egg. Very cool. Definitely a place to go to for a girls day out.",1
4,"The experience lives up to the hype and you'll come away with social media post-worthy pics/videos for a full album. Each room is so quirky and vastly different from another. Be prepared to run into people having full on photo sessions in the open space pod bathroom. 
The hosts were beautifully decked out, as if straight from a photo shoot, and our server was so sweet and helpful. Our entire tea time reservation was a well-timed performance, but we were not complaining. Loved the live orchestral quartet playing in the main gallery.
While the food and service were hands down a 5 star service, the food itself was merely 4 stars. Our afternoon tea service offered endless variety of teas, scones, sandwiches, and cakes, but we were honestly too stuffed to even order more! It's a ton of food, which is good considering the price point. The desserts were mostly very good, but the sandwiches themselves were a bit bland. I suppose tea sandwiches are not that exceptional to begin with, but we found them to be just okay.
A very enjoyable experience nonetheless. I'd advise you to dress to impress as pictures will be taken! Now, if only we had run into Wes Anderson and Bill Murray on the way out ...",1
5,"Wow the fanciest afternoon tea I probably ever had during Easter weekend. The experience was five stars, the food was awesome, the decor very interesting, the bathrooms extremely different, and overall had a bloody amazing time!",1
5,"We went here last year for my birthday and got tea
It was amazing
It is funky and fun 
It is worth every penny you pay for it 
I liked about 1/2 the snacks on our tiers but I am a picky eater
The girls I was with really enjoyed it as well
The tea was wonderful
and so was the service 
The bathroom is fun and of course we took a picture in there
The coat room was adorable 
I really liked the hop-scotch in the entry way",1
2,"Cute, but overpriced and the food is just ok. Tea is lovely but the gentlemen had poor attitudes and honestly I would just go back for the decor.  But they really trick you by explaining how their menu works and charge you for things you didn't realize were separate.",-1
5,"Yes!
Decadence, thy name is Sketch. This place is pop art, at a Mad Hatter's Tea Party in a wonderland of All The Whimsy. There are servers in silk dresses, maids in French outfits, tea masters, and a caviar man in a pink suit from the set of Great Expectations. 
Decor: We sat in the gallery; gold, pink, plush everything. The 'great room' of the establishment, with a bar of gilded gold, rose gold copper countertops and backsplash. Pink velour and leather seats. The gallery's perimeter walls are lined with whimsical and random black and white sketches. There is a trio,  or quintet (who counted?) playing Satie, and vaguely familiar music from car commercials and films. The parlour next door is another room from Alice in Wonderland. The walls are trees papier machéd in layers so that you are staring at dimensional paper woodlands.
Food: First, who knew tea sommeliers (masters) were a thing? We each selected a tea for our palates. The moods at the table were: Rose, Oolong and Green-all delightful. The dude from Great Expectations gave the condensed biography of our caviar: Russian sturgeon raised in Italy. These were ceremoniously served in mother of pearl spoons before the tea complements arrived in three tiered splendour. Then the tea cakes, scones, and sandwiches came in waves: chicken, salmon, tomato confit, duck eggs, cherry, pistachio and sponge. There was joy and also apricot cheesecake.
Tea accoutrements, the honey, sugar and such, came with clever witticisms marked on the pottery. 
Service: Their attention to detail is demonstrably excellent. The only downside to dining was the 30 minute wait before our orders were taken. And yet. Five stars. We filled the time with ogling the egg pod shaped futuristic toilets. Reading the randomness in the sketches. People watching the cross-section of society that came to experience the glory that is Sketch. This was transformative and immersive dining. Would do again, 11 out of 10.",1
5,"So going to sketch was on the top of my 'to do' lists. I wasn't sure what our schedule was so I kind of forgot about making a reservation. I arrive in London and tried to set one up online. Only availability was the following week. :( 
I went to Sketch without a reservation and had cream tea in the parlor.  I asked our waitress about reservations and she checked with the hostess.  They had one reservation available for the following day.
The pink room was pretty amazing.  The egg pod bathrooms are very instagrammable. My daughter got the kids tea set and husband and I both had the bubbly set.  It was such a fun experience. My three year old loved it.
Thank you to our waitress in the parlor room for checking and to the hostess who was so sweet to my daughter.  Two thumbs up!",1
1,"Are you serious?  Go for Instagram. Then find a real restaurant to eat at.  This place has to be the worst!  Overpriced and filled with a bunch of wanna be social media influencers. 
I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.
Priced like fine dinning but really just a bad photo opportunity.",-1
5,"One of the only things I wanted to do was have afternoon tea. My amazing husband did all the research and made reservations here. The decor is very a mix of classy and whimsy. There were all these interesting sketches on the wall with plush pink couches for us to sit on. Also, you need to visit the bathroom. We actually didn't know about it prior but definitely a visit is a must. 
FYI, you have a two hour limit. We were there a bit over an hour. The service was very on par given that it is a Michelin star restaurant. You have unlimited tea - you try everything if you want. Our favorite was the caviar, egg, scones, and mini sandwiches. The dessert was okay. You will be full. It is a bit pricey. It was our second most expensive dining experience of our 8 day London trip.",1
5,"The sandwiches - amaze balls. The tea keeps coming. The champagne was on point. The desserts were great and the best thing is, is that you can just keep it coming! Make sure you have reservations!",1
3,"Yes, bring your Instagram filters and a full bladder, but this place fell flat for me.  Full disclosure: I don't fully understand the concept of afternoon tea, but I just didn't feel like I got my money's worth.
There are DOZENS of employees milling about the place, but service was lacking.  We waited a long time for our actual tea, and the cocktail that was ordered.  And everything else for that matter.  This seems odd since there are, literally, no choices to be made (except for tea).  At some point, we should have received a gratis round of champagne.
Also, I requested a cocktail and was notified that only the four or so listed on the menu were available (because there wasn't a bartender available).
They had a trio of strings playing music, which was great.  Tea selection was amazing and they let you know that you can try different ones throughout the meal, but we were only able to try two each.",-1
2,"A fun and cute place to visit but not a place to have a nice afternoon tea. 
Except the curry chicken sandwich, everything is mediocre. It is a must go for tourist but I guess definitely not where the locals would go.",-1
4,"Had some really cool cocktails, loved the ambience and decor, and we're impressed by how friendly the staff are. Highly recommended!",1
3,"This place was top on my to try list in London. Unfortunately I did not have a reservation for the gallery room but they do take walk ins at the parlor room. I would recommend doing that if you don't have a reservation, want a cheaper meal but still want to try out sketch, and if you want to see the bathrooms (opens after 12).
I had the poached eggs with asparagus cream and the 3 mini desserts with a pot of tea. The eggs were okay...kind of bland. The desserts were very tasty and if I were to do it again, I would come only for desserts and tea (10£) and eat lunch elsewhere.
Service was so attentive, despite the fact that some guests near me were so rude and entitled to the staff. The guest next to me even took off her shoes and stood on the chairs to take a photo...not what I expected in the middle of a nice restaurant.
Overall, I really think it is worth trying out but the food is overpriced and not that great.",-1
4,"Went to Sketch for the first time and did brunch. The meal and cocktail were expensive but I would say worth it just for the experience. The inside of the restaurant is unlike anything i've ever seen. Service was a little slow but I didn't mind because my friend any I were enjoying ourselves in the unusual setting. 
Definitely add this to your restaurant list for London.",1
5,"I made a reservation online...or so I thought. They didn't have me when I arrived but the gentleman at reception helped me immediately and found me a spot for tea without issue. I'm sure this is not always possible given popularity but since I was solo,  it was greatly appreciated. The presentation is amazing , the rose tea was my favorite , as an American first timing having boiled quail egg and soldiers (toast). Taste was perfect. Atmosphere was  decadent with trio of strings playing while eating.",1
5,Not just dessert or brunch or tea or dinner... the list goes on... it's an experience!  Hop scotch your way into one of the dining rooms to enjoy an array of ambiances!  Ensure that you at least wash your hands to experience the bathroom bar and egg pods that are the toilets... it is as-if Alice and Wonderland invented space travel and became an infusion restaurant for a truly unique and memorable (night I add delicious) experience,1
5,"I had brunch here with my girlfriend in the Glade room. The first thing that strikes you is the atmosphere -- it sort of feels like you're in some kind of Alice in Wonderland movie with a sort of wild regal air. 
I ordered the traditional risotto with parmesan, creamed spinach, and a cocktail. Unfortunately I forget the name of the cocktail but it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. However, it was also one of the most expensive ones too, around 20 USD for a single cocktail. 
The risotto and the creamed spinach were amazing. The risotto's texture was perfect with the rice having just a little bit of bite and the richness was surprising; the dish was rather small but I was completely full afterwards. The creamed spinach was buttery smooth and delicious and lended a really good complement to the risotto.
Delicious food with a unique atmosphere but a pretty hefty price.",1
4,"I had a late reservation on a Sunday and was a bit turned off by the front staff who was rushing me to my table. I couldn't even check my coat it. 
I ordered the traditional fish and chips, it was well presented and perfectly cooked. Also ordered the Charcuterie which is a meat platter with mustard ice cream. I know it sounds awful but it complemented the meats.  
The ambiance was very friendly and upbeat in the pink room.  It's definitely not a place I would go to on a weekly basis but for a special occasion absolutely.",1
4,"The atmosphere of Sketch is really breathtaking. My first initial thought when I walked into Sketch was: Wow, this place is huge! There are three rooms from what I saw when I walked into the doors: them being, the Gallery, The Parlour, and The Glade. The Gallery is where you can order à la Carte, desserts, and its famous afternoon tea sets. The Parlour and The Glade are where breakfast and brunch are served. Even though Sketch is famous for its afternoon tea, I actually did not reserve seats to try the afternoon tea, but to try their brunch. Surprisingly, it was really tasty. 
When my friend and I looked at the menu, there were so many options and we wanted to try all of them because they all sound so good; however, of course we did not do so. We ended up ordering two main plates and one dessert: fish pie nîmoise (£17.00), grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce (£21.00), and a victoria sponge cake (£6.00). The fish in the fish pie nîmoise was salmon and I thought the texture was kind of funny and interesting, but the dish was delicious! The salmon of the grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce dish was super juicy and well cooked. The dish I actually loved the most out of the three is actually the victoria sponge cake. It has raspberry jam and a few raspberries on the top of the sponge cake and a vanilla chantilly layer in between the sponge cakes. When I bit into it, I did not know what to expect because I was not too fond of raspberries. However, after trying that dessert, I immediately change my opinion on raspberries and I quite like them now. 
A downside of this restaurant is the service. Even though there were a lot of servers, we still had a hard time calling for them and had to do it a couple of times before they would come and take our order. However, the food came quickly, which makes the wait more bearable. 
Some may think that Sketch is too overpriced, but to me, I think these prices are inexpensive for the magnificent quality of food the restaurant serves.",1
4,"I love this place so much - not because of the food, which is actually quite good, but because the wildly varying degrees of decor in the entire place just tickle my fancy so much. There's the main tea parlor, enrobed in rose petal pink, whose chairs look like ladyfingers and where you feel positively doted upon by all the servers. While you wait for your seat, you might have a drink at the spherical bar in the back, where seating goes around the perimeter and the ceiling is decorated with unconventional drawings. Their cocktails are good and not overly strong. The famous space-age egg bathrooms are above, and when you use one, a recording of a 1940s pilot speaking on the radio crackles through hidden speakers. Then you have the Glade, personally my favorite room, decorated like a woodland fairytale as if straight out of a Lorrain landscape. And upstairs, you find the trippy disco bathrooms that fascinate me even more than the egg bathrooms - a small, dark room filled with flashing, twinkling, revolving lights, accompanied with similarly twinkling music, that make you feel like you just walked into an acid trip. No matter what room you're in, you can be sure it'll be thoroughly decorated and every detail thought of.
You might think all the excess in decor is there to mask subpar food, but the thing is, afternoon tea more than holds its own here. For two people, you get a large three-tiered stand filled with delicate tea sandwiches of different flavors and several desserts as well. Is it the best food you've ever had? Resounding no, but it's still much better than you might expect for such an outwardly flashy place. When you finally stagger out, stuffed more than you thought possible from just a couple of tiny sandwiches and and tea, you'll come away with the sense of having had an experience you won't really find anywhere else.",1
5,"Ya so it's p basic (some might argue gimmicky?), but I still loved it here. The decor is unlike that of any other restaurant I've been to. With the music and the lights, you feel as though you've been transported to some alternate universe. (Yes, also the bathroom pods etc. etc. - these weren't THAT stand-out to me, but I would be lying if I said I didn't take many photos...) It was such a fun experience.
My friend and I sat at the bar in the pink room and ordered drinks and apps. The food was whimsical, just as you would imagine. We had charcuterie with mustard ""ice cream"" (ice cream consistency but mustard flavor), burrata in some sort of bright pink sauce, and a delicious cauliflower dish, which was my favorite. The cocktails were beautiful and so, so delicious. 
It's pricey, but you pay for the great food/drink and the ambience. Can't wait to return!",1
5,"I was invited to celebrate my anniversary in the main room. Decor and service were really super! It's expensive but worth the experience. Tables are far from eachother which gives that special deluxe feeling, most waiters were either French or Italian which gave it that high level feeling you expect from a Michelin awarded restaurant.
Top!",1
3,"Gave me a discontinued pound as change for our bill, which is not accepted by businesses in the UK anymore. Had to go to a bank and have it changed.",-1
5,"This is one of the purely beautiful colorful places that serves up a decadent afternoon tea, lunch and pastries. I have been here several times and the customer service is amazing. 
Each room has a different theme. If you go during the Royal Chelsea Flower Show timeframe, there will be flower draping in the most beautiful way. They change the decor of the front parlor every couple of months and I love it. It gives you something to look forward to and I really appreciate the happy memories I've had in each of the rooms.",1
4,"The Michelin-rated sketch has a great afternoon tea option, but the bill will be hefty.  3.5 stars. 
// AMBIANCE // Sleek, quirky and modern. 
// SERVICE // Slow but courteous. The host was very professional and welcoming. 
// FOOD //
     + Tea: aromatic, I leaned towards the very floral or fruity teas. They are more than happy to change out the flavor and add more hot water whenever you're ready.  
     + sandwich: refillable, our favorite was the chicken curry. 
     + dessert: unfortunately more pretty to look at then 
It was a good experience, but not sure if it was worth what we paid. 
*tip: be sure to check out the bathroom, guaranteed you've never seen anything like it.",1
5,"Before I came to London, I heard about Sketch and their infamous pink room for Afternoon Tea. I made my reservation a couple of weeks in advance and alas the day arrived.
We were greeted about three times by different hostesses before we made our way inside the pink room. 
I saw the pics in advanced so I knew what to expect, however, it was still an exciting experience. I couldn't help but feel a Barbie, Willy Wonka, Alice in Wonderland vibe in the room.
The waiters were attentive, some of whom had sexy French accents. We had the champagne tea option. The food came out promptly, the sandwiches were delicious, and the sponge cake we were offered at the end was to die for! 
Take lots of pics, have a laugh at the drawings on the wall, and most importantly visit the bathroom...even if you don't have to go! Sketch is an unforgettable experience! Make your reservation and enjoy!",1
4,"Very unique atmosphere.  We counted 4 different bars and a restaurant (could be wrong, we only got drinks in two of them).  Different vibe for each bar, too..interesting.  The drinks we ordered--a grape vodka drink--sounded interesting.  It was $18euro or so, and it tasted like grape soda and a drip or two of alcohol...lame.  We also got the ""pink ponytail"", which was stronger and delicious, however it was $22euro.  I would go there again for the atmosphere to hang out, but we will drink in our hotel before going in there, otherwise I'd be spending $150 to get a buzz.  
Note:  the bathroom ""pods"" are super cool.",1
5,Impeccable attention to detail and incredible service all night long. Sketch is a dream.,1
4,"Went for afternoon tea and it was really lovely. The ambiance of the room was trendy and alternative. It's a pink room and the walled and plastered with funny sketches :)
The afternoon tea itself was great value for money. The servers were attentive and always asked if we wanted more sandwiches, cakes and tea. The best thing about the experience is the sandwiches... some of the best I have ever had. The cakes are good. 
Would come here again when I can afford it !",1
2,"Fancy it is not , good quality it isn't either 
It's quirky and fun but it's also very expensive for what you get. 
We had the special dish which was a flavorless cut of meat with 3 fried onion rings and 3 cherry tomatoes 
The only thing that was decent was the wine and the bread basket at 4.50 
The wine was pricey but oh well you are in a trendy restaurant in a trendy city so get on with the program !!!!
The sides were vegetables and cream of corn purée not good at all none of these 
We passed on dessert 
Service was on and off ; some someliers are just too full of themselves but our waiter was amazing and the assistant somelier was pretty cool too",-1
5,"It had been two years or so since I visited Sketch and once again it was completely different. This time with dusty pink interior, I got the feeling like I was stuck in the 1960's- all I needed now was big hair and a classic pin-up dress to match.
Opening the menu, I was startled to see paper cutlery pop up, which was pretty cool! As a consumer, I felt like I was gaining an experience rather than just having dinner, I like that it has a museum feel rather that a restaurant.
To begin, I had thinly sliced tuna with Avocado, which was absolutely divine! By now, you should know that I am in love with Sashimi! This was accompanied by a glass of white wine- Pinot to be precise, although I did move onto cocktails in the latter, which is always a bad idea. (Bouji Tip: Never mix cocktails and fish based dishes!) British designer David Shirley designed the plates and his artwork can be seen throughout the restaurant- classic, monochrome, but childlike which is a great conversation starter.
For dessert, I chose Malabar, which has to be the best dessert that I have tried in a long while. I will definitely be back solely to have dessert and cocktails as this was just what my taste buds required; Lemon foam, bubble gum ice-cream, Panna cotta, Orange blossom and strawberry marshmallows. I felt like a little child again 
Oh and you must visit the toilets, which was the highlight of my night! Although that sounds rather weird, which it was, but the toilets are designed into alien egg spaceship capsules. Once inside, something strange happens, you can hear the sound of birds tweeting as you pee. How thoughtful of Sketch!
I never noticed at the beginning but there is actually hopscotch on the floor at the entrance of Sketch. I don't know what possessed me but I actually attempted to hopscotch on the way out! Live a little. Carpe Diem!
Price: £££",1
2,"The place is cute, and they have 3 violinists playing, so it seems magical. But the food was literally disgusting. Who cant even make a decent scone? Its expensive, but I basically paid to take a cute instagram in their pink room, aka the ""Gallery.""  Its a place people go to take an instagram. The service was ill informed about the food, they did not explain anything to us for a 78 per person closed menu. I swear, every dessert was dry, bland or the wrong texture. The sandwiches were just not good, even their chicken salad sandwich had a massive lump of chicken fat. Also I had to pay 4.5 pounds for a bottle of still water BUT they fill your cup up a bit with it and take it back so its more like a third of the bottle, but you still pay.
1 star for gorgeous decor 
.5 star for nice booking people when you call and .5 star violin music",-1
5,"Sketch was at the top of my ""must do"" list for London restaurants, and it did not disappoint! My friend and I arrived about 15 minutes early for our 3:00 high tea reservation, but were seated right away. The pink room is absolutely gorgeous -- something like a dream. Our waitress and everyone who worked there were very nice and helpful. 
Once we stopped gawking at the cuteness of literally everything, we ordered our tea and champagne. Again, we were not disappointed. The pastries and biscuits were lovely.
I definitely recommend this place and will be visiting again on my next trip! 
Oh... and don't miss the bathrooms!",1
5,"My second afternoon tea in London and it was perfect and more than good!
I was a bit worried about this place at first but I was disappointed at all. In fact, I'm always careful about all these trendy places where, sometimes, it's trendy, it could be nice but the food is not good. I wanted to try it, because I knew the restaurant was a two starred Michelin and was directed by Pierre Gagnaire.
The place itself is so funny and full of surprise: all the rooms are totally different and funny. The main room for the afternoon tea is pink everywhere! We tried to find a name for that style but we didn't success! No loud music and the atmosphere is pretty calm.
The service was great, even if we experienced one bad thing: our waitress was really nice, friendly and always wait to let me the time to translate for my parents who can't speak English. She took our order and a careful notice about my sister's allergy to mustard. But, the issue is, the kitchen staff made a mistake and some of the finger sandwiches contained mustard (fortunately, my sister just had one and it's not a too big allergy...) The waitress came to apologize as well as the manager and they did all their best to make our experience incredible (we almost forgot about this small thing :) )
The food was PERFECT! Everything was good, delicious and amazing from the finger sandwiches to the different cakes served. It's expensive but, the food worth the price.
I recommended this place for a nice, perfect but not too fancy afternoon tea experience!",1
5,"I love Sketch. If I could go back every month, I would. But alas, I live in New York and we don't have a Sketch.
Is it a wee bit overblown re its reputation? Probably. But I think the hype is well-deserved. You walk in and the hostesses at the front (who, by the way, are designated for that area) greet you and walk you to the next point after you give your name on the reservation (MAKE A RESERVATION). The next group of hostesses/host then lead you to your table in this giant pink, modern, artsy, chic room. There are giant pink couches and hilarious white/black prints all over the walls. You get seated and a new set of waiters come to take your order.
It's obviously a set menu for high tea, but you can add champagne options (which we did). The food and tea are refillable - we definitely overdid it on the refills, but HEY, it's vacation. Where do I even begin? The sandwiches are delicious and the various different kinds are great for a diverse palette. The desserts are also not too sweet and everything just looks amazing to accompany the great tastes. 
When you're there, don't be ashamed of taking a million and one pictures of the food, the decor, and the people you're with. 
Take a selfie in the strange pod-rainbow bathroom - everyone else is doing it, too. Even if nobody else does it, you do you and you take that picture! 
I loved the attentive, friendly service and the entire experience. Missing it already!",1
5,"The coolest, most Instagrammable bar/restaurant I have ever been to. The cocktail and dessert lists are filled with interesting ingredients, beautiful when served, and amazingly delicious when consumed. The staff is friendly and the bathrooms are an experience of their own! Be sure to book a reservation ahead of time.",1
5,Once in a lifetime experience! This was quite expensive. I have never drank some much tea before I recommend the lemongrass ginger tea. It was quite refreshing. Make sure you save room because the plates just keep on coming but the Victorian cake was outstanding your gonna want to try that for sure!,1
4,"Very posh restaurant with expectedly posh public. You wouldn't go there for an occasional lunch. Its a special occasion dinner place. Food was good, but nothing extraordinary. Deffinetly check out bathroom if going to the gallery room. 
I have to say the decor of the gallery i reaaally liked.",1
3,"Sketch creates an enchanting visual to lose oneself in; the dining experience here is all about the esthetics. A chalk-drawn hopscotch at the entrance announces the restaurant's whimsy; you're not only here to eat, you're here to have an eye-gasm. Ascend the white staircase & feast your eyes on egg-shaped pods & colorful ceiling aka their co-ed bathrooms. One dining room -- a forest of teals & greens; another room -- pale pink & gold & ultra femme. 
Apart from the adornments, Sketch offers very little in the way of an exquisite dinner. His sirloin was tough & flavorless. This isn't the place for a quality steak. As for my cheese plate, there were interesting bits & bobs such as a creamy brie & an accompanying green apple gel, but nothing screamed unique or amazing -- sadly, a stark difference to how Sketch's surroundings made me feel. 
My advice to those curious & intrigued -- indulge in every online pic you can find of the restaurant, immerse yourself in the fun, artistic details...& then spend your pounds wisely by having dinner elsewhere. Entertaining decor impresses me, but a great meal impresses me much more.",-1
5,"We hoped to visit Sketch as soon as we began planning our trip to London. But once we arrived we seemed to be busy or somewhere too far away. On our last night in London, we were waiting for our Uber and realized that we were just around the corner from Sketch. It was almost 11:00pm. So we went over and they were kind enough to let us in without a reservation. We had a really nice time in their stunning bar. Everyone was wonderful, the cocktails were amazing, and the atmosphere was so cool and chill. Can't wait to visit again when we're back in London next year! Maybe we'll be able to experience their afternoon tea!",1
5,"Everything about this restaurant is well thought out and fantastic. 
It's art, meets modern cuisine, topped with amazing service. I would definitely recommend it for catching up with friends, that business lunch you are hoping isn't too stuffy, or just a place to stop by if you are feeling absolutely fabulous.",1
1,"If  I didn't know that Stanley Kubrick has long ago left our beautiful world, I would assume that this place's toilets are going to be one of his next movie's setting.  
Prepare your camera to take a shot of the most interesting - futuristic - artistic toilets you have ever seen. Several white capsules/eggs that cover a huge colorful space, will make you forget why you originally asked for toilet.
Sketch gallery is the dinning room of a michellin restaurant placed between two different themed rooms for drinks.
The gallery rooms itself is a piece of art, full of David Shrigley artistic touches. 
But you will come here for the food, not just for your Instagram addiction. Am I right?
Having a 3 course dinner, I would say that food didn't meet my expectations. 
I would expect much more  from a 2 Michelin stars restaurant, especially when it is so overpriced.
Regarding service, everything was fine.
Conclusion: I wouldn't suggest this place for dinning - but,  for one or two drinks it would be fine.",-1
3,"Poor service. Waited forever to get what we ordered with our tea and then I got mine about 20 mins before my bf got his which...obviously we would want to eat what we ordered together...at the same time. 
They also did a fire alarm drill during our visit (at about 5:40pm). This lasted a decent amount of time as well.
Overall an unpleasant experience. Took a £15 cab ride to get here also.
The mango tart was really good though. I gave it an extra star for that alone.
The tea was okay - nothing spectacular in my opinion.",-1
2,"Food was good. Tea was good. The problem lies with the presentation of it all and the service. We opted for the champagne afternoon tea which came out to 108 USD per person with no additional add-ons. For this price, we would've expected impeccable service especially considering this is afternoon tea. The service was fine, but again, nothing for the price. We had to ask multiple times for more water, more tea, etc. and were never offered it, but always had to ask. Finally, the last ""course"" of the tea was a slice of cake, which our waitress first asked if we would like to split one piece -- a strange thing to ask when we are paying so much for the afternoon. Finally, it felt as though we were rushed out of the table. Again, afternoon tea is meant to be drawn out and to not feel rushed in the slightest, but before we were even done with our cake, without asking if we would like anymore tea or anything else, the check was brought.  We didn't feel as though we ourselves were eating or drinking quickly, and we actually tried to take our time, but they had us in and out in under two hours. At the end of the day, the value was poor and the service not up to the standard one would expect. I would not recommend.",-1
3,"Interiors are A++++ the food could be better. Plating was gorgeous, but the flavors were just OK. Go for the ambiance, if anything. I'm a pretty serious foodie, so keep that in mind.",-1
5,"Timeless classic ,food can be average
To good but the overall scene here is unreal,and they keep reinventing themselves into a more ecelectic avatar than the last",1
5,"Loved the hour spent here, chatting to my friend over tea! The cups were adorable, the plates even better! Nothing not to love...great way to spend a rainy afternoon!",1
3,"Really disappointed in my most recent Sketch experience. Came here 2 years ago to what was the best tea experience in London, beyond the ambiance, the food was amazing (we got seconds of everything) and the tea selection was great. This time however we were left feeling scammed.
They've changed the menu for the worse. The tea selection seems not as special, just your run of the mill teas you can find anywhere rather than the rare & exotic flavors from our first time. The desserts were inedible, the only one eaten was the blueberry cheesecake, otherwise they were all artificially sweet with ZERO texture to them. Even the macaroon, shabbily stuffed with runny icing was left untouched. Overall everything had either a bland or too sweet taste. Even the poor Victoria sponge was dry, it made me wonder if they've hired a kitchen full of first time chefs. 
I would suggest saving your money for a nicer (and undoubtably cheaper) experience at literally ANY other tea salon in London.",-1
5,"Everything you'd hope and more!! 
Outstanding service, the design is impeccable and the food was delicious. 
I'll never come to London without going to sketch.",1
5,"Came here one day while on holiday from the states. One of my highlights of my trip, truly. Prices are definitely not the cheapest in town but the experience was excellent. The place was decorated in a very unique and oddly cute way. There were multiple rooms but we dined in the pink one. All the dishes and flat ware were equally adorable. We had afternoon tea which was about 59£ each (minus alcohol). The food was excellent. We didn't know that we could get free refills on sandwiches, pastries or teas, which was a bummer. The tea selection was amazing. We had the mint and the red dragon, both excellent. Although it is a bit pricey, I would recommend and go here again. Experience and food are an A+ in my book! Also, the restroom are super adorable and again, oddly cute. Definitely an experience you'll need to try if you're in London !",1
5,"I've eaten dinner in The Gallery several times and always enjoyed it - the food is delicious and the whole atmosphere is very tongue-in-cheek.  The champagne coupes are larger than your face, the plates have cheeky labels, and the bathrooms are a surreal experience.
Put on something funky and prepare yourself for an unexpected twist on fine dining.  And make sure to visit the secret cocktail bar tucked below the restrooms for a nightcap.",1
2,"Meh...unless you're a devoted Instagrammer/Snapchatter/design obsessive (or you happen to live in or spend tons of time in London and money is no object) I can think of many better places in London for afternoon tea.  In fact my favorite parts of the experience were the bathrooms (I had no idea so they blew my mind) and the floors...requested a nut free dessert and was punished with an inedible array of mystery gels and fruit leather.  And I'm not kidding about inedible, even my vegan daughter couldn't eat them.  The sandwiches and scones were fine but I've had better.",-1
5,I booked the sketch Afternoon Tea about 20 days before the experience and had a great time there. Soooooo gorgeous surroundings and the food was also very delicious. The  service  was  good  and  you  can  ask  them  to refill  if  you finish your  sandwiches  or  scones and  wanted  more，as well as the cakes from the trolley. There was also live music played by the musicians. It is a great place for girls to take pictures and have reunions. I would definitely go there again and recommend it to my friends.,1
4,"This place is worth visiting just for the interior design, let alone the food. As an art lover I really wanted to see the layout of this place, and I was so pleased! We didn't come here for afternoon tea but I definitely would if I ever go back to London. We had no reservations but we're still seated for breakfast immediately. We came back late at night for drinks too, and they make amazing cocktails.",1
5,"This was such a fun experience! My sister and I did the full tea service here during our first trip to London. The tea room is so cute - everything is pink- and the art lining the walls is quirky and sometimes hilarious. There was a group playing live classical music while we were there, which only added to the elegant experience. The servers were very attentive (always ready to refill your tea or bring more food) and friendly. There were so many delicious sandwiches and desserts and teas to choose from! It was really a magical time and I hope to return one day - even if it's just to see those crazy bathrooms again!",1
5,This place has an amazing breathtaking ambiance. I hear the decor is curated by various designers/artists whom switch out and rotate after a few years. I'm in AWE!  And the food is to die for!,1
3,"Snack/Tea:  My wife and I tried many of their different snacks.  None of them stood out.  I had their black tea, which had a nice hint of orange to it.
Snack/Tea rating:  3.5/5
Service:  Service here was decent
Service rating:  3.5/5
Price:  Expect to pay about 45 euros ($65) per person.
Overall:  This was my very 1st afternoon tea experience.  It was very interesting decor, with good tea, but the snacks were pretty dull that is not cheap.",-1
5,"My boyfriend and I had brunch here. Unfortunately, our reservation wasn't for the typical pink room or the bathroom that everyone takes pictures in, but regardless the food was amazing. I ordered the granola bowl and my boyfriend got the eggs with parmesan cheese. I definitely loved my boyfriends eggs more! A little pricey but you go for the ambiance/decor of the place.",1
4,"My wife and I were visiting London this week and were advised by a friend that we had to have afternoon tea at Sketch. We made a reservation a few days in advance and were not disappointed when we arrived. We were shown to our seats in the basement gallery room and offered a drink, I enjoyed a Matcha Bellini and it was a wonderful way to start the sketch experience!  Our first food offering was a small plate with slices of toast, a small serving of caviar and a ceramic egg with some kind of yummy cheese, my wife did not want the caviar and instead was offered a veggie version.  Next we were brought a 3 tiered tray of yummies, one tier of lovely finger sandwiches and 2 tiers of sweets, they were all quite delicious! They give you the option to order extra helpings of the food but be careful because there is plenty more to come! Next we were offered a choice of scones, with or without raisons, these were accompanied with wonderful clotted cream and 3 choices of jam. After the scones were were offered Victorian Sponge cake and Banana Toffee cake, the sponge cake was the winner as far as I was concerned.    We enjoyed 4 or 5 pots of different tea and they were all very nice. Overall it was a wonderful experience, the ambiance was very nice, the servers were very friendly and helpful. As wonderful as it was I would say it was a bit of a novelty, something that would be nice to do once a year or so. Be prepared to pay for the experience, this was not an inexpensive meal but to do it every once in a while it is well worth it. After a few pots of tea you will of course have to visit the toilet which are quite memorable at Sketch, they look like giant eggs or pods, I called them Disco Poo Pods for obvious reason, well obvious to me anyway. All I can say is that Mork from Ork would feel at home sitting on one of the poo pod thrones!",1
3,"It is most beautiful to visit, but I did not find the food that amazing.
I had the lobster bisque served on a bed of black basmati rice.  I was not a fan of black rice, and found it very liquidy, than a great broth.
The veal promised, lemon and capers, and it arrived deep fried and dry, sparse capers, and a lemon curd.  It was very disappointing and I left it behind.
They charge you to order bread $4.50 pounds,  really?
And the hostess kept pushing cocktails on me, even after I told her I was not drinking, she came back with a wine menu just in case I changed my mind.
The Yelp reviews rarely mention the food, and now I know why.,",-1
5,"Absolutely divine! This place has an all green room sprinkled with fur and deep purple accents that allow you to imagine an Alice in Wonderland experience. Adjacent to the green room is the all pink room with suede pink furniture and David Shrigley artwork circling the space. Sketch offers breathtaking space, from their two main bars, to the mini bar in the bathroom, to the bathroom itself, and even the coat check.",1
5,"I remember the hype when Sketch first opened, and it speaks for the place that it is still just as special and buzzing more than ten years later.  If anything it has got better, each room has a special feel to it which is enhanced by Sketch's well thought through strategy of using art and music.  And while the pods are no longer a secret, a trip to the Sketch bathroom is an experience in its own right.
I didn't stay long enough to sample any food on my last visit, just sipping a bespoke cocktail at a private function on this occasion.  Mind you, the sheer number of reviews here and the consistent high rating speak for themselves.  Sketch is no longer a mere sketch but an Old Master at making a visit to a restaurant an experience to remember.",1
2,"Seems like Sketch is one of those places where everyone is in town for the first time has to go to, at least for a picture of their infamous toilets. Long story short: it's a beautifully designed place indeed, with really average food and cocktails, and service is a hit and miss. In two words I would say: overrated and overpriced. Would definitely not come back.",-1
4,"Easily one of the most unique and fun spaces I've been to. Incredibly kind and hospitable service, which was a little unexpected for such a trendy place. The environment is just delightful - pictures cannot capture how beautiful and weird the dining rooms, bars and bathrooms are. Worth your while to check out in London. 
I came here for dinner (unfortunately missed the uber Instagram-friendly high tea) and had a lovely time. We had a delicious drink at the bar before moving into the pink dining room, and the service was absolutely fantastic - the bartenders were friendly, accommodating and knowledgable. 
Dinner was also very nice, though the service was not quite as on point as at the bar (likely because they were very busy). The food is good - not mind blowing - but fun and quirky, like the ambiance. My favourite was the Tchouki dessert, which was fluffy, lemony, marshmallowy, bubble gummy, ice creamy... super hard to describe, but totally one of a kind.",1
5,"This is such a fun place to go to! It's quite expensive, so I consider it a place to go to for a special occasion. The atmosphere is just amazing, the furniture and lighting is just so cool and the service is impeccable. The food was all delicious and so inventive. We ordered the duck and it was the perfect plate to share with my date! They first cut out one part of the duck and with the rest they make a paté. Everything was spot on and it is totally worth it going.",1
4,"This was definitely a decadent experience. But I knew that I wanted a splurge on my visit to London for mine and my friend's birthdays. I managed to snag a last minute reservation in the pink room.
The decor, in all pink, plush, and gold, made the experience unique and whimsical. The staff were all polite and friendly. Once we were seated, we were greeted by the Champagne Popper [yes a person who's sole role was to pop open bottles of champagne!] who sold us on ordering their Rose. His recommendation was solid and we enjoyed it [despite the price tag on just the one glass]. 
Then we had the caviar guy come over in his full pink velvet suit with a top hat! And after him, our tea master came over to introduce herself and offer recommendations and answer any tea related questions. Finally our finger sandwiches came out and we put in our orders of teas.
I tried several different pots of teas and I became full despite barely touching the sandwiches and cakes. And of course, took several trips to the restroom to experience the pods! 
Overall, the entire time at the Sketch was an experience from beginning to end. 
They also had a trio of violinists playing as we had our meal!",1
5,"It was fun to explore the menus at the three different places decorated in different ways at Sketch. We had brunch, afternoon tea and a late night drink 2 days in a row. The food was pretty tasty. But what impressed me the most was the bathroom with the most creative design. This place should be a must for whoever in town.",1
1,If zero stars was possible I would put it. The portions are extremely small and the food is deplorable. The fairy forest just looks like the rain forest cafe not to be rude but I wouldn't recommend.,-1
5,"Really enjoyed the ambience of this place. The bathrooms are great, high tea is an experience, and the food is actually pretty tasty. Definitely go at least once to make your London experience complete.",1
3,"We went on a Thursday night and had a table for 2. To be honest, the food was OK. I expected it to be better according to the value for money. of course it is known for the interior and I totally understand why it is not known for the food. Overall we had a pleasant night but the food just didn't fulfill our expectations.",-1
4,"This place is super trendy. The reason people are attracted to this restaurant is the inner decor. I came with my friend on the first night and was curious about modern European food. We we're seated by the bar, and they didn't care about our dress code that much, of course, try to dress nice to fit in. Plastered in square ""sketches"" all over their pink, very dim room with lounge-esque tables and chairs and a bar (we sat at the bar) It's a lot to take in. We tried to read as much of the sketches/cartoons as possible. People literally come for egg pod toilets. Unisex and elevated on another level by the stair case, this place takes a bathroom experience to a whole new futuristic level. The elevated level felt like a nest for these eggs. I had some risotto that was covered in green sauce and mustard ice cream for dessert. All the flavors are dynamic and interesting. Not something you would find anywhere else. For a trial run, I would highly recommend this place, but honestly, the food palette surprised me so much and I didn't love the food. Maybe come for brunch or cocktails at night to take in this places interior designs.",1
5,"AMAZING!
This place was beyond. Food was great, drinks were great, vibes were great...everything.
This place has a lot of rooms and somewhat secret rooms that are all decorated so nicely, all have bars. The bathroom is where everyone takes pictures because its so futuristic. Will be coming back to London to grab afternoon tea at Sketch!",1
5,"UM yes go here! 
Good food, drinks, service and man the ambiance is just too cool! 
Rooms I saw with my own eyes:
- gallery (big pink room) 
- glade (really cute fairytale-esk room) 
My friend and I ate in the gallery, it was so pink! But we loved it! Everyone we encountered at Sketch provided exception service and they must have a great hiring process because these people seemed genuinely nice too! 
The food, as I write this, I'm debating if I have time to go back for another meal during my short 4 day trip to London. Yes that good.  I highly recommend the veal and the cauliflower gratin and of course for dessert the sketch chocolat. 
As for cocktails just ask them to choose one they're all good!",1
3,"If you are going for unique and very quirky...Sketch is your place. You are greeted by hop skotch when you enter and some very different and entertaining art in the parlour to the right. If you head on straight through you see some of their other themed rooms which are also a sight to see. At the end are the famous egg shaped toilet stalls which make you feel as if you are in some sci-fi or futuristic show.
The desserts in the parlour were pretty good but the food was so so. This wouldn't be high on my list of places to eat in London  but it was fun anyway.",-1
4,"This place is epitome of what an afternoon tea should be.  When you walk in, you are welcomed by lavish curtains, dimmed lighting, and pink walls to set the perfect ambiance to sip tea and converse forever.
On our visit, we had afternoon tea for 2. It comes with layers of assortment of goodies from macarons, chocolates, meringues, and finger sandwiches and much more.  Quail egg finger sandwiches were to die for! Had couple refills, which is complementary along with the tea.  I ordered the blackberry herb tea and the color and taste was just so me, pink! I adored this place!  
This was my last stop during our 6 hour crammed day trip in London and it was one of the best part of the day! Not to mention that my online reservations weren't showing up in their system... I was literally about to have a fit if we weren't able to experience it. Luckily one of the host sat us, during the reservation chaos while the other host was asking me to scrimmage through my email to find the confirmation on my almost battery drained, dying phone with bad data connection. 
For this I couldn't give this place 5 stars.  Some staff were a bit too snobbish for their own good, including our server...  Lighten up, maybe they need a tea break as well.  
Do visit the bathroom during your visit.  It's pretty fascinating and bizzard that people are taking pictures in front of the bathroom.  Guilty of taking pics as well, bathroom is pretty unique with their individual white egg pods that simulate wilderness sounds that reminds you of being in jurassic park museum before things went sour.  But in the end, it's a fancy porter potty!
Oh, and be ready to cough up some $$~
Wasn't friendly on your wallet, but will always remember this visit! Who knows when we'll ever go back to London.",1
2,"I went here for high tea with some friends. It took us 40 minutes to get someone to just give us water. It took another 30 minutes to place our tea order. In short the service was abysmal! I was so disappointed and so were my friends. The scones were not warm and they forgot to give them to us- and we had to remind them. 
I will not be returning, and I have heard from others they have had the same experience.",-1
2,"Incredibly overpriced for the food they deliver.
The drinks were good and the service was excellent. But the portions were small and there was nothing imaginative or especially high quality about the food that would support the price point. On the way home I eyed a Nandos and seriously considered going.  Hoping they fix the food OR lower the prices to make this a better experience for diners!",-1
2,"The service was downright awful. Although the servers were pleasant when they did finally show up, we felt invisible all night.  Including when we had to request the bill 3 times over more than half an hour!  The food was fair, certainly nothing to brag about. We had been a year ago and everything was so much better. The decor and ambiance are still fun, but all in all not worth the cost or aggravation.",-1
2,"Here on a honeymoon trip, our last night in London. We were so excited to see Sketch. We had the best time in London at all of the other top restaurants and bars and expected the same here. 2 hours spent here in total, with about an hour and 15 mins of just waiting. We sit down,l and  no one came or offereds us water for 20 mins. I dont think you realize how long 20 mins is until you just sit there at a restaurant. It also took us 30 mins to get our bill. As in, we looked around for our waitress for a full 30 mins. She could tell we had terrible service our entire meal and did not do anything to try and end our experience on a good note. If you want to eat here, go for it but I'm sure you will not want to come back. Our dinner was at 10:30pm by the way, so not during what would be considered ""dinner rush"" either. If this restaurant wants to keep repeat customers, you need to staff more wait staff to keep the tables turning. They're still basically full with the exception of a couple of tables so you should not have two or three waiters for the whole room. The decor is quite beautiful and you get pretty photos, but we all have Google for that now. Save yourselves $120 (for two people, we skipped apps as we were starving by the time they got us our water and cocktail menus). The quality of your hospitality and service is everything at a restaurant. I'm sure we will be back to London for business and pleasure, and I'm pretty sure we won't be back here.",-1
4,"One of my favorites in London. I went here for the interior and high tea, which was delicious.",1
4,"I was hesitant on the number of stars to give this place because it is very dynamic. ATMOSPHERE: 100%  five stars, every room is like stepping into a parallel universe. I am sure most people have seen the bathrooms on social media, but everything from the coat check to the tea room is instagram worthy. MENU: cute, yummy, but overpriced, 3.5 stars. SERVICE: 2, very nice people but very unorganized. It was not a busy day and we waited forever for just one drink and a macaroon. We were not even sure who our waiter really was because 3 different people approached our table.",1
3,"This review is for the Lecture Room at dinnertime with the tasting menu and vegetarian tasting menu: 
I recently visited The Lecture Room with my boyfriend for a nice dinner while on holiday. Making a reservation was easy. I did mine online, got an email confirmation, and then also a phone confirmation the day before. 
Upon arrival, we were greeted outside of Sketch by a very polite gentleman who showed us inside. We asked to have a drink at the bar because we were early for our reservation. I had the Cable Car (I think that's what it was called) and it was delicious. It smelt strange because of the egg, but it was quite tasty and very flavorful. 
After I finished my drink, we went back out into the main hallway and were escorted through a roped off set of stairs up to the restaurant. The door was opened for us and our chairs pushed in at the table. We were seated in the room closest to the street. The chairs were incredibly comfortable and the ambiance was nice. It was quiet and nobody was ever very loud. I did feel like I had to speak more softly than normal, despite the distance across from my boyfriend being rather wide. 
I ordered the vegetarian tasting menu, while my boyfriend ordered the regular tasting menu. Both had the same amount of courses and the same timing, although mine was about 20-30 pounds cheaper. We were offered champagne but we declined. This was our first ever Michelin experience and we were very excited to start trying the food. 
Each course was mostly timed well. It gave us time to digest in between, although toward the end we were so full it became hard to finish the courses. Rather than go through every course we had, I'll just speak in generalities. 
Before eating, I had expected that this would be one of the most flavorful and best meals of my life.  While the courses were indeed flavorful, none of them blew my mind. I hardly do fine dining, but I can still recognize amazing flavors and great taste. Most of the courses were good, but again, not life changing. My favorites were the asparagus ice cream/soup dish, goat cheese ravioli, strawberry dessert, and chocolate mousse (not sure what all was in it) dessert. My least favorite was the very dry pancake. All in all, I would rate the food about a 7/10 in taste, 8/10 in unique combinations and flavors, and 9/10 in presentation. 
Service-wise, everything was great for the first 2.5 hours. Our waters were always filled (not free water btw), napkins folded when we left the table, doors opened for us on the way to the bathroom, courses explained (sometimes hard to understand the thinker French accents), and chairs pushed in for us. Around the 3 hour mark, our service began to decline. Some of the people who arrived after us and were on the same eating pace as us began getting their courses ahead of us. We waited quite a long time between the last course, the desserts, and the petit fours. 
Also, after we were clearly finished with the final petit fours, we sat around and waited for 30-40 minutes to get our check. That really was the worst part of the evening, as it was nearing midnight and we were ready to leave. It's like everyone just checked out and forgot about us. We were the last to leave in our room, despite having finished our food at the same time as everyone else.  
Service for the first 60% of the dinner: 10/10. Service for the last 40%: 6/10. Should have been amazing the entire time. 
The food was good, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't go again because nothing was very memorable or mind blowing as I had expected. Perhaps my expectations were too high for a Michelin experience, but I just wouldn't spend the money to eat here again. Overall, the experience was great and the food was sufficient.",-1
5,"Sketch is unexpected. And weird. And fantastic. Pink. Everywhere. Small crappy but very hipster sketches on the walls. Staff is well dressed. Hostesses are tall and beautiful. 
Afternoon tea. Gluten free sandwiches and pastries. Traditional. Fun. British.
Visit the loo. ""Wait, what?"" Yes. Visit the loo. It is unexpected. And weird. And fantastic.",1
5,"Oh Sketch, why is there nothing like you in San Francisco?
I've never felt quite so classy and girly in my life and I loved every minute of it! 
~Decor~
While visiting one of my favorite gal pals in London we stopped in at this wondrous spot. All the rooms are decorated in different ways but they all hold their own charm. The main room is this fun pink land with hand sketched art showcasing some occasionally dark humo(u)r.
Sketch is probably most known for their unique bathroom. A clean white room with individual ""pods"" for use, stained glass ceiling panels, and FYI it's co-ed.
~Food~
My only regret is that I couldn't eat more of the finger sandwiches. They were all so good, although a special call out must be made to the *Mozzarella and Pesto Panini* GET IT!
~Tea~
Amazing variety of choices, everything from Green to Herbal to Black. Honestly though I think I only tried one; would love to go back and split many teas among a large group.
~Service~
I'm almost positive everyone who works here is French...I can't prove it but I highly suspect it. Service is amazing and not just that; the uniform for both the men and women is v. classy and makes you feel like you are fine dining.",1
5,"Really enjoyed Sketch for afternoon tea service. The reservations for the main room were fully booked but there are two other rooms (not quite as fancy but still really nice) that are first come first serve. One is an enchanted garden theme and the other one is a French patisserie. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. All of the food was delicious and they will refill sandwiches or tea you enjoyed. It is a splurge at 45 pounds a person but that is the average price for afternoon tea. Definitely a quirky place for a different experience. PS check out the bathrooms, each stall is a giant egg",1
1,"Coming from New York City, this has to be the most disappointing place I found in London. The food is average at best (especially seeing as I paid nearly $50 per entree). Also, when they ""offer"" you bread and olives, SAY NO!!!!!! THEY CHARGE YOU NEARLY $7 FOR EACH! Place is quite awful. Would never recommend to anyone, especially for this kind of price. It also attracts an older, not very trendy crowd, so if you're looking for that definitely do not come here. At lease the bathrooms were cool.",-1
5,"Tea here is amazing, and worth every peenie. I would go in to debt eating here if I could, the customer service is out of this world and the cakes are so F*ing tasty.",1
5,"This place was a dream! Great service, beautiful decor and ambiance, and the food and drinks were perfect. I went for high tea and I have to say it exceeded my expectations. I'd recommend reserving way advance because it's a hard reservation to come by, but it is worth the extra effort! I will be back :)",1
1,I had HUGE expectations for this restaurant when going there. I ordered the French toast (that was the size of less then a half piece of bread)  and a raspberry Bellini and paid almost 30$. The service was terrible and the fire alarm kept going off tell us to leave. Honestly the only good thing about this restaurant was the decor and the bathrooms. Would not recommend,-1
5,This is my absolute favorite place to eat when I'm visiting London. The food is perfection. The drinks are to die for. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Definitely Instagram worthy.,1
4,"Marvelous and stunning interior, totally a stop for any londoner or tourist.  Incredible food and tea selection.  I would say the service was insanely slow though and I had to waive them down several times to get the check or order.  Surprised by that since your paying for the experience and it's not cheap.  The bathrooms were pretty wondrous, check those out!",1
4,"***FOR AFTERNOON TEA ONLY***
I had heard of Sketch many times before, primarily for their different designed rooms. So having scheduled to be in London for only 24-hours on my recent trip, I made the effort to book reservations at Sketch for quintessential afternoon tea. I made reservations online approximately three weeks in advanced and easily booked the designated time I had wanted for the Gallery (the pink room). 
Afternoon Tea is preset for person at £36. It includes sandwiches, scones, and desserts, at minimum one piece of each item on the menu for the number of people at the table, and a pot tea of your choice. Any additional cocktails or champagne is outside of the set price.
Don't under estimate the sandwiches and desserts! It's all very filling! The pesto panini is the only warm sandwich on the menu, so it's suggested that you eat it first. Service is oddly quick. The scones are wonderfully crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The earl grey macarons are great too. My favorite sandwiches were the panini and the salmon with cream. If you happen to like more than the rest, you can ask for more! We sure did with the panini sandwiches. 
For anyone booking late in the afternoon, tables have to be returned by 18:00. I had reserved a table for 16:30 and the hour and a half was easily enough time. Beware - there is a cancellation fee if you don't show up! Its just as much as afternoon tea per person(£30)!!!",1
5,"I absolutely adore this place. When I walked in, I knew that was my type of place. It's super girly, whimsical, funky and well decorated. As an event planner, this is a perfect place to throw a party and a great place for girls get together. 
The bathroom was definitely one of the coolest I have ever seen. I must confess it's the first time I ever took pictures in the bathroom cuz the design is just so unique. 
I got some scones and tea. Honestly the scones were slightly disappointing but the ambiance totally made up for it. 
If you are ever in London, this is a cute place to check out.",1
4,"Had a great time at sketch. It's definitely a site to see. The different rooms are fun and the bathroom is outrageous! I enjoyed the first, less formal room. We did not need a reservation and still were able to get tea and lovely cakes. I'm very glad we did not do the pink room. It seemed a bit overrated for the cost. It was still fun to see though.",1
3,"Expected a really great experience for the price and I did not get it at all. The tea was cold and we had to ask repeatedly for new tea because it was unpleasant to drink such cold tea. The sandwiches were not very good. It is very pretty in the room, but I would much rather go to a place where the food and desserts are actually good. A couple of the desserts tasted like you were drinking perfume. Would not return.",-1
5,"Pros
Salmon sandwich 
Curry chicken sandwich
Pesto mozzarella 
White peach lemon verbana  cheesecake
Veuve cliq
Cons
I just don't like cucumber Sammie
  
Those little cakes WILL fill you up. Don't let it fool you
Little confusion over the champagne.  They will send over the ""sommelier""  and you may sit there stumped like why is he here. Here is why he is here. KEEP READING. 
If you are planning on ordering more than one glass of champagne between two people go ahead and get the bottle it's cheaper but they won't tell you this.
They have created   champagne concotion of Earl Grey and vanilla tea is 25 pounds PER GLASS but the novelty is worth it BUT NO NECESSARY FOR THE EXPERIENCE.
I'm sure we will be doing this in the states within they year.",1
5,"An absolute must! After having a spectacular vegan high tea in the most aesthetically pleasing gallery ever, the price was redundant. It's best to see the price as an art gallery ticket plus high tea. While you're at it, splurge with a champagne! It completes the experience seamlessly.",1
5,This place is breathe taking. I love everything about it's futuristic modern style. Amazing themed rooms and awesome staff. The food was just scrumptious. You will be pleased. A must go if your in London.,1
2,"Definition of ""Tourist Trap."" I went for high tea. The most redeeming quality is the (theoretical) unlimited tea and the trendy, photo-worthy bathroom. If you've seen a picture, you've had plenty of the experience. The food is subpar and overly sugary. The service is quite slow. Though they say you can order unlimited tea, good luck getting your server's attention when you want more. It's a fascinating gallery, but for high tea in particular, I don't want to pay 70 quid to look at art that a 10 year old could have made while constantly struggling to flag down my server. I would recommend a more classic place for high tea, where you actually get a traditional experience and your money's worth.",-1
4,"We booked in advance for afternoon tea and I must say I was pretty eager to sit at that beautiful pink room. First time we showed up there hoping for a walk in, ""no could do"": we were offered to take the same tea in another room, but I decided to just place a booking for another time because I needed to inject a good dose of pinkness on my instagram feed. :)
The pink room is as beautiful as you can imagine, a bit darker than I expected but it certainly improves the ambience, as bright lights in restaurants just kill the mood. Crank up your camera's ISO and you'll be fine. :D The service is impeccable; smiling and awfully polite staff as it should be. Soon after being seated I was informed that they were having a ""special"" afternoon tea event  (extra charge). I didn't really understand but didn't complain; I was just looking forward my treat. But I do recommend checking carefully before booking as the surcharge was substantial.
Teas were delicious and you can chose from an interesting selection. The crockery fun and it's available to buy, if you can afford it. :) Usually the weakest part of an afternoon tea for me are the sandwiches, the same boring classics your nan would've put on your lunch box, often dried out bread + meagre fillings. Not here: the offerings are interesting, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I was indeed very happy that they give you refills. The scones were nicely done, warm and the perfect texture; the cakes were more like desserts, not the classic slices you'd get at traditional places (and not the best part, in my opinion) but tasty enough and very well presented. thankfully not a tacky cupcake in sight here. 
In the end we were offered one extra sweet and then finished our teas at leisure. We left satisfied and recommending the experience to our friends. please do pop to the loos at some point, as like everyone here pointed out they're worth having a look.",1
5,Sketch was such a fun experience to have. You need a reservation but we went a little early and they were able to seat us right away. The service was great. I would recommend anyone to come here and enjoy afternoon tea,1
3,"Went here because my sister wanted to visit. Food was bland, service was subpar.  For what you pay for (around $100 per person), it's not worth a visit. People just come here for the ""insta"".  The ""Tea Masters"" were ladies who are suppose to help you choose what type of tea you want to try. However, they literally looked like they didn't want to be there and acted as if any questions we asked were bothersome.  The only good service we received was from the gentleman in the one-piece jumpsuit. Food is not good, you can always ask for more, but it wasn't good enough to ask for seconds.  Save your money and go elsewhere.",-1
4,"The place is always a joy to come... nice drink and great people, and services.
No need to mention the toilets, but the wine list could be improved...
The bartenders are very good! Worth to try some great cocktails.",1
1,"Man ordered a drink and the bartender poured it halfway and then stopped. He continued to do nothing and was talking to the other bartenders. I asked him politely where was my drink and he said ""I got other things to do you have to wait more"". Shocking experience and I left and management seemed not to care. Seems like these things only happen in London. Do not go here.",-1
5,"Quirky is an 18th-century townhouse tea room that transforms into a cocktail lounge every evening. This place is so chic and has a really wonderful interior design, Quirky has several bars and restaurants that are all very unique.",1
5,"It's taken me a while to write this review (possibly due to the ensuing sugar coma) but I took my uber cool sister to afternoon tea here for her birthday.
I knew from the moment we stepped inside the red-lit entrance hall that I'd picked the perfect place for her - my sis is creative, arty and trendy in that 'I'm-not-even-trying' way, and the woman that greeted us looked like a work of art herself. I actually had to do a double-take as she stood even taller than me, wearing 4-inch platform heels, cropped trousers, statement necklace, bright lips and a completely bald head. I had to stifle an embarrassing gasp as she stepped out of nowhere, almost android-like, and referred to her iPad. I was simultaneously relieved I'd made an effort with my own outfit and excited about seeing the rest of the place after this start.
It didn't let me down - we were seated in the outer garden-themed room by the bar, which was open and airy thanks to the skylight and decorated with leafy vines and greenery. It all felt a little Alice in Wonderland (though without a mad hatter in sight) as we sat on cutely mismatched garden furniture; I took my usual spot next to the bookshelf :)
Tea was delicious - though be warned it's heavily biased to sweet over savoury versus other teas in London. The sandwiches were fine but over quickly and it's two tiers of sweet tooth heaven from then on. The key component to impress me on is always the scones, which arrived separately and were fabulously soft-not-crumbly here and nicely warmed through, with generous amounts of clotted cream (always a must). After that, the third dessert chapter was also delicious, but - and I can't believe I'm saying this - possibly too much?! There's 2 full tiers of little cakes and dessert pots which are all so incredibly sweet that it's difficult for even a seasoned after tea-er like myself to finish everything they offer you, let alone any refills.
The service was attentive and friendly throughout, and I was glad we were seated in the light garden room, particularly when I walked through the larger inner room which had a different feel completely - more cave-like and much dimmer. That walk led me to the now-legendary toilets here, which reminded me of that scene in Godzilla when Matthew Broderick finds the eggs in Madison Square Garden. Only with multi-coloured lights on the ceiling and very bright white 'eggs'. In fact each pod is a toilet cubicle complete with its own sound system - mine seemed to be playing an old radio broadcast whilst my sister's played animal noises. It's a little confusing (still not sure whether there's separate guy/girl pods) but makes going to the loo an adventure in itself!
It all added to the slightly wacky arty vibe that shows they have a sense of humour behind all the serious art on the walls, and meant we were very happy to while away a few hours sipping tea refills, people-watching the very well put together crowd, and trying to find more dessert stomach space. It's a relatively reasonable price tag of £35 for the full package you get, and my fave for a slightly quirky afternoon tea in London. They rotate the artists and room themes too - yet another reason to go back again :)",1
5,"The Sketch is an amazing place. 
I was visiting London for the first time and afternoon tea was a must during my visit. I made a reservation online for afternoon tea in the Gallery Room about two weeks prior and there were a lot of openings. When I first arrived, I was greeted promptly by the friendly host.
When you first enter Sketch, you're already in awe because of its decor. Each room has a different set up/theme....even the bathroom! It is gorgeous!
When I first entered the Gallery Room, I was simply amazed. The decor totally sets the tone for afternoon tea with a loved one, friends or family.
Service was beyond my expectations. Our lovely server was super attentive, friendly and helpful. Other members of the staff came by to help and they were all pleasant as well.
The finger sandwiches and desserts that come with afternoon are all delicious! You can get free refills on all of the items, so do ask for more! My favorites were the finger sandwich with quail egg and caviar on top, the strawberry/raspberry cheesecake, early grey macaron, and the chocolate cake. I ordered the Black Currant Hibiscus tea and that was lovely. It was sweet and very flavorful. 
Overall, my experience at Sketch was beyond my expectation. I would definitely come back here again when I am in London. 
Tips:
--Sketch is walkable distance from Piccadilly Circus Underground Station. It's about a 8-10 minute walk.
--Make a reservation. They usually are fully booked o the weekends. 
--You can get free refills on all the sandwiches and desserts that come with your afternoon tea. 
--You can try another tea for no additional charge. 
--There is a 2 hour maximum.",1
4,"Fantasy. Alien. Pink. White.
Words that came to mind with my dinner last week
Escargot
Whole Duck (portion enough for four)
Foie Gras Terrine
Lamb Chops
Udon (kinda bland)
Spinach
Steam Veggies (need some flavors)
*Basically ordered everything*
I have to say, the food was just above average but the presentation, decor and atmosphere skyrocketed. Several 'themed' rooms to try out. It was a perfect night to a not-so-perfect rainy evening. The White room that has another bar and an endless staircase that takes you to the restroom area...which was an experience all by itself.",1
4,"Sketch is quirky, it's imaginative, and it's thoroughly fun - both in terms of food and atmosphere. For example, the food ranges from strange dishes to classics to re-inventions of classic dishes with a cheeky addition of something you would never add but sort of works. My club sandwich had beetroot jelly and crayfish in it. Usually I like a club sandwich with chicken, bacon and mayo in it. My tastebuds were shocked but not in an entirely terrible way.
We visited the parlour, which is less formal than the other two eating rooms in Sketch. You can order what you want when you want, unlike the other two rooms which are more suitable for lunch, dinner and afternoon tea. As you walk in, you see a bar with lots of delicious looking and colourful cakes stacked high. Try and avoid that temptation. We couldn't! After my club sandwich I had a chocolate and coffee tart, which was heavier on the coffee side than the chocolate. That disappointed me a bit as I don't think you should ever have less chocolate in your life...
In the room, I was mesmerised by the different types of people. There was a fabulous old lady near us who had come in alone for a martini and cake and was reading a book. I want to be like that in a few years. There were some bloggers taking pics of their cake and cocktails and there were groups of friends. For some reason, there were very few men in the room. Maybe that's because the portions are on the small side or maybe it's because men don't appreciate  the quirkiness - they come to eat, then leave.
If it were for the toilets alone - individual cubicles shaped like eggs where men and women share the same wash basins it would get five solid stars. Six if I could give it six. The cubicles play bird song music, for goodness sake. But it is expensive for small portion sizes, my desert wasn't chocolatey enough and I'm still not convinced they needed to tamper with a classic club sandwich.",1
3,"Sketch is an impressive place to visit.  The decor is really unique!  You walk thinking that you have walked into a different time. There are so many little details in the cultlary,  the menu, the entire out lay that make this place really fun! The loo is really cool and very differ to anything I have ever seen. 
 The staff is extremely attentative!  They talk you through what is on the menu and make recommendations.  
The downside was mostly the main course.  I ordered he chicken frikasse.  It seemed the the,chicken was undercooked.. Not ideal for chicken.  The texture was interesting as they had added popcorn to the dish.  All in all, it wasn't a great dish. The dessert was very small but tasty.  I tried the hazelnut and praline dessert with brandy sauce.  
The Virgin cocktails were delicious!  
I would expect top notch food for a place like this considering how expensive it is.",-1
4,"It seems the main reason to visit sketch is for the ambiance, and I love that each room is a work of art. The 'forest room' is a great spot for an evening drink. The Gallery is lovely although they keep it a bit dark for my liking, and the pink sofas are looking a bit tatty and could probably be reupholstered. The bathrooms are definitely the highlight- they are just so unique and gorgeous!
Afternoon tea: £45 per person and the food was delicious- my friend and I especially loved the savory sandwiches and the scones. The tea and food is unlimited, so if you're feeling especially hungry you can ask for more of everything! We definitely requested extras of our favorite sandwiches (grilled cheese, smoked salmon, and coronation chicken) and only felt slightly cheeky doing so. The service at tea was superb. Everyone that works in The Gallery is incredibly nice and helpful and they always made sure we had plenty of food and warm tea. We left feeling very stuffed and content! 
Drinks: I returned another evening for drinks at sketch and was not as impressed as with the tea. We explored each of the rooms until settling on the forest room for some cocktails, where a waiter showed us to a table but then promptly ignored us for quite a while. When we finally flagged down someone to take our orders, they were friendly enough, but took about 20 minutes to bring over the drinks. The cocktails were fine but nothing special. Given that we had popped in for a quick drink before dinner elsewhere, we ended up only having a few minutes to finish our drinks by the time they finally arrived, so it was disappointing to feel rushed. 
In conclusion- I'd recommend sketch when you want to treat yourself to a nice afternoon tea, but would probably skip the cocktail rooms.",1
5,"great experience here for afternoon tea! size of afternoon tea is definitely big enough, great selection of tea choices",1
5,Such a fun environment!! All pink and the sea bass was light and delicious. Be sure to reserve!!,1
5,"Sketch is a magical place with ever changing rooms, yummy beautiful food, mismatched furniture and FREAKING. AWESOME. TOILETS. 
Most people come here for the afternoon tea which is stacked full of delicious sweet treats but they also do a great lunch menu with one of the best foie gras burgers I have ever tasted. 
Came here once for a set menu dinner too which turned out to be too good to be true. Food was strangely just not up to scratch but maybe that was just a one time offence. I forgive you Sketch. 
Now let's talk about their toilets. Their awesome individual egg shaped toilets with soothing bird chirps to sing you to poops. Let's not forget the cleaner wondering around in a French maid outfit and their colourful stained glass ceiling. Ahh it's all so magical.",1

5,"I gave up my Gordon Ramsay dinner to have afternoon tea here. And I don't regret it at all.
What an experience! If you think afternoon tea is boring, too frou-frou, for grandmas, or just a waste of money, come to Sketch! You'll definitely see afternoon tea in a new light and lose a few pounds while you're at it. Har, har, har. (I heard the British like puns. Okay, bad joke.)
This tea is on the pricey side but worth every pence. It includes unlimited tea and food service within your two hour time frame and you don't have to be embarrassed at all when asking for seconds. As chic and cool the ladies are here, they are very nice and accommodating. They are also very patient. I took pictures of everything and held up service. Yes, I was one of those people but who could blame me? Sketch was meant to be photographed and social media-ed out. Actually, you really have to experience it yourself. Its an amazing place.
We really took our time and enjoyed our tea, sandwiches, and sweets. And when we were done, we walked all around the Gallery to giggle at the very witty sketches. As the British would say, ""Absolutely brilliant.""
Also, don't wait too long to use the loo. It's a conversation piece for sure.
Hopscotch ya later~",1
5,"If you are a collector of fancy toilets like me, you must check out sketch. My memory of sketch were three main themes: artsy interior decoration, egg pods toilets from the future and innovative high tea. 
Upon our arrival, the receptionist led us to walk through a hall way, passed the giant dinning room then to our tea room. Walking in the tea room,you would feel that you are Alice in wonderland !!! The high tea was lovely with assorted finger sandwiches. The sandwich with quail eggs and caviar was my favorite. I also like the one with sliced asparagus/ cucumber on top. The scones were soft inside and crunchy on the skin. They made a perfect match with jam and clotted cream. The selection of pastries were fantastic. The portion is large enough for your sugar high whole week. 
Last but not least : egg pods toilet from the future!!! Interesting art pieces and have fun taking pictures with them folks!!!!",1
5,"Definitely pricey, but you're paying more for the experience. You feel like Alice in wonderland from the moment you're sat. My favorite part was the Caviar Man (but be wary he costs extra if you ask him to come back). The tea was excellent the sandwiches/pastries were pretty good, surprisingly filling. I would definitely come back for afternoon tea when I feel like splurging.",1
2,"Super pretty decor in the pink room with lots of random illustrations, suitable for a girls night out. 
A venue that is definitely more style than substance though...food is pricy and not particularity good...tasty cocktails in the cosy bar at the back. Make sure you book a space in advance",-1
3,"Instagram got drew me here and I like it a bit. 
The first bar, I don't recall the name, had an awesome DJ from New York play. The bartenders made some great drinks that made me come back for more! I will totally return for the music and drinks. 
Avoid Gallery at all costs. 
It's cute and feels fun, it ends there. Food was terrible and service was rushed. We arrived famished and left hungry, no bueno. Real rip-off",-1
1,"Bad food. Bad service. Only go if you're interested in paying £60+ to take bathroom selfies.
Literally we had to keep reminding them to bring our tea and food.
Also why do they think it's okay to add a £1 donation to their charity of choice without warning? Nothing against donating to charity but that's seemed off.",-1
5,"I spent part of my Easter celebration here as I was about to kick off my European tour. The place was quite easy to find, especially once you found yourself in the high end retail shopping area. 
I walked in charmed by the atmosphere, and my door was opened by one of the employees. To my left, I saw the Alice in Wonderland room and to my right, I found the pink room where I would be having afternoon tea. 
I was underdressed. I'll admit I just landed in Heathrow hours before, and so appearing in jeans and a decent blouse they thought I was a tourist just wondering in. They asked me if I was lost. I was baffled, but found it quite funny. As soon as I relayed that I had a reservation, they brought me to my table of 1. In the background, I heard a duet of violinists playing covers of popular songs. It was beautiful. The food and presentation was also fabulous! You had endless refills of everything except the champagne. Sad, eh?
If you are coming to London once and have an extra dime (definitely just a saying in this context), stop at Sketch. Its an absolute trip!!!!! I do not regret going here and having afternoon tea for the first time!",1
5,"I'm a little bit in love with this place. It combines so many things I like, ambiance, cocktails, art, vintage feel, and cake, ooft.
It's quirky, like going to drink in an art gallery, which is unsurprisingly what one of the dining rooms is called, and you can tell that Turner prize winners have had a touch on this. 
Pink velvet chairs, that reminded me of packs of sausages, and so comfortable, it feels kind of like an old fashioned ice cream parlour, the walls lined with artwork. Every room in this place is dramatic. You can sit in the pink sausage chairs feeling all jazz age and have cocktails brought to you by charming waiters and waitresses (there's a cocktail bar tucked below the loos, but the egg shaped loo pods filled with trilling birds is a whole other story).
The forest room is beautiful too, and the cocktails are rather lovely. 
I plan to come back both for afternoon tea and for dinner, so many recommendations!",1
5,"My husband and I were told that we HAD to come here and we were not disappointed. The staff was very inviting, the food was delicious and generous, and the tea was some of the best that I've ever had. Don't skip the restroom (especially after drinking all of that tea), or you'll be missing out.",1
4,I still dream about the tea from Sketch.  The ambiance is absolutely to die for and the tea is unforgettable.  The sandwiches are hit or miss with some of them being the most amazing sammies you've ever had and others being a bit strange.  Service was excellent and I would definitely go again.,1
4,"We came to sketch both at night time and for afternoon tea.  There are quite a few rooms, so I recommend walking around to check them all out.  They are each different and unique.  
We had high tea in the pink room, and it seems a modern twist on an old tradition.  The tea was good and the sandwiches were tasty.  The scone was buttery and pastries were fantastic.
When we looked around, we noticed all the asians were sitting in our area, so that was a bit funny.  The staff was a bit snobbish, but hey, drink tea with pinkies up, I guess.    
We had drinks in the forest room on another evening and also checked out the gallery at night time.  The drinks are quite delicious. 
Oh.. you must check out the toilets.  Amazing egg pod futuristic things...",1
4,"I came here with 3 friends while traveling around London and this was an amazing experience. Granted this was my first real afternoon tea, it was a great one. As I was browsing Instagram a few days later I noticed that a ton of bloggers/YouTubers were coming to Sketch as the notable pink chairs and one-of-a-kind bathrooms were hard to miss. 
The food was pretty great and unlimited refills was quite great. Just let your server know which ones you like and you can get seconds/thirds of those! There is a huge variety of tea and that was quite nice to choose from. I do wish the pots were a bit smaller so I could have tried a few more - and I'm a bit sad I didn't think to buy some before I left. 
The decoration here is a lot of what you pay for. From the artwork hanging all over the walls to the ambiance of the lighting and the tiny details down to the furniture and dishes, this is definitely a place to experience. Be sure to check out the bathroom pods - it's very cool!",1
2,"4 + stars on reviews, critically acclaimed....are they critically kidding? Veal was thick, breadcrumbs on it bland. My friend's fish and chips had the cheapest type of French fry, not even fresh cut. The peas that came with it and bread were nothing to write home about either. This place is like an Instagram picture: it looks amazing, but when you see it in person you say to yourself, ""That's it?"" Not to mention, the table to my right said ""The Olive Garden is way better"" and the table to my left told the waitress the place is nothing but a show, and she can tell the chef that, and bring him out so they can say it to his face. He never came out, and all they did was take off her entree and free dessert!! Laughable! The only redeemable quality about this place is the decor and cocktails. Next.",-1
5,"This place was beyond my expectations. It was such a wonderful experience! I would recommend this place to anyone who visits London. From the service to the decor to the food.. 100% on point. We came for afternoon tea around 430 pm and the menu is 45 pounds a person ( exclusion champagne) with unlimited fancy sandwiches, pastries and any tea of your choice. We ended up upgrading to the one that includes a glass of champagne which I can't remember how much it was but about 57 pounds. It's worth every ""pound."" All the pastieries, scones and sandwiches were amazing but by far my favorite was the grilled cheese. Yummm!!!! On the other hand the bathrooms were unbelievable. It was two stair cases going up on each side of a round room
With a cocktails bar inside. The toilets upstairs looked like cocoon shaped spaceships . It was so unique! This place is definitely worth the hype. I will come back again if I am back in London.",1
4,"If you are looking for an Alice in wonderland experience with with fine French fusion dining, look no further than sketch. This concept gallery restaurant. The afternoon tea has been the best experience I have had with this venue. Their home made marshmallows, sweet petit fleur pastries and complimentary drinks makes it the perfect place to enjoy a London themed place to sit down and relax.
As for dinner their wine selection is impressive. I much adored my glass of port the whole night. The rosé champagne was outstanding too. The overall dining experience was amazing. My udon noodles and chocolate caramel dessert was very ones my expectations. I could taste, that the ingredients were amazing quality. Worth all the hype and the reservation waiting.",1
5,"I went here back in 2013 so quite a while ago but still dying to go back! I know the decor has changed in the main restaurant and the afternoon tea menu has slightly changed - alternatives on the cakes that I was served. It was just so tasty! I was so impressed. Definitely the best afternoon tea I've had in London! Savouries were all delicious (normally a let down), with lots of different variants - mini croque Monsieur, egg mayo with quails egg and caviar. Then scones good with good selection of jam. The macaroons were delish along with the pastries. Also homemade marshmallows and a little panacotta type dessert!
I can't recommend the afternoon tea enough! Not been for any other food/ drinks",1
4,"I've been desperate to go to Sketch for ages. Not only do they apparently do one of the best gluten-free afternoon teas in London, it's also the gallery of David Shrigley - one of my favourite artists.
I wouldn't be surprised if this is the most instagrammed room in London - it was absolutely beautiful.
There was so much attention to detail - everything from the menus, to the crockery - even the uniforms for the waitstaff (which I would wear in a heartbeat).
As for cost, it's a little on the steep side, but for the location, and the wow factor of the venue alone - combined with the sheer amount of food, I do believe it's worth it. Not something I'd do every day, but definitely worth popping in for a special occasion.
You get a lot of food - unlimited refills of tea, sandwiches, cakes and scones, the latter being the best part of the gluten free menu.
Even the bathrooms were outstanding (to the point where I was slightly concerned that they were toilets at all, instead of part of the artwork).
We didn't manage to finish our tea completely, but the lovely waitstaff packed the last of our cakes for us, which we got to enjoy later that weekend.",1
4,"I came here because of the immense amount of instagram posts I've seen regarding their tea time and it definitely didn't disappoint! We opted for the tea service, which included an unlimited supply of tea ( there are many different flavors) and little sandwiches. It finished off with an array of dessert.
The decor/bathroom is what makes the restaurant interesting and very modern. Service was great and we got treated to a choir singing Christmas songs.
The downside of this restaurant is the price. Perhaps because of the holiday, the menu was pricier, but we ended up paying $100 per person ( this didn't include any alcohol). A bit much for tea time but to enjoy it once is a must.",1
4,"Sketch:
With unsurpassed visual aesthetics amidst an eccentric, unconventional atmosphere, I knew I wanted to dine at this outlandish Michelin-awarded venue during my recent trip to London. We dined for afternoon tea in the Gallery in September 2015.
I originally intended to have dinner at the Gahban O'Keeffee-designed, two-Michelin-Star rated Lecture Room & Library, menu devised by the renowned Chef Pierre Gagnaire, yet an evening reservation with Dinner by Heston Blumenthal overruled. Nevertheless, I am ecstatic with my decision to have afternoon tea in the ethereal Gallery.
The pastel-pink color scheme and eclectic wall art made for great conversation. The prix-fixe afternoon tea menu featured a nice selection of tea choices, along with assorted finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries. This is an ideal venue to relax and catch up with friends over the course of an afternoon. See below for a more complete review.
Reservations:
Having originally held a booking for dinner in the Lecture Room and Library, we decided an afternoon affair would better suit our schedule; I made a booking for late afternoon tea. 
Décor:
Sketch is located on the lovely Conduit Street. Upon noticing the oversized menu and illuminated red Sketch sign, we made our way inside and walked on a hopscotch board outlined on the floor-- I knew the afternoon would be filled with fun and good food. The soigné hostesses greeted us with exceedingly pleasant vibes and lead us to the Gallery.
Our eyes immediately met the vibrant pastel pink walls and couches. The walls are also covered in art by David Shrigley-- examining each would take quite a while, but I encourage you to look closely and carefully-- some are more interesting and risqué than others. This overall nouveau style created a chic setting for an enjoyable afternoon.
Tea Selections:
There are opportunities to order and sample a variety of teas. As with most afternoon teas, selections include green, black, white, oolong, herbal, and puerh. The teapots and cups feature intriguing thoughts and words.
Finger Sandwiches, Scones, and Pastries:
Some of my favorites include the cucumber and ricotta sandwich, sultana scone with traditional clotted cream or strawberry and fig jam, and chocolate mint cake. By the end of the afternoon, you'll hardly be able to finish the selections, even though the staff will continually bring more of whichever item you desire.
Service:
The staff was pleasant, yet in typical British fashion, maintain an overall hands-off approach, which allowed us to enjoy the afternoon with minimal interruptions.
Summary:
We had a fantastic time enjoying Afternoon Tea at Sketch. From the splendid, unique décor to the delicious selection of finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, Sketch provides an enjoyable afternoon outing. While most likely no longer a secret, you must visit the bathroom or, as they referred to in the UK, the toilet or water closet-- the egg-shaped pods and psychedelic rainbow roof elevate the overall Sketch experience. 
My Recommendation:
Go. While Afternoon Tea at Claridge's is still the ultimate afternoon tea experience in my opinion (see my review on Claridge's London), Sketch offers a great selection of afternoon treats and teas amidst an intriguing atmosphere. I will certainly return for tea in the Gallery; I also hope to return for dinner in the Lecture Room & Library. 4 Stars
Michelin Stars: Two (2015)",1
4,"Sketch is a collection of fancy toilets conveniently located nearby a restaurant.
For anyone who is not familiar with sarcasm, it's a restaurant with fancy toilets.
Sketch is definitely an experience.  We arrived for...brunch?  I believe it was too late for breakfast so it must have been brunch.  Might have been breakfast.  Gonna just keep talking to myself.
We were seated in an area which was decorated in a very...hipster way.  That's the best way I can describe the design aesthetic that brings us such brilliance as ""Hey, let's put a goat head on a guy in a suit"".  Lighting seemed a bit dim.
My wife and I ordered what was essentially a take on the traditional cooked breakfast (I can't remember what they called it, something fancy).  The food itself was all very good, especially the black pudding and sausage.  The desserts were also quite good.
Speaking of desserts, I am compelled (externally) to mention the eclair my wife got. It was just a simple eclair with a vanilla custard filling. I thought it was good. She was obsessing over it for the remainder of our trip, pining for it like a drug addict.
It's difficult for me to judge the prices and portion sizes since I'm not a local.  Being from the States, I'm used to massive portion sizes and have a general feel for what a meal should cost.
But yes, if you come here you should really check out the toilets.  I've never seen such fancy toilets in my life.  Do people really need that much luxury to poop?
(Just adding this down here to the last word in my review won't be ""poop"", but something else)",1
3,"I had very high expectations for afternoon tea here after reading all the Yelp reviews and doing some research online. My expectations were met in terms of food and ambiance, but the inattentive service was enough to ruin the whole experience. 
We were seated immediately at our reservation time and promptly instructed on how the afternoon tea would go. The menu looked delicious and there was an abundance of teas to choose from.
The bad experience started when a food runner brought over our food on a tray and placed it next to our table for our waiter to then place on our table and explain what each item was. Except, the waiter never came...not for at least 15 minutes. Our food was just sitting less than an arms distance away from us unable to be touched. 
The waiter finally came and instructed us to eat the warm cheese sandwich first, but of course the sandwich was no longer warm. Other than that, the sandwiches, pastries, and scones were all soooo good. I only wish I had a bigger stomach to eat more of them.
Had our service been better I would have given this place five stars. The place is freaking gorgeous and the food is beautiful and delicious as well. Of course, you can't forget about the crazy bathrooms. That was an experience in itself.",-1
4,"Came for Christmas high tea with friends, and was so much fun. My first experience with British afternoon tea, so I wasn't sure what exactly to expect. The room was very pink, feminine, and had a mid-century feel, but lovely nonetheless. Christmas time meant there was a group of carolers for entertainment, which was very nice. My favorite tea was the Christmas chai, spicy and sweet. Their hot chocolate is also incredibly rich and delicious. The best part was of course the tower of sweets and snacks. I particularly loved the brie and black truffle and smoked salmon sandwiches, and all the little pastries towards the top. Its a set price for unlimited food/drinks, so its great to just sit, relax, and eat/drink as much as you fancy. Seems like a tourist hot spot given its prominence on Instagram (especially pictures of the rather psychedelic egg-shaped restroom pods), but we all had a great time.",1
4,you pay for the visual stimulation / atmosphere and you are rewarded with one of the most aesthetically interesting bathrooms in London.,1
5,"Super cool place. The tea was great and so were all the pastries. For the price, I wouldn't recommend doing he champagne tea because it was just one glass. The staff was really friendly and helpful, and I'd definitely go again.",1
3,"Sketch is in the heart of Mayfair (close to Soho). The interior is whimsical and feels like a chapter out of Alice in Wonderland. For interior design, I give it five stars. 
But, let's talk food. It was just ok and the tea wasn't anything spectacular. They don't keep the tea leaves in the teapot, so you can't make the tea more or less strong. I don't like that. 
The egg salad sandwich was delicious. However, the salmon sandwich was lacking. It was a tiny square with little salmon.",-1
5,"If you want to go to somewhere unique and unusual, this is the spot! I only saw 3 of the 5 rooms, but each room had so much character & it was visually pleasing. 
I came here for some late night drinks & we were directed to the East Bar. If you're looking for an intimate area, this is the perfect spot. The circular room is small with the bar in the middle & seats around. The drinks are as unique as the room itself. 
The Glade was closed for a private party, but I saw The Gallery & it looked like a great spot for a girls day/night. The Parlour was a 180 degree version of The Gallery with skulls & lounge chairs. The most interesting ""room"" was the restroom. The vibrant restroom had pods that looked like Eve from the movie ""Wall-E."" A restroom break is necessary here to check it out. There were no men in the men's side so my husband showed me the urinal. It will make you feel fancy as odd as that sounds...   
I LOVED exploring this place & its a place you won't forget!! You're guaranteed to find a room fit to your taste.",1
4,"Completely forgot to yelp about this place! Loved the playful and kid like environment with the hop scotch at the entrance. Definitely Alice in wonderland inspired, which I love! I ordered the chamomile tea and shared one of the platters for tea with desserts and finger sandwiches. I loved everything I ate it's just a bit pricey. Personally I liked the tea better from the Orangery and better price wise as well but I'd recommend either one as a great experience that shouldn't be missed if you are visiting London for the first time.",1
5,"Great cocktail lounge! Ambience, people, location. Food could be better but the crowd is great.",1
1,"The prettiest dump I've ever been to.. The dinner food is absolutely disgusting and expensive. Small portions and bland. I ordered the rack of lambs and received very thinly sliced sandwich meat in Brown gravy with sauteed mushrooms. Never heard of a rack of lamb being served in a bowl. My date ordered the cod, which was simply salty fish. 
They overcharge for water too and serve it likes it's wine, how pretentious. Furthermore, oh the hidden charges! They include some type of surprise tax, in addition they include an automatic donation to some charity of theirs, oh and of course tack on their own gratuity on top of their already over-inflated prices! They really take advantage because like me, most visiting customers are too proud or shy to speak up, and quietly accept the audacity of their greed.
I suppose the tea time experience is why the reviews are high, I'm not sure. But after that dinner experience, I urge you to take your money somewhere else where you can actually get a bang for your buck instead of wasting it on this posh and overly polished giant turd.",-1
5,"Two words = ""attention (to) detail""
Brilliant menu, service, and cocktails. One of my favorite dining experiences.",1
5,"{Afternoon Tea Review} 
Mom: ""Why is there a cat without a part of it's head outside?""
Me: ""I think it's on purpose."" (failing to notice that it's missing the tail or another body part.. sticking out either) 
Mom: ""I don't like this place.""
~ Little did she know.. that she, along with the rest of my family would end up loving this place.
I was looking at a list of the most instagrammed places in London, and at the top of the list was this gorgeous and fully pink room with a rainbow bathroom. I knew I had to go here. 
Sketch is one of those restaurants that you CANNOT miss out on. It's definitely not the cheapest place to go. But it is so quirky and unique you have to go see for yourself. It's a mini art museum with high class food combined together. You seriously just have to wonder what state of mind the artists were in when they created their works. They are so random.
{DECOR}
- The Gallery is the main room for afternoon tea - it's pink. and I mean REALLY PINK. It has chairs that look like they've had eclairs glued onto them and the lovely rainbow bathroom with egg booths. 
- The walls are lined with 200+ ""sketches"" which you'll have a fun time looking at.
{BOOKING} 
- Reservations can be made up to 2 months in advance.
- They do take your CC in case you don't show up (there is a fine)  
{SERVICE}
- The service here is THE BEST. Every time I went to pee (which when you're drinking tea non stop for an hour is a lot) they folded up my napkin and helped me out of my chair. 
- They clear out the table every time they put new food on the table, and they are so so so attentive! You've just got to look over and they will come on right over. 
- They are so incredibly kind. I commented that the bag to take away food was super cute and the manager offered to give me one as well! 
- The envelope to get the bill is made out of SANDPAPER. And while my family was oozing over it the manager laughingly also told us we could keep it.  
{AFTERNOON TEA}
- At £38/person (59USD), we're on the high end here. If you want champagne it's about £10 extra. But this is 100% worth the price. The service, atmosphere and food just blows my mind. 
- FREE REFILLS! - Oh yes, eat as many of those little strawberry tarts and drink as much tea as you want. 
- You can take all your leftover food home! 
- 2 hour maximum time.
- All of the food was so delicious. I was stuffed by the time we left. 
{RECOMMENDED TEAS}
- Jasmine Pearls
- Earl Grey Supreme: Can you ever go wrong with this?
- Ceylon & Rose
- Vanilla Tea",1
5,I went here with my friend for the tea. I loved this place it had to be the most unique restaurant I've ever been to. The sandwiches are unlimited and if you don't like one they will switch it out for a different one. The tea is also unlimited. The decor is just amazing down to the tea pots and cups. The bathroom was actually my favorite part of the whole restaurant it was really interesting. You get a lot of food you will be stuffed by the time you leave there.,1
4,"Went for cream tea with a friend, and it was solid. 
For only £10.50, you can get unlimited tea and scones. The tea selection isn't vast but still good -- for one, I got white tea, and it was unique and refreshing. The scones were good as well. If you go for champagne & tea set, you would get sandwiches, etc as well! 
Service was so-so. It started out very good, but then, they took forever to bring us water. It wasn't even busy either, so go figure why that was. Overall, I felt like the staff could have been warmer and friendlier.
Finally, great posh but also hipster ambience. Would be good for any event!",1
1,"A group of seven of us are travelling from Canada and stopping over in London for 24 hours. We wanted to visit sketch because we have been long-time Instagram fans and were super excited to partake in their afternoon tea. Since the reservation maximum was 6 people, we booked separately: one group of three, one group of four. I emailed sketch reservations with our reservation information to see if it was possible for us to be seated together. The Reservations Agent replied and provided the following response:
 ""In regards to your enquiry, the maximum table size we accommodate for reservations would be for 6 guests, so unfortunately we are unable to accept any larger groups. As we do not honor multiple table reservations for one party and do not accommodate reservations for more than 6 guests, I have cancelled one of the reservations under your name leaving one booking.""
We were left with one reservation for three people. The Agent did not ask whether I wanted to keep my booking, instead he cancelled it automatically. Very poor customer service. The proper way to handle this would have been to let me know we would not be able to be seated together, and then ask if I wanted to keep my reservation. So frustrating and unimpressive.",-1
5,Amazing afternoon tea with drinks ...the staff are nice  and of course toilet is very interesting.,1
5,"The best place for a fun afternoon tea experience that doesn't feel stuffy!
Food: 5/5
We were presented with an assortment of sandwiches, pastries, desserts and scones. Every item tasted fresh and delicious. My favorite were the scones, these were the best I had ever tasted and I still dream and crave them. The small scone size allows for that perfect ratio of crunchy exterior with fluffy inside, paired with the clotted cream and strawberry jam, it was like heaven melting in my mouth. It isn't just for people who love sweets, my husband found the quail egg sandwich to be savory and divine. It was so tasty, he had 6 of them! 
You can also have a champagne pairing, and their sommelier is amazing. She offered excellent pairings and even allowed my husband to taste a variety of champagnes so he could choose one he liked. 
          
Service: 5/5
The staff is extremely attentive. 5 class service. 
Atmosphere: 5/5
The Gallery is indeed very pink, and the drawings on the walls are a bit trippy. It adds to this weird ""Alice in Wonderland"" feel. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and fun. The toilets look like space pods. 
Value: 4/5
At 38 GBP per person, it is on the expensive end. However, most afternoon teas are around 20 GBP and do not include any refills. At Sketch, you can get refills of anything you want as often as you like. When travelling with a hungry man, this was the best decision.",1
5,"We went for a romantic pre-valentines meal here last year - it's pretty pricy but a fantastic place for a special occasion. The food was elegant and cooked to perfection - and although they might look like small portions actually the intensity of the flavours and combinations of ""not the norm"" ingredients leave you more than satisfied.  
Beautifully and artistically designed with different themes in the different rooms and the service was top-notch too, attentive and friendly.",1
1,"Though I never had a full meal here, I usually go for a cocktail or a cup of tea. I have always found the place to be amazing and the service impeccable. That is, until the last time. I went to the restaurant on Feb 17, we got seated immediately, and the drink and the waitress were lovely. When we were presented with our bill, my friend immediately put in the card without looking at the bill. After all, we only had two drinks, what can be wrong. After she paid, I noticed that the restaurant charged us an extra £1 for a charity that nobody told us about or even told us that it would be automatically added to the bill. Don't get me wrong, £1 is not a lot of money, but I would like to be told if a restaurant wants to charge me for something that I did not in fact consent to. When I mentioned that to the waitress, she rudely sniped at me saying that I should have checked the bill before paying it. I find it to be mind-blowing that restaurants can just do that, which in my mind constitutes as stealing. Charity is a voluntarily thing, regardless of the amount of a donation, and not something to be forced on upon customers. 
I love the place, it's interior is stunning, drinks are great. But service and the restaurant policy is sometimes just shocking.",-1
4,"Wild tea shop with some really cool furniture and fancy dishes with a very art chic vibe. Like a modern artists hang out spot. 
Staff seemed a bit put off but I'm sure they get a lot of weird customers so we didn't hold it against them. 
Vegan menu was awesome and the coffee and juice was phenomenal. 
Very sweet spot.",1
1,"I am sorely disappointed. Ambience was quaint, more than liked the presentation, was more than willing to pay the prices on the menu, but to say the food was lackluster is a severe understatement. Came here hungry enough. Ordered the fish and chips and beef and foie gras burger. Every item was so tasteless that even though hungry, combined with the texture, we just couldn't stomach the food and preferred to leave hungry. Can't comment on the cakes as we cancelled our order and just wanted to leave and grab some real food. As my BF said, ""I feel cheated."" 
Kitchen needs a radical change. Until then, skip this place and just head to Pret A Manger, better use of your time and money.
Note: they add a donation onto your check without your consent. It's for a good cause, but their policy is to not ask (I asked them) and to just append it to the bill amongst your food items which is a little strange in my personal experience.",-1
4,"More of a hip high tea in London than say the Ritz, less formal but wonderful presentation and feel nonetheless. The tea is excellent, so is the food, overall definite try for visitors",1
5,Highly recommended for their afternoon tea where everything is refillable and order as many teas as you want with the two hours seating limit. The atmosphere is very pinky surrounded by sketch arts. It can get a bit noisy but what do you expext when you get a roomful of people indulging on finger sandwiches and delicious pastries.  Make sure to make reservation on the weekends.,1
5,Great service and ambiance. Wish I remembered the gentleman who helped us. He was great! The gnocchi was amazing. Will be back when I'm back in the U.K.,1
5,"Last time visited the Glade and just did The Gallery for afternoon tea. I still love this place. 
Afternoon tea quality was aces. The sandwiches were good, pastries were delic, and the scones were warm/fluffy/scrumptious goodness. The scones were even better with the housemade fig jam. You can ask for more whatever you like and it's within the £29 fixed price for afternoon tea (sans alcohol). Service was a tad slow, but they were nice and it wasn't terribly slow, so it was okay. 
Love this place!!",1
5,"One of my favourite places in London. Great food, ambience, service and overall environment.",1
5,"I thought the food in London SUCKED??? It must be old news pre-Jamie Oliver. I didn't have one bad meal the whole week I was here, except for the fish and chips tourist trap outside of the Tower of London. As for this place, it was absolute amazeballs with a healthy serving of awesomesauce. Am I dating myself already? Doesn't matter. This place must be placed on your checklist of British culinary adventures. Bravo, chef, bravo.",1
5,"Don't miss this place. The BEST scones we had in London, the KINDEST servers, and the COOLEST interior decorating. And don't miss the pod bathrooms, of course!",1

5,"I love this place.  Weird hipster vibe in one room and total different experience in another.  The egg shaped bathroom stalls are a nice touch.  As for the food, $$$$, but I loved it. It actually IMO worth it if you are into food.  Not American size portions I'm use to but it is enough to be satisfied.",1
3,"If you haven't been to Sketch then it is worth a visit, just for the decoration and the supercool cyber design restroom.
They required each person to order a tea set, so we end up ordering 5 afternoon tea set, which is ""A LOT"" and we could barely finish half of it.  The tea set has no surprise at all, nothing particularly delicious. There is only one thing I like, which is the sparkling grape juice.",-1
5,"The afternoon tea of afternoon teas. I've had my fair share of finger sandwiches, buttery scones, and delicious teas but none compare to the experience I had at sketch. I made a reservation the day-of on a Wednesday, and it was a very easy process online. The only risky part of making a reservation is that if you don't go, you'll be charged the full amount of the tea service per person included in the party. I can understand this, since the turnover time for afternoon tea can be pretty slow. 
The hype over the interior is not un-founded. Coming here is like walking onto the set of a Wes Anderson movie, and the fact that there are no windows really gives the effect that you've stepped down the rabbit hole into another world. There are differently decorated rooms (and a very interesting bathroom!), which will make for cute Instagram photos if that's what you've come here for. But me, I came here for the tea.
Overall, the food was REALLY close to perfect. Everything was so tasty and fresh, and you can really tell that everything was made to order. I believe the price was 30 or 35 pounds per person, or somewhere around that range. It is completely worth it. You may order as many desserts, or sandwiches as your afternoon tea-loving heart wishes, and the waitresses do it speedily with a smile. You can also choose from a wide selection of delicious teas, which I expect nothing less from any place that serves afternoon tea, but nonetheless, the ones our party ordered did not disappoint. 
If you're coming to London, be sure to stop by, if just for looking around. I compare all the afternoon tea places I have experienced to my time at sketch, and I'm sorry to say it, but they all fall short.",1
4,"Doing afternoon tea is a must in London, so I decided to check out Sketch with a few of my friends, especially after seeing it all over social media, & not to mention pretty decent reviews. 
This place is definitely on the pricey side for afternoon tea, but it's worth because of the unlimited tea and bites for two hours. I personally cannot eat a huge amount in one sitting so I don't know if I would pay extra for all you can eat again, but it is good value for money in general. You can also add champagne to the deal for an extra 10 gbp. Definitely suggest to make reservations online a few days before to secure a spot. 
The ambiance is to DIE for. There are a couple different rooms available for seating but we were placed in the big pink room which basically made all my little girl dreams come true.  That, along with the cute tea sets and the awesomely designed restroom pods all came together to create a really awesome experience. I am giving four stars because the selection of savory bites were a bit off for me and my friends which disrupted the experience a bit, but the delicious desserts made up for it. 
If you're looking for a classic and traditional afternoon tea experience, I wouldn't recommend sketch- but if you're looking for a hip, trendy place to hang then this is definitely the place.",1
5,"The food was phenomenal and the tea was perfect (though I'm a novice when it comes to tea).
First off, I walked in without a reservation around 3pm on Sunday and it was a 40min wait. I had also tried the Saturday evening and they weren't taking walk ins. I highly recommend calling to make reservations. You must also wait in the building but it was fine b/c there's a cocktail room you can sit and enjoy the decor while you wait.
Once seated, I opted to order off the menu vs the pre-fixed afternoon tea (£45 pp). I was so happy with the food - duck leg and beef roast - it was absolutely incredible. The tea was great as well - I ordered the jasmine. And, finished with chocolate and coffee cake.
The entire place is charming and visually intriguing. You must see the pink room and use the bathroom. The staff was really friendly, BTW.
I was dressed pretty casually with jeans and heals. I was comfortable though a lot of other patrons wore dresses. I'd wear whatever you'd feel comfortable in but dresses and hats wouldn't be out of the norm for tea.
Overall, I highly recommend this place; food, service, and general interior design.",1
4,"Trendy and restaurant, food was pretty tasty as well. Interesting unique decor, reminded me of Alice in wonderland. Very fun to wander around the space. Would come back again with friends to explore the other rooms.",1
5,"This review applies to the Lecture room & library restaurant at Sketch.
You know that you are in for something special as soon as you arrive at Sketch: you walk up a flight of stairs and enter the tastefully appointed and luxuriously decorated dining room through the double doors. 
Dining in the Lecture room means you embark on a fascinating culinary journey with creative and original kitchen, innovative and refreshing cuisine that always surprises yet never feels artificial. Gagnaire and his team master the fine art of precisely painting complementary flavors and textures into brilliant culinary masterpieces. Furthermore, the dishes are extremely well presented with great eye for detail.
Pair this with an exceptional and impeccable service and you have a winning combination for an extraordinary dining experience. You instantly feel welcomed by the team that visibly enjoy what they are doing and take great pride in offering an exceptional experience.
I highly recommend the tasting menu with the wine pairings.  It is to die for.
Of all the London (Michelin star) restaurants, this is without a doubt my absolute favorite. Having moved from London to New York, this is probably one of the place we miss the most. We are still looking for a place to fill the void!",1
5,"Always a fantastic experience for many occasions. With their breakfast rooms, tea rooms, and bar all featuring luxurious decor, this isn't a place to miss.",1
1,"We were having a lovely vacation and using Yelp daily to find great places to eat, sometimes at odd hours (jetlag, post-theater, etc.). Even though this spot's kitchen was still technically open (within its stated hours of operation) and the pink room had over half of its tables empty, we were refused service for really no reason. Polite as they were, there was really no reason to turn away two obvious tourists looking for a late bite at their establishment. We even asked for nearby recommendations and the ladies looked like deer in headlights and were largely unable to converse with us in a meaningful way. I was sad to see that a place with such acclaimed interior design and great reviews would be such a disappointment.",-1
3,"the place itself is worth the visit. yes there is an artistic edge, yes there are pods in the restroom but the food nothing spectacular. friendly and helpful staff. everything was on point but the food. we had a bit of everything and nothing was out of this world, very basic palette. to be honest I had a better foodie experience at the borough market. all hype, all social media hype.",-1
5,"This place was recommended to my friend and I for our vacation, and I have to say it did not disappoint. While it was rather expensive the entire experience was great from stepping in to using the restroom in the cool egg-shaped stalls. As for food, our favorite was the fish-sticks and the Limenello drink. I will no doubt be back next time I am in London.",1
5,This place was such a treat.  The whole room is pink and very nice and the waiters are very very attentive and polite.  But the bathroom is the best part never used the bathroom in an egg she'll lol.  We even had love music while we ate that was such a treat!,1
5,"Sketch is one of the best and most unique dining experiences I have ever had. I recommend it to everyone who is in London. 
The entire place was like a high class restaurant with Alice in Wonderland vibes on drugs. SO COOL.
The decor is unreal. You must check out the bathrooms- they are all white with big space ship like pods and a technicolor rainbow ceiling.",1
5,"Wow just too much to say. The food was amazing the service was awesome and the wine was great.  Love this place.  The 400.00 bill was a bit much, but we don't eat like this often.  
Highlights - Sea bass and scallop",1
3,"We had breakfast here and while the ambiance is  cool (even tho we weren't able to have it in the pink room, which I heard was amazing), the food wasn't great. Well, my porridge with coconut and bananas was so good but I should have never ordered a side of eggs, which came so incredibly salty we couldn't eat them, and for which I paid $12 pounds for. When I told the waiter, rather nicely to please tell the chef about the eggs, she just walked away. 
Also I agree with the reviews below, the whole charity on your bill without asking isn't cool. It's only $1.50, but they should just give you a heads up about it.",-1
4,"Although it's been around for a decade, Sketch has managed to retain its playful sense of kitsch among the departing and arriving competitors in surrounding streets. The two highlights of this place are probably afternoon tea in the upstairs parlour and the lavatory experience (I won't spoil the surprise). The meals are okay, but nothing to cross town for and the service is pretty, but hit and miss. It's definitely not an oil painting, brimming with attention to detail. However, it's a pretty fun sketch that you might wish to share with a friend or potential date.",1
3,"I came here once with my mother, I got the beef tartare, which was small but good. Service was attentive and the toilets are sick but I don't think the price is justified, the food being good but not amazing and overall lacking that ""wow"" effect. The interiors are beautiful though and I think a trip here is worth it just for that",-1
5,"Quick Review:  Beyond beautiful displays of amazing food, Sketch is a culinary journey that I highly recommend you try.  Its as if you are eating in a Tim Burton film but its definitely not creepy.  A bit pricey but its a once in a lifetime place you should try.  
FOOD (I recommend getting a few plates to share, sorry for no prices...I didn't see any on the menu online)
Pan-Fried Escargots (also came with baby squid, chorizo and caviar):  Escargot is not a fav of most people but you wont even be able to tell.  They come deshelled and were delicious
Chantilly Lace (w/ black rice, basmati rice and lobster bisque): They pour the lobster bisque over the rice and its an experience to see
Steamed Cod demi-sel (w/ mussels and grilled baby leeks): Fantastic especially if you like seafood
Dessert: Sketch Chocolate - soooo yummy, it was not too sweet, definitely should like chocolate though
SERVICE:
Everyone was very attentive, even if they were not our particular server, they still came by to check in with us.  They don't waste any time when it comes to taking your order though, we had to ask a few times for more time to decide.  This is definitely not a bad problem to have though.  
AMBIANCE 
Each room has their own decor and vibe.  Outside of the food, the restaurant itself is beautiful and quirky at the same time.  Definitely view the other rooms, especially the bathroom.",1
4,"Everything about the atmosphere here is quirky and unique. The washroom is filled with egg shaped pods and they play the sounds of geese at you while you do your thing. The walls in the pink room were all plush and, well, pink. The art on the walls was to die for - so funny and made for great conversation starters.
The food was very good, but perhaps not worth the steep price tag. There are endless refills on everything, but the refills come slowly. After I had ordered one extra plate of sandwiches and dessert, the waitress started to ignore me, so the refills weren't as endless as I would have liked them to be.",1
5,"This place is one of my favourites.
I'm a big big art person and I particularly love David Shrigley, so the beautiful pink room is a great mix of things I love: David's sketches and this weird Wes Anderson feel.
The food is yum - I wouldn't say Michelin star level quite yet - but it has a good mixture of quality and innovation. I particularly enjoy the fish when I'm there.
Also, great wine list, which always helps.
I really really want to try the afternoon tea.
If nothing else, go there for the instagrammable bathroom, I mean that's why people go out for dinner these days isn't it?",1
5,"Such a beautiful space and quirky, interesting art. A must-do if it is in your budget for afternoon tea! The eccentricity of Sketch is awesome from the caviar man serving you a spoon from a 500g container of caviar to the egg-shaped restrooms. Absolutely an Instagram-worthy setting with delicious food. My partner and I were too full to even bother to ask for more (which you are fully allowed to) whenever prompted. Their desserts and scones are the best part!
You should absolutely make a reservation, as I saw a couple people being turned away at the door.",1
5,"I wanted the authentic afternoon tea experience in London and this place was pretty much spot on.  All the decor when we walked in oozed character, not to mention the hostess that was pretty much speaking the proper queen's english. 
Once we walked into the dining room it's a completely different vibe.  Really abstract sketches were on every wall, and made for great reading if your eyes decided to wander during tea.  Tea service was everything I expected.  You get little finger sandwiches with smoked salmon and caviar and little dessert things.  Everything was top shelf.  Then you get your fancy tea with scones and jam.  On top of the food and tea being great the service was top notch.  You could tell that they were professionals.  Our waitress was on top of everything without being overbearing at all.  
I couldn't review this place without mentioning the bathroom.  You pretty much need to check it out even if you don't have to go.  Imagine a staircase that leads up to a white room where like 5 giant eggs sit.  These eggs have doors so you can step inside where the toilet is.  On top of that, there are speakers inside the eggs that play ducks quacking at you.  It's crazy.  
Overall, sketch might be a little pricey but the food service and ambiance are more than worth the price of admission.",1
3,"Maybe Sketch is for you but it's not for me. To give you an idea if you might like Sketch, here are some of its most important characteristics: 
- The dining room is all pink! Everything is pink except for the art on the wall which is black and white
- The bathroom is so weird, it gave me nightmares. It's an array of egg-shaped toilet pods that evokes the movie Aliens, except the monster hatching inside is your poo. Inside the egg pod, there are loud rainforest sound effects with a man counting down numbers which made me feel like the egg would hatch open if I didn't hurry. Not the most relaxing toilet experience  
- Food and drinks are mostly tasty but all came out a bit unexpected. My BF had the filet mignon and it was good. For my main dish, I ordered chicken. Except the chicken was diced up in BBQ sauce with popcorn. Straight up microwave popcorn and literally popcorn chicken with BBQ sauce. You should probably avoid that one if you can.
It's an eclectic place that's for sure!",-1
3,"I was taken to Sketch by my boyfriend as a part of my birthday treat. It was our second visit. As we're both David Shrigley fans, we wanted to visit the place again in the current incarnation.
I love The Gallery, I imagine I'm in a Wes Anderson film for 2 hours.
We had  booking for 6.30 and when we arrived 10 minutes before the time, we were told to wait along with another few guests for the evening service, which we were told starts at 6.30 (although there were already people inside). Literary 2 minutes lady a posh looking couple arrived, storming the door and were immediately escorted into the main room. That wasn't nice. 
I recommend coming at the very beginning of the serving time as the place is mostly empty, so it's nicer and quieter, so you can enjoy the place more for yourself and take photos without  feeling embarrassed and risking catching come c-celebrity in your selfie.
I started with the sashimi, which was meant to be an homage to the artist in residency, but was nothing more than an average and over-salted sashimi at a double price. The started was followed by a prawn dish, that was tasty, but not very big (literary 6 prawns with a spicy sauce) My boyfriend had a fish pie and that was much better and very filling. After two average dishes we found it hard to pick desserts as most of the descriptions weren't convincing. In the end I picked up what was sounding at least half exciting, but turned out to be one of the most fun desserts I've ever had. It was a creamy milky soup with pink bubble gum tasting ice-cream, tiny marshmellows, and pop candies. As a birthday babe I also got two tiny sweets. 
The wine by glass is well overpriced. Even if good quality, you get a tiny amount in a huge glass that last for about 3 sips and then you have to order again. Bottle is much a better option from the start.",-1
1,I am so sad such rude service on the reception table and destroy my happy mood. We 3 ladies wanna have some main food but she only applyed a tea table for us. Here doesn't deserve ur visit if u don't mind the service.,-1
5,"Solid experience. From the service to the decor to the tea and food selection, I was thoroughly impressed and satisfied. One of my main goals was to attend afternoon tea in London, and this was probably the best place I could have done it. The tea selection was huge, and we were given a two hour time slot to enjoy all the teas and tiny bites we wanted. The art and the restrooms were very entertaining, and the atmosphere, although a bit dark made for a very peaceful and romantic (if you want it to be) setting.",1
5,A wonderful place for afternoon tea. It's really delicious. The pink decorations are fantastic and ideal for photo lovers. Do recommend this place and you'll see how romantic it is.,1
5,"Imagine someone giving you a blank canvas and said, paint and create the most imaginative restaurant you can come up with. That is Sketch. We only had breakfast, but it is hard to believe that lunch, dinner, tea and drinks would be any worse.",1
5,"Beautiful place to visit in London with multiple rooms of different character. Amazing really is an understatement. I went for the pink room because I love pink! But I forgot to make a reservation and didn't get in. No big deal. I still got to see it and sat in an equally magical room with a friendly staff and fabulous food. Speaking of staff, they all wear designer outfits which were remarkable and so fashion forward I would have totally bought one. My husband and I hung out for the afternoon there and had a late lunch and lots of wine. I must comment on the restrooms because it is a one of a kind potty experience with portable egg toilets that make you feel like you are somewhere in the future. Sketch is the most spectacular one of a kind place and I highly recommend! It is a must!",1
4,"I feel a little bad giving this place 4 stars, but I don't quite think it deserves 5. The ambience as a whole is amazing, but the walls were covered vile, crude illustrations that, while good for sparking conversation, were on the whole unpleasant.
Also the food was delicious and presented imaginatively, and my spicy cocktail, burrata appetizer, and the dessert were delicious; however the flavor just of my entree, the lamb, just wasn't special. 
All in all, it was a lovely night but I think that for a place with multiple Michelin stars the restaurant fell a little flat.",1
4,"Good tea sandwiches especially the smoked salmon with roe. Very modern place, not reminiscent of a traditional English afternoon tea place.",1
5,We are so happy we came across Sketch in London - what a treat! Such a cool atmosphere with different rooms of different themes. You also have to check out the bathrooms! We loved it and had a great afternoon tea. Not touristy at all.,1
5,"Absolutely LOVED this place. Where in London do you find tea infused champagne? Or luscious cakes like a pistachio profiterole? Or such great finger sandwiches? Plus their toilets are egg shaped, very instagrammable and you get to hear the Apollo 13 commentary inside. And it's all pink. Basically sketch sweats happiness.",1
1,"Our experience was pretty awful. The ambiance is lovely but the service is quite lacking and the food quality was terrible. The pubs we've visited on our trip served much better (and less expensive) food.  Our drinks took 25-30 minutes to come out - two rounds in a row, which was ridiculous. After sending one meal (Risotto) back because it was overcooked, when the bill came we found both that and the replacement meal were charged. It was taken off when we pointed out the mistake, but there was very little care shown for the fact that the food was an issue. I would definitely. It go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.  I rate it 1 star because the hype is so over-inflated and the experience is so underwhelming.",-1
3,"I dont know how I feel about Sketch. 
In fact, I do know how I feel about Sketch. The same way I feel about Novikov, but with slightly  worse food and music. 
BUT! If you need to see and be seen... actually, hang on, I'd totally go somewhere else if I felt like I needed oligarchic validation in my life. Although, to be fair, I did meet a famous porn producer here once. 
This place is more hype than actual anything. Shame, them toilets are siiiickkkk. Soz.",-1
5,Great atmosphere. Good service. The place is very cool. Each room is completely different. And the bathrooms are a MUST see! They are basically egg pods. Awesome spot to have a drink!,1
3,"I had high expectations from Sketch because of the fantastic review and whilst the restaurant is stunning I felt the food lacked the same wow factor. 
The emphasis is on the ambiance and if this is what you are looking for than Sketch is the place for you! 
The staff is not short of wonderful too!!",-1
4,"Went to Sketch in The Gallery restaurant area.  When you first walk through the entrance of the building through a black curtain you come across hopscotch drawn on the floor what a way to enter but instead of walk in hop in.  You then pass many pieces of different art work on the walls.  You can check your coat in at the reception area before entering the restaurant.  The Gallery (restaurant) when you walk in you are blown away by the colour pink, pink and more pink.  Basically everything was pink from the comfy cushy chairs to the waitress's uniforms which was designed by a top designer.  When me and my friend was given the menu and we opened it up this pop up of knifes and forks made out of paper came springing up what a novelty and such a surprise.  The menu was quite hard to understand with its wording but the waitress explained it well.  I opted for the lamb dish and my friend the prawns and for a side we had mashed potatoes.  My lamb was very nice and the mash was the best mash I have had but for £5 I feel it was overpriced.  My friends dish was also very nice and sweet and different but for four prawns at £28 with some salad around them again overpriced.  For dessert I opted for the pavlova which was done differently to a normal pavlova and she opted for the chocolate dessert which looked like a chocolate U.F.O .had landed on her plate.  Again desserts nice but again perhaps a tad overpriced.  Whilst you are there you should go and check out the toilets.  Firstly you go up a lit staircase pink for girls and blue for boys.  You will then come across loads of pods like an alien has planted them there.  Inside the pods is the toilet and music so odd and different but then afterall Sketch is all about art.  Even though we had a nice time and we loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as it had such a buzz and was packed and this was at 6.30pm and that is rare to see a restaurant packed at this early time I would not go back purely because I feel it is overpriced for what you get to eat BUT saying this it has to be done to be experienced especially for the unusual toilet area.",1
5,"I went to sketch for afternoon tea back in December to celebrate my birthday. The food was delicious, and they were very accommodating when we asked for extra sandwiches (the mini toastie is so moorish). 
I do not have a bad thing to say about sketch, the interior inside the parlour where they hold afternoon tea is delightful, the service was wonderful and the food was spot on. 
I can't wait to go back and try something different in one of the other rooms!",1
3,Going to Sketch is a cool one time only experience. It is expensive but well worth it once!  The food was fine. A little bit excessive in quantity.The staff wears cool uniforms and the whole process is quite theatrical.  Lavatories are out of this world.,-1
5,"We went to Sketch for afternoon tea at 3pm. It was quite simply amazing! I want to give it 10 stars. The atmosphere is great, it's a fun and quirky place. The waitresses are bubbly and cute...and as for the the Maitre d'....Yes well.. Go see for yourself  and don't even get me started on the toilets!!! 
The Sommelier served us sweet Veuve Clicquot Champagne infused with bergamot. However, Afternoon Tea with champagne is more expensive and no refills. The food was delicious, and you can order extras of your favorites free of charge.   I would say GO for sure, it's definitely a one off experience, but totally worth it!!",1
4,Very good experience! All the staff very professional. Food very tasty with bold flavors and interesting combination from Asian/France cuisine.,1
5,"Gorgeous ladies afternoon tea.  
This is my go-to place to take out of town guests.  It has a modern twist on an original classic in a spot that is unique and memorable.",1
4,"A very cool - looking place that lives up to its reputation online. The place is immense and I wish I could have tried the tea room -- keep in mind that if you'd like to that, you should make a reservation! 
Definitely a bit $$$!",1
4,"I just made reservations for high tea. So this review is not about food. My reservation says, you can use the table for 2 hours, after which you will be asked to leave.. And we will hold the table for 15 minutes. British snobbery? Nanny knows best attitude? I will update this post after I visit. 
Food was really good. Waiters, servers were great. Attentive. Sandwiches and sweets were delicious. But London does not have good tea",1
5,"Swanky, posh, and artful. All the bar spaces are expertly designed to create an unique and lavish experience. Circle bar is great for dates.",1
2,"Super cool atmosphere, ok food, poor service...for the splurge price I expected so much more, waiter seemed to have forgotten us during Sunday shift change. Scones never came, cream puffs near reception never came, the second cheese toasties my kids requested never came! For a family coming for their first U.K. Tea it was a real disappointment, no teddies can make up for feeling poorly treated!",-1
5,"Five star rating starts with the eclectic decor as you walk in the door. Afternoon tea, although quite pricey is a must do for an elegant splurge. (45£ in the gallery). Wait staff is unbelievably attentive without hovering. Food was plentiful and DELICIOUS. Large selection of infused teas. Sandwiches and pastries were a gourmets delight.......and the bathrooms, well.....you'll have to go see them to believe them.",1
3,Cool place for afternoon tea.  Service crazy slow though.  Not sure I'd come back but cool funky decore,-1
4,Definitely a must-see in London. The rooms are beautiful and I had some delicious cocktails at the farthest bar. Next stop: The Parlour! (The most beautiful room of them all...),1
5,"I was dying to go to afternoon tea in London, and my friend and I were lucky enough to score the last seats at the teashop a half an hour before service was done for the day. Sketch is much more than your traditional tearoom. In fact, it's an eclectically designed collection of themed rooms - complete with an underground cocktail bar, a lunch and dinner café, a pink room with wall drawings, and futuristic ""pod"" bathrooms. It's truly a piece of art.
If you ever find yourself in London, I highly recommend a visit! I had a Pureh tea (still not actually sure how to pronounce that) called ""vintage mini cakes"" with two authentic English scones (side note: they're pronounced ""scons"" apparently) with clotted cream and jam. For a couple of hours, I felt like a true Londoner.
Service was amazing, as was the tea and the tea room. Come for an hour or 3 for an eclectic twist on a traditional British pastime.",1
5,Unique designs in a special place that is constantly evolving with the creativity of London and its buzzing patrons. Still loving the pods in the bathroom area and the layout of the tea room (ex lounge).,1
4,"Amazing dinner and after dinner place in Mayfair. Must take a tour if you're never been around. Good music and nice people.
A complaint: I asked for a Moscow Mule, a classic cocktail. What I've been given was not what I expected: let's define it a vodka and ginger beer mix with some red and sweet topping (?!). Disappointed.",1
4,"Sketch is like a dream full of rainbow unicorn and magic. The place is a eye candy that you take people to when you want to impress them ;). 
There are 3 bars and 1 restaurant inside. All areas have a different theme and music. All of the themes are very tasteful and unique. For the people who have been, will agree with me that the bathroom is amazing and a must go area (lol. Just remember to bring your camera ;p )
The menu selections are good, I wouldn't say the food or drink are excellent but definitely good. The service is great. The bill is hefty as you'd expect before going in.
I would recommend people to go to this place for special occasions or if you are visiting the city. You will sure to have an amazing time.",1
4,"Sketch is more of an experience than just food!:) 
I have been a few times and I love to take visiting friends here because they always enjoy the quirky, fun vibe here. 
It has a few different rooms to eat in, I have only been to The Parlour (because the others are even more pricy). The Parlour is wonderful, no two sofas match, and everything inside is an eclectic, bohemian collection of furniture. Everything is pretty to look and rather interesting to check out. Everytime I go I'm greeted by a hopscotch game chalked onto the floor, which I always use when I think no one is looking:P 
I never leave without making sure my visitor has seen the bathrooms here, because they are really fun. One is covered in swarovski crystals (even the flush is a crystal you push), and on the way there you pass a statue of a sitting woman completely made of crystals. 
The second bathrooms is even more fun. When I walked in, my first impression was of a blindingly white space filled with egg pods and odd noises. It is a bit disorienting to realize that each egg pod is a bathroom. The atmosphere is really different than any other bathroom I've been to, and the first time I went I was greeted by the sight of a girl dressed as a Victorian maid scrubbing the shiny white steps for all she was worth, and I wondered for a mad moment if I had been transported to a Victorian futuristic alternate universe. If I was coming for the first time, I wouldn't leave without going here, and hoping to see the cleaner lol.
The decor changes everytime a little, and I'm sure it is different for everybody. My favorite time was the first time because to get to the bathroom i had to pass through a room that was dim and had a video projected on all the walls of someone climbing trees with the loud and creepy sounds of the rustling trees and people. I was expecting lunch, not art, and the surprise was really fun.
Speaking of the lunch, the menu changes everytime I go as well. The first time I went I had the high tea, which was wonderful. They had the loveliest, fragrant jasmine green tea served in pretty tea cups, and a hazelnut chocolate cake that my husband and I fought over because it was so good. 
The next time i went, the cake was gone and the other desserts though decent, were not quite at that level. Another time we tried the lunch and I had tiny black sandwiches which were quite fun although not that yummy. The food there is unpredictable, I have had one or two really yummy things, and otherwise decent if unremarkable food, but never anything terrible. I love the atmosphere and would recommend it to someone who wants something different and fun with a cup of really good tea:)",1
5,"How fancy is this place? Went late night for drinks, Very impressed by the decor of the bar - a bit creepy but cool vibe with great techno music. I got the rocket mohito and finally discovered that the British name for arugula is rocket. A yummy drink that's healthy too. I'd say a bit on the pricier side but then this it's worth it.
And OMG the restrooms! I will not spoil it for you. You have to check it out yourself.",1
4,"Went to the first-floor area for a quick business meeting in the morning, and really wished I had the time to explore all the nooks and crannies of this huge, eccentric place.  The decor here is anything but dull, and I really want to try it out during the buzzy hours to see what it's like at its peak- plus, gotta see those famous egg-pod bathrooms.
I had to immediately downgrade a star because it is SO BLOODY OVERPRICED.  I get it, we're in Mayfair (though not even in the poshest parts as it's a stone's throw from touristy Regent's Street) but £6.50 for a non-alcoholic fresh juice drink?  So yes, do set aside a budget if you wish to partake in any food or cocktails here.
Still, if you're looking for a London spot with a 'wow' factor, this place is kind of a must.",1
5,"Amazing service! Friendly and helpful staff!
Came to London with Sketch being one of my top To-Dos and booked a reservation online. Somehow though, the reservation didn't go through and when I showed up, they didn't have my name down on the list. The man working the front was super understanding and found a way to fit me in anyway! I was so grateful! He made 2 Californians very happy!",1
3,"I went with my sisters and daughter for dinner at this awesome designed restaurant with 0 expectations. I had no idea what this place is about until the moment I walked in.  
The space is incredible the toilets even more.  However......the food was not worth the cost. Yes nothing tasted bad aside from the very boring and tasteless salad but from that to paying 360£ for 4 people it's a big never again place for me.  Yes the place has style the service is superb but did not amaze me enough to don't care about the bill.  
 There are enough places in London to eat well and not go crazy with the cost.",-1
3,"Definitely a place purely for the environment and vibe.  Pretty decor.  Went for afternoon tea with 2 children.  Food is not the reason to go.  Nothing was really that good.  Tea was very good though.  I would suggest this a a joint you take your bestie after not having seen them for 10 years, not just because you're in London.",-1
4,"Come for the decor, stay for the toilets. Also the food is pretty good.
A friend of mine made reservations here the other night. My lady and I met him and his lady. Actually, I met all three of them there...I wasn't late. They just left early without me. Some friends.
Just kidding they're alright.
Any place that has Ron Zacapa on the drink menu is a good place in my book. I keep a book. Assuming you do as well, so you know what I'm talking about.
After dinner we got a drink in the bar that looks like a forest. Cool bar. Not so comfortable on the seating, but whatever. Just drink the pain away.
Turns out this place has two Michelin stars. Found that out afterwards. Pretty cool.
I could spend all day looking at the stupid pictures on the walls. Art. Ha. Still, I liked it.",1
5,"It's a 5 for versatility. It suits all your needs whether you want a quirky afternoon tea, or fancy dinner, or casual drinks. And the women's bathroom is the number one reason to visit! It used to be House of Dior (I'm told) and has a fantastic design.",1
4,"This is a review for Afternoon Tea at Sketch in the Gallery room. Sketch is a great place to take people as it's very different - one of a kind place you'll see in London. Definitely worth a visit. In what looks like a very small establishment on the outside, there are many different rooms on the inside including a 2-michelin star restaurant.
As for the Afternoon Tea - it's your pretty standard Afternoon Tea you'll expect at any London hotel with a more funky Sketch spin to it.  Of course you've got the tea to choose from.  Lots of tea choices. All good.  You've also got a variety of cakes they bring out... probably had my week's worth of sugar in that meal but all worth trying out.  Their finger sandwiches are very unique - for example their egg sandwich had a very small sunny side up egg on each sandwich. Nice attention to detail.  The scones were available afterwards (not much space on the table as there were 3 of us) and they came out warm with jam and clotted cream. Very tasty and above average for the food tasted.
I would expect paying close to 30 quid for tea the service would be exceptional.  If I compare to other Afternoon Tea establishments for at other luxury hotels for roughly the same price the service is sub-par.  For example, tea was provided but not poured. We had to ask for sandwich refills rather than just being brought them.  These are the tiny things I'd expect. The staff, however, was nice friendly and we had a good meal.",1
5,This place is soooo cute- makes sense since I initially saw it on a list of the most instagrammable places in London. Each room has a different theme and each is equally inspiring. The drinks are delicious as are the macaroons! I'll be back with each friend who comes to visit me.,1
5,"I came here for my birthday and it was amazing. This restaurant is pretty much something from a Wes Anderson movie. The food is also incredible, I had the risotto and was very impressed. The whole room is note worthy, I spent the majority of my dinner looking at each drawing and laughing at the funny/sarcastic drawings and pointing them out to my friend. 
Also, the bathroom is a definite picture worthy place, I spent maybe 20 minutes taking pictures in the bathroom and I wasn't the only guest. The toilets are inside individual egg shaped domes, and the ceiling is covering in these multicolored light panels. 
If you love art, light pink, good food, and egg shaped toilets, Sketch is the place for you.",1
5,"I'm going to keep this short and simple because that's all you really need , it's probably the most creative restaurant in London, food is amazing! Probably the best Duck I ever had! They have a very artsy hip vibe and honestly you have to experience it! From the starters to the drinks to the main coarse to the dessert everything was perfect",1
5,One of the places I miss the most in London! Love it - love it - and love it! I can come here many times over and always feel like it's the first time. Bouncing between kaleidoscopical bathrooms and Clock Work orange Bars another must in the city!,1
4,Came here mainly for the interior decor. Five star interior decor! I really like India's interior style and taste. It's retro futuristic. The food is average taste 3 and half star max. I feel like if I were dining in 2030 or another planet. A chic place to hang with family and friends.,1
4,The scone is the best I have tried! Afternoon is great but the most impressive thing is that egg-shaped toilet. U gonna love it!,1
4,"What a delightful little surprise with such exquisite, with very well thought out interior decor. FYI I'm only reviewing about the afternoon experience I had here.
Mixing heritage with a modern twist, the hip and artistic atmosphere here is great for birthday tea as well as small friends gatherings. Downtown romance with uptown dining experience, the £32 tea set was pleasant, though not a full on 100% of what I expected- a mediocre scone with 2 jams, around 3 slices of finger sandwiches, one tiny macaron, pistachio mousse, a tiny chocolate eclair, two bite size caramel chocolate candy (so DELISH btw), lime and raspberry tarts, and three marshmallows (lemon, lavender and rose). and of course, a pot of tea that comes out to around 2 cups. 
The tea sets weren't meant to be shared, meaning that's ALL yours. Also ordered an extra earl gray macaron and this raspberry rose macaron base tart (the one with full on rose pedals on top). Do recommend this over that puny droplet of earl gray macaron although the earl gray flavor was a nice touch in variety.
Overall, very satisfied with my experience at this posh and chic place, a little pricey, but consider it worth it regarding all other aspects!",1
5,"My dad and I went here for afternoon tea. The restaurant is gorgeous and you'll keep looking around at all the artwork. The food was great. I loved the fact that you could reorder as much as you wanted. My favourite was probably a truffled cheese melt and the scones. The pastries were really great as well, not too sweet. I've been to other afternoon tea places in London like Fortnum, but this was definitely the most special and I recommend it to anyone!!",1
4,"Food was very good. Entire presentation is lovely. Relaxing room.  Great service - The entire staff was attentive and even made special birthday plate for my sister. Pricey but worth it, one of the best afternoon tea service in the London. My only complaint is that, we made a reservation one week before we went and still had seat too close to the service area.",1
5,"This is every bit as London cool it will ever get!
Decor is beyond ridiculous, the euro-space cool bathroom pods juxtapose with the old school maid uniforms of the bathroom attendants. I could of easily taken my shoes off and started running through each of the rooms in a game of chase with my husband, yes...that level of playfulness. 
Oh right, the food. Yeah, was awesome...some Michelin guy loved it too, or something. 
GO! 
( I was totally stuffed after the lunch tasting, but I recommend you accept what will come immediately after and go for it anyway, yolo people.)",1
5,"Everything was delicious, seriously no complaints.
For an afternoon tea that is not your ordinary tea time, Sketch is the place. It's expensive but its worth it- I walked out of there feeling completely stuffed and satisfied.
The selection of teas is very good- ranging from fruity to more classic teas. I went with Chai and really enjoyed it! My friend had the hibiscus and currant tea- it smelled amazing!
There was more then enough food for everyone with us! All of the different varieties of finger sandwiches were amazing! Then the pastries - especially the pistachio puff, were so so good! I loved everything I ate.
Would definitely go again and would definitely bring friends from out of town to Sketch for tea.",1
4,"Probably one of the coolest well decorated/designed restaurants anywhere, unique in every way. Went with kids for lunch and enjoyed a holiday brunch special on a tower platter, one for kids one for adults, both delicious.   Service was good not great, food was excellent, price was over the top, two platters, champagne lunch L350...",1
4,Drinks are good but expensive in a unique setting. Can be a bit of a hassle if you don't have a booking which is a pain when it's not late in the evening.,1
4,"This place was like a DREAM COMES TRUE! We celebrated my birthday at the gallery , the place was really BEYOND & unique. Starting from their pink decorations & their artistic paintings they had on their walls, exactly where the famous Singer Tyler swift had one of her photoshoots for a magazine right behind the painting walls in the pink gallery. & of course their FAMOUS bathroom, that looks out of this world in which you MUST take tons of selfies in there! 
Their menu was very limited specially with the maincourse yet we got trufilled steaks along with some french fries & onion rings -which were unbelievably tasty- yet I didn't like my steak much & I don't know why, it tasted too meaty , other than that it was really good. & for the dessert we had La Rochelle, which was a very weird looking dessert tbh , it had what looked like 3 icecream cones , only that they weren't icecreams at all , they came in Lemon, Mango & berry flav along with some side marshmallow, so it wasn't that great even though it was highly recommended to us by the waiter. The duck sounded interesting yet overly pricely as it was 32£ i guess. 
 The waiter sounded a bit confused & clueless & i told her to bring me some cocktails instead of the diet coke I ordered, at the end she brought me both of them! & her food recommenations were not obviously the best.
It was a pricey experience, as we paid 100£ +for the food & service, i was surprised to see that the olives alone costs 4£ & the bread & butter costs 4£ also -in which they recommend at the start- BUT it was all worth it! I fell in love with that place & I don't know why, You must visit the sketch at least once in your life! It would be an unforgettable experience, I guarantee you that!  
Cheers!",1
5,"This was my first introduction to the British afternoon tea concept. We came here last Sunday for a reservation at 4pm. It seems like reservations shouldn't be hard to come by as long as you make them 24 hours in advance. Ironically enough, this place is French.
Sketch was everything I expected after reading online reviews and their website. Swanky, futuristic, Sketch is an exciting blend of modern art piece and everything else from a cafe during the day to a dancing club at night. Or so I have heard. 
Instead of ordering an enormous three-course afternoon tea set, we both went for Cream Tea option. I had scones and White tea with hints of melon and cucumber. This is perfect for someone who's in the mood for a mild yet delighted Sketch experience. 
Check out the bathroom that look like a collection of giant eggs. The whole area seems to be taken straight out of a futuristic space ship where living specimen are frozen to come back at a later life. I might be taken a little bit away now... 
In short, I can't recommended Sketch enough. Bring a friend here as it's perfect for tourists and residents alike.",1
5,"This is where you go for an amazing date that makes you and your partner feel like you're in a David Lynch movie.  Absolutely delightful.  Great food, great drinks, great aesthetics, all without taking itself seriously.",1
2,"This review is for dinner in the gallery (pink room)
The restaurant is beautiful, unique, and very trendy. Several rooms/concepts wrapped into one place. The room I dined in was furnished with pink everything and clever art. Very well done.
The service was adequate, though I often felt rushed, and several junior level staff members could use some polish.
Most of the food was a bit bland, and with the exception of dessert, all dishes left something to be desired. 
All in all, wouldn't pay the ticket again for 'just OK' food and 'good enough' service.",-1
5,"First time for afternoon tea, and as a dude, I appreciated:
- unlimited food with afternoon tea. I definitely got seconds of everything I liked, which included the sandwich with caviar, pear tart, and lots of tea
- the artwork on the wall. hilarious stuff!
- ridiculous bathrooms. I used them multiple times, because I stuffed my face full of their food.
Solid place and definitely an alternate to the formal, high tea you could get elsewhere. Recommended!",1
5,"The cream caramel is as good as it gets. Did you see what I did there, Yelp?",1
5,"A great experience right in the middle of Mayfair. The service was friendly and efficient, and the food and cocktails excellent. Definitely worth treating yourself!",1
4,"We rolled into Sketch last night around 10pm for some shits and giggles.  Its a blast in there, what a cool atmosphere.  We sat at a table and had some grub and then headed into the circular bar area.  The drinks flowed till late and a good time was had by all.  The eggpod toilets are a trip, don't even get me started on the waterfall.  Good fun for sure.",1
5,"Quite simply, the best restaurant in London that I have ever visited. Usually I dine in the lecture room but decided to give the gallery a go this time.
Food is magnificent, service is top notch (thank you Sarah), atmosphere is great.
Not cheap, but sometimes it's not about the money!",1
5,"Initially saw this on Dina Tokio's vlogs on YouTube and was immensely impressed by the bathrooms alone and the decor in general that I didn't even care about the food...boy, was I shocked! In a great way. The tea has delicious and so were the little goodies. Highly recommend it! The service was also phenomenal and more attentive than I had expected considering how busy the place was. The pink room was my favorite! What a beautiful gem.",1
5,"This place is truly unique. Everything from the alien bathroom and the boutique dining room to the impeccable food display, I recommend going here if you want to show off or have classy friends from out of town. 
We started in the circular bar where the cocktails were fresh and strong, and finished with a full three-course meal. Even if the decor wasn't as glitzy, the food was so good that I would have still recommended this place. 
But if you have time do roam around... it's like being in a modern art or design gallery where top quality and style is the norm. Hats off to both chef and interior decorator :)",1
5,"Sketch was worth the wait. I had this restaurant on my list to experience ever since my son dined there over 5 years ago and finally dined here July 16th.  The sommelier was perfect with her choice of wine, A 2000 Chateau Belgrave Haut-Medoc.  My wife and I had the duck and loved it. Would I return?  In a flash if I resided in London.  Of course the decor in our dining room and the bathrooms were quite edgy and classy.
I recommend this restaurant!!!",1
4,"Highly recommend making reservations at the Gallery restaurant. We had the udon noodles and a beef dish, along with a Mexican cocktail-delish! Don't really recommend the parlour as without a table you'll be stuck at the tiny bar. This area is tiny as it is. Cocktails were great though, hostess was very rude but bartenders were great!",1
4,A little pricey for afternoon tea but all the sandwiches and treats were refillable so we felt like it was worth it.  My favorite was the smoked salmon sandwich as well as the Brie sandwich (comes hot).  I also loved the scone with clotted cream and fig jam.  The only reason I took away a star was that the service was slow and this was late in the afternoon when it wasn't as busy so I felt there should have been more attention paid.  The atmosphere is very cute for a girls the (pink room),1
5,"Went to London on vacation and went to sketch and I must say the experience is unforgettable I love sketch and the whole style that they have going on! Oh and there drinks are ridiculously good! But if I recommend any of the items I would have to say get the duck! They serve it two different ways and present it to you before they actually prep it! This restaurant is more of an experience. From there funky bathroom to there out of space vibe bar, to there pink room dining room. Even there plates are cool! If your in London you must again MUST dine at sketch",1
3,"As you walk in around 4 members of staff were checking to see where we were going - felt sincere. 
High Concept bar - weird....very 90s. Each room has a theme. We were in the cocktail bar. the bar itself was lowered into the floor and the staff had table service. its £13.50 - £15 per cocktail, we stayed for two, they were quite nice. 
iTs a bit cooky and weird - the toilets are little pods with weird people talking in them - sounds like air traffic control. Now what struck me as particularly bizarre was the fact that if you have a massive section for pod toilets where you can look over to the mens side  - why bother have mens/women. I was guided to the ladies side by a bizarrely dressed staff member (in a French maids outfit) who looked miserable as she was leaning on a pod. 
I'd go again - its bizaare but fun.The restaurant seemed to be a place where it booked up in advance, but not the bar. It is certainly a pricey place.",-1
5,"Amazing design decor and multi use space. They truly invest in the correct art, decor and designers to keep this space constantly evolving and alive. 
The afternoon crowd can be questionable given how popular it is and its location but clearly that's a reflection of Sketch's success!",1
2,"decor was the only thing that made this place worthwhile, the food was cold and the service was horrible",-1
3,"the only reason for three stars was the wonderful bartender.  Probably the most pretentious restaurant I've ever been to.  The food was not worth the high price, it was just okay.  From the doorman who asked for my ID before letting me in (this is not a club, and It was 8pm) to the hostess who claimed they didn't let people eat at the bar and they were completely booked. Two people walked right in the door without being questioned or having to show their IDs (clearly much younger than me). After asking to use the ladies room, I went to the bar and asked if I could sit down and eat.  The bar staff immediately attended me-  They saved the evening, and were great.  The food was decent but overpriced.  Drinks were delicious.   I hope the management trains the staff to treat people with a little more respect , even those who don't show up in Chanel...",-1
5,"This was the most incredible dining experience of my life!  Everything was incredible!  The Gallery was the perfect mix of beautiful, charming, formal, and friendly.  Every person I contacted was so kind and helpful!   Don't even get me started about the food!  I don't remember exactly what I had, but my main course and dessert were out of this world incredible! Of course, the bathrooms were a special treat.  Also, for the budget conscious, the lowest price entree is 14 pounds and the entrees range to upwards of 50 pounds.  Worth every pound!",1
5,One of the best afternoon teas I have had. The blueberry eclairs in particular were excellent,1
5,"Wonderfully delightful experience. Be sure to try the tea infused champagne and now that I've had, I'm not sure how I can go on without it! It is delicious and a wonderful infusion of you love tea. The sandwiches and deserts are enough for a meal since you also get a pot of tea. My friends and I enjoyed the ambiance and the experience thoroughly.",1
5,"My favourite restaurant&rafter noon tea place in UK!the interior is just amazing...so sad that the toilet with eggs is not open in the morning...wanted to show my fed this morning!had English breakfast and omelette, but not as nice as the afternoon tea set!",1
3,"The Place looks amazing - that goes without saying - the toilets look like eggs and are spectacular looking - Its like a cross between willy wonkers factory and wonderland - But considering that it is £44 per person for afternoon tea I was expecting a lot. However, the cakes and sandwiches are nothing special and the taste combinations don't really work. 
I would recommend going to see sketch but as a one off thing!",-1
1,"One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. And I dine out several times a week. I rarely leave reviews but it was a negative enough experience to where I have to say something. We visited Sketch during my first visit to London. We booked for brunch in the Glade on a Monday morning. As in, not peak hours. The service was non existent. We waited over 20 minutes just to be greeted and receive a menu but noticed the server attend the table next to us at least 4 times in the same time span. Our order was never taken and finally we moved to the parlor. The server was more affable in that room but the service was still painfully slow. We had to wait another 20 minutes just for our coffees. It seemed they had one server for the entire room when they know the rooms will be full given you have to make a reservation beforehand. We noticed other tables complaining about the service and looking miserable as well. The menu was overpriced and the cheese and crackers was a complete rip off. Three of the thinnest crackers I've ever seen and some small cheese cubes on a plate for 12 pounds. The rest of the food was ok. It seems they prepped the aesthetics of this place for instagram and then forgot to properly train wait staff. Perhaps they do not care. I don't recommend unless you have 2+ hours to spare for overpriced bites. Very disappointing.",-1
4,"Pretty good French food, but you go for the design and ambiance, very cool.+ Amazing toilets of course!",1
5,Omg!!!! This place! Wonderful staff wonderful environment. Price was fine considering the experience. I took my daughter for her birthday. She loves it. Visiting from US and this place made our trip! Love it! Food was great!,1
5,"Okay let's be honest here. You're paying for the atmosphere because the food isn't all that great. But geez, the ambiance here is unlike anything I've ever seen.
Unique, futuristic, artsy. Each room has a different theme and it's like you step into the wonderland that is Sketch right from the moment you walk through the front door. I made reservations weeks in advance for a Thursday night in The Gallery. We had a bit of time to wander around the venue before being seated so we walked through The Gallery and into the back bar/bathrooms. One word: WOW. Questions like ""Was this the future?"" and ""I am on a spaceship?"" crossed my mind. Really, really, cool. And you get to handle your #1's or #2's in your own personal egg-shaped pod. Nothing beats that. By far, the coolest bathroom I've ever seen.
The food was okay. Nothing to brag about. You'll surely leave hungry unless you want to order multiple dishes. My friend and I split the Sea Bass Tartare, which was nice, but had a very light flavor. My friend ordered the Beef & Foie Gras Burger (21.0), which came with a side of fries. It wasn't a very big burger and we ended up splitting it. Juicy, tender, with a very light layer of foie gras. I ordered the Gambas (26.0), and I wish I got something else because it literally came with 3 prawns. Yup. That's right... THREE. 26 Pounds. BOOM. 
But seriously, such a stunning venue. A MUST DO AT LEAST ONCE!",1
4,"The food and plating presentstion was refined and adventurous. The ambience is worth traveling across countries for--it truly is a fantastical experience. However it took ten minutes for anyone to even stop by our table in the Gallery. Hosts, servers and the proletariat-styled utility servers were all buzzing about but we felt utterly rejected and had to ask just to order. It was very disappointing to say the least since I had been so excited to bring my family here. My martini didn't even have olives after I had requested them in my order and it was brought out twenty minutes after the rest of the drinks at the table. I will go back someday but perhaps to a different salon. The staff in the Gallery were just not up to par with the delicious menu and unforgettable installation.",1
4,"INCREDIBLE PLACE.  Food, wine, service, ambiance, everything was absolutely fantastic. 
FOOD: We did tasting menu with wine paring. My partner did vegetarian version, and I did non-vegetarian one.  Every single course was beautiful, interesting and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. There was no dish I liked ""just ok.""  My partner also loved every course of vegetarian tasting menu. An interesting thing was that vegetarian menu was 20% cheaper than non-vegetarian one and vegetarian menu has one more course than non-vegetarian one. Paring as well. (Vegetarian tasting menu: £95 for 7 courses, paring: £95 , Non-vegetarian tasting menu: £120 for 6 courses, paring: £120)
WINE: It was probably the BEST WINE PARING I've ever experienced in my life. I was wonderfully surprised and almost shocked by how perfect it was for every course. 
SERVICE: It was exquisite. There didn't seem to be assigned or main servers for each table. Instead all servers were working on us and other tables, which I liked a lot.  For one course, our sommelier couldn't bring paring wine before dishes were placed in front of us. We were going to wait for wine without starting eating the course. But next second, they noticed about that and brought wine for us within 30 seconds instead of keeping us wait for the sommelier. (The sommelier came back to our table to explain the wines while we were enjoying them.)
AMBIANCE: Interesting and grand. I love it.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: There was no female service person or sommelier on the floor!!!!  To make things worse, there was one female outside the floor just standing in a costume of maid!! I didn't ask the reason of all about this crazy situation. So I don't know, but it looked to me that some gender discrimination was going on. This is why I marked four stars instead of five. Since I didn't ask the reason and also I've been seen only one night, I mark four stars instead of less.",1
1,"Sketch London was an absolute disappointment. When we were visiting London in September, my boyfriend and I made reservations and I was so so excited to finally be able to experience this place. His mom and sister were in London as well, so we had all planned to go together for a special night together. 
Right off the bat they wouldn't let my boyfriend in because of how he looks and they were incredibly insulting. They told him that he looked too ""jarring"" for their establishment, but his mom, sister and I were welcomed inside. His mom explained to them that we had come from California and I had been planning to come here for years, so they reluctantly let us in. Our table wasn't ready yet so they had us go to the bar where there was an apology drink waiting for my boyfriend. He wasn't drinking, but we thought it was at least a nice offer. I was almost in tears at this point because of how belittling they were to us, but I was trying to make the most of it, especially since they apologized and tried to accommodate us. I ordered a mimosa for myself and when I got the receipt the ""complimentary"" apology beer was 15 pounds... I looked at the bartender only to have him give me a snarky look in return, so I didn't bother complaining and just paid for the drinks. 
We waited 30/40 minutes past our reservation time until they finally seated us after having to remind them multiple times that we were waiting. Our waitress was incredibly rude and treated us like we didn't belong there and didn't have enough money to be in their restaurant. We each ordered what we wanted but when we declined drinks she blatantly scoffed, pursed her lips and rolled her eyes. 
By the time we finished my boyfriend and I were both incredibly upset and I was in tears. I've never been anywhere, let alone a restaurant, where the staff made me feel so beneath them and belittled. I had hoped that this would be a special place for us to create memories when we visit London and after our experience I will never step foot in here again.",-1
4,"Trendy multi-concept venue in Marylebone. Dinner, drinks, late-night, it's all here. Sure, they serve meals, but I'm here today to talk to you about that liquor.
Firstly, bring yo camera phone, because you will want to take selfies. This space oozes cool, from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy bathrooms, to the English tea time pink dining rooms (the booths look like pink lady fingers) and three (3!!!!) bars inside to choose from. 
It was my last night in London and I wanted to celebrate. My friend and I eyed the drink list and she mouthed to me ""champagne"". Eff the exchange rate! 
Sexy people here so don't come in with your leggings and boat shoes. Not that there's a dress code...
The rest, kind of a blur. Don't really remember getting home, but aren't all the best nights like that?
Great venue for friends, dates, showing off to your country bumpkin friends and showing off to your hard-to-please-American-gals (cough, cough me).",1
5,I love that every room in this place its own cool personality! I only went for drinks but I know it's popular for afternoon/high tea.,1
4,Make a reservation and go! The menu can come across as limited but worth it. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back!,1
3,"(Dined on 19/07/16) The dining gallery and the bathroom area certainly lived up to expectations, and the food quality is very good. Unfortunately, the air conditioning was not working on the hottest day of the year, and it certainly affected our dining experience.",-1
4,3 floors of exuberance delight and originality. Sketch has been opened for years and busy season upon season for a reason. From dining in The Intimate Library room to having drinks in the more funky mainstream bar downstairs. Somewhere truly unique hidden in the depths of Mayfair. LOVE THIS PLACE,1
5,Great afternoon tea spot! It is located in the tourist area but the atmosphere of the restaurant is chic and trendy. The pastries were delicious. Highly recommended,1
5,"This was the absolute best Afternoon Tea experience I've ever had in my life!  The place itself is so beautifully and whimsically decorated you feel like you've stepped into a fantasy land.  Often with places this fancy you find that the staff is rude and condescending; that is definitely not the case at Sketch.  Every person I chatting with was friendly and attentive.  I was blown away at the service and positive attitude.  I had the champagne/Earl Grey specialty cocktail and it was out of this world!  I also had a great conversation with one of the staff about the cocktail's creation, which was great.  The tea and food was terrific and I will go back upon every visit to London.  You cannot write a review without mentioning the bathroom!  The egg-pod toilets and space-age decor were such a treat.  I loved this place!!",1
5,"When I think about more quickly and interesting bars to show a visitor that's coming to London, I think about sketch! I haven't eaten there yet but I have been down to the bar which has a bit of a fairy tale atmosphere. And of course you can't leave out the toilets.. #eggsInSpace :)",1
2,So pretentious and such rude staff; the cocktails are lovely but that's literally this place's only saving grace.,-1
5,"Even if the service was bad I would still give sketch 5 stars. Amazing selection of pastries, tea and sandwiches. I wanted to bring my family here from the states since they're visiting me during my studies here in London, I don't think I could have made a better choice. My young cousins are vegetarians and our sweet waitress catered way above expected to get us a better selection of sandwiches. She was so genuinely concerned with our tea, making sure we had everything we needed. They even brought out fresh hot scones towards the end of our tea. Not to mention that the bathroom is awesome- but I'll leave that a surprise.",1
5,Absolutely loved my visit here! Went for the afternoon tea which was great and they have very cool toilets!! Haha.,1
1,"Afternoon tea at sketch? No thanks.
I went in there to give it yet another try. They turned the main Gallery in something pink and sickeningly plush. Why sickeningly....well have you seen that picture going around the internet where they should you what chicken mcNuggets are really made of? That's what it reminded me of. 
Bad service. Really. For a Michelin star restaurant I expect more, much more. At Sketch it is condescending, inattentive and impatient. Forget about tea & clotted cream top ups. You'll be lucky to get someone's attention to get your bill.
The food. The only sandwich that was worth landing in my memory is cheesy compte one. Nice & crunchy. The rest were...well. Sandwiches.
There was a lot of sweet stuff alright. Just because you're pink, Sketch, doesn't mean you need to kill your customers with sugar. Opera cake was nice but the rest of the pastries were just disappointment. And scones? I was given a *choice* of scones. I could only have raisin OR plain, nope, not both. Let alone there were no savoury choices for scones (kudos for Mad Hatter Afternoon tea at Sanderson's - they've got it right).
I was hosting guests from abroad here, so at least bathroom impressed them. At least they've got that right... This review would probably not change a thing. The food would still be mediocre, the service still bad and ambiance still not do it. And people would still give it rave reviews. Disappointed.",-1
3,"Step into this exclusive looking club and you feel like you've just walked through to Alice in Wonderland's Mad Hatter's tea party. The decor is crazy cool and the bathrooms are just mind blowingly weird. 
We came here for a cream tea and I was really impressed with the quality of food/drink and the decor. I was not, however, very impressed with the service. We booked a table for 3 at 4pm. We didn't get seated until about 4.30, with not much apology about the wait and ordered straight away. By 5pm we were still waiting for our tea to arrive, let alone the scones. 
I was quite frustrated by the whole thing and thought that they could have at least brought the tea quicker or maybe offered a glass of juice whilst we waited as surely the point in booking is to be efficient and not have to wait.
However, I think the place is really unique and would definitely like to come back some day for dinner or drinks as it's so quirky.",-1
3,We had dinner here for NYE 2012 at the two michelin starred restaurant. The food was excellent but the service was a bit average. To make matters worse they brought out the champagne after the coundown had finished and everyone has wished each other Happy New Year !! A tad disorganised dont you think ? specially for a place that has such a high rating ?? I have posted photos of the food here and also the menu. I would defenitely come back here again another time when it is not so busy and see if it's better on the service front. The waiter we had was a tad arrogant and took ages to bring us our bill and rarely checked up to see if everything was ok. I would give 5 stars to the sommelier on the night and he was fantastic. His knowledge of wine was immense and he was extremely attentive the whole time.,-1

Fortuitously blessed with the ability to sleep soundly on aircrafts at any time of day it was fresh off the red-eye from McCarran to Heathrow that I walked into The Parlour at Sketch and although a table laid in wait at The Lecture Room upstairs just sixty minutes later I simply could not resist the temptation to experience the 'casual' side of my favorite Chef's cuisine amidst a room of intriguing design and some of London's most beautiful people.  Truly a space to see and be seen with eye catching décor at every turn it was in a trio of small plates that my Sketch experience began and served en masse at my request not a single bite underwhelmed in the least, the ethereal gougeres melting to the tongue while both the creamy liver and black brioche would not have been out of place at Michelin starred spots throughout the English capital.  Already impressed with the best yet to come it was with a surprisingly smooth transition that I moved to the posh environs upstairs and having already studied the menu at length a six course tasting soon progressed, though as anyone familiar with Chef Gagnaire will know the plates hovered somewhere in the mid-twenties with concepts and flavors evolving exponentially as a well-trained staff assured I was never for want.  Truly a landmark meal for many of the same reasons that I've enjoyed Twist and Rue Balzac in the past suffice it to say that those willing to adventure into seemingly discordant flavors are likely to be rewarded for their faith and with bitter playing a strong role in both Morels and Foie Gras while intense sweetness was well served in the indulgent $51 cocktail and a soufflé standing tall and proud the highlights of the meal were in fact the three-piece guinea fowl and a cheese cart focused on the local and unpasteurized with thick cuts and clever accoutrements unlike any I'd see elsewhere in the subsequent eight days - the unpasteurized Stichelton particularly elegant and a beautiful segue to a baba that would trump even Ducasse, the savory sesame notes playing perfect foil to smooth lemon jam while a stiff shot of rum found levity in syrup, cream, and semi-tart fruits.",1
5,"One of the coolest restaurants I have ever been to, and the food rivals Michelin-starred darlings - very impressed with their ability to accommodate allergies, and loved the drink menu! I have dined here twice now, once for afternoon tea and once for dinner - both were exquisite and I was so impressed with everything from the food to the service. Obviously the bathrooms and decor are quirky - but the food and service are the true gems here.",1
4,Great for afternoon tea . Not as keen on the food. Great atmosphere with quirky toilets and bar,1
4,"It was a lovely place for girlfriends getting together. Everything is pink, even their cocktails. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly. We didn't have the reservation and it was a rather busy day when we walked in since it was a post-Valentine's Day. People who didn't get the reservation on V-day flushed in the day after. But the waitress managed to give us the best seats at the bar which gave us the view of the entire restaurant. 
The cocktails are great. The bartender definitely knows what he's doing. Even we were sitting at the bar, they still gave us sufficient attention to make our experience wonderful. 
Also, the bathroom is worth checking out. 
The entire building has this ""Alice in the Wonderland"" vibe. Each room looks different and very heavily themed. The Sketch is like the tea party and the bar across it is like the tree hole that Alice falls in. 
Unfortunately, we missed the tea time this time, but I would love to come back and try their afternoon tea.",1
2,The decore here is awesome but £12 to £18 for 1 cocktail i dont think its worth even going there for 1 drink.,-1
5,"I'd been here before, but I decided to come back last year with my partner for afternoon tea in the Glade Room.
The design of the whole interior of the building is incredible, with loads of lush ambient light and the totally weird pod toilets. But my favorite part was going back to The Glade Room for our afternoon tea. 
There's a really nice ambiance about that room in particular and the hues of greens and yellows with the bamboo styled furniture are all really nice.
The selection of beautifully made cakes and savories were just as good, if not better than the first time I came. They were displayed on a lovely stand with a mousse and macaroons at the top, some more sweets in the middle, and with things like egg, cress and caviar topped sandwiches at the bottom of the stand. 
The tea and cocktail menu is also really well put together their gin and tonics are really on point too.
This is a great treat if you want to surprise a loved one, or are in London and want something a bit traditional, yet wacky to do.",1
4,"Went there with a group of friends.
Food is good, broad range of wines, signature cocktails are sophisticated.
Yet restaurant is overpriced : 100 £ (140 € for starter + main course + wine and coffee).
Courses were good but not to an extent that you can expect for such a price (or at least that would not be the case in Paris).",1
5,"Sketch offers an amazing dining experience. I call it an experience because that is what you will get when you done here. From the moment you walk all of your senses will be stimulated. Your eyes will be greeted by the lights and beautiful artwork in the entry way, which is nicely complimented by their soundtrack. I give the atmosphere 5 stars and the food alone 4 stars, because it is good but not as amazing as the atmosphere sets you up to expect. We had the Chantilly Lace (amazing) Dover sole (rather boring) and veal (very nice). The desserts were unique and refreshing but not amazing, we tried the cheesecake and the La Rochelle. They do have a fabulous wine list!",1
3,"This place is bizzarre. In order to get the full experience, try to see the whole restaurant, as it is a pretty cool place. Going to Sketch is like going to Alice In Wonderland, with many different themed rooms, and very interesting toilets. I have ate at Sketch twice, once for dinner, once for breakfast. The dinner food was absolutely horrendous (got this weird miso noodle dish), and the waitress got our drink order wrong because she did not speak proper English. The breakfast was good, just got porridge (how can you muck that up?), so I would recommend Sketch only for breakfast. I would go to Sketch once for the experience, as I did, but I would not go back unless forced.",-1
1,"I've given this place far too many tries and now my patience is over. 
A ""sommelier"" who isn't capable to recommend a bottle of whine below 120£ (this is not about being too pricey for ME, but about being too pricey for a poor quality restaurant), fancy sounding overpriced dishes with more than poor taste/execution, and since the renovation even the cool atmosphere has vanished and been replaced by the feeling of sitting in hell made out of bubble gum.
Did I mention that before you get the menu (which would enlighten you) they ask if you'd like bread (which is free in 99% of all other restaurants I know, with 1% being McDonalds) and in the end they charge you about 5£ for a tiny serving?
Being a lover of pork, foie gras and (strangely) black pudding, I ordered the ""suckling pig and foie gras gatêau with black pudding"". You would imagine a layered piece of heaven, treating all the ingredients, especially a delicacy like foie gras, with all the necessary respect. Far off! What I got was an undefined roundshaped ""mash"" of pork and foie gras on a bed of blended black pudding (attempt to make a sauce?) that tasted to undefineable that I forgot what it was supposed to be at the time.
One word: YUCK! The ingredients were mashed together with disrespect, it tasted like old greasy slime and unfortunately there wasn't even any texture or crunch from the ""suckling pig"".
I have never been so disappointed by a dish with some of my favorite ingredients.
The final reason why I will definitely never come back to sketch: not only was the dish disgusting, it also gave me food poisoning.",-1
3,"Sketch is actually three different businesses - a bar a lounge and a restaurant down at the end. The lounge is weirdly laid out (it's sketchy) with all sorts of random adornments - fancy furniture, moose heads on the wall, very electic. The drinks menu is on newsprint and is quite pricey. You must walk through the restaurant where you can see great sketch artwork on the walls on your way to the bathrooms which are out of this world. You just have to see it to believe it. The only thing I'll say is I wonder if the DJ is aware of what is flowing on either side of him.",-1
3,Went here for tea and thought it was seriously overrated. The restaurant itself looks fanatic but the food quality was so average. We went at a busy time and the staff seemed really rushed and it was hard to get their attention.,-1
5,Amazing surroundings and beautiful interior design. It takes a breath away (especially if you don't expect anything).,1
3,"It has long been on my list of places to go to, especially to check out its famous, colourful, funky loos. I was there recently, seated in the Parlour, for a brunch with some ladies. I had taken my 7.5month old baby along as reviews seemed to indicate the place is surprisingly baby friendly. And I must say, I was pleased with the promptness with which they brought the high chair out... I had a pot of the Puerh tea to start with, as it was a nippy day and I wanted something to warm me...the tea and the presentation were both lovely. I placed an order for their poached eggs, with crab and cereliac remoulade and toasted brioche. The eggs were just right and the remoulade was an unusual take on the traditional breakfast. But, I definitely felt the portion size was a tad on the smaller side, which is why I placed an additional order for wholemeal toast after the eggs arrived. Really liked the spreads to go with the toast. And can't fault the latte afterwards either. However, I feel like this may not be the best fare on offer at sketch.... I looked around and saw a party enjoying their afternoon tea and thought, I must come back to enjoy some of that. Also, I had a peek at their various other rooms including the plush Gallery, I made furious mental notes on where to book for my next meal here... this time, it was an A-OK meal, but next time, I suspect it'll be better!
PS - Also, my experience of the place may have been coloured by the company... when you have a group of 6 who have placed more or less similar orders, just split the bill equally. I mean, really. Stop tallying up the individual items you ate...especially if you have so much freaking cash to eat here in the first place. And especially if the final sum you pay is more or less similar to everyone else's...this is a pet peeve, clearly.",-1
4,"Elegance embodied. 
Sketch is an interior designer's paradise. The attention to detail is magnificent. Several, individually themed rooms create an unparalleled, multidimensional experience. 
The service is faultless. The staff have evidently been well trained. 
This review is focused just on the drinks. Unfortunately my cocktail wasn't up to standard, especially considering the staggering £15. 
The truth is, you don't come to Sketch for the food or the drink. You come to soak up the ambience and bask in its beauty.",1
5,"I made reservation on their website in advance. I love the place since I walked in to the place. The place is well-decorated and classy. We had booked the afternoon for $45 per person. The tea were just okay but their cakes and very tasty, you can have unlimited tea for 2 hrs. The portion for the afternoon tea is a lot, we couldn't finish the whole thing but you can definitely take them to go! I would say the place is a bit pricey for afternoon tea, but for the experience is definitely worth the money! Forgot to mention, their toilet is so pretty and fancy!  I LOVE IT! So, overall, Sketch is definitely an experience!",1
5,"Afternoon tea at Sketch is a sight to behold. The room alone is breathtaking. We were greeted with a saucer of champagne, which was soon followed by the afternoon tea. The sandwiches were unlimited and personally, my favourite part of the meal. The tiers were followed by warm scones and more tea. An amazing experience, by far the best afternoon tea I have had. The service was impeccable. The knowledge provided by the waitress was fantastic. The atmosphere was great and the interior is stunning. The bathroom is out-of-this world- like something from Alien! Each cubicle is an egg.
My only criticism would be that they try and convince you to order more champagne again and again, as this is obviously not included in the £65 afternoon tea price.",1
1,"This place is so deeply vapid - it feels like its sole purpose is as a location for instagram photos, not to actually experience anything or engage with your friends. The space is interesting but the lack of windows and self-consciously cool decor makes it feel a little like Vegas or Disney World. The food was fine but definitely didn't make up for the unpleasant vibe and the service was not great - both of the tables next to us were told they needed to hurry up ahead of the next seating. We could not wait to leave - find somewhere else for an English tea.",-1
2,"...probably really cool 10 years ago. The food was just not there in taste and presentation, especially for the price. The pink velvet chairs had layers of dirt building up, really should focus on cleaning up the entire act. I cringed when I realized the toilets were built openly on top of domed bar. The witty writing under the food on the plate was faded. It's just a dying brand, really outdated in every way.",-1
5,"Most amazing afternoon tea of my whole entire life! They bring you extras of whatever you want from the tea for free. My one regret is that I wish I had more time to enjoy it. Carve out a whole afternoon for this experience! The decor, fashion , dishes, staff, music are all inspiring and creative. Don't miss out on using their restrooms! It was an out of this world experience that I can only liken unto a more sophisticated Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but that totally doesn't do it justice.",1
4,"Great steaks, nicely served good service. The service is nicely performed and with a smile",1
4,One of the most eclectic places I have ever been. Each dining and bar room (including the bathroom) has a different theme that ranges from Victorian to a spaceship. Makes for a great photo opportunity with friends and the drinks were spot on too.  Kick the kettle and Benoit bulleit hit the spot... Ask for them to ease up on the basil syrup though as it can be a little on the sweet side.,1
5,"So much fun that I'm giving this place 5 stars. This restaurant is by far one of my favorite places. It's an amazing experience you won't find elsewhere. There are different rooms to choose from and they have the coolest starship inspired restroom. My family and I had dinner at the gallery. They have the nicest waiters and waitresses who give the best service. The food was fine, I ordered fish and chips and my family ordered the udon noodles. The food wasn't too amazing, it was just fine. But, the restaurant and the experience was amazing and is why this place deserves 5 stars! They really should think about opening more locations, because this place is awesome!!",1
3,"Cute place for afternoon tea, the toilet is  designed  so good. and the sandwiches are nice as well but hope could serve some fruit as well.",-1
5,"Absolutely one of the highlights of my trip to London! Amazing restaurant, service, food, and cocktails. No detail is left untouched! The visual concept is beyond creative  in every room, right down to the bathrooms. Me putting it into words does not do it justice! I just can't do it justice with my words. Sketch is a place you need to experience, and see for yourself. I hope you enjoy as much as I did!",1
5,"The bathrooms alone were worth the trip for afternoon tea. While expensive, we received the highest quality service. The interior was so cool of Sketch is amazing (as are the toilets). There's a reason why Sketch is one of the most instagrammed places in London.",1
4,"Four stars just for the egg shaped toilet stalls. Is the food amazing? Not so much, but this is a fun place to take friends, especially ones visiting from the other side of the pond. I love pretending I'm British, after merely having lived in London, and Sketch is one of those places that can forgive an American for her fake British accent provided that copious amounts of wine are consumed.
And copious amounts of wine SHOULD be consumed. This is London. And this is Soho baby.",1
4,"Came here for afternoon tea during the Christmas menu. It was about $100 USD total/person. There was an assortment of pastries, but I didn't find any that were very surprisingly unique. There was also a wide assortment of tea to pick from. Everything was refillable. It might be that we booked the last afternoon tea reservation of the day, but we only had 2 hours for our afternoon tea and I felt a bit rushed to consume everything. The servers were nice and told us we could stay as long as needed, but it felt a little awkward when the room started emptying and people started coming in for dinner. I felt like the afternoon tea place is more known for the cute pink room atmosphere, the christmas choir singing, and the egg shaped toilet bathrooms than the actual food.",1
4,"My flatmate and I visited Sketch a few moths ago and loved it. Every room is beautifully designed and the bathrooms are amazing! 
We had breakfast which was very small and not great to be honest but the tea and cakes more than made up for it. I highly recommend the 'London to Paris'.",1
3,"Yes, the loos are cool, but is that really the first thing you should say in a restaurant review?
Some of the food was really good, like the lamb (which I got to try because my friend only ate half of it due to her tiny appetite. She is an awesome friend). Chantilly lace was a bit weird. Beef tartare was quite good but it didn't really need so many things going on with it. Just the raw meat is fine. Slightly raw fondant potato was not so fine. Banana and lime macaroon was so incredibly good, I absolutely loved it. So basically they need a little more consistency and to let the flavours speak for themselves [disclaimer: I have no idea what I am talking about].
Their website looks like it was made by a 15 year old internet nerd in 1997. Why do so many restaurant/bar websites make noises of some kind? So much inexplicable animation...
The decor...I liked the tree made of toys. And the paintings made of forks and other random items. I can't work out if it's being wanky in a tacky way, or tacky in a wanky way. Either way, it was a pretty fun experience!",-1
2,"Been to Parlour once for drink and really liked the vibe, so I decided to take a friend there for her birthday to check out the mysterious and fancy library. I liked where I had my food, but I didn't enjoy what I had to eat. 
I was finally allowed behind the velvet rope and led upstairs to the library. I really liked the ambiance with beautiful high ceilings and one side of the dining room with floor to ceiling tainted mirrors. I also like the eclectic furniture style. 
We had the tasting menu which took almost 3 hours to finish and I wasn't satisfied in the end: 
- We had quite a strong beginning: a nice spread of tiny and delicate finger food of tart and jelly and cheese puffs. I was immediately full of anticipation of what's to come, only to find the experience to be going downhill. 
- First off, I had the sea bream and cuttlefish on black olive jelly. Obviously, the jelly was pre-made and put in the fridge and they just put the fish on top when someone orders it. It was quite blend. 
- Then came the red prawns which was actually quite good. 
- Foie Gras ravioli came after. I am a big fan of foie gras and I was not very pleased that they actually screw this one up. First off, putting foie gras in ravioli means it is not off the best quality, otherwise, you will never mess with it that way; secondly it was in a curry sauce which overpowered the nature taste of foie gras. I was not a happy camper. 
- Roasted pollock. It was a nice piece of roasted fish, and there was a bit of a surprise as escargot was used in the sauce. 
- Veal with sweetbreads wrapped in lettuce. They were served separately and I was wondering what the connection of these two flavors were. 
-Lastly, we were presented with 6 Pierre Gagnaire's desserts. They all looked very pretty, but there was one problem: except for one or two, they were not made onsite. While it was great to try different types of desserts, I'd rather have one very good one that is made to order. Don't get me wrong, those desserts were nice and I would be perfectly happy if I were in a nice cafe, but for a tasting menu, they didn't cut it for me. 
They charge 95 pounds for a 6 course tasting menu, but I have tried much tastier and more creative menus at a cheaper price elsewhere.",-1
5,Best afternoon tea I've been to in London. This one is worth a visit. The decor is fun (pink room and spaceship like toilets).,1
3,"Came here for afternoon tea and given all the hype came away with the impression that this is exactly the sort of place that makes people hate London. The tea (£39 a head) is in a room that is head-to-toe pink - it feels overwhelmingly like you're sitting in a blancmange prison. Everyone mentions the toilets, which are startling and apparently modelled on a Hollywood version of a celestial waiting room (or an Austin Powers set) with wall-to-wall white, individual egg shaped pods (mine didn't seem to quite seal itself, meaning I had to keep a paranoid grip on the door handle for fear of becoming a victim of latrinus interruptus) and the inexplicable inclusion of loo attendants in full French maid kit. 
The sandwiches are petite and with the exception of the salmon and caviar offering (whose caviar topping offers a welcome burst of intense flavour), sadly rather tame in the flavour department. The asparagus in the cucumber sandwich lacked any seasoning whatsoever, and the mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur was surprisingly greasy and tasteless.
The scones and cream were probably the best thing about the whole meal - the scones are large and came to the table still warm, albeit with not quite enough clotted cream to go round. The fig jam was also delicious (and I say that as someone with a long time antipathy towards jam in general). 
The cake selection is disappointingly free of British flavours and the cakes themselves are horrifyingly small - the coffee eclair was about the size of my little finger (and I have relatively slim digits) and the raspberry meringue...let's just say I've seen bigger engagement rings. Call me a greedy beggar, but if you can eat it in one mouthful, it's not a cake, it's a petit fours, or in this case, a disappointment. Both the pistachio macaroon and the berry tartlet could have been quite delicious but (like so much else about Sketch) suffered from a wearying overkill with the addition of an unnecessary berry jam/compote in the middle. 
You do at least get free tea refills, but the staff dropped the ball by bringing my flowering tea out after it had infused, thereby denying me the visual pleasure of watching it bloom (which is pretty much the whole point of ordering a flowering tea).
Overall, I might have been reasonably content with the food were it not for the disproportionate price tag which appears to be a function of the achingly pretentious interiors and service. Call me old-fashioned, but I'd much rather have my food served up by polite, friendly professional wait staff without legions of wannabe models floating around purposelessly in utilitarian chic shirt dresses.",-1
1,it's okay. Too touristy. Head over to the Gilbert Scott for afternoon tea.,-1
5,"I came here with my cousins for afternoon tea as we wanted something a bit different. Located in a fabulously renovated townhouse in the heart of Mayfair, this is definitely worth a try. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The afternoon tea was a mixture of traditional sandwiches and modern interpretations of cakes. Thoroughly recommended and a real highlight from my visit.",1
5,"I came here for afternoon tea and it was delicious. The scones were excellent as was the service and ambiance. Afternoon tea is a great way to enjoy Sketch on a cheap budget but still get to experience it.
ALSO, while I was there my friend and I sat right next to Billy Zane and Bill Paxton! They were in town for the Titanic 3D premiere I suppose. So now you have an extra endorsement from them to go to Sketch!",1
4,"This is the most unusual Michelin starred restaurant I have visited in London so far.  It looks like a trendy nightclub at the entrance (I think there is a bar on the ground floor).  We were led past the velvet rope, up the stair case and went past a few heavy curtains to arrive at The Lecture Room where our table was waiting.
Their surroundings are just what I want to see in this kind of restaurant.  Rich, colourful carpets and decorations flowing with luxury.  Comfy seats.  Dining here is an experience. The service was friendly and efficient, not stuffy. They made some jokes with us, which makes a nice difference.  We also got a mini menu to take home with us.  Another nice touch.
We opted for the 7 course tasting menu. There was a vegetarian tasting menu and a la carte options available too.
Breads. Served in a bowl, warm and crusty, but there was only one type of bread. There were two butters: citrus and a regular one.  The citrus one didn't quite sit right, it tasted like you were eating a lemon creme biscuit.
Amuse bouches.  A mini macaron with blue cheese cream, a disc of goat cheese and a mini roll which tasted like melon.  There was also a little bowl of crunchy parmesan bites.
Earth and sea 3. Great contrasts of flavours and textures. Looked like a raviolo, but it was a blanket of cuttlefish over the other ingredients (squid, pineapple and crunchy fennel). I liked the look of the mini lettuce filled with crab meat.
Crayfish served with onion and turmeric jus. Came with spelt which gave the disk a nice texture.  The crayfish was obviously the hero of the dish and were tasty morsels.
Pascaline.  I'm not sure what pascaline is (!) but this dish was firmly based around scallops, which I love.  We had fried scallops and fresh (raw) mushrooms on top of a scallop mousse and a mushroom sauce.  It tasted just as it sounds. I liked the scallop mousse the most.
Hake, Savoy cabbage and razor clams. Nicely cooked fish and cabbage, I liked the clams. They were like prizes. The crumb coating on the fish tasted like lawn, which is not a bad thing.
Jellied sardine, fois gras, celeriac, frozen raspberries. This was the most interesting looking dish of the night, with the huge cubes of jelly and the star-shaped dish.  Unfortunately, it was not entirely my cup of tea, but it had solid flavours.  It felt like a lot of sardine jelly to get through.  I would have preferred simply fried sardines, but I could see how this may have been too close in nature to the previous course.
Hereford beef fillet, with turnip gratin and crispy aubergine.  The beef was cooked nicely, but for me the most interesting part was the cripsy vegetable chip on top.
Pierre Gagnaire's Grand Dessert.  This was six desserts which came out on separate plates, 3 at a time.  They covered a wide range of tastes and textures, with my favourites being the chocolate ones.
Petits fours.  There was a jelly, a mini tart and a chocolate.  Nice, but not too special.
I had been looking forward to our visit here for weeks, but when the date arrived I had been sick for a couple of days and had a sore throat.  It was a shame because I wouldn't have got the full taste experience.  It was an expensive meal, but in line with my price expectations.",1
4,"I'll be upfront, the stars are mostly for the decor and the bathrooms. I love a good bathroom design and these are some crazy ass wonderful ones.
The food was surprisely good but way overpriced for the portions size and ingredients. You are paying for the decor and what decor it is. Over the top in all ways both good and bad. 
I came here for lunch so I can't rate the dinner service. The tea service was also going on while I was there and it looked quite nice if I on the dainty side. I would still like to try it as would I like to try the overpriced dinner service.
I ate lunch in the parlour, it's probably the most boring room but still charming, there is the main dining room which was closed for lunch and the garden room which is very charming and of course the toilet which are egg-like free standing pod in a elevated white platform. 
I got the haddock souffle which was surprisingly good if very overpriced at 14 pounds but compared to the 46 pound dishes on the dinner menu, it's steal.
The service was horrible even more so since they automatically add a ""discretionary"" 12 percent service fee which as a North American I would have a hard time asking a server to remove. But seriously the manager had to yell at the server to actually come over and take my order as well as the person next to me. I had to flag them down to get the bill and this was in a room with only four table occupied. It was my first time encountering a discretionary fee being added to the bill without my approval although it appears to be a horrible trend in service lacking London. Again if you are going to charge for service, you need to actually provide it.  
So if you want to check out the decor without spending the big buck eat in the Parlour.
The bathrooms are not in any way wheelchair accessible and the whole space is not designed for any kind of accessiblity.",1
5,"Lindsey in Wonderland!!!!!  Lindsey in Wonderland!!!!!
Sketch is like my own personal fantasy:  delicious tea and scones, with a side of over the top Alice in Wonderland decor.  And don't even get me started on the space pod bathrooms (I'm sorry England - toilets).  ^see several photos posted above
You'll spend more than a pretty penny here but it's worth a trip at least once.  Don't forget to book your reservation a week out or more, this place is popular!",1
5,This restaurant is a beautiful venue with amazing service and food to match. The afternoon tea is such great value. The sandwiches were different and the quail egg stood out with its slight mustard twang. The macaroons were faultless and the small delicate lemon éclairs just exploded in your mouth with so much flavour. I also went for a seasonal cocktail and it was probably one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time. (Visit - 29/11/2014 Lunch),1
4,"9 Conduit Street in Mayfair, London.
If you are into food, art, fashion design, or architecture, then you may be familiar with the address. The opulent townhome has served as the headquarters for the Royal Society of British Architects, the atelier of Christian Dior, and is currently home to the 2 star Michelin-rated French restaurant run by Executive Chef, Pierre Gagnaire.
Even if French food isn't your cup of tea, if your pockets are deep enough, I suggest that you at least pay a visit to check out the unique ambiance. The décor is parallel to none; with each room in the space taking you on a journey that is evocative of trippy dream. There are three different dining rooms--each one offering a different menu and price point--as well as two ultra posh cocktail lounges. The whole venue is a riot of color and an onslaught to the senses. But the loud and quirky design makes this Michelin restaurant feel, dare I say, comfortable?!
After studying all of the menus, I chose to dine at the Gallery, which is the more informal restaurant space with more reasonably priced menu items. British artist, Martin Creed, has transformed the space into a serviceable museum of modern art with eclectic chairs and one-of-a-kind dinnerware.
To start, I ordered the Chestnut Velouté with white truffle oil, and pan-fried squid sautéed with garlic and cherry tomatoes (£15). It was velvety, rich, and every bit delicious. I cleared the bottom of my bowl with the trio of freshly baked breads that were brought to the table (£4).
The second appetizer that I tried was the Dublin bay prawn tempura with haricot beans and aubergine, accompanied by an Osframpi sauce (£25). The prawns were delicious but sadly, there were only three of them--typical French portions! I didn't expect the vegetables would also be deep fried, and I found them a bit bourgeois in contrast to the otherwise haute cuisine. The osframpi sauce was magical, however, due in part to the fact that I've never tasted one before. Essentially, it is a puree of wild berries balanced with some sort of lemon acidity to cut the sweetness. I did not use it for the prawns, but rather as a spread for the breadbasket.
For my entrée, I ordered the Cannon of lamb roasted en crépine, Niçoise socca, swiss chard pomponette (£28). The lamb was cooked to perfection and the sauce dressing the plate was to die for, but I have had better cuts of meat before. I cleared the plate none-the-less, which easy to do at a French restaurant--oftentimes in just two bites!
There was little hesitation when it came to choosing a dessert; naturally, I opted for the chocolate one: Sketch Chocolat, which is a dark chocolate box filled with vanilla cream, nougatine, dried fruits, caramel syrup and coffee genoise. On the side, of the box was a little shooter filled with pistachio ice cream with pineapple and mango coulis (£10). I also got the suggested after-dinner drink, The Whisk Away, made with Laphroaig Whisky and Kalua (£7). The coffee notes in the dessert and cocktail complimented one another beautifully.
All in all, Sketch is about the experience: the art, the atmosphere, the service, the exotic bathrooms! Sure, the food is very, very good, but it is the ambiance that is over-the-top. I would certainly return, possibly in some high heels next time, with slightly lower expectations of the food.",1
5,"Never disappoints !!!I love visiting this place , its classy with a very different artistic touch !! The food is always good with a consistent quality that have not changed for as many years as i visit it !! I know every one says that , the bathrooms are a must visit !!!",1
4,"Cute afternoon tea spot. I think this had to be one of the more interesting dining experiences. This place is massive, varietal and just overall a fun experience. 
Afternoon tea was an absolute delight with some of the better looking and nicer waitresses we've encountered in London. Its not your typical proper ladies tea out but this is just an opposite spectrum of how whimsy tea could be. 
Definitely a splurge but one worth doing if this your first time in London (like us).",1
4,Go for the decor and the incredible bathrooms. I'd say that the brunch fare was quite good. It's not necessarily exceptional (although some members of my party had tea and scones and I was thoroughly jealous). The prices were consistent with other restaurants in Central London. I must reiterate--check out the bathrooms. They were so much fun. The different dining rooms also added a kick of fun to what was an otherwise cold and dreary English day. The cappuccinos were strong--excellent for a mid-day boost after a tiring morning flight. The toast with butter came with a good selection of spreads.,1
3,"This review only applies to the Parlour. Sketch is one of those places that would almost be most enjoyed if no one had ever told you about the details of it's decorations and you stumble upon it yourself. Although this restaurant has apparently been a London classic for nearly 10 years, I first learned of this restaurant after making a reservation for Pierre Gagnaire's original restaurant in Paris. When I asked around, everyone in London described that it's decoration alone is worth a visit, especially the loos. I jumped on this chance when I had friends in town who wanted to meet for breakfast (reservations taken before noon at the Parlour).  
The Parlour is probably the most tamed/classic of all the rooms. It is a tea room and stays true to that. A walk through the other rooms and the design element didn't disappoint. I'd say imaginative, arty, and eclectic (part Sandusky hotel, part vintage). I wish no one had told me about the loos and left me to discover it myself, so I'll leave out details here. 
A few other patrons were having afternoon tea and it looked decent. We ordered lunch (burger, tartare and salads) and it was OK. 4 stars for the decor (even with the hype) and 3 stars for the Parlour food. Tea selection was good.  I think you take Sketch for what it is. Perfect for bringing guests looking for a surprise element but I wouldn't go for those looking for a classic Chez Gagnaire food experience. In fact, I don't even think I'd recommend it if guests were looking for one single London must-try.",-1
3,"Go for the spectacle of it all, but the substance is lacking. There is not much behind the pink walls full of ""art"" and the Mork from Ork eggs as wash room stalls. Serviceable food and adequate service. Ironically the best way to describe this place walked in as I was leaving. A dapperly dressed man with his dog in tow trying to remain aloof and indifferent, while his every move is screaming, ""Hey, look at me!""  This restaurant is just trying too darn hard.",-1
5,I've been to sketch four or five times and have loved it every time. Fantastic service and exquisite food! Hopefully back soon again!,1
4,"This restaurant is all about the experience. It is like dining in a modern art gallery. We sat in the room in the front of the restaurant that was a mixture of strange items and art pieces. As far as I could tell, there are two more rooms in the restaurant. One looked like a forest. The last one was bright pink. The restrooms are an experience too!
As far as food, that is why the restaurant gets one star off. It's not that the food was bad, it just wasn't great. We started off with a tomato soup and bread brought in a Lego basket. Then, I had both the pate and foie gras burger. Both were fine, but not exceptional. The presentation on both was phenomenal. We had dessert as well which was unremarkable. 
Overall, just because this restaurant provides such a trippy experience, it's worth going to.",1
4,"Came here for an afternoon tea on a beautiful Thursday afternoon. 
First things first, the price: £34/person x 1.125 (service charge) + £1 (donation to KidsCo). So you're looking at around £78 for two people. That's about the price of an afternoon tea at any of the nice hotels in the area - so if you're feeling a bit adventurous or forgot to adhere to the dress code, this is the place to go!
There is a great selection of  teas: I got the white tea, and it was the right bit of flavor - and didn't get too concentrated as the water ran low. 
The assortment of desserts and sandwiches was unique, my favorite dessert being the strawberry cheesecake and my favorite sandwich being the asparagus sandwich. The scone was spot on. 
We sat in the parlor room, which had a very interesting chandelier and paintings that demand more than a passing glance. The servers were nice and attractive, though slightly slow. The highlight of the afternoon was the egg bathroom and its two French maids. I never thought I would say a bathroom would be the highlight of a dining experience. 
Definitely worth going back to when friends are in town.",1
4,"You can't write a review of this place without mentioning the toilets and the lego-brick bread boxes.
Went in for dinner, and had a wonderful time.  Would definitely return.",1
3,"Sketch is a splurge, no doubt about it. Be aware of the price point.
I'm glad we booked up in the Lecture Room; when we got a tour of the rest of the premises, the other dining rooms were much louder, much more buzzy, and much less, well, classy. (Also, the pod bathrooms are cute, but they didn't smell or look particularly clean on a Saturday night; I'm glad that the Lecture Room had its own facilities, which were bling-tastic but impeccably clean.)
When I visit a new place like this, I generally opt for the tasting menu to get a broad sweep of the chef's style. The food here is very much nouvelle Continental. You won't encounter anything particularly exotic or flamboyant, but you can generally depend on classic flavours done right.
I felt that some of the menu items shone, like the venison, whilst others were a touch off base. A couple of the sauces were too bland, and the kamut (or spelt; I can't actually recall) was overly salty. Portions were small, as expected, but very slow to arrive; overall, we were there nearly five hours, including the 20-30min tour of the building, which is quite a long time for a seven-course meal.
Service was mostly impeccable. One of the waiters was less than willing to make a substitution for one member of our party, which was a touch off, but the chef came up with a compromise. Likewise, the sommelier butted heads with me on a few of the wine choices, despite my explaining to him that I was choosing them to be in line with the more conservative palates at the table.
Dessert was visually pretty but all components were overly sweet and not particularly refined. 
I would have liked to have seen a greater overarching story to the meal; instead, it felt like individual components cobbled together in only a roughly increasing degree of intensity rather than gastronomic cohesion.
Enjoyable, and a good choice for a celebratory dinner, but I can't say that any of the dishes were memorable enough to make me rush back.",-1
1,"Terrible service, mediocre food, weird and tacky decor. I had a manager guy drop an entire glass of cocktail on my back and got no real apologies. I ordered their special duck dish for 2 but it was not good. took us 30 mins to get our coats back at the door because of all the clubbers coming in. Terrible experience.",-1
4,"If you want to go and take a pee in an egg shaped toilet cubicle whilst hearing the sound of birds humming in your ear then THIS IS YOUR PLACE! BOOM! Be prepared to reenact a scene from the film Cocoon when venturing to the bathrooms. (Anyone growing up in the 80s + visited sketch has done that, right!?) Now on to more important things (just), we visited Sketch for afternoon tea recently. The room is extremely quirky and the 'sketches' on the wall had my 5 year old inner self in stitches. The waiting staff were on the boarder of being rude, nobody was exuding a fluffy pink mood to match the room sadly (I would have happily paid extra if the waitresses were dressed in a pink care bear outfit - imagine that!). The food was good - egg sandwiches are always a winner and nice to have vegetarian options for afternoon tea. Tea was out of a tea bag, not PG tips mind but still out of a bag. I would expect tea leaves for the money you pay and destination. Rose champagne was £17.50 a glass so make sure you start saving up those golden nuggets! I went with my mum and would definitely visit again with friends. More of a girls club than with partners.",1
2,"This place is pretty cool. The pink decor and overall atmosphere definitely creates a lovely setting for a relaxed afternoon.
Food and tea wise it was good. Although the sandwiches and cakes etc are small there is plenty of them and you wont leave hungry, you also have unlimited refills. 
With regards to the tea, I don't actually drink it. but I was there as part of a girls day out and my 3 other friends said it was ok, nothing amazing but I did notice a lot of different flavors to choose from though.
The reason I'm giving it just 2 stars is because of the excessive cost.
Our cost was £68 pp, typically it is £45 pp but it was higher than normal because it was Wimbledon week. We were aware of the cost at booking and decided to go ahead as there was a different package on offer reflecting Wimbledon. These ""extras"" was the bathroom attendant was dressed as a ball girl and there was a live feed from the tennis matches coming thru the speakers in said bathrooms......that was it. We each paid £23 EXTRA for that.
The real humdinger was when we got our bill an additional £12 pp was already included in our total as a discretionary tip! 
As I said it is a really nice place, decor, food, staff - no complaints. If we had received something extra reflecting the extra cost incurred I'd be really happy. For now it just feels like a rip off.",-1
2,Outrageously overpriced for well presented but bland food with mediocre service.  Don't try to impress anyone by bringing them here...,-1
4,"we had the afternoon tea in this nice restaurant, especially the toilet of it. It's a special restaurant, even though the food is not that amazing.",1
3,"I visited Sketch not too long ago for afternoon tea.. and at £44 per head, I can't say I was highly impressed.
The interiors and decor are definitely incredible and nothing like your average London hangout. I agree with some of the other reviews, it has an Alice in Wonderland feel with quirky messages written on the teapot and at the bottom of the cup. 
I must be very boring, as the sandwiches and cakes didn't leave me wanting more probably because of their unique combinations. In fact, at times I often just finished what was on my plate because of the price! The toilets are jaw dropping to look at and each 'cubicle' is in the shape of an egg (bit claustrophobic though).
The staff were friendly and showed us to our table when we arrived. They also provided extra tea but were a bit difficult to get a hold of when it came to asking for the bill. 
Can't say I'll be coming back here again but I am glad I've visited as it's another place I can check off my list.",-1
3,"I went to the Gallery with a friend for dinner last week. Overall, my experience at Sketch was memorable, but I still wouldn't say it was worth the price tag, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. One thing I must say is the service was top-notch. The staff was attentive and very helpful in their recommendations. They seemed to be genuinely interested in making our dining experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible. The ambiance is absolutely lovely. The pictures don't really do it justice. It is truly a Gallery as the name would suggest - very colorful and beautiful without seeming over-stylized and tacky. Also, check out the bathrooms! One of the coolest bathrooms I have ever been in in my life.
Overall, the food was pretty good, not mind-blowing. My friend and I each got a cocktail, a starter, a main, and a dessert. The dishes were inventive on paper, but didn't seem all that different from what you could get at a number of restaurants in London for a much better price tag. Given that the hype and the ambiance was so unique and fresh, I was expecting the food to exhibit the same qualities. This wasn't the case and I paid a premium for it. 
I would say if you're looking for a great scene with decent food and don't mind the price tag, try Sketch out. I may come back, but it will likely be only for drinks or their afternoon tea. Again, I may have ordered badly, so I'm not ruling this one out entirely. :)",-1
2,Apart from the funky toilets it wasn't all that. I still had to go somewhere else for food because the portions for were soo small. It is a very posh place and is good for the experience but the food didn't justify the price.,-1
2,"Went for dinner.  Décor is enjoyable (although now looking a bit tatty in places), food is really poor and at silly prices for the quality of the kitchen - let me make that clear: FOOD IS REALLY POOR AND AT SILLY PRICES FOR THE QUALITY OF THE KITCHEN - service is obnoxious (but possibly in a slightly funny and characterful way - the stroppy cloakroom woman with attitude was hilarious).  Probably best for a drink in one of the louche and atmospheric bars.",-1
3,I was expecting a little more glamorous atmosphere. Instead it was pretty sweaty and smelly in some of the rooms. For that amount of money I have been to more appropriate places. Design and decorations there were really cool though.,-1
2,"I think this place has 5* for novelty factor. But I was very disappointed with the actual content of the sandwiches. There was very little filling in them, despite looking the part. I also thought it was very expensive for what it is. The one bonus is that they are happy to bring you more sandwiches and cakes and don't charge you extra.",-1
5,A feast for the eyes!  The different rooms are incredibly decorated.  Very different feel in each.  I had dessert there and it was a work of art.  The service was like no other.  Great music and great atmosphere.  A must!,1
5,"I've been to Sketch's restaurant a couple of times for lunch and really enjoyed it - as well as the food, I love the decor and the theatre of it all. I'd highly recommend lunch there on a sunny day - when they whisk you up the stairs and throw open the doors onto the dining room, the light and colour is just spectacular. 
I think this was also the first place I dined where my handbag was brought it's very own seat at the table, which was a delightful touch, and made it feel so special! 
I've had afternoon tea in the parlour before too, which is fun, although usually very busy. But it was only recently that I noticed they also do a breakfast/ brunch menu (served until noon), so this review is primarily focusing on that.
I went for the Parlour Breakfast scrambled eggs and smoked salmon option, which is not my usual choice, but it was absolutely delicious. Beautifully served, the eggs were the perfect consistency, not too runny and not too firm. The salmon came in a separate side dish and was melt in your mouth delicate, with an accompaniment of lightly cooked tomatoes, and toast. 
I liked that all the constituent parts were on separate plates enabling you to build your own breakfast as you ate, and it meant that the toast stayed crunchy, the salmon kept cool and the tomatoes didn't leach into the eggs.
Other options include their take on a full English or continental breakfast, eggs benedict, pastries, porridge, muesli and fruit, so there's a decent, albeit fairly traditional, selection on offer.
And of course given their focus on afternoon tea, they have an extensive range of teas and herbal infusions available, although on this occasion I went for a cafetière of one of the ""rare and exotic"" coffees, which was just right. 
I will definitely be finding a reason to brunch here again!",1
5,"The Sketch is such an amazing and interresting place. It is the perfect place to enjoy a drink while you are mesmerized by what is surrounding you. 
The Parlour Room is this sort of bar that you'll be proud to show to your friends. Mix of Class and Cool!! 
The Egg bar, is just crazy, an Egg shape bar with the Egg toilets upstairs, it says it all. 
You Have to go there if You have been yet. One of the nicest place in London. My favourite place by far.  :)",1
5,"Hands down totally beats Fortnum and Mason afternoon tea! The head chef is Pierre Gagnaire, an extremely awesome French chef! The decor of the tea parlour is so soothing and its light pink. The bathroom is literally a jungle of dinosaur eggs, you go into an egg for the toilet haha! The food was amazing especially the pesto panini and smoked salmon sandwich! You can also top up anything as much as you want! It was £45 per person for a normal set including service!",1
3,"Sketch's recent £50 off deal meant I finally got to visit!
The Gallery's deco is very memorable and makes you feel like you are in a Wes Anderson film. The walls are covered in individual drawings which results in constant distractions.
The toilets are mad and are all in individual pods.
The food itself was ok, but if I had of paid full price I think I would have been a bit disappointed. I went for the ""fish and chips"" for main which was a good sized portion but a little too salty for my pallet. I went for a cheesecake for desert which again was ok, but nothing spectacular.
Overall an interesting experience but not somewhere I think it's really worth spending all that money on!",-1
5,"Sketch is truly unique. 
People have described it as very ""Alice-in-Wonderland"", and that is appropriate.  Every room has it's own unique charm, theme, design.  The attention to detail is evident everywhere.  There is not a single light fixture, door knob, or texture in the place that hasn't been thoroughly thought-out.  You might not always agree with or like the thought process yourself personally...but you cannot deny that a creative mind was at work on each and every decision.
Possibly there might be better restaurants in London; possibly there might be more capable cocktail bartenders in London.  
But you will never set foot in a place like Sketch anywhere else in the world.  
It's worth the trip even if all you do is walk in, sit down, and order a soda.",1
5,Unbelievable meal. Incredible wine. Wonderful service. Amazing ambiance. I would highly recommend this restaurant. It truly is an experience.,1
5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! Since we only stayed in London for one day, we only had time for the afternoon tea, and it was FABULOUS! 
Food were great, but the decor was AMAZING! English is my second language I just can't describe it in words. You MUST go and see/feel it yourself! It was such a FUN experience! 
Next time when we go to London we will surely check out other rooms!",1
4,We had dinner here the other night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  They were cute with all the attention they gave us.  My husband made a comment on his booking and they took it and ran.  Everyone that spoke to us knew we were celebrating.  So on to the restaurant itself.  I love it.  The food is amazing and the service is as good as the food.  We had foie grais to start and I had pork for main while my husband had the lamb.  It was so good but left us both so full we couldn't sample any of the cheese which looked amazing too.  The pork was sweet and juicy and just so tasty.  I love this place.,1
5,"Highly recommend this place for a great tea time!  Four of us had the tea which came with a lot of teas to choose from. The three level tray of foods was amazing. There were curried chicken salad, ricotta and cucumber, grilled compte cheese and salmon sandwiches to choose from. The next two levels were different sorts of pastries - all delicious. My favorite was the pistachio. Next came scones with cottled cream and fig and strawberry jam. After that, was a special dessert of vanilla custard with rhubarb. Also, you can get more of anything you like for no additional cost!  Bathrooms super cool sleek white pods. Great neighborhood too right in Oxford Circus.",1
5,"I came here with a few friends for afternoon tea and was blown away. The David Shrigley gallery is hilariously entertaining and adds to the experience tremendously. The food is delicious and the best part is that you can order as much as you want! Tea is great (as expected), and if you're looking to drink champagne the options are excellent. Well worth the hefty price! This place is a must, and I will definitely come back.",1
4,"Ok, the toilets are amazeballs. This is probably the only reason I'd tell anyone to visit Sketch which is really quite wrong. Big giant pods with maids cleaning around it. A real-life bizarre dream. 
Sketch has different rooms with different atmospheres and a restaurant between the bars. The bar which you would first walk in has a calmer ambience with elegant yet crazy furniture. The room on the far end is very small and much darker with a bar in the middle of the room. The bar sits lower than the ground floor so that you are much taller than the barmen. 
Prices are quite shocking but the cocktails were nice. Definitely not amazing. And it took at least 25 minutes for two cocktails to come. 
The service was top notch. Great staff, handsome men at the doors and between each bar standing straight and elegantly. 
Sketch",1
5,"Woah.  Sketch is a work of art which contains works of art.
Came here with a small group to celebrate my 32nd (ugh) birthday a couple weeks ago.  We had dinner in the Gallery.  Sketch is a larger building comprised of several different portions.  There's the Parlour where I believe they have afternoon tea, the Gallery, in which we sat and ate and gawked and marveled, upstairs is the Lecture Room which boasts a Michelin star.  There are also a couple smaller bar areas, one of which looks like you stepped into a fairy tale forest, and another which I unfortunately didn't discover!
The decor in the Gallery is everything I could ever aspire to dream of in a future home.  The furnishings are completely mismatched.  No fork looks like any other fork... same can be said for every other utensil, glass, chair, table, etc.  Oh, I love it so!  It's a feast for the eyes.
No complaints about the food or drink either.  I had the Chantilly Lace as a starter which is basically lobster bisque with a tiny tower of tri-colored rice in the middle which was black rice (squid ink), red pepper rice, and regular basmati rice.  It was fantastically delicious.  Roast leg of lamb main, which was basically tiny chunks of lamb with bean and a gorgeous broth, and the ""Lemon"" for dessert.  It's just called ""Lemon.""  And it delivers on the name.  Again, every plate is a carefully constructed work of art.  I wish I could shake the hand of that pastry chef because man, was that Lemon something to see.
As we were leaving, a gentleman caught me and a friend gawking at the art (which we found it is commissioned specifically for Sketch), and quickly started telling us how he'd worked there for years and Sketch was his passion and he very nicely showed us around to the rest of the building!  He snuck us upstairs to the Lecture Room and let us peek in, told us the history of the building (it used to be the House of Dior), and told us more about the art and showed us the equally spectacular bathrooms on the upper floor which are meant to be the inside of a jewelry box.  Quite the contrast from the crazy insane egg-pod bathrooms near the Gallery (all bathrooms attended by ladies in stereotypical ""french maid"" outfits, bee tee dubs).
My only complaint is that they were completely out of their famed hot chocolate!  Oh well, guess I'll just have to make my way back.",1
3,"It was a really quirky dinner and great waiting staff. Great food, not as pretentious as expected but definitely on the pricier side - but was a special occasion so glad that we did try it out. May not make it a regular visit though - too many other quirky places to go in London!",-1
4,"I give this quirky spot 4 stars for atmosphere and friendly service. It is almost impossible to describe what Sketch looks like. You must go and see it for yourself. And don't miss the bizarre, but fun bathrooms. That said, this was the most expensive drink I have ever had. Wayyyyy overpriced.",1
1,"If I could pick zero stars, I would. We came to London for 5 days for Christmas and picked sketch for our last night as it was so highly recommended. We were highly disappointed with our experience. We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived on time and were seated right away with barely a greeting or a smile. The waitress hastily dropped our menus and walked away. When she came back to take our drink order she was visibly annoyed when my sister and I (we were with our mother) requested sparkling water and no cocktails (my mom ordered a martini). It was clear that from this point forward we were an afterthought as we were not a high ""money making/bill running"" table (since we were not planning to drink.) As she kindly described the menu and specials to other tables around us as they sipped their cocktails, we were simply asked if we were ready. We ordered at 9:40 after being asking twice and our meal was delivered by 9:50. It was clear our table was being rushed out the door to turn us over quickly. we felt very upset as this was our last night and we wanted an experience and not to be rushed in and out. My mother asked to speak with a manager and he was so arrogant and rude that it was inexplicable. the customer is never right at sketch!!! he gave her a great deal of attitude when she explained she felt upset. The whole staff was pretentious and rude  and this restaurant is HIGHLY OVERRATED. Not worth it, an awful experience and highly overpriced with a disrespectful staff to match. Besides the awful service, the food was nothing to write home about either.
Don't waste your time or money!",-1
5,"CRAZY AMAZING place !!!!
Everybody should go there at least one time !!!
The better time is from 17:30 to 18:30 like that you can visit the 2 different toilets and all the crazy rooms. Ask for information about the design and decors.
The waiters are very nice and happy to tell the story of each room :)
Oh and the tea and food is just PERFECT :)",1
3,"Sketch is an interesting place with a bizarre layout and atmosphere which makes for an intriguing visit. 
In the evenings it becomes a lively bar. I'm sure the atmosphere is different during the afternoon. 
The few evenings which I've been the music has been good with lots of space, seating and tables in the main room.  
We enjoyed spending time in the small intimate room at the back of the bar which almost feels as if you're inside a padded space capsule.
A quick visit to the bathrooms upstairs and you will find bathroom pods which resemble something out of a James Cameron film. Well that is until you spot the scantily dressed French maids cleaning round the pods :)
Trying to get bar service at Sketch always proves very difficult for us and other patrons. The wait time seems obscene no matter which room you go to or what you are ordering.
All in all it's worth the visit because of it being totally weird!",-1
4,"I went for a drink in the afternoon, friendly staff and amazing decoration! You gotta save some pee to see the egg-shaped toilets!",1

tldr: the avocolado is amazing, and well worth the 7 or 8 quid.",1

4,"The place is cool; the ambiance more hip than we could ever be; and the food is very good but not great. We had the shrimp, the veal and a couple of appetizers.  All were good but they were not as interesting or as memorable as the room and the place settings.
So, no five stars but definitely worth a trip.",1
5,"We enjoyed afternoon tea here at the parlour room. Very hip, out of this world, chic, & artsy. loved it there! Conveniently located by oxford street...what a great way to unwind & relax after an afternoon of shopping. We had the ""cream tea"" which consisted of fresh fruit scones served with jam & clotted cream & your choice of teas. They brought out an individual tea set & tray for each of us, super cute. and we enjoyed free wi-fi as well! the bathrooms were way cool. wish i had the opportunity to check out the different sections of the restaurant...definitely will be back here if i'm back in london!",1
5,"Lasting impressions of Sketch (I merely came here for a quick snack) - awesome hot chocolate, the most beautiful restrooms I have ever seen (probably the only times i would stop to take a picture in the restroom), and one of the most glamorous/hipster places in London.",1
3,"I feel late in jumping on the Sketch bandwagon, because like, everyone I know who does food/restaurants in London has already been here, but I recently came for lunch in the parlour with a friend before he moved. I convinced him to come because ""you can't leave London without eating at Sketch,"" and based on my previous suggestions for our meals out, he was interested.
First impressions were good--the host was very nice and realized who I was despite my lost looking-ness, and directed me by name to my friend. That's the kind of thing you want to stick in people's minds.
The parlour itself is beautiful, like a funky dream place from Alice and Wonderland. Filled with interesting things to look at, we tucked into a table near the window and enjoyed the sun while we waited for our orders to be taken.
Here's the tough part: we waited.
At a place like Sketch, especially for lunch on a Thursday where the parlour is maybe 1/3 full, waiting shouldn't be part of the equation. Much less should we have had to flag down service each time we wanted something.
We ordered the burger, chips, and the macaroni cheese. I was pleased with my mac-cheese, but my friend was disappointed in the size of his burger. As a guy, I understand, because it was nowhere near enough to fill a person, much less for the prices we were paying. I especially dislike letting down people with my recommendations, which is another strike in my mind.
The decoration is of course cool--I had the chance to walk through and look at the other dining rooms on the way to the coolest bathroom in London (though I do have an issue with the idea of having such an obviously hip, gender-neutral bathroom color coded in pink and blue... stereotyping much?? What about individuals who don't identify as ""blue"" or ""pink""?). It seems like a nice place for a really great experience, at a really high price. I will probably be back to see the dining rooms in action one night... but it's only for the visual experience, not the eating or customer service.",-1
3,"When you go to Sketch, you're going for the ""complete dining experience"". And I'll admit, it's fun and interesting. The gallery is hilarious, the maid costumes quirky and the bathrooms are amazing. That being said, the food is average, bordering on bad. I had the risotto, and I know, don't order risotto, but I thought I'd give it a test. Horrible choice. The rice was actually just hard. I'd expect with the price tag, we could at least get this right....",-1
4,"wow, sketch, way to be out of this world.  the first room, big fairly quaint...we ordered a melbec...not good.  This place is a members only...which means pay your dues or know someone....lucky me, i knew someone.  This place is like a weird time warp plus art gallery...think allison wonderland weird tea party with an andy warhole exhibit...noting that neither of these has anything to do with sketch.  
The two rooms towards the back, interesting and different.  Looks like they took some painting from a midsummers night dreams, enlarged it and threw it on the wall.  The other room turns into a weird seventies v-neck sweater vest pattern...and the very back bar...looks like some star trec weird modern bar....which serves amazing cocktails...order the herman something...good dj, though no one was dancing.  London? Do you hate dancing?  WTF?? The bathrooms are located above the star trec submarine, and they are eggy like latrines...seriously its bizarre.  That, in fact, is the most relevant thing i've typed.  Sketch is bizarre and yet sort of cool.  The kind of place you want to know about so you can tell your friends, but maybe not go yourself...again...",1
5,Amazing food and it's work a visit even if for the toilets! The first time I went I was amazed how cool they looked like ;),1
1,This place might have the rudest bouncer in the world. A noteworthy accomplishment!,-1
3,"Reading the great reviews I feel like I visited a different place! The ambiance is certainly interesting, unique and an experience. The service is excellent. Everyone is really great, very attentive, helpful, kind - I cannot fault it anywhere. The only thing I would suggest is perhaps follow the good reviews on here and go for afternoon tea. We went for dinner and left unimpressed, which is a real shame. The starters were good but the main dish (we both got the same - chicken fricassee) was bland and flavorless. It was as if the chicken was boiled. Perhaps the other dishes are better. As for desserts, 1 was really great (praline/hazelnut one) while the Sketch chocolate dessert left much to be desired. Perhaps it comes down to choice -and if you make better choices the experience will be far more enjoyable.",-1
5,"Sketch London - We were in London wandering around Oxford Circus and Regent Street looking for a French Restaurant and we find this place by chance. And I am very glad we did. As mentioned in other reviews, this is a building with several functions. We went to the Lecture Room upstairs. This is an upscale French cuisine, with a special ambience with lots of details to call your attention, starting from the doorman.  The building is the former Chanel House, we were told, and captures all the glamour of London and the old buildings around the area.  And more.
Service is amazing starting at the front door and as you goes upstair enter it gives you already a sense that it will be a special evening. The menu isn't extensive but it is interesting enough to call your attention. However, when food comes and you taste it you realize that is above all expectations, simply delicious.... I had the duck, which came with the best fois- gras that I had in my life. My husband had the lamb, equally outstanding. We did not asked for starters, but they surprised us with small bites of heaven.  The experience was repeated for dessert. We should have taken photos of the food, but we missed it.  It will be one more reason to come back. And we definitively will, whenever we are in London. Hopefully,  we will come back soon to take our  daughter there, she will love it as well.  I guess this will be a enw London favorite!",1
4,"One of my favorite things to do is googling ""quirky London resaturants"", and I've found that Sketch consistently shows up in the results. This place is adorable with its eclectic but perfectly appropriate decor.
I've only been to the Parlour- it is still quite expensive even though the food and drinks are delightful.  £7.50 Tzatziki was not your run of the mill dip, but enhanced with green curry,  £16 burger came with a red cabbage and xeres jelly that we kept dipping our fries into.  Drinks will definitely make a dent in your wallet with its £10+ prices but they are amazingly refreshing and made with top notch liquor.  Try the Kick the Ketel and Let's Talk about Passion.  Their nonalcoholic drinks, the juices and tea, are very fresh as well and worth trying.
During the day it feels like the sitting room of a crazy grandma who has been hoarding bizarre relics and haphazardly displaying them in their full awkward glory.  Parlour at nighttime though- grandma's taken out her fur, cigarette, and heels, and she's ready to mingle.",1
5,"Great food, great art, great ambiance. Really handsome boys who eat french fries with forks (:",1
5,"If I were to sum up sketch, it would be a constant surprise.
Between the marelle drawn on the floor at the entrance, the fairy forest bar, the delicious cocktails, the nearly alice-in-wonderland main dining room and the borderline clockwork-orange-lookalike egg-shaped toilets well sketch simply does not stop surprising you.
All I had was a delicious cocktail. I cannot wait to go again and have dinner, another cocktail, and generally spend more time in the slightly surreal, oddly juxtaposed, mildly psychedelic and indubitably francophone environment. Et c'est reparti!",1
5,"Came here for afternoon tea. £40 a head (plus 12.5% service charge) but in my opinion worth every penny.  Really tasty sandwiches, LOTS of sweet stuff, and refills if you wish. Come here at 3pm and you won't have/want to eat again all day.  The decor is sublime (the parlour room is pink and decorated in lots of David Shirley drawings; the toilets are like something in a UFO) and the whole thing is just great fun. Staff were fine and attentive.",1
4,"this is quite a restaurant.  i think you come here more for the experience rather than the food.  we started in the bar on the right and had a few cocktails.  the cocktails here are delicious if not a bit pricey.
we had dinner in the gallery, and the room is amazing.  it's kind of hard to come on a quiet date, b/c there is music playing, but if you're in the mood for fun and a more ruckus time, then it's fine.  i started off w/ a salad w/ beets, avocados and some greens and split that w/ my friend's lobster bisque.  for my entree, i had the halibut and split that w/ the sea bream.  everything was tasty but none of the food was blow-me-away fabulous.  for dessert, we got the le citron and the chocolate gateau, and both were very good.
i'm not into place which make you pay for bread, even if it does come in a lego box.  it's bread, for christ's sake.  
the best part of the restaurant is the decor, and of course, the toilets.  going to the bathroom in an egg pod definitely made for an experience.",1
5,Beautiful cakes in a beautiful place. Worth the expense. Different rooms take you to different worlds. Witty artworks set the scene.,1
2,"After a very enjoyable 2 courses our meal was brought to a very abrupt and disappointing end. Immediately after the removal of our main course dishes we were informed (fairly rudely) that we had reached the 2 hour limit allotted to us and we had to depart as soon as possible without dessert. We asked if we could have dessert in another room as it is a very large, cavernous space, and were told there would be some tables opening up soon next door but we must pay for our meal so far before leaving the table. We attempted to enter the bar next door for dessert but discovered that the menu would not be the same. For such an expensive restaurant it was very disappointing to be shown this level of service after what would have been a very enjoyable meal. The food was very good and the service had been more than adequate until this point.",-1
5,"I took my friend for a birthday dinner and when asked by staff how she enjoyed the overall experience, she replied ""I feel that I have been made love to without even being touched!"" That sums up the evening. We experienced the vegetarian tasting menu which was a proper introduction to the chef's talents. It's a rarity to find an all vegetarian menu in a 2 Michelin Star environment, which indeed delivered. The portions were very generous and left one to be well satiated. The presentation of each course was lovely. The wait staff were stealth ninjas, always anticipating, very attentive, impeccably dressed and soft on the eyes. This was my 2nd time and I look forward to the next dining experience at Sketch!",1
5,"In my books, sketch is in the elite when it comes to tea rooms. With its unique design interior and traditional afternoon tea, this venue is a must see. I have been quite a few times now for lunch and afternoon tea, and i must say each time i visit i am extremely pleased with the overall service.
 It's extreme attention to detail at sketch. Make sure you check out the toilets!! 
The Jasmine green tea is to die for as well.",1
5,"Great place for afternoon tea or a drink, it's definitely a change from your more traditional bar or restaurant.
I went there for a cream tea and was agreeably surprised by the many choices of teas. The scones were served warm and with two different jams. Service was a bit slow but very nice.
I also tried the cocktails in another room. They are a bit pricey but good, and the decor is worth it.
If you go there, don't forget to visit the restroom! It's a must-see!",1
5,"THIS IS MY NUMBER ONE PLACE FOR AFTERNOON TEA! 
I had ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS wanted to go for Afternoon Tea here. I knew it would be fantastical and it did not disappoint one bit! I knew if I wanted the Afternoon Tea on a Saturday I'd have to book, originally I was going to call just to enquire. I called up and the gentleman (because he was ever so polite, so I'm not gonna call him a 'dude') asked me what I was booking for. I mentioned it was a surprise for my friends birthday. So he said rather than just booking for the Parlour he'd reserve me a table at the Glade, which he said would be 'nicer'.
On arrival there was quite a queue, but thankfully got to bypass it all to be taken to our table. Coming from a Theatre Design background I was in complete awe of my surroundings. The quirky sculptures we passed on our way to the Glade. Totally geeked out over how visually stimulating it was. If you've visited their website and loved the quirk, the place itself will not disappoint. 
On to the good stuff. Everything that comes with the afternoon tea looks exquisite and tastes absolutely incredible. THE BEST AFTERNOON TEA EVER. Every single thing that I ate was pretty much orgasmic. YEAP. THAT GOOD. This is fine dining at its best. I can't say any more than it was the best, the best, the best. 
N.B: I've kept this short (for me) because I cannot recommend it anymore, other than saying if you don't try it I may have to slap you with a giant wet fish!",1
3,"London's better clubs are private. You either need to be a member or have your hotel concierge get you on ""the list"". Sketch is just one of those clubs. 
There are three bar areas- one in the front, the pod, space like one in the back and the other one that is hard to explain but that we spent the most time in. The walls are red with laser lights shining on them and crystal sparkles dotting the walls. There is a huge branch like decoration hanging from the ceiling and small tables scattered about. It was almost garish when we walked in but got better when the lights were dimmed a bit.
The drinks are not for the ""faint of wallet"". Their speciality cocktail list starts at 13 pounds per drink and have names so odd I cannot remember one but are interesting concoctions. At the end of the day- I still prefer my old stand bys.
Service was almost nonexistent for a private club- they easily could have served us three drinks in the span of time that we were there yet we only were able to get one. And all of our glasses were empty for quite some time. 
The dining room in the back doesn't open until 9 but it's almost impossible to get a reservation there as the members have it all booked up.  I wish I had made it to the restrooms reading these other reviews (and the manager told us about them the second we walked in) but we were running short on time.
Take a gander at some of the wild art that they have around this place. The copulating greyhounds statue (so much detail) and the technology tree (all sorts of gadgets) come to mind as two things you won't miss if you walk in the place. 
All in all- a bit much for me but given the crowd there on the night we were there . .it seems to have a loyal following.",-1
2,"I was invited to a set dinner at Sketch about a month ago through work. Having wanted to sample the menu for quite some time you can only imagine my excitement when my colleague rung me to say there had been a last min cancellation and a spare chair for me. However all I can say is I'm glad that I wasn't footing the bill. Whilst service is wonderful, and the egg shaped loos never grow old; the food was terribly disappointing. 
A tomato salad with a jelly balsamic, jelly with salad... really? It didn't work and I think the chef was just trying to be too fancy. Why not slosh some good quality balsamic onto those quality tomatoes and let the natural flavour shine through... hmmm.
My second course was halibut, delicious cut of fish cooked perfectly- but with potato foam?!? Why foam when you could just have it with some great tasting Charlotte potatoes? 
An experience but certainly not one I'll be going back for... overpriced, over fancy, not my thang.",-1
5,"Sketch is amazing. From the moment you enter..hopskotch awaits you..you gotta do it..it be rude not to..to the egg shaped toilets..I don't know who designed tthis place but its utterly beautiful. The cocktail guy aaked what I wanted so I said just make us a crazy cocktail..it came in a teapot! Sooo cute , like something out of alice and wonderland. In fact, that could summarize the whole place. Alice in Wonderland.",1
5,"I came here with my boyfriend  for my month long birthday celebration and boy were we impressed!!! The food was spectacular !!!The ambience , the food, the service, and the bathroom was stunning. Will be back!",1
4,"i love Sketch.
i fell in love with the quirky decor.
loved the pod style bathrooms.
bread ""basket"" was a basket made of legos. :)
food was just okay. 
ambiance was wonderful.
service was impeccable.
hip. modern. trendy. pricey.",1
4,Fantastic for high tea !! Visionary stunning and the food is pretty great too.. Must try people!!,1
5,This place is amazing. The food is spot on and so is the decor. I got the vegetarian curry appetizer twice in a sitting it was so good and my bf did the same with the scalloped carpacio. i would suggest you Go to the bathroom...they're eggs. The lounge area was deemed 'worlds smallest nightclub' and is a circular dome with a couch along the entire outer wAll. I'd go back in a heart beat.,1
5,Great little place for a drink is the sunken bar. The bathrooms cool too with the egg design. Defiantly a must visit when in London.,1
4,"I came here for some late night drinks with while visiting London last week. I felt like I was on a spaceship and I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Regardless of the strange decor though, I have to give this place at least 4 stars for the cocktails. AMAZING. The rosemary martini was probably the best drink I've had in my life (and I've had a lot of drinks...). They have a pretty extensive list and everything we tried was delicious. The drinks were surprisingly even worth the 13 pounds that they cost.
The bathrooms are absolutely bizarre. You walk upstairs to a group of egg-shaped pods. Each ""pod"" played different music and/or sounds. One of my friends said that her bathroom had barn animal noises. Points for originality?",1
2,"Pricey pretentious food, gaudy decor and ridiculous egg pod toilets. I would not visit this place again. There are lots of nice restaurants to blow your money on of you want fancy dining but Sketch is definitely not one of them.",-1
5,I had a nice little birthday party here!  This is a little gem in London...a fantastic spot for tea and scones.  I love the artwork and the little rooms filled with surprise.  The servers had great outfits/costume and the place really took you to a fantasy world.  I loved the music!  My friends and family had such a great time.  Truly a remarkable place and a memorable night!,1
2,"This restaurant was wack. Multiple rooms felt more like an upmarket version of Oceana than a trendy restaurant?! The food was AWFUL. Tasted like microwave quality to me but with exceptionally high price tags. Large wine menu, and I will admit the wine I chose was very nice. Staff were attentive and the crowd was hip. Go here for the ambiance and wacky set up rather than the actual food. As a foodie I won't be returning.",-1
3,"We brought some friends who were visiting London for the first time, had brunch in The Parlour before shopping on Regent St.  The service was very average and they were no help explaining the menu.  However, we all were happy with what we ordered (omelette, quiche, croque monsieur, club).  The food was quite yummy, but we wished we'd known that the portions were sort-of bite-sized (especially for two tall men).  That being said, exploring the other rooms of Sketch was actually the best part, especially the toilets.  The decor is so intriguing, I hope to one day try out dinner in The Gallery as I think it'd be much more enjoyable!",-1
4,Totally unique - food and service are exceptional but it's the decor and ambiance that make the difference. U have to go at least once,1
3,"I love writing reviews, but there are times where I really don't want to write the review because I really want things to be better than they were. Sketch is one of those places.
Four of us went here to dine in the Lecture Room (Nava, Andrew, me and my other half). I was really excited. Nava had a £50 promotional code! My parents got my other half a £100 gift voucher! I was ready to have some fun and a good meal.
Unfortunately, several things went majorly wrong. It started out okay. We met in the Parlour room for drinks. The drinks were nice, if not a bit strange. They took us upstairs to the lounge in the Lecture room to wait for our drinks. My rosemary martini tasted nothing like rosemary nor a martini. Reading the ingredients, it was expected, but still, rosemary would be nice. The other half wanted another cocktail, so the waiter brought him the cocktail menu (for the Lecture Room). There weren't many and they were way too expensive. It was close to £50 for an old fashioned, and while it was with really rare bourbon, it seemed a bit too expensive. So the other half asked if he could order a drink from downstairs. He was told no. He was told he could go downstairs and get one, but they wouldn't make one upstairs nor bring it up for him. (Annoying). He went downstairs. The maitre d' saw him going downstairs. He was with other people, but eventually caught up and told him that they would take the drink to him upstairs. And they comped him because he should never have been told to go downstairs and get it. The comp was nice, but it was annoying he had to go down and ask for it in the first place.
At the table, we were told we couldn't use both the voucher and the promo code. Which made no sense. A voucher is money they already have. It's not like we were trying to use 3 promo codes or anything. Nava agreed that we could use ours. My other half had to talk to them at the end of the meal. The manager agreed that we could use both, obviously, but the fact we had to actually discuss it with them was annoying. (The trend here is annoying, in case you haven't noticed.)
The food was actually pretty good. Most of it. However, they left the plastic backing on part of my food, which I had to eat around. Really two-Michelin star restaurant? Plastic? I also had a bone or plastic in my fish as well. Two courses in a row? It's annoying (and puzzling). The chicken curry was fantastic. They really enjoy giving you two or three dishes at once. (Or in the case of dessert, SIX. Yes we had six different tiny plates surrounding each of us. My other half was overwhelmed and felt rushed to eat it because it was all there at once.) And they liked to whisk the plates away at random times. I'm used to dining in the UK where they take plates away all at once, but the constant whisking away of plates was a bit unnerving. The hot chocolate was good, very good. Not the best I've ever had to be honest. Given that good chocolate is fairly new to the UK, I can understand why people would think it's the best. I'd have it again to be sure, but I've had far better in the States. The seaweed butter was to die for though. I've never had it, and I kind of fell in love with it. We ran out early, and had to ask for more. Irritatingly. We were almost out of butter and they kept bringing us bread. It's not hard to notice that more butter was required.
The wine. It was really good. So good we do what we often do and see if we can find it to have at home (because wine at home is usually about half the price. There's a markup, I get it, I don't mind paying double for a bottle when you're at a restaurant). We couldn't find it anywhere in the UK, but they were about €15 a bottle on the mainland. Now I'm pretty good at math, but you don't really need to be great to figure out prices. I know it's more expensive for booze in the UK (thank you taxes), so €15 a bottle equates to about £25-30 a bottle in shops in the UK. Now double that, it's pretty standard at a restaurant. That's about £50-60 a bottle if you're out. Now these wines were about £75-90 a bottle. That's a triple markup. I shouldn't be surprised since they were selling glasses of Balfour sparkling wine for £30 a glass. I can get it at home for about £40 a bottle. Do the math. Six times £40 is £240 pounds. That's way more than a triple markup. Triple markups are a bit too much for my liking.
The decor is pretty fab though. All the rooms are decorated differently and you can tell they spent a lot of work making it look the way it does. The big cushy seats in the Lecture room were also great for eating dinner in!
So overall, I had a good time, the food was good. The service needed a lot of work (so very surprised with the two-Michelin star rating). It seemed the servers needed a lot more training to understand what Michelin star service should entail. I'm probably not going back when there are lots of other places to try and since I wasn't wowed by my experience, I'll be moving on.",-1
5,"I've been dying to go to this place for ages, mainly for the bathrooms that everyone keeps raving about. What finally got me here was it being the 1st stop of the Mayfair chocolate tour as Sketch is reputed to have the best hot chocolate in London.
Verdict? Yep definitely some of the best hot chocolate I've ever had, and by far the best in London. It's rich, creamy, full of deep chocolate flavour, but light enough not to weigh you down. It comes in posh porcelain tea cups which is a little odd as I consider hot chocolate best served in a mug with little marshmellows but then again that's usually when made at home or around a fire.
The bathrooms are just hilarious, and fittingly odd for the place. To put into context, you first walk up a short flight of stairs and in front of you is a beam of light which changes colour periodically. Cool but nothing special until you turn your head away from it and a word flashes out at you from the corner of your eye. It's almost as if you are seeing things but it is just a strange optical illusion definitely sets the scene. 
The sculputures around the restaurant, cafe, and club areas are a bit disturbing and what I imagine the artwork of Chucky to be like. My favourity was the slim female figure in an almost Thinker pose with a big afro. Which wouldn't be that unusual until you realise that the ""afro"" is made up of hundreds of syringes stuck needle first into the head of the figure.
There is a Michelin starred restaurant above (didn't make it there, but planning on it soon!) and a large open room that you can easily see being a dance floor at night. The room is ringed with projectors that can cover all four walls with pictures and movies although in this dark open space with white couches, the only playing was a indie art flick that I could only describe as the lovechild of the Ring and The Twilight Zone. Needless to say I didn't linger in this room and rushed to the bathrooms just next door. 
The bathroom area is actually above a sunken spherical bar and boys go left while girls go right but a curving white staircase. In contrast to the room of horrors of a club, this is pure dazzling white. You pick an egg, cocoon yourself in side, and go about your business. Oh and don't be scared if you hear voices...everyone does.
Overall, loved the unique atmosphere that Sketch delivers and just walking around is a rush. Tracy L and I have decided it's a must for a night clubbing and then perhaps a posh dinner.",1
3,"Giant pod-shaped bathrooms!  
Definitely the classiest pee I've ever had.  Ascending the pure white staircase up into the foggy nest of space pods was quite surreal.   Each pod is quite roomy with it's own separate toilet inside and a small mirror for primping as well.   I've never been so amazed with a toilet in my life.  The pods are like big fancy port-o-potties in a sense, though much cleaner and you don't feel like the whole thing could topple over.  After exiting the pod when your business is complete, there are maids standing around to offer any assistance you need.  Now that is service!
I was only here for my office Christmas party, so I can't say that I've truly experienced Sketch in all its glory.  But, it is definitely cool.  Whilst wandering around I found Buzz Lightyear atop a sculpture of toys and trash, a statue of two dogs getting it on and lots of sparklies and flair.   Bizzare, yet awesome.",-1
4,"Let's just say - I take everyone who's visiting to Sketch.
This place is so quintessentially London!
The best decor I've ever seen anywhere, quite frankly.
I usually go for drinks, I'm a big cocktail person, but their's fall a bit short somehow. Same goes with food - nothing I tasted blew my mind.
But it's just such a wonderful place, the service is great too, that I just keep on coming back.",1
4,"Review is for the bar areas only:
Great space and ambience! Very unique. Check out the toilet. Drinks on the menu are delicious and interesting (on the fruity side).",1
5,"We stumbled upon this restaurant one afternoon while visiting London a few months back. There was a 30 minute wait for afternoon tea, so we decided to keep moving, and possibly comeback for dinner. 
We called later that night to make a reservation for dinner, but they were closed for a private event, and we proceeded to make plans for lunch the next day. When we arrived the following day for lunch, we were seated in the Parlour until our table was ready, and the staff was ready to assist. We were greeted by the maitre d' who told us that the chef would be ready shortly, and then gave us a tour of Sketch, and the history of the establishment. He led us upstairs into the Lecture Room and Library where our table awaited with a full-on french staff ready to assist. 
I was given a stool for my purse, and the napkins were placed in each of our laps. In the background you can hear music playing. Very similar to a finger piano, which has an almost eerie sound. We both went with the fixed lunch menu, which was three courses, plus palette cleansers, and after dinner espresso with chocolates. Overall the presentation was breath taking, and every dish was very creative.  
The service was impeccable! Our pretty french waitress was on point the entire meal. She wiped every crumb from the table, and instructed us on proper consumption of the more bizarre artistic entrees. For example: when I thought I was supposed to eat some sand at the beginning of the meal that was holding thin crackers. She informed me that I should not be eating it, awesome lol... I'd also like to brag about their cheese plate selection, it was the finest I have ever seen at a restaurant. After lunch, we were allowed to explore the art studios in the back where different events are held each night. We then ventured upstairs to some crazy futuristic white bathroom pods that speak to you. This place left a lasting impression on us and what a cool city London is. We highly recommend Sketch to tourists looking for a hip place to eat lunch, dinner and afternoon tea.",1
4,"Sketch is a must for visitors and London locals alike. You're going for the atmosphere and people-watching more than the food, although that part is definitely unique.
LOVES:
- Service - very attentive and charming!
- Stool for my purse!
- Complimentary glasses of champagne to compensate for a short wait
- Black and white (silent) theater on the walls & unique art
- Coolest bathrooms ever
There is so much to look at that it is hard to focus on the food, but here are some of the highlights:
- Scallops appetizer
- Lobster and rib eye mains
- Chocolate cake (yum!)
There was a lot of mousse / foam in the dishes (3/4 of the dishes had some sort of foam-related covering), which I'm not against, but it seemed a bit overdone.
Dessert was delicious - and I might come back here only for that and cocktails / champagne next time!
Don't forget to dress the part for this place. A unique outfit is a must because like you, everyone else is looking around :)",1
5,"This was a really fun and funky Afternoon Tea.  I had a few surprise visitors from home (NYC) and I wanted to make sure they didn't leave London without having afternoon tea.  I also didn't want a boring traditional afternoon tea either.  I've done the traditional swanky afternoon tea at the Ritz and I did enjoy it but its some place I'd take my mom.  This place was just what the doctor ordered. The main comment I got from my friends is that they felt like they were in Alice In Wonderland (good thing the Mad Hatter's Tea at the Sanderson was booked up).  As soon as I got there there was a doorman with tophat and I got a little nervous because of my attire (its summer and I had ""stylish"" flipflops on) but I trucked on in anyway.  My friends were waiting from me and I was immediately pleasantly surprised by my surroundings.  I passed the cafe - for the sorry sods that weren't smart enough to book - and walked into can only described as a tea room in a red forest.  the lighting was soft red and I passed some truly artistic trays of edible art.  Our party each decided to have the Afternoon Tea £25 but I decided on the champagne tea which came with 1 glass of champagne (Pommery Ampanage) along with unlimited tea at £46.  I don't think that is particularly worth it but the presentation of the glass of champagne was definitely something to see.  We all chose different teas so we could sample each others. Mine was jasmine, but the ladies ordered berry hibiscus, vanilla, and rose hip tea.  I liked all but the rose tea.  Now for the sweet and savoury goodies... WONDERFUL. Anyone who thinks they won't be full is terribly misguided.  We had servings for 5 people and we left with 2 beautiful takeaway boxes because we couldn't finish it all.  The Assorted finger sandwiches were smoked salmon and Jacob's cream cucumber, ricotta and asparagus, MY FAVORITE mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur, and egg and mayonnaise, quail egg, caviar were seriously tasty and is NOT your everyday egg salad sandwich.  It also came with 5 warm and buttery Sultana scones
served with clotted cream, bitter orange and strawberry jam. All the jams and creams were so fresh I didn't care that I felt the pounds literally developing as I ate.  And finally, the edible are which were the sweets selection of pistachio macaroons, almond and berry tartlet,coffee éclair.  We ate our strawberry cheesecake in a glass because we knew we couldn't take it with us. The only thing I didn't like and its only because I am not a big marshmallow fan was the mousse malabar marshmallows which tasted like spongy chalk but again... I am NOT a fan of marshmallows and other people will probably love them. There were other sweets but honestly I can't remember the names and here's a warning: these pastries are meant to be eaten THE DAY YOU GET THEM.  Not that you'd be able to resist but as I said we were so full we had to go boxes and after tea went shopping, by the time I got home my macaroons lost their air so they shrunk and of course wasn't as pretty but just as tasty.  Our waitress was super sweet and I only have to say you have to SEE the restroom in order to believe it. The bathroom mirrors are just a small part (they say: You're beautiful and remember I'm a mirror so I can't tell a lie) of how awesome the bathroom is.I am going back there again and again again and I highly recommend.",1
4,"Coolest loo in all of London!  
This place is just dripping with coolness.  Sleek, stylish, quirky, modern art-filled interior. A bit pretentious, but that's part of the thrill, I suppose. It's less of a restaurant and more of an experience. To be honest, I can barely even remember what I had to eat. 
Oh, and the loo. It's quite surreal. In case you haven't heard yet, there's a large room with a bunch of white pods... women's on one side, men's on the other. After using the appropriate pod, and attendant helps wash and dry your posh pod hands.",1
4,"Sketch is Famous French chef Pierre Gagnaire's signature restaurant in London. It actually consists for three different restaurants: Gallery, The Lecture Room and Parlour. Parlour is the more relaxed option while The Lecture Room features a tasting menu. I had the chance to eat at Gallery which is their ""middle ground"" option last weekend. Although the food didn't live up to my high expectations, I absolutely loved the experience. I had the ""Pollock"" for starters and then the scallops with truffles.  Both were good but not that original in my opinion.
""Le Citron"" dessert was excellent. And so was the Bollinger red wine selected by their high-skilled Sommelier.
All in all, it was a fantastic experience for the food was good but, most importantly, service was absolutely spectacular which is a rarity when the staff is mostly French. Sketch, indeed, seems to be the exception that proves the rule in that regard. In addition, the decor of this place is just worth going there just to check it out.",1
5,"Sketch strikes me as a really ""London"" experience. As a Canadian, I see London (and Londoners) as quirky, unique, and a little brash underneath the demure exterior. That's what Sketch is like. It's like Alice in Wonderland here, with chipped gold-plated cups, a trail of false blood leading you to the washrooms, and waitresses wearing brocade jackets and converse sneakers. 
I've had tea and lunch here, and it has been totally lovely. Service is a little uneven, and they get busy on weekends, but it's worth it. Cream tea is only ten quid, and the scones are delish. Oh, and after your meal be sure to make your way down the stairs from the main tea room to the cavernous washrooms with their blindingly white pod-like toilets. A very cool photo op indeed.",1
4,"What hot spot in London would you take your weekend guests for
a lasting memory? At Sketch - as one of the rare exceptions in
London - a club membership is not needed for having a good
night out. Even first timers can expect to be greeted warmly
several times over by the receptionist - the front desk - the
wine waiter and the table staff. Sketch is placed in Mayfair at
Number 9 Conduit Street, formerly the house of Dior. For Friday
and Saturday it is highly recommended to reserve a table a week
in advance.
The Gallery, a white room with white padded sofas and ornate
chairs, is one of various eating-places: there is also the
cheaper Glade, the (much) more expensive Lecture Room and Café
Parlour. Being ushered into the gallery one is surrounded by a
multinational crowd (wearing avant-garde black) dining while
still art is projected onto the walls above. The new trend of
visual jockying (VJing) goes beyond just the eating experience.
Even though Sketch presents their cuisine as French, it has
more than a few international influences. Matching Sketch's
concept, - the food is aesthetically pleasing and the flavours
are exotic. You eat with your eyes and the small dishes are
arranged decoratively. But if Chef Pierre Gagnaires's dishes
are modest in size they are not in price.
Imagine enjoying a fantastic dinner while the DJ puts up his
electro beats louder, chairs and tables are taken away and
finding yourself in the middle of a dance floor. You would be
surprised what interesting conversations and contacts can be
made over a Diamond Martini from the adjacent igloo formed bar.
In there you hear the echo of voices and music. If the toilets
get the main part of discussion, there is something wrong with
the restaurant, but an exception has to be made: Have you ever
stepped into an egg shaped space ship before? They are beyond
this world (literally).
The Michelin Star reflects the high concept dining; it goes
into an extravagant overdrive combining art, fashion, style and
glamour. The gallery has forthcoming exhibitions. This November
there is a gallery opening showing the exhibition of Patrick
Jolley and Oswaldo Marcia. For more information see the
references below. Finally, let me share a secret: on your way
out, draw your attention to a piece of UV light art. While
shaking the head and looking at it the words love appear - What
other surprises are waiting tonight?",1
5,"Five stars for the experience. 
Drinks were good, pricey as expected. It's worth the money for a walk through and a look at the people and interior. As mentioned, the toilets are cool as hell.  Hung out in the East Bar and it's a very compelling space and the sunken bar is one of the many oddities throughout the place.",1
4,"Go for the atmosphere, not the food!
If you're in London, a visit to Sketch is a must.  From the moment we arrived, we were surrounded by bizarre things - all of which added to an excellent ambiance.  From the pod-shaped bathrooms to the computer graphics on the interior walls, it all culminated into a visual ecstasy that was extremely entertaining.
In terms of the food, we enjoyed the extensive cocktail menu and wine list.  The sommelier was very helpful in choosing a wine that paired with our food selection.  We had the lobster bisque as a starter, the venison for our main, and the chocolate cake for 2 for our dessert.  The lobster bisque was very well done with the rice, lobster and bisque all being mixed in front of us.  The venison dish was only okay.  By the time dessert had arrived, I had forgotten what I had as my main.  The main was not worth the value, but given the ambiance and quality of the other dishes - it was alright.  The chocolate cake was more of a tart, but delicious.  It was paired with a small scoop of vanilla/hazlenut ice cream which was amazing.
All in all, if you're a foodie - this place is probably not for you.  If you're a London guest, or entertaining a guest in London, this is a great place for an exciting evening with a relaxed atmosphere for catching up.
Tip:  Be on time.  They hold you to a strict allocation of 2 hours.  They loose a bit in my book for this policy.",1
4,This is quite the funky spot to go!  We had tea and sandwiches. Only hung out for awhile but loved the egg shaped bathrooms and the whimsical atmosphere. Check it out!!,1
4,The orange duck was great and the deserts were some of the best I've had. It was the bathrooms that really made this place though.,1
4,So good. Eclectic furniture and unique decor. Salad rocked and the sommolier was very attentive. Coming back.,1
5,"This is one place that's truly deserving of the term 'classy' and even as a seasoned, canape-fatigued journo type I have to admit to getting quite over-excited when I find out that an event is happening here.
The decor is gorgoues and really quite inspiring, and all food and drink I've ever been given here has been first rate.",1
3,"I think the restaurant, theme, decor and different rooms are excellent, however the Food it self was very much average. I tried the very hyped up Burger and to be honest much rather I was in GBK! The atmosphere and experience is the only thing this place has going for It.",-1
4,"Elegant, beautiful place, that offers a true taste of the French cuisine.
Great food, fabulous decor ,the staff are friendly and kind, really good atmosphere, and fairly reasonably priced.",1
5,"As someone who ""wines and dines"" my clients all over the world, I can state, without a doubt and without any bias that Sketch produced for me one of the best culinary and service experiences ... ever! This is not your standard grab a quick dinner establishment, but a highly sophisticated dining enlightenment that was truly savored over the course of almost 3 hours.  I have to pay a massive compliment to our host Sebastien, who really took us on a journey of some of the finest foods London has to offer.  Let me offer up an example of Sebastien's amazing attention to the guest as well as details.  We ordered the cheese course to start the evening (i was treating one of my best friends to a Birthday dinner), and the normal thought process would be that the restaurant brings out a cheese board with a variety of breads and spreadable flavors.  Sketch takes it to the stratosphere by rolling out 4 separate mobile cutting boards and presenting the diner with a cheese entourage from around the world.  We probably had over 40 different types of cheese to select from, and Sebastien took his time to review everyone of them. We took his suggestions (all of them) and he cut very generous pieces from each selection, and then suggested the order in which to appreciate them.  This in itself was over an hour, and the whole process was fascinating.  I cannot throw out enough positive adjectives regarding the entire dinner experience, as every course, including the artfully crafted desert, was stunning.  Now, here is where Sebastien and Sketch go over the top to secure themselves in my own personal Restaurant Hall of Fame.  Sebastien comes over to the table, asks us to put down our napkins, and follow him.  How do you not comply with this request? Sebastien walks us back to the kitchen to meet the head chef and the brigade... AWESOME!  I felt like we were walking the Hall of Honors, and the Chef could not have been more gracious to us.  How was the rest of the service? As outstanding as it could possibly be.  From the gentleman pouring the water, to the waiter who refilled the bread and to the management that checked on us, as well as gave us a tour of the entire complex, we felt like the red carpet was specially rolled out for a personal experience unlike any other.  I cannot wait until my next trip to the UK, and the number one stop on my list the next time, and every visit thereafter, will be Sketch London.",1
2,"The food was unimpressive (particularly relative to the price), most of the staff had snooty attitudes, and we felt pushed to leave on a timetable so they could get someone else in, even though there were lots of empty tables.  The decor was impressive though.",-1
5,"I've been there few times. The people, the streets, the lingo, the architecture. Everything seems so fresh and interesting.
 The place is mysterious, impossibly chic and you need to understand all the philosophy and the history",1
3,"I had afternoon tea here and I hate to say it, but I wasn't hugely impressed. As many of the reviews here rightly point out, the venue itself is amazing, and there's something extra special about turning off a busy Regent St and ducking into this charming maze of quirky grandiosity. But I digress. 
The afternoon tea itself was really delicious. I should disclose at this point that  gluten and I do not get along, so afternoon tea always requires a bit of compromise for me. However in the course of my fledgling love affair with this quintessentially English way to spend the pre-twilight hours, I have learned that the swisher establishments can usually cater accordingly. My lovely wife has no such handicap, so she was able to enjoy the full offering as the chef intended it, and it looked delicious - particularly the sweetish glazed smoked salmon buns. Not that I'm bitter. Really.
The first problem was our seating. We were in the parlour, which is where they accommodate the overflow from the front room. It's a nice room in itself - warm pinkish tones and pleasantly spacious, but we were tucked away into a corner behind the door and the effect wasn't so cosy. There were three staff in the area but they seemed to struggle with the demands of the room. 
The real problem was with the presentation of the food. They brought out each person's entire meal on a lovely looking cake stand. While this looked good, it didn't really work because the scones come out warm, as they should, but they're not the first course so by the time we got to them, they were cold.
My sandwiches were nice, but the gluten-free bread was nothing special. But the real disappointment for me was that when I asked for more, I was told that I would have to order off the menu. Now I've only eaten afternoon tea at two other places, but both times the extra sandwiches flowed freely. And at £27 per person, I reckon Sketch can afford to get a little more generous with their precious sarnies. 
The sweets were delicious, and so too was the tea. But we were hustled out after an hour and a half, when we could have done with an extra 20 minutes or so.
Basically it was good, but not great. There are a few too may buts that need to be addressed before they can be considered in the league of places like Claridge's, which definitely served the best afternoon tea that I've ever had. That said, Sketch is still worth a visit, but maybe just for one of their fancy (£15ish) cocktails.",-1
3,"I came to Sketch for some drinks with friends while visiting London.  The bar decor is a bit uber-bizarre, including the quite anatomically correct dog(s) statue in the entrance, the bar that only comes up to your knees, and the very strange pod bathrooms that make you feel like you're in an alien egg.  I think the fact that we were there on a Wednesday night (making the place almost empty) may have added to the strangeness... It would probably feel a little more ""cool"" and a little less ""creepy"" if there were more people around.
Evidently, Sketch has been awarded a Michelin Star, and the quality that suggests shows up even in their cocktails.  There were three of us there, and we each had two drinks, so I (math whiz) got to try 6 of their drinks.  Every single one was delicious.  I especially enjoyed the ""Duvel in Me"" drink, which incorporated one of my favorite beers into a cocktail expertly.  
Yes, it's a bit pricey, but this isn't the type of place that you're going to have 10 drinks at (well I suppose that I shouldn't say that for sure, but definitely not when it's a Wednesday and you're jet-lagged from coming in from Chicago the day before!)
I almost forgot to mention... the WC Pods are quite an experience.  Mine had barn-yard animal noises coming through the speakers.  I am not kidding.",-1
4,"My flatmate decided to surprise me with a belated birthday dinner and took me and a friend to Sketch. We were greeted my a number of beautiful people at every door and each one of them was more accommodating than the next. The ambience and decor  were incredible with the dim colored lighting and white hand-painted ""antique"" furniture. There were images of bubbles projected on the walls creating a fantasy-like atmosphere. And going with the bubble theme the restrooms were these singluar white pods, everything was very pristine and sexy.  
Dinner was lovely, I had the lamb (that was perfectly cooked) which was accompanied my some coco beans, celery slivers and yogurt dollops on what seemed to be a sweet cracker of some sort.  My dinner guests had the salmon and the ribeye which they polished off as well.  DInner was followed my this delicious chocolate cake with a lemon/ginger custard.  Yum!
The reason I took off 1 star was due to the fact that out waiter was rude.  Well, I take that back, he was very rude to my flatmate.  The 3 of us could not figure out why but it seemed that everything he ordered the waiter judged.  It was a little comical after a while but at the same time there was no reason for Pierre/Jean-Louis/Francois to be as rude as he was.
There are also a few cocktail bars in this venue that you either have to be a member of or have dined there that night to enjoy.  The 2 that customers can enjoy were both very unique. One was tiny and followed along the bubble theme as it was this round pod with a sunken bar in the middle and the other was more of a lounge with great lighting effects.  
I highly recommend going just for the atmosphere alone.",1
5,"My bf and I got a reservation last minute on a Saturday night since his friend is a member at Sketch. Didn't realize all the perks you get if you're a member!
The whole place had a artsy/Damien Hirst vibe to it. Like the dog humping statue, alien pod restrooms, and the trendy dining room. 
The staff was amazing, shook our hands and greeted us by Mr. X and Miss. X. 2 glasses of champagne was at our table. The food was good, nothing too memorable about it. I was just in awe of all the great looking people walking around (both the staff and the customers). 
Afterwards, we headed to the members only bar which was very cool. Really good cocktails - watermelon martinis are my fave. DJ was playing alot of great music as well, and everyone was up and dancing!
I also loved the fact they had a smoking jacket by the door that they offered to guests when you headed outside for a smoke break. Big black fur coats are GREAT to smoke in cold London weather. 
Anyways, I am definitely coming back again.",1
4,"Absolutely fabulous atmosphere and customer service! I only had tea and scones and didn't have a full meal so I can't really judge the quality of the food, but I was very impressed by the staff. They were downright jovial and inviting - a rarity these days! I'm looking forward to going back for an evening drink and meal next time I'm in London.",1
4,"So bizarre.  I think I quite like Sketch, despite not completely loving my night there. I love offbeat art, and as soon as you walk past the coat check, the statue of dogs having sex kind of sets the tone for what you'll find inside. 
London is one of those cities where you can get away with dangling dead birds and laser lights over people and still charge them 4.75 for a bottle of Asahi as long as you make them feel like they've done something fabulous to have made it in the door. 
I think there's two ways you can look at the place, another reviewer mentioned that they don't seem to take themselves too seriously, but I'd argue that they take themselves very seriously.  There's a lot of work that goes into looking that nonchalant, kind of in that way where the indie crowd spends hours on their hair to make it look like they've just rolled out of bed. 
Visually, I do love the place, but I think my visits are going to be sparse in the future as it's just not something I could justify the spend for on a regular basis. Certainly worth a stop in if you haven't been.  You know, when in Rome...",1
4,"Had breakfast here with my husband and was immediately a fan. Loved the decor & coziness of the place. Although it was said to be quite posh, it wasn't at all as intimidating as I was expecting. The food was good, but portions were a bit small. 
The best part, though, was checking out the bathroom. We heard a woman at a table near us saying that it was the best bathroom she'd ever seen. My husband went to check it out first and he couldn't stop talking about it for the rest of the meal. At the end of the meal I made my way to the bathroom and was amazed! 
It was truly an odd, wonderful, crazy, little place & would definitely recommend breakfast or tea there.",1
5,"I've been to the Parlour at Sketch a few times. They serve a great afternoon cream tea, with bizzare nibbles and colourful confections. The crockery is as mismatched as the furniture and decorations. But it all works. And it attracts an interesting mix of people. And you can dress up and not feel silly.",1
5,Excellent food. Very beautiful ambience (former Chanel House) Amazing Service. Lamb and Duck were extraordinary.,1
4,"Sketch feels special, even if your'e just calling in for a coffee (£8!!!!!). The decor is lovely, the waitresses are beautiful (it must be on the job description) if slightly nonchalant, and the food is tasty. Apart from the £8 coffee, the prices actually aren't too bad. At lunch today I had an aubergine, feta and... something else I've forgotten... in pita, French fries, glass of wine and of course the £8 coffee and it came to around £25. We took our time (we were having a meeting) and were not rushed or made to feel like we should be leaving. 
The lunches are light - so don't expect big portions or stodge.
Although I clocked the selection of patisserie on the way out and they looked stunning, so you could always top up the light lunch with a couple of those!
I really like it here but do consider it a treat, not a regular venue.",1
4,"came here for breakfast with friends, was a little over average, but not the less lovely. all the rooms are wonderfully decorated and so are the bathrooms, I recommend the London to Paris room, my personel fav!",1
4,"Stylish, artsy, hipster...overall cool. Must check out the bathrooms on the gallery! And try the steak tartare! Service is excellent",1
5,"Love, love, loved this place!  Did I mention that I loved it?  It was unique, fun and the food was delicious!  We sat in The Gallery.  Unfortunately, The Lecture Room was closed for the evening.  Perhaps, next time we will get reservations for it.  The risotto is to die for!!  The servers were attentive and informed about the decor and menu.  Seriously would recommend this one to all who visit London.  The prices lean toward the higher side but very well worth it!!",1
5,"Decided to check out sketch a few weeks ago and i thoroughly enjoyed it. Spent all night in ""The Glades"" bar. The decor inside the entire building was mind blowing, the wine was great and it was pretty chilled out. The giant eggs toilets are pretty awesome too!",1
5,"Wow - this is the ultimate place for bling, glamour and ultimate service.  The staff are attentive and the service is truely personal from the time you step in the door to the time you leave.  The food is absolutely delicious - as you would expect from a two michelin star restaurant.  Took a client here for a business lunch and it certainly is the place to impress.",1
4,"Wow, what a place.
 The décor is worth going to see before you even have a drink or something to eat. When I went we had apple pie mojitos which were delicious and a selection of canapés which were mostly very good, apart from a couple of iffy ones.
 If you go you really must make sure you use the bathrooms. They are egg-like pods which sound effects and it's all very surreal.
 The major downside of this place is the price, but for an extra-special treat it should be on the to-do list, even if it's just for a drink in the bar.",1
4,"This is a great place for tea. I just had an afternoon tea over with a friend and the staff was really helpful. The price is not cheap but it's worth the money. The cakes were very good. I couldn't fault it atmt. You also don't need to call for a reservation. Just walk in and they will get you a table. 
However, I didn't like the seat that I had. The place looked vintage posh so I expected the chairs to be comfy but there were very hard (for my friend's as well). But it depends, I guess. I saw other tables, there were good seats where you can sit on a couch. Still, I don't think anyone would expect uncomfortable chairs in the place like this. 
Another thing was, it can get very busy. There's a possibility that you might get the one like mine.",1
3,"An interesting place, worth the visit, if only for the experience.  I came here for tea on a very rainy Saturday.  The wait was long, but we were finally seated on these cute little Alice in Wonderland-like chairs.  The desserts looked beautiful, although I have to admit they looked better than they tasted (in my opinion).  The chocolate tart with orange zest and salt, however, was rich and delicious. 
While you're there, take a walk around the place.  The different rooms have different atmospheres.  As you walk toward the back, the stairs to the left appear as if they are covered with wet blood, although this is only an illusion.  The stairs to the right lead down to a library-like dining room, as well as a large white dining room, which was not in use when I was there.  You have to walk through this room to get to the infamous white egg pod bathroom, but it can be a little creepy.  As I walked through the completely dark and empty room, I could hear the sound of someone chewing/eating, emanating from the speakers.",-1
5,"When I got to Sketch, I was fortified with an entire bottle of wine sloshing about in my veins.  Imagine my excitement when I went to empty some of this liquid excess and found myself peeing in a GIANT EGGPOD FROM THE FUTURE.  As if that weren't enough, a trip to the bar yielded a quirky delicious rosemary martini made with basil, vanilla syrup, rosemary-infused vodka, sugar, salt and pepper, apple juice, and pineapple juice.  This was as tasty as it was innovative, a combination that is all too rare in the world of cocktails.  At £13 a pop, these drinks are exorbitant and should be savored.  To get your money's worth, get a little liquor in your system and go dancing among the ovoid spaceships upstairs.",1
5,"I first came here on a first date some few months ago, he certainly impressed me with his choice of venue for the evening.
 We had a cocktail in the space ship bar first and then went on the restaurant where we had a really nice and pricy (well I wasnt paying the bill so it was ok) meal with a bottle of wine.
 Each area has its own stylish atmosphere,
 The highlight really has to be the memorable egg-shaped toilets. The architecture of which are absolutely amazing!
 This is a great place to come for an extra special evening.",1
4,"I went there for my birthday. The decor is funky,elegant,posh,unforgettable!
Pricy but you are paying not only for the food here,its the whole experience..",1
4,"Yikes! It is expensive, but you get what you pay for!
I was lucky enough to attend a dinner here last night hosted by business contacts. 
On entering the main hall the general bar is the the right on the grouns floor, a long, open room riotous with colours and quirky artwork. On meeting my group we went down stairs to the rear of the venue to the Glade room for drinks. This bar is a bit quieter and makes talking a lot more simple. Ceilings are equally as high, with reddish-pink walls decorated with crystals and sequins in swirling patterns. Odd squat 70's furniture reminded me a little of my grandad. Don't worry, you're not being targeted by snipers - the circular rotating mirrors in the walls seem to reflect red lasers for some reason. All part of the 'artistic license'.
 After drinks we moved into the main Gallery restaurant, much more to my liking. The whole space is white with projections beamed onto the upper half of each wall in an ever-changing display. All furniture is white, whether it's high tables with cocktail chairs, low sofas or glossy laminate tables.
 Just off the restaurant the VIP bar looks like a James Bond-esque snug - all black leather around a circular bar and curved walls. Up the curving staircase are the egg-shaped toilets that everyone raves about.( see pics uloaded). Yes - they're cool, but slightly unnerving to hear applause or Ave Maria sung by choirs on completion of your time 'en oeuf'. Apparently the sound effects differ per pod and the lights strobe through the full rainbow spectrum so you get a different experience at different visits.
Now, on to the food. 
Luckily, with all the pomp and pretention, the food is still excellent. We tried the set menu ( which seemed to have some kind of apricot theme throughout! )
I tried baked pollock on a bed of aubergine and a square of apricot jelly-esque side spread. This was followed by the rib-eye steak, done to perfection as a medium-rare, with vegetables and a polenta cake with some whipped, cocunut frothiness on the side. Finally a cake concoction stacked with diced apricots, apricot sauce and a brittle, nutty disc on top. All in all, a great food standard peppered with friendly and prompt service.
 I think that the main reason this place has stayed 'de rigeur' for more than 6 years is more down to this level of attentive and professional staff and high-quality food than to the 'quirky' or trendy styling.",1
5,"Sketch is a Bar and restaurant just off Regent St. This Establishment never fails to give you the wow factor from it's ever changing Gallery Restaurant (This has different artists to commission unique digital and traditional works and themes) to the excellent East bar that is housed in a dome with great atmosphere and the craziest most unique toilets that you will ever encounter. Food here is also excellent and the lunch menu is great value if you can get a table.
Definitely worth a go on a civilised night out if you get a chance go and check it out!",1
4,"If you don't mind paying a little extra, this place is well worth a fun and posh afternoon tea. And being an American - yes, please, I'll take my tea while being posh...only way to do so, right?
The interior decor is breathtaking and the bathrooms are super fun (yes, I said the bathrooms are super fun).
My mate and I (I can call him a 'mate,' because he's British, even though I'm not...) weren't very hungry, so we shared the ""Queen's Tea"" (I think that's what it was called): 3 scrumptious little scones with delectable butter and raspberry jam - perfect to compliment the hot Earl Grey in the cutest tea pot.",1
4,"I came here for dinner with some colleagues while on my last business trip to my company's London office.  It's located literally steps away from my office, so we thought we'd give it a go.
Sketch has a unique vibe - sort of a combination of Star Trek meets Alice In Wonderland...kooky, yet chic at the same time.  It's a combination of NYC Meatpacking district type club meets chic restaurant  The decor is modern, yet with a twist of vintage at the same time and includes quite a few over the top works of art (including the enormous images of a man's scrotum on these video screens that hung at the top of the dining room we were situated in)...hmmm.
A DJ spins dance / electronica tunes which add to the cool and lively vibe.
Overall, the food was very good.  They have a great selection of wines and cocktails as well.  I did think the prices were a bit steep for what we got (and I am by no means a cheapskate...refer to my other reviews).  At these prices, I do at least expect free bread, thanks!  I don't remember if we had to pay for the first bread basket, but there were 3 of us eating dinner that night and all we got was a tiny bread basket with 3 miniscule bites of bread in it.  When we asked for a second round, the server made it clear that we would be charged for it...seriously?!!!  I just ordered a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine and you're making me pay for a bite of bread?  Wow.
The service was decent, but I've had better.  It got a bit sporatic as our meal went on and the place was getting busier.  Again, at these prices, I expect a certain level of service thanks.
This may sound crazy, but the best part about this entire place is the bathrooms.  So quirky and unique!  You have to go up the spiral stairs that wind around the bar to this weird open room at the top.  Each toilet is individually located in it's own separate egg shaped ""pod"" (see pics to get what I mean) - again, it makes you feel like you are in an episode of Star Trek...as if you are about to trasport to another dimension once you close the pod door and the world outside disappears!
I would definitely come back here again, but not for dinner - just for drinks.  Oh, and of course, to use the bathroom ;-P",1
4,"At the entrance to the Sketch restaurants (reviewed elsewhere) is Sketch Parlour, a cozy place to take an excellent pot of tea, a delicious cake or two or even a light lunch. 
The place is laid out with the sort of furnishings you'd find in the parlour of a georgian house, without much in the way of formality or pattern. Pull a group of armchairs and a table together and while away an hour or two with friends or using the free wi-fi. The services is friendly and attentive, the food beautifully presented and delicious and the atmosphere calm.
It's not cheap, but it's an oasis and a great rendezvous right in the heart of London.",1
4,The loos in this place are cool! Big white pods in the nighclub area! worth a look!,1
1,"Service in the bar area is unpredictable, i've had good service during the afternoon around tea time, and i've had inattentive and rude from my last visit in the evening when we popped in for a few drinks.",-1
5,"This place is pretty awesome.  Most hoighty-toighty places are superficial and starch, and this place is nothing like that.  
This restaurant has a sense of humor, and doesn't take itself seriously.  It's whimsical and interesting interior entertains while providing a wonderful dining experience.  It's been said, but if you ever get the chance, visit the bathrooms!  I'm sure if you stop in when it's not busy and more casual (lunch) they'll let you pop in to check it out.
My friend and I checked online to see that they weren't taking any more reservations for that night.  We decided to go check it out anyways, and try to get in without.  We walked right in, and after saying we didn't have reservations we were seated immediately (it helped that we got there right when it opened at 7)
The food is delicious; my friend got the chicken dish while I got the Norwegian Cod (which came with gnocchi colored with squid ink.  Fancy!)  We both finished all of our food, and it was very good.
If it weren't so expensive for a student, I would definitely be back in a heartbeat.",1
3,The coolest bar and bathrooms ever. packed and overpriced drinks with a pretty boring crowd made it kind of a bummer. No one looked as though they were having fun. The bar staff was hustling and made a delicious cocktail though. Not my spot in town for fun.. but would like to try the restaurants and give them a fair chance.,-1
5,I only went to the east room bar a couple of times. It's the one in the white globe. The drinks are amazing very creative and some of the best drinks you can get. Well worth the price and the wait at the bar. It can get very busy especially right after everyone has dinner. Overall totally worth it and I would make an effort to return here.,1
5,"I drank gallons of tea during my time in England and out of all the tea I had out at restaurants, this place had the best cream tea! I believe it was £10.50 for the cream tea- the tea is endless, so we had a few pots  between the group I was with. The scones were fresh and the atmosphere is unlike any place you will go in London. I have never seen such unique/odd but cool different types of designs in one place. We came in around 3 pm on a Friday and had no issue getting seated. You have to go have a look around this place. Be sure to walk into the different rooms and to their main restaurant upstairs as well. I am sure this place gets pretty wild at night, as it seems like a bit of night life hot spot, but if you are looking for an affordable afternoon tea in a great area, stop by here!",1
4,"this place is 'hip' and.. i dont even use that word. 
had to go to the gallery because the michelin star one was full. service isn't great. it's snobby. but u still want to be there because everyone is 'hip' (.... i can't think of another word to use and it's kind of awkward)
food was good- delicious risotto and dessert, nicely paired with a white wine. i'll skip the loos, (five out of five toilet rolls on LooReviews)
we walked out of gallery and to the left just before the exit, and danced in a room with a cool vibe, where men with handkerchiefs in their suit pockets asked me to dance. fun night all in all.
p.s. LooReviews doesn't exist [yet.]",1
3,"In additon to my review below I have since had another visit to sketch for a friends birthday. We ate in the bar this time around and I can say without any hesitation that it was really, really poor. The food was trying to be art and flavour was an after thought. Out of 6 or 7 dishes we ordered 1 was ok and that was the peanuts. The sandwiches were black (by design), but all this managed to achieve was to to make it taste like a old sports shoe.. 2/10 for the bar, must try (less) harder! Back to basics...
 Have haunted the corridors of sketch on more than one occasion and always had a good time albeit expensive. Yes, put your nice clothes on, buff you shoes, clean your teeth, splash of the smelly stuff and hit the ATM hard and in style, ok now your ready for night.
 Pre dinner cocktails with well healed city girls and boys and then into the restaurant for dinner. Set in visual projected on surroundings the food is well presented, service efficent and wine list good but didnt find any gems.
 Great place for date, not a first! Great for group of friends who want good drinks, fun bar and good looking people.. A little bit shallow, well maybe a touch but theres a place for everything and Sketch fits theres perfectly. Toilets, well everyones else has said plenty about them but for my two cents, there clever and egg shaped, other than that there toilets and Ive seen better places to spend 5 minutes in several other London bars/ restaurants.
 Not sure about about one reviewers suggestion to ""forgetting about the credit crunch"" and hit sketch, theres a good possibilty you will still wake up in the morning with a very expensive hang over and not feeling any better about yourself.. But ive been wrong before... Worth a visit, but please no first dates unless your a city boy with little imagination and a large wallet, in which case, have a great time!",-1
5,"While in London you have to go to Sketch.
Service and food are just amazing. My favorite is the egg/pod shaped toilets. I always make a dash to go see them. I get yelled at every time by the bathroom attendants who think I am trying to sneak into the mens or something, while I'm just trying to take a picture! They get very angry about that but oh well. Great place, definitely a must do!",1
5,"I first came here on a first date some time ago, my date certainly impressed me with his choice of venue for the evening.
We had a cocktail in the spaceship bar first and then went on the restaurant where we had a really nice and pricy (well I wasnt paying the bill so it was ok) meal with a bottle of wine.
Each area has its own stylish atmosphere,
The highlight for me has to be the  memorable egg-shaped toilets. I would recommend you go there to see the toilets alone!
This is a great place to come for an extra special evening.",1
4,"Came here multiple times for tea.
Fabulous, the only thing I can complain about is that the staff seem to think that they're part of the decor too - it takes a while to get some service here.
Do try the scones and chocolate tart! Absolutely delicious.",1
4,"The place is pretty interesting - I feel like I'm stepping into a Dali painting :P  Random pieces of art cover the space and each room has a different look and feel.  My favorite area was the bar downstairs -- all black interior with the bar located in the center of the room - very sexy!  
The bartenders and wait staff here are all very nice and accommodating - which is a definitely plus! 
Next time I'm in London I'll definitely pass by here for drinks again.",1
4,"London hip - I was here with a group for a private group business dinner. The service was fabulous, the food and drinks were wonderful, but really  it was all about the toilet pods",1
4,"Sketch is a wonderful space, I love their decorations! It is glamorous without being too snobby, and the mix of people is wonderful. It's a great stop after doing some shopping in the area. 
I've only been here for tea, and every time it's been a great experience. The food is good, but typical, not extremely outstanding or innovative, but always up to a certain standard. Their desserts always look very delicious, and I really do enjoy their tarts. 
I am, however taking a star off because the staff can sometimes be a little snobby. Sometimes I feel like they are a bit short staffed? And it takes awhile for them to come to our table.",1
5,"never miss this place if you visit london. Unique place. Go there to enjoy their ambience, special toilet, cool designed chairs and tables. I can't tell if their tea is better than other place, because I forgot its taste while I was looking at their unique things. Maybe no tables left for you, or close. location is also good. walking, shopping, kinda tirey? go there and take some rest. But little bit overpriced, I think. Still, it is  a must- go place! I haven't tried their restaurant, but it always crowded. I assume maybe good food(Not sure).",1
4,"Cathy and I dined here twice, once for afternoon tea and cakes back in September, and once for supper in April. Let me say this much - the place is very large, with different rooms with different themes, and so much to look at that it borders on the distracting (but in a decidedly good way). First, I'll say the one bad spot regarding Sketch ... the service is a little erratic, and sometimes takes a while to get noticed if you're drink is needing replacing or you need extra attention to your meal.  That being said, let me move onto what I can describe as the magic of Sketch!
We got seated proper at 8.30 on a busy Saturday evening in the Gallery Room, and the maitre-d was an incredibly charming French gentleman who said everything with a insouciant flourish of his well-manicured hands and his impeccable smile. A giant lamp made out of children's toys and action-figures and dolls painted entirely white is by the entrance. Near the coat-check is a porcelain statue of two mating greyhounds. In the entrance is a hopscotch painting in the floor, and one of the doors off to the left appears to be melting, cascading thick red resin down a petite flight of stairs. Outside is a merry-go-round of ""out of work"" ashtrays that spins and empties themselves into a urn. Cathy and I were seated next to a softly lit wall set in the centre of the room that was impaled with chairs, pieces of antique tables and chandeliers, and one of the first things we noticed was the projections of the Paris skyline rotating slowly on the upper parts of the walls. A DJ was spinning some wicked house music with a lot of bass, and everybody was beautiful.
We ordered a bottle of Veuve Cliqot, which arrived quickly, and received two little shot glasses of a vegetable puree which was then poured over a little shaving of raw tuna with something that resemble lentils. Cathy's entree was a little radicchio salad with slices of Chilean Sea Bass and a balsamic vinaigrette, I went for more of the tuna!
Main courses came a bit later. I dropped a knife once and a server caught it as it bounced off the floor, and immediately replaced it. Good reflexes! I had a rib-eye steak bloody with dauphinois potatoes and leeks, whilst Cathy had a fish dish I can't remember.
After we had this blowout piece of lovely hot chocolate cake, I took off to the toilets. All I can say is ... WOW. You go through a door in the back and you see in the centre of this massive room a small dugout bar surrounded by two semi-spiraling staircases that envelope the bar as they go to the next level. One is back-lit blue for the boy's toilets, and the other one is pink. You ascend the staircase, and come across these pods that look like escape pods mated with the transportation pods from ""The Fly"" and the eggs from ""Alien"". The door opens with a gentle hiss, and closes behind you. Everything is bathed in a soft blue (or pink if you're a girl) light, and gentle soaring sounds surround you as you complete your business.
I recommend saving some space in your evening for a last glass of champagne in the little dugout bar when you've finished with your meal.  It's rather small, and looks like something out of ""Star Wars"". The gently domed ceiling is covered with little sketches, the bartenders were friendly, and a single portal in the centre gives way to the blue/pink lights from up above near the pod toilets.
A very interesting, fun, and fabulous evening, I highly recommend it!",1
5,"had tea (actually champagne and cakes)  in the parlour.  what a cool place.  lovely calm atmosphere.  relaxing.  cute manageress and really helpful staff! should be for the price I spose :)
great place to go though and we will be back. oh and, of course great loos; ha",1
4,"I don't have anything in particular to say about the tea, but the scones so good!  And the raspberry jam is the best raspberry jam I've ever had.  That itself made my day.
Sketch also has a gallery in the back of the dining area, and if you go even further back, they have the mot unique bathrooms ever seen.   Each bathroom was a pod.  Kind of like a very comtemporary portapotty.  I even made my friends that didn't need to use the restrooms go check out because they were worth taking pictures of. And I don't take pictures of bathrooms. Ever.",1
4,"This place sure is a little bit quirky - which makes it so appealing! It's not the kind of place to take your oldies for Sunday lunch. I visited the Sketch Gallery on a Monday (which was suprisingly buzzing)
 The decor is of course an art gallery so you shouldn't expect anything less than eccentric! The projectors show the latest art exhibit on the blank wall 'canvas'. There is an extensive list of cocktails but @£13 a pop you probably won't be getting too wasted! The bread is served in lego baskets. The food although good isn't exceptional. the menu is based on little carbohydrate & dairy products, so you shouldn't expect mountains of grub!
 Was an interesting experience and you have to go for the whole atmoshphere not just the food. (and the wc's)",1
5,"Sketch is just perfect for a glitzy afternoon tea. Everything about the place is glamorous and you really feel like you are living the high life for a couple of hours when you come here. 
I came for afternoon tea with my mum for her birthday and it was a wonderful experience. The delicious cakes are displayed like jewels, the decor absolutely ravishing and I would highly recommend a pot of the white jasmine tisane! 
The little girls room is an experience in itself; very space-age/futuristic but it does get your imagination going and a good example of somewhere that has made a conscious effort to make its decor uber cool. 
Lets be honest, Sketch is rather expensive but it has to be visited if only for a cocktail or two to experience the decor (and creative use of technology) alone.",1
5,"Futuristic in design with a bit of outerspace galactic appeal not overdone however, this uber cool restaurant is fanciful in delight.
I went with family for dinner to celebrate the festive season. With reservations on hand the quirky minimalist proportions intrigued my male cousin who likes a substantial meal. A two course meal with dessert and wine costs about £40 upwards per head. But with the highly rated service and menu it was a luxurious dinner enjoyed to the utmost. 
My attention was especially caught by the simple use of technology to create ambience. With projection lights placed strategically across the dinner hall patterns evolve throughout the wall and ceiling space to create texture played with colour. Along with the music this movement is so catchy and surprisingly not distracting. I found it highly effective in every possible design rule.
I would say perfect to entertain international business clients, a date with someone special or just a celebration. I don't think big group gatherings could be a success. I may be wrong.",1
4,"I've been to many, many great restaurants all over the world, but Sketch is among the most interesting dining experience I've ever had. The rooms are eat-in art interactive art installations. When we sat in the dining room, it felt like, as others have said, dining with the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland (helped by the fact that one goes below ground to get there). The food, which my wife astutely observed, was good but had predictable combinations that did not match the bizarreness of the restaurant's design. Nonetheless, I would highly rate, even require, you to visit Sketch when you are in London, even just for a drink and a trip to the lou.",1
4,"Okay, first of all get over the OTT pricing...it is what it is. Just go here once as the place is incredible, the bathrooms are hysterical and kind of ""trippy"". The service was impeccable, the food is mediocre. we went to a couple of the bars afterwards and we were not dissappointed but the bar tenders were only okay and the drinks were again pricey. I would come again for a treat because its different. Also its a great spot to people watch",1
4,"I was invited to an event here recently. Just the bar though. So I didn't get to try the restaurant.
 I had a blast. I even danced - something I very rarely do in public. The drinks were pretty delish and very fancy schmancy. In fact the whole flashy moves by the bartenders by the bartenders kinda turned me off. Just fix the drink! But, hey everybody else seemed to like it. So what do I know. The other thing that turned me off and away from drinking more than I would have liked was the price. YEOUCH! Sketch ain't cheap. Most cocktails were well over ten quid. I guess that's to be expected in such a happening Mayfair spot but I had to mention it.",1
5,"There is no question that this is one of my favourite hang outs in London. It ticks all of the right boxes:
Good Food
Great Drinks
Excellent Service
Beautiful people
 This place really does it all for me. Whether you want to have a romantic night for 2 or indeed a wild night with friends Sketch fits the bill!
 I can highly recommend the risotto and without a doubt they have the best mashed potato in London (maybe not eaten together!)
 So it might be a bit pricey... forget the credit crunch for one evening and treat yourself, you won't be disappointed!",1
5,"An excellent venue any day of the week! The food downstairs is lovely and definately worth the money that you pay for it. I have been a few times and the atmosphere is always lively and vibrant and although it's usually very busy the service is excellent and the waiters are very attentive.
 A good night out either with friends or for an intimate meal for two. The decor is lovely - check out the egg shaped bathrooms.
 Don't forget to dress to to impress - it's a very cool and chic crowd that come here and there's often a celebrity or two!",1
4,"It's a must visit just for the scenery alone (pod bathrooms, projections on the wall, sunken bar, library room, extra), but the cocktail list, wine menu and food really isn't half bad either. I must admit that it can come across as a bit of a posh persons trendy hang out, but its not the too young ""posh""...ie you don't feel like mummy and daddy are paying for the meal and it's established people that really just like good food and great cocktails.  For a trendy place it's not pretentious and peps working there are great and approachable. There is a bit of fusion going on with the food, but it's all worth a try (adds a bit of excitement to your meal). I'm not sure I would be a huge fan of going back to the sunken bar but for a 5ft5"" chick - it felt good to fill tall",1
4,"Best loo I've ever been to.  Really.  The pods thing is so cool.  The decor in general was great.  The food was unique but not excellent.  My duck was a bit dry.  Still good though.   Overall, a fun place to have dinner.   We sat next to Mr. Brainwash.  Great people watching.  Definitely worth the experience.",1
4,"I love the Sketch Restaurant. Gorgeous wait staff, gorgeous decor, gorgeous food. The whole experience is always gorgeous! WIth an extensive wine and cocktail list, and an impressive menu, Sketch isn't cheap, but it's worth the extra pennies!
The spaceship toilets, however cool and 'Clockwork Orange-esque', freak me out a bit, and after a couple of cocktails I always fret I'll be stuck in there forever...or at least the night.",1
5,"Having eaten at L'Atelier I'm Las Vegas several times with excellent service from their Sommelier Rafael Garcia I jumped at the chance we he found out I was headed to London and offered to make a reservation at L'Atelier London. 
The kitchen was much smaller than Las Vegas but after watching the food prep for a little but the synchronized choreography and all the kitchen staff became evident. My order took a minute to sink in with the waiter, ""I want you to pick my meal for me and pair a wine for each course. 
As the food and wine came out each course was delightful prepared and the wines paired perfectly. Nothing disappointed but the ravioli was mouthwatering. 
Rafael, you're going to have to work next time I'm in Las Vegas to deliver me an equal experience!",1
4,"As a first Michelin experience, I was pretty overwhelmed by the environment and attentiveness of the staff, but I really enjoyed the experience of having so much care taken into your meal.
My friends and I got the three course lunch: I got the beetroot tartare, the caramelised quail stuffed with foie gras, and rum baba. 
They served steaming hot bread first with butter. Then they offered us sparkling/still water, and then later red/white wine. Later upon refill, the water accidentally poured more still into the sparkling glasses and vice versus for my friends still water. A slight mess up but it was nothing really.
The chefs beginning foie gras with red wine reduction was very rich, I couldn't finish but it was delicious.
The waiter gave me the carrot starter and I told him I ordered the beetroot but was happy to take the carrots. Another worker told me that he'd give me the beetroot and that we could share the carrot dish! It was delicious too, the beetroot was refreshing.
The quail is one of the best things I've ever had, honey is the perfect flavor to treat your meats. The side of ""famous"" mashed potatoes was also amazingly buttery. 
The rum baba might not be for those who don't like rum or sponge cake, but the vanilla cream is so light and sweet.
The petit four was also a nice bite at the end.",1
5,"What a special evening. We were able to secure seats at the counter and watch our meal transform before our eyes. We did not opt for the tasting menu; instead we chose a few items from throughout the menu. Our overall favorite was L'oeuf Caviar, Oscietra caviar served atop a crispy poached egg and cauliflower cream. We also spoiled ourselves with the freshly shaved jamon iberico served along pan con tomate. The only dish that did not wow us was the sea bass. Otherwise, an amazing meal.",1
5,"Amazing beautiful restaurant. Probably one of my favorite dining experiences! 
Service was amazing and our waiter was the sweetest thing ever. She recommended the chefs dining experience where the chef picks out each course for you so we tried it! It was amazing!
Each course wasn't too big and was gorgeous. You don't leave feeling heavy or full at all.
They are known for their ""world famous"" mashed potatoes and they are to die for!! 
I can't wait to come back and have a wonderful experience again.",1
1,"Not the best customer service 
Long wait times for food 
After the waiter brought the wrong food not our order we asked to get the food we ordered and gladly pay for it but the manger refused and said he didn't have enough time. The waiter however did realize his mistake later and offered a dessert instead but by that time we all were over the horrible service we had received. We asked for the check and he asked us to get desserts again we said no please just bring the check so we can go elsewhere",-1
5,"Enjoyable evening with our Son on Holiday! Service, well attended to. Amazing amuse bouche, 7 course tasting was lovely!",1
4,"I really enjoyed this restaurant. Not a 5 Star because the feel, ambiance of restaurant seemed very causal, maybe it was the black and white checkers that reminded you of a steak and shake. I personally enjoyed the food, small portions and creative plates but my partner whom is more of a wine snob than a foodie liked his experience at La Petite Maison which the total bill there was double the cost mainly because of you be Wine. I would still recommend that go here to experience the food. May favorite starter is the Fois grad  hamburgers. Fois is something I never would have gotten in the past (bad experience) but I discovered it's all how the chef prepares it.",1
5,"Although I am not in London anymore; I must give this place the review. This is the first Michelin Star I have ever been in and it was amazing. The place has a romantic setting and the chef and his workers cook in the kitchen thats right in front of you. The unison of the staff is great! The full course meal is amazing. I had their steak the first time. It was so amazing I had to go there a second time. They start you off with a selection of bread and butter. Their water was 6 pounds which makes sense for the restaurant to charge that much. Afterwards, they bring you 3 small complimentary appetizers. Their molecular gastronomy techniques are excellent. Hard for me to describe the taste so I will leave photos of them after the review. Next was the 20 oz steak with jalapeno peppers and finely cut potatoes. They wrap a small bundle of rosemary to enhance the flavor of the steak. This steak was and still is, the best steak I have ever had. On the side is their famous smashed potatoes and it definitely has an exquisite taste. Lastly they gave me complimentary desert that was a great palate clenser. All for only 55 pounds. If this was a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, I can't imagine what a 3 star will taste like. I can still imagine the soft firm taste like it was yesterday. Until one day, I will come back to this place",1
4,"This is a delightful spot for a special dinner whether you are trying to impress your partner or you have a business contact you want to woo.  If you dine here you need to surrender yourself to the whims of the chef or your server.  If you do, you will not be sorry.  The service is good but the menu selection is superb.  I had the chef's menu and was blown away by the presentation and the flavors.  For me, the highlight was the dessert which consisted of ""chocolate wonderfulness"" that defies an adequate description!  This is an expensive spot but its innovative menu and remarkable ambiance is well worth it.  My only issue was our server had a very thick accent which made it difficult to understand her.  I am not trying to be picky but this put me off a bit.  Our entire group had the same problem and we had a group that included both native German and French speakers.  The acoustics didn't help.  The menu, presentation, and food gets five stars.  Service, sadly was a little confused with plates arriving at different intervals.  Not a huge issue but caused the overall rating to slip from five to four stars.  If you want a special meal in London, L'Atelier should not be overlooked!",1
3,"We were excited to see that there were reservations available on a Saturday night.  We booked a 10:30 PM slot. When we arrived, our table was not ready.  We were sent up to a lounge where we were given menus for cocktails. No one ever came by to take our order while others were being seated and helped. Finally, after 30 minutes, someone came by. He was extremely apologetic and provided us with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine.  About ten minutes after that, and fort minutes after our reservation time, we were seated.
Someone promptly came to give us menus and bread.  There were no bread plates, so after several minutes we had to ask.  My friend ordered a diet coke.  The waiter took our order and then a few minutes later someone else came to take our order.
We ordered the eight course tasting menu.  My friend's diet coke never came, so after a few courses, we had to re-order. I ordered a cocktail, the Secreta Negrita around the first course. It came around around the seventh course. That was ridiculous. I didn't get it until I threatened to cancel the drink order.
Our dessert took forever, at least 25-30 minutes after we finished the last course, which was strange because the other courses came out at a nice pace. By this time, people were banging pots and cleaning without seeing if we needed anything. I kept having to flag down people for water.
We had the eight course tasting menu.  
Course 1: Tempura - This is not your Japanese style tempura. These were fresh vegetables wrapped in a light tempura batter.  Simple and delicious with a light cucumber and mint cream.
Course 2: Caviar - The caviar was served over crab with potatoes vichyssoise. This was beautifully plated on a plate with palms painted on it and a bowl of ice underneath the dish.  Very beautiful.  The caviar was on top, and then the potatoes vichyssoise, and underneath was the delicious crab. The combination was superb. 
Course 3: Seared Scallop - This was beautifully presented on a half shell on top of potatoes mousseline. The scallop was seared perfectly. The texture and flavors were supreme.
Course 4: Gyoza - This was a chicken and leek gyoza in a hibiscus broth. The broth was slightly sweet and acidic. It was so good that I didn't leave a drop in the bowl.  The gyoza was my least favorite.  It didn't taste any better than the dollar dumplings in NYC, aside from the soft (vs dollar dumplings' rubbery) texture!
Course 5: Foie Gras with a similar hibiscus broth/juice from the previous course. This was my favorite!  It was a generous portion, and it really melted in my mouth, truly a wonderful experience.
Course 6: John Dory with a tandoori-lime emulsion. This was my second least favorite course. It was good, but the texture was a bit rough. I never had John Dory before, so maybe that's how it's supposed to be. I really liked the broth, and it came with baby clams.
Course 7: I had the lamb cutlets. My friend had the quail stuffed with foie gras. Both came with a mashed potato that was to die for. It was the thickest and creamiest mashed potato I ever had. I had my lamp medium well. It was tender and savory. 
This was around the time I got my drink, La Secreta Negrita.  It's truly a dessert in itself, a creamy mezcal drink with a chocolate treat inside.  
At this point someone put a bowl of the mashed potatoes in front of us and didn't say anything.  Several minutes passed by with it sitting there, so we asked about it. And the waiter said he ordered it by mistake. We gratefully indulged!
Course 8: Herb sorbet and kiwi puree with a light Sorbet AND Chocolate Mousse with Oreo cookies.  This was worth the wait. 
Overall, a beautiful venue with fresh vegetables serving as decor and strong red colors that make the ambiance.  The food is divine.  If they can get their service in order, this would be the perfect experience!",-1
5,"Cheer up and for the hell of it, asking siri where the nearest michelin star restaurant was, and walking in, booking free in work clothes, and being sat at the bar. 
Cocktails to start, gorgeous combination of spirits, decorated with fruit and flowers. 
Little palette cleansers in between, that were fresh and flavoursome.
I had the duck, duck bon bons and cherries, it was cooked perfectly, and tasted divine. It was only then that we realised we were sat facing the open plan kitchen, they were working so quietly, efficiently and cleanly they didn't disturb anyone.
Before desert, we were given little petit fours of truffles and gorgeous raspberry marshmallows. 
We ordered pots of tea, with super attentive service I wasn't allowed to pour my own. 
My friend's desert in particular was amazing, with a beret of leopard print painted chocolate, my desert was also perfect, but not quite as pretty.
I would definitely come here again, really did love it.",1
3,"Massive expectation gap!
My friend and I were very excited about this lunch. Turns out it did not live up to the Michelin star expectation. #disappointed
We were sat at the bar area elbow touching elbow with the customers next to us. I could literally read who the customer next to me was whatsapping. There was a couple sitting next to my friend, talking about her mum #wedidntwanttoknowherstoriesok(!). Cosy was not what I was expecting. 
The bread came without the butter. We waited for a few minutes thinking the butter was on its way. Sadly it did not show up and we had to request it. I felt that the waiting staff should be more attentive. 
The starters, mains and desserts were decent. However, it just felt that we were having fine dining at a cosy ramen bar. 
The last disappointment hit when the coffee came without the chocolates/sweets. The waitress did inform us that the sweets were on their way. Though they never show up and we ended up asking for them. 
All in all, a huge let down.",-1
1,My review plain and simple. We had a reservation for a family celebration and they did not have a table when we got there. Which is not a acceptable situation for any restaurant. Even the local chain restraints can accomplish something that simple.,-1
2,"Big disappointment for a Michelin starred restaurant. The meal left me quite sick well into the night and next day. I started feeling sick after the third course and was was sick until the night. Husband had the regular tasting menu and I had the vegetarian. He liked his; I did not like mine at all. The two stars is for husband liking his meal. However, The vegetarian courses were quite heavy and complex, but in a way I found overwhelming and ""tried too hard."" The beetroot and poached quail egg dishes were nice.  
Aside from the somewhat disappointing food courses, the service was very patchy. We asked to see the sommelier a few times before she appeared, a promised dessert wine never came, and courses took a while to come out even when we were the last people there and they were cleaning to close. 
The worst part was that we saw at least one mouse running about the restaurant. One if the waiters stomped his feet to scurry away the mouse. When that mouse or another one reappeared, another waiter blamed it on the door being left open. The hostess said, "" don't worry madam-- it's a mini one.""  That statement did not work in their favor. The door was not open and seemed unlikely that the mouse had run in from the outside as this was pretty far into the end of the restaurant and there are two separate doors by the entrance. That's not acceptable for any restaurant, much less a Michelin started one. It completely ruined my appetite for the last dessert course that took too long to come.",-1
1,"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.We dined at Joel Robuchon in London for Christmas dinner last winter.  We've been a fan of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon restaurants in many cities, but our experience on Christmas day at your restaurant fell far short of our expectations.
The food was decent, as consistent as other Robuchon restaurants we've been to.  It didn't wow us as much, possibly as our bar is always moving higher.  The service, however, made us feel unwelcome.  We were about 10 minutes late to our reservation due to traffic, which we apologized profusely for.  However, I don't think the service thereafter was justifiable.
Throughout the night we were consistently ignored.  We weren't sure if there was a dedicated server for us, as no one had introduced themselves as we were seated, and several folks rotated on our needs.  It took roughly 5 minutes after we were seated to get a menu.  It took another 10 minutes for someone to take our order (we got the tasting menu).  The older couple next to us had a blast talking with many of the staff, which is great for them, but my wife and I were paid no attention to for drinks or feedback on the food.  At the end of our meal, it again took a long time for the bill to arrive after we had asked, and no one bothered to take away our dishes after bringing us the bill.
At some point we wondered if we were ignored because we looked younger or because of our ethnicity (we saw other tables also ignored according to a pattern), I'd rather not assume discrimination so we'll chalk it up to just bad service.  Given that it's Christmas night, this made it all the more frustrating experience.
All in all, I would not visit Joel Robuchon London again, nor recommend to anyone.  You can get better food in many places, and better service in all places.",-1
4,"Cleanliness: 4/4
Service: 3/4
Honesty: 3/4
+1 bonus star for good flavors, freshness, and presentation
The cleanliness was good. But then again, it was so dark i couldn't see much. You feel like you're entering a Chinese torture room with antechamber and all. The service was awkward. They sit everyone at the bar looking into the kitchen so the service is impersonal. Also, every time the chef said something, the minions would say, ""oui, chef"" and it got very annoying after the 70th time. Also, i ordered a Sazerac and it took over 30 minutes!!! I have no idea what happened. Someone dropped the ball? After 30 minutes i told them to just forget it but eventually they ended up bringing it anyway as a freebie. Regarding the honesty, i dont know. I didnt like the exorbitant pricing for a lackluster experience. Two hamburger sliders for example was £21 (almost USD$30). If they had made the whole experience more personalized, intimate, and awesome i wouldnt mind the price. I also felt they were more interested in making money than providing an experience.  After asking for the check, it was very awkward. They kept opening and closing the pocketbook with the check and whispering amongst themselves. At one point i got annoyed and asked, ""is that mine? Is there a problem?"" Even after setting it down, Two seemingly managers came to open the pocketbook again and look at the check. ::rolls eyes:: oh, lastly, the maitre'd seemed annoyed when we arrived.",1
3,"Came here with my wife while on a quick visit to London.  Coming here is a five star dining experience complete with over attentive staff, unique tasty dishes, and high prices.
My wife had a five course tasting menu while I secreted a few things a la carte. 
A few standouts-
Lamb chops- maybe the best lamb I've ever eaten. Perfect. 
Blacken Cod- pretty good. But not the best I've ever eaten. 
Foie gras stuffed quail- very good especially the quail. 
In the downside the deserts didn't wow us. My Oreo cookie chocolate entree was just so so.  My wife had a mango sorbet / homemade candy concoction which was also just ok. 
Service was good and friendly- which it should be for the prices you pay and the mandatory service charge. 
Had this restaurant been 20% cheaper it would be an easy 4 or even 5*.",-1
2,"We've eaten st this restaurant many times and requested a table when making reservations for a graduation celebration. They said we will have that ready for you; however when we went to check in they said they would be seating us at the bar. We explained this was not acceptable and they said, ""it's lovely. It's the whole experience of Robuchon to sit at the bar. We've sat st the bar. The only experience is that you are not able to talk to your companions. It's loud in the restaurant anyway. They said they sat a table right before we came in because its first come first served despite us having a reservation. Not accommodating at all. They really push the bar area every time you go because no one really wants to sit at the bar. If everyone enjoyed the bar so much, all of the tables  would not have been filled. Will not be going back even though the food is usually wonderful. Left a bad taste in our mouths.",-1
5,"We had the most wonderful evening!  It was our 23rd wedding anniversary and we could not have picked a better place to celebrate.  Honestly,  the whole experience was special from begining to end.  We actually asked to speak to the manager to commend him on his knowlegeble and attentive staff.  The food was incredible and we loved watching the magic as each dish was created in the kitchen.  Thank you for a very special evening!",1
5,"I actually prefer this location to the one in Paris.
Don't get me wrong, the one in Paris is nice. But this location is truly special. The service is top notch, the menu creation is inspiring, and the food is superb.
My first experience here was during restaurant week a few years ago, it was a steal of a deal! Since then I come back fairly frequently (as often as my budget will allow) and it always seems to get better every time I go. 
It is quite pricey, but I do think it's worth the money.",1
1,Do not go for New Year's! They double the price and  the dishes are boring in comparison to their regular menu. We were extremely disappointed and hope others don't make the same mistake.,-1
5,"Roasted Bone marrow was out of this world. 
Free range quail was unbelievable. 
Langostine ans truffle ravioli with Savoy cabbage was amazing as well. Lost my self in that one. 
Being able to watch the kitchen so close, seeing the passion in the kitchen, so much attention to detail, was the most rewarding experience. 
The service was also notable in their efforts to make us feel so welcome and well looked after.",1
5,"This is one of my favorite spots in London, go for the fixed menu. Great drinks, make reservations it is very busy specially on weekends.",1
5,"We've dined here both upstairs and down, and at the sister restaurants in Las Vegas and (now closed) New York. Of all of them, this is our favorite, because of the intimate size of the downstairs area. It offers arguably the best tasting menu in London, with wine pairings that superbly match each course. 
The artistry of the food arrangement is really unsurpassed, and it's great fun to watch it being assembled before you, so be sure to ask for a seat at the counter. This makes it easy to chat with the servers and sommelier, making it a friendly, energizing experience. For parties of more than two a few tables are available downstairs, which I recommend over the less intimate upstairs dining room.",1
2,"Let's start off with the service- WORST service I've encountered in London. Arrived with reservations and no one at hostess stand- we stand waiting for someone to show up for 15 mins.  
The remainder of our service should've taken place at a fast food establishment-
We had the tasting course- the food was absolutely lovely and the presentation perfect. It's unfortunate the service and management is poorly performed.
I've eaten at several Joel Robuchon establishments around the world and thus by far the worst service I've received.",-1
4,"Being in England, I'm trying to accrue as many fine dining experiences as possible. This was so worth it!!
Absolutely delicious. From the beginning to the end, it was definitely a two Michelin star experience. It was actually fairly empty when me and my friend went, so we had 3 people serving out table. They recommended the Riesling from Germany which was lovely. Nice, sweet and refreshing. It suited my tastes perfectly.
I ordered the lobster salad, which has fresh lobster (really good, comparable to Newfoundland!), avocado, fried courgette and large mozzarella cheese balls. It also has a green creamy sauce which I would hazard is avocado. 
This came after a basket of fresh bread, which of course also tastes great when you're hungry. This was followed by an aperitif which was quite interesting. 
They brought out a free bowl of mashed potatoes which somehow was also really good, rich and creamy. 
We finished the night with dessert. I ordered the chocolate mousse but I just couldn't finish it. So good but so rich! Definitely get desserts to share! It had this white whipped cream around it which was nice and a little bit lighter to complement the rich dark chocolate mousse and it had a hard chocolate top.
Good value for fine dining. Plus, you get a free dessert voucher after your first meal there!",1
1,"In all of my years of travel for personal and work, this has to be THE ABSOLUTE WORST place I have ever been in terms of treatment of customers, attitude and overall behavior. It is so bad, I asked the hotel to never book a guest here ever.  
I arrived for my reservation on time for 8:30. I sat upstairs for 50 minutes waiting for my table. We were told that there was no ETA on when we could be seated. At this point, we were waiting over an hour to be seated. At 9:30, I was told by a manager that I could sit at the bar on level 1. There were three people in my party. There were empty tables that could accommodate us. How would that work with three people eating dinner at a noisy bar? When I spoke to a very nice manager, he finally seated us at a table.  Once at the table, it took 20 minutes for someone to come take our order. We ordered basic steaks close to 10pm at night. As time went on, no food was delivered to us. We kept having a manager tell us the food would be here shortly.- ""a few more minutes"". We waited 70 minutes after we ordered but STILL NO FOOD. At this point we had been in the restaurant for close to 3 hours with no food but bread and water. We had ordered coke to drink for the table. That never arrived. We spoke to a very rude and condescending manager who told us to ""be patient"".  At that point we got up and left. It was 11:30pm.
Another manager, told us the food was coming and to go back to the table. He kept saying the kitchen was backed up but the food would be there soon. 
While we were getting our coats, the hostess was laughing about the situation.  She then said to my friend ""have a good night, thank you""
We walked out of the restaurant at 11:40pm followed by the manager who basically told us to not come back. 
I told my hotel, who booked the reservation, to never book there. They will not. 
Interesting to see that others had similar experiences as well- dating back to 2016.",-1
5,"Truly spectacular in every way. The food, the hospitality, the service, the ambiance, they all hit the right notes in an evening that was more like a symphony than a meal. We ate on the ground floor in the bar area, a concept begun in 2003 at his left bank St. Germain location in Paris. I highly recommend this as it allows you to watch the precision of the kitchen,  which you're in full view of, and you can engage more easily with the staff and your neighbors if you so choose. 
Either before or after dinner make sure you head to the 3rd floor for drinks as an aperitif or post dessert coffee or tea. Beautiful lounge like bar with an outdoor patio area on warm nights. 
The staff is so great you could have a bad meal and walk out smiling. Of course, having a bad meal here has got to be impossible. We opted for choosing 3 courses each from the starter list/tapas style and portion part of the menu. See my attached pics for mouthwatering crab, langoustine, scallop, girolles (chanterelles), black cod, quail, chocolate soufflé and pineapple dishes. Epic meal!",1
4,"Been to the restaurant once but more frequently to the bar upstairs which is a place you need to know about as not evident from the outside or, as you step into to the restaurant.
The bar is a cosy place with soft furnishing to relax into.   There is an outside area for the summer time.  During the winter there is a large fire to keep you warm.  Cosy little seating areas which are great for a catch up treat. 
This is a treat as the price of the drinks are rather on the higher end of the scale.  Waiter service is attentive without being hassled and drinks served with a decorative little rose petal placed beside it.  
Cocktails are wonderful (but reflected in the price).  Challenge here is not to drink too much that you forget (or stop caring) about the cost as it can be a pricey visit!
However, love it here!",1
4,"We had a very good lunch time deal with top end quality food, from very well poached egg, to pig trotter terrine, foie gras & blackcurrant coulis teaser and deliciously baked bread.",1
5,"There are few things I wouldn't do for the mash potatoes. They are legendary, to the point that it's sinful! No words for how amazing this place is.",1
5,"It's a five star place, no getting around it.  L'Atelier serves super high quality food in a casual environment.  The location is in the heart of tourist London, but L'Atelier is hidden in a smaller street so it's not crowded.  
All the foie gras dishes there are really good and perfectly cooked.  I especially liked the lobster dumplings with foie gras sauce, since the lobster was really sweet, the foie gras sauce gave it just the right amount of bitterness it needed.
I also really enjoyed the veal steak.  It was also cooked to perfection and was tender as fuck mate.  They have a sommelier there if you dont know your wine shit, but make sure you are specific when you tell them what you want otherwise they just gonna suggest the most expensive shit.
Would probably come here every time i go to London because french food is bomb AF",1
5,"Utterly incredible. Beautiful food, lovely attentive service. My dessert was a masterpiece.",1
3,Kind of overrated and extremely over priced! The only thing amazing here is there lamb chops and there mash potatoes everything else is extremely overrated borderline awful,-1
4,"We were somewhat disappointed in our experience here. The food was good, don't get me wrong. However, the food wasn't great, and for the money that we paid to eat here, we expected and should have received great. 
We ordered a range of things from the menu including the foie gras, scallops, miso cod, and lamb. The foie gras was done excellent and so was the lamb. Surprisingly, the best part about the lamb was the mashed potatoes that came with it. Unfortunately, the miso cod was very average and we have had much better. However, the biggest letdown were the scallops. The presentation was beautiful (as it was in every dish), but they smelled and tasted fishy, to the point where we couldn't even finish them. They were also in a very harsh flavored sauce that did not go well with them at all and couldn't even cover up the fishy taste enough to swallow them. 
I am happy we tried L'Atelier after hearing so much about it, but I highly doubt we would go back after the mediocre experience we had there.",1
5,"This might be my new favorite restaurant.  We had the tasting menu last month while sitting at the counter and it was fabulous.  First of all the service is impeccable.  The staff is attentive, helpful and friendly.  
The tasting menu was amazing and the sommelier arranged a wine pairing alongside it for us.  We started with crunchy spring vegetables in tempura that was a perfect light first course.  The second course was a crab royal with vichyssoise and caviar.  It was basically parfait of vichyssoise with delicious crab at the bottom and topped with caviar.  It was excellent.  The third course was a seared scallop and was lovely but suffered by comparison to our crab.  The fourth course was a chicken and leek gyoza that was excellent in a tasty broth.  The foie gras course came next and was excellent with fresh cherries.  We then moved onto the black cod that was good but set the stage for our main, the lamb.  The lamb was excellent and flavorful.  For dessert we had mango with a passionata sorbet followed by a herb sorbet with chartreuse cream.  
All in all, a wonderful meal and even if you dont eat some of the things on the tasting menu, I would suggest you go for it.  I rarely eat crab or caviar but that might have been the highlight of the meal.  Everything is so well done, you cannot go wrong!",1
5,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon had flawless execution from start to finish. I am 110% satisfied with the experience I had here. Right when you walk through the door, you're greeted by a friendly host who gladly checks your winter coat. I came here for lunch yesterday with a friend and we both had an amazing time. The atmosphere is dark, dim, and especially trendy. I loved the back where the wall is covered with tree leaves. We were seated at the bar, which was lovely because you can see everything the chefs are doing. Every dish is carefully crafted and none reach the table unless it looks absolutely perfect. And yes, it tastes as good as it looks.
It was lunchtime and a prix-fixe menu is available with a few options at different price points. We opted for the one-starter or dessert and main entree for £28. We both went with starters and a main entree.
Starters
L'ŒUF DE POULE - Poached egg in a crispy rice batter served with black truffle &Iberian ham; This was incredibly delicious. My friend said it reminded her of hash browns & breakfast, which isn't a bad thing at all.
LE CŒUR DE SUCRINE - Heart of lettuce with chicken breast, crispy bacon & parmesan shaving; Very light, but still very tasty. All the elements of a caesar salad, not the most unique dish but still very good nonetheless.
Mains
LE CABILLAUD - Cod fillet served with flat parsley ravioli and vegetable broth; Very light and flaky but very tasty. The vegetable broth was amazingly flavorful, the fish was steamed cooked to perfects, and the ravioli cover gave it a nice touch.
SPECIAL OF THE DAY, PORK FLANK - This isn't on the menu, but it was most definitely the best dish we ordered. The pork was tender and juicy and packed full of flavor. It was one of those dishes that with every bite you take, you roll your eyes back and savor each bite. Yes, it was that AMAZING.
Not only did we have an incredible lunch, but to add to the already amazing experience, the service was just as good. I guess I shouldn't be surprised given this restaurant has 2 Michelin stars, but the waitstaff kept bringing us little sides throughout the entire time. Compliments of the chef, we received an amuse bouche to give our tastebuds a teaser, fennel & mashed potatoes as sides for our entree, and a little dessert to end our meal. We spent a good two hours in here and we were never rushed out even though we sat and stewed for a while after our meal was over. 
I'm a big fan of this restaurant and I'll gladly say that this was one of the best experiences that I've had at a restaurant in London. If you're short on dough and want to experience a culinary experience here, try to come during lunch time when the prix-fixe menus are available.",1
5,"Excellent service, nice decor and ambiance. Was there for the Holidays, the menu was different but still very original.
Did the wine pairing, they were all excellent choices, so much that we asked if we could have a copy of the wine list so we could order them later.",1
5,"The upstairs cocktail bar is where it's at!
I haven't eaten her, but would say that this amongst one of my favourite cocktail bars in London.
You wouldn't be mistaken entering this building through the bouncer guarded door into the mute black tones of this venues reception that this place requires a suit. But don't be scared, as long as you're not wearing trainers, ripped clothing and paint splotched jeans, the chances are they won't turn you away and leaving your excess luggage in the clock room and you'll be escorted to the top floor cocktail bar!
In the same black muted tones, you'll find plush red seating laden with cushions. For those who like the outdoors there is also a outdoor patio that allows you the fresh air that you so seldom find in venues located so centrally.
At around £12 a pop for a cocktail, some may find this on the more expensive side, however it's still a reasonably priced night out if you don't expect to binge drink and are happy to nurse your beverage.
However beverage really isn't the right word to describe these cocktails, each is made extremely well with great care, have a fantastic balance of flavours and you'll find amongst some good old favourites, some really great modern twists.
I would highly recommend the Aviation No.3 which is pure nectar. Whilst the Fleur de Framboise is surprisingly delectable, without the normal sharp tones your expect for a dink that features Prosecco.
The atmosphere, the attention to detail and the fantastic drinks, definitely makes the salon bar a firm favourite of mine!",1
5,"I really enjoyed a lovely dinner with friends.  Had the 8 course with regular (non-French wine parings).  The 8 gets you an extra dessert and a few other goodies.  We sat downstairs; the stools feel a little uncomfortable for an 8 course meal.  The quail and caramel desert were very memorable.  The french vibe was also very cool.
After dinner they seated you upstairs for coffee and dessert, which was great, too.  There is a pre-theater special that I would have tried if I knew about it.",1
5,"Four course tasting menu with the option to upgrade dishes.  The final tab was £70 for lunch, and I wouldn't have changed anything about it.
Joel Robouchon does not disappoint no matter which location you go to.  I can't wait to head over to his Vegas location.",1
5,"Had a spontaneous dinner at the restaurant last night and must say the service was impeccable, the atmosphere was great and the food divine... Highly recommended",1
5,"This place was a highlight of our recent trip to London. The food was exquisite and the staff was warm and friendly, it was truly a dining experience!!!!
I look forward to returning! Should have another Michelin star!",1
5,"What can you say but this place is epic!   The environment is modern and creative and really makes you feel like you are in a movie, without being intimidating.   I sat at the bar once and got a table with a date another time and both were great, though very different experiences.   If you want to impress someone, you can't go wrong here.  Yes, the prices are high but you don't leave feeling like you got ripped off.   You leave completely satisfied and happy.",1
3,"New Years Eve in London - It had to be French - San Francisco banned foie gras so getting my hands on some was 100% necessary. 
Atmosphere: 
Nearly identical to L'Atelier in Tokyo - dim, chill, trendy, centered around their bustling open kitchen
Service:
Relaxed, friendly, a bit scattered at times
Food:
The tasting menu for the day didn't appeal to us so we went a la carte, which meant double the foie =) Overall - the black cod and mini-burgers with foie were excellent, but everything else was tasty but very forgettable.
Damage: ~£200 for 2 (including some champagne)
Overall - A notch down from the Tokyo branch and  the weakest 2-star Michelin I've been to, I think closer to a medium quality 1-star. Doesn't matter though, cuz I got my foie =)",-1
5,"Delicious, inventive cuisine. Professional and attentive service without being pretentious. Elizabetha and Sarah were outstanding!  Unique ambiance. Super cool vibe. Out favorite meal in London!",1
4,"I just came here for drinks... but after the experience that I had, I will definitely return for dinner.
Upon entering the lobby, you are greeted with a chic, tasteful decor and a typically friendly hostess. The other thing that you are greeted with is a beautifully cloying food aroma. And this is one of the very reasons that I know I will return here!
After being escorted to the lift, you will head to either at the restaurant or the cocktail bar. In my case, the latter. The chic, gloss black and red decor continues through here and I always appreciate a bar with dim lighting. I never understand why in London, bars insist on flood light-strength illumination!
The table staff tried very hard to accommodate our large group and did so with good grace. When my cocktail arrived, it was presented in a beautiful manner along with a single petal - I know that they have great attention to detail here and I very much appreciate this.
With the amazing ambiance, great service and that oh-so-wonderful food aroma... I can't wait to return!",1
5,"After having been to a few other L'Atelier locations, I feel that the food at this L'Atelier was the best. I did the big tasting menu and everything was so amazing. The cocktails were delicious (could have been a little stronger), and the presentation of each dish was phenomenal. It was a little bit dark and slightly tight in there, but it didn't really matter since I sat at the counter. I highly suggest sitting up there, especially if you eat alone a lot like I do. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in London!",1
4,"Regular Tuesday evening at work and a senior colleague declared that we would be doing a 'spontaneous' team dinner after work. I volunteered to organize. Knowing the nature of the people at dinner, I knew I needed to look at the top end of the range - Hakkasan, Galvin Bistrot, sketch, L'Atelier de JR. Amazingly, sketch and this place had seats available - the bosses preferred good food over funky atmosphere, so we settled on L'Atelier. 
Free team dinner at Michelin restaurant - yes, please! But oh no, I have some medical restrictions for a few months on alcohol, raw food and delicacies like caviar and foie gras - oh so sad (What a strictly upper middle class first world problem :P)
We were seated upstairs in a dark gallery with dimmed lighting, stylish decor and a view of the kitchen. We provided plenty of logistical challenges to the restaurant between my dietary constraints and one of the party arriving 45mins late, which upset some of the rhythm of the multi-course menu.
After some confusion, we finally placed our orders. The tasting menu comes in 5-/8-courses with two different types of wine pairings (Sommelier's choice vs. French pairings) - we decided to brave the 5-course menu with Sommelier's choice(not for me!)...but as I started reading through the details of the menu, I realised I could have almost none of the courses without replacements, so despite the ""strict"" rules about the entire table ordering the menu, I was allowed by the chef to order off the 'small tasting dishes' menu. The other alternative was to order off the vegetarian tasting menu but frankly, what's the point? 
After running into foie gras in the most unlikely places, I finally picked 4 small dishes (with dessert to follow!) to keep pace with my colleagues' 5-course menu. A nice balance of veggie, pasta, fish and meat with non-alcoholic drinks.
Verdict:
1) Spiced Carrot Juice - excellent. Light, gingery, quenches thirst perfectly without overwhelming the palate or weighing me down.
2) The amuse bouche with port reduction, egg etc- hmm, oh yes, readied the palate very nicely for a grand meal afterwards
3) Slightly smoked aubergine caviar with vegetables and spicy tomato coulis - Tangy and sour from the tomato coulis, just the way I like it, the aubergine was of a smooth texture with crunchy veggies to balance out the creaminess. I like.
4) Capellini with tomatoes and a méli-mélo of crunchy Spring vegetables - a cold dish of stringy pasta in tomato sauce presented pleasingly with a range of veggies. This was certainly the most underwhelming dish of the evening for me. It made me wish I had gone for the lamb, cod or crabmeat instead.
5) The Apple Mint Soda took a while to materialise, some chasing was required - I liked the first few sips but soon, it was ghastly in its sweetness and it overpowered my palate and appetite so much that I had to drink water to wash out its flavour before eating
6) John Dory fillet on a tomato reduction with avocado vierge sauce - I hadn't had a dory in a long time, so I enjoyed the dish. It was a bit more-ish which is perfectly fine as I was starting to get a bit full. I would venture to say that a tomato reduction is a fairly strong flavour, not always ideal with fish, but this worked. In the future, I'll keep in mind not to order two dishes (aubergine caviar and this) in the same range of flavours - both dominated by the sourness of tomato
7) Gyoza of braised veal shank with spinach and harissa - This definitely felt like a 'main'. For one, there are 4 substantially sized gyozas where one might expect 2 or 3. Also, the meat is bursting with flavour and tender, so you can't just inhale it without noticing the quantity. The gyoza was made perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 
8) The bread basket was fabulous!
Aha, dessert. While the rest had to go with their menu-dictated choice (something boring with raspberry), I could pick from a wide range, and I decided to go for the Warm Guanaja chocolate soufflé and Sicilian pistachio ice cream, despite their warnings that it could take 15-20mins. It didn't take that long and oh my gosh, definitely the highlight of the meal! The souffle was the BEST I have had in life. It was light as air, the chocolate was dark and intense, the texture was flawless...I almost didn't notice the pistachio icecream because I couldn't get over the souffle, ooh la la.
I noticed my colleagues enjoyed a wide range of wines from various regions, including an unusual Riesling from Luxembourg. 
So. Why the 4 stars, and not 5? Well, when my dinner costs a small fortune (over 700quid for 4 of us, and I wasn't even drinking), I would like to not feel like I'm inconveniencing the chef through my dietary constraints. If foie gras is merely a garnish in a dash, can they not exclude it? Even chain restaurants are happy to customize so this was unexpected. Service was friendly but a bit confused. Even so, excellent place and quite an experience!",1
3,"It must be me. Or maybe they were just having an off night.  I have eaten at amazing restaurants all around the world and people talked about L'Atelier like it was the second coming or something. I thought it was just OK. 
First of all- there is a ton of pretense. I can be as pretentious as the next person but there was attitude abounding in this place. First the reservation. We called a month in advance and still could only get a 9:30 seating. We got there early and were seated in the upstairs lounge drinking very pricey cocktails until our table was ready around 9:45. 
A quick note on the lounge as it was quite lovely.  There is an outdoor area with the walls covered in ivy.  Inside are several grouped seating areas- one around a large fireplace with leather sofas and chairs.  We grabbed a corner table relaxing in the club chairs that surrounded it.  Another nice touch?  They put down black napkins for your drinks and adorn them with a red rose petal.  Very classy.
Once our reservation was called, because there were 4 of us- we were not seated around the kitchen which is the norm (allows patrons to interact with the chefs)- but got one of the very few tables in the place. This place is small. It gives the illusion of being bigger than it is with mirrors on every wall but I think there may have only been 4 or 5 tables in the whole place. Most of the seating is at the counter where you can see the food being prepared sort of Japanese style. 
Service was SLOW- slow even by European standards (I get that everyone thinks we Americans are always in a rush but we were hungry!) And our server kept commenting on our choices as if we should be ordering something else. 
The menu is broken down into two areas- smal tastings on the left facing page and entree sized portions on the right. But don't think you can share the tastings.. These are little tastes. If you want to share- you need to order more than one- and at these prices . . .it adds up fast. 
We ordered a variety of the tastes: soup, john dory, squid, mini burgers, the salmon (which never came) and the egg cocette. We also ordered the beef tartar from the entree side of the page. While most were good (forget the egg cocette if you want my opinion and order more of the john dory- now that was good!) this was not food I was going to rave to people about. Nor would you be full. Four people split the above and if not for the bread- we would have walked out hungry. 
But since one in our party had been there before- we had a special treat for dessert. Picture a ball of chocolate (About the size of a softball) filled with fruit and ice cream. At your table- they then pour hot liquid chocolate over it which causes the shell to break apart and reveal what is inside. This was the highlight of my entire dining experience and truly unique. 
I would have a hard time recommending this place to friends as I think for the money there are better places to eat in London. Those that know me, know that I am not on a budget when I eat out. But I also like to think that the place that I am spending my money wants me as a customer. I didn't get that feeling here at all. And for that . . I doubt I'll be back.",-1
5,"This place is very classy and expensive.  We took Mum here when she came over from NZ on holiday, it was good for a special occasion like this.  The dishes were very well presented.  The servings were small, but the food was rich and you didn't feel like you would want the servings to be any bigger.
Every dish was luxurious and delicious.  We shared our dishes with each other, so we could experience all of the tastes.
The staff were very helpful.  We were looking for a side salad and there wasn't one on the menu, but it was no issue for our waiter to get the kitchen to make one for us.
Of course, this was an expensive dinner, but this is a place that you would go to for a special treat.  I would recommend this restaurant in that context.",1
5,The food is not only delicious but an amazing experience and work of art. Thank you !,1
4,"Had a memorable meal here during one of my trips to London. My favorite was the sterling caviar w/lobster jelly. Simple yet complex, a nice contrast of umami from lobster & nuttiness of caviar. 
Also fun was having an open kitchen where you can see the chef at work.",1
5,"I'm late in writing this as I went earlier in the year but at the moment my meal here ranked as the best dining experience I've ever had so I needed to write this.
Went for a date night, sat upstairs and ordered the tasting menu paired with wine.  It was a lengthy experience and I loved it.  The details were right, the range of flavors wide and expertly done matched by attentive service and a very clever sommelier.
I remember one course was spaghetti and red sauce.  I thought they must be  joking...this place!?  But it fit in perfectly wasn't a huge portion hiding behind some oddity, just a very well done dish.  The deserts and chocolates were tops and they even prepared my wife's to-go since she had run out of room.",1
4,"Wonderful food beautifully presented. Attentive wait staff.
However, we were seated upstairs which is lacking
in the atmosphere department. After our dinner, one of
the waitress showed us their roof top bar which can
be a great place to have a drink or small party.",1
4,"I had lovely time at this restaurant last night and food was really delicious- something you won't find in many restaurants in town 
the service was impeccable 
setting is pretty unusual (didn't like the short back on chairs- find uncomfortable) 
the one thing I didn't like there was food portion is so little so I found myself grabbing a sandwich when I got home 
highly recommend it although highly priced- around £100 per person",1
4,"New Year in London? 
Want something unforgettable? 
Perfect service? 
Delicious food? 
Dim and trendy atmosphere over there? 
Joel Robuchon!
We ordered L'oeuf De Poule and after that dish I felt in love with that restaurant. I haven't been to France, but it's the best French restaurant that I've been to! 
The starter was an egg in a crispy rice with black truffle and ham - freaking good...
The main dish was Le Cabillaud which is a cod fillet with ravioli and vegetables which gives it a special taste... Vegetables were perfectly cooked. 
Both dishes were amazing!
Although, portions were not super-sized as many people got used to, it's worth money. By visiting that restaurant, you'll get an unusual experience and try the best dishes of French kitchen :)",1
5,"One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten in. Each course was a delightful blend of carefully composed tastes.  The mashed potatoes was a velvet symphony of decadence.  The dessert was a delicious, beautiful painting. The sommelier picked out perfect complex wines for our meal. The staff was attentive and informative. They deserve 5 stars!",1
4,"Ordered: Lobster amongst other things
Price: £200 for two people
Review: A truly impressive restaurant - however, I would not rate it as highly as some may rate it. If you want a truly impressive meal, I think I would look elsewhere. The flavours are mouth watering to say the least and the service is immaculate, however something lacks the true fine dining experience I felt. Toptable and others do a good set meal in here so I would go to those for sure, or for the London Restaurant week for sure. Taking someone on a date here, for a loved one, family - this will not fail to impress for sure!",1
5,"Really delicious food!!! A really lovely and humorous staff. Though it is a little bit expensive, anyway I'll go there again.",1
4,"The bar on the 3rd floor is a trendy but chill place to start the experience.  Everyone who works there is friendly.
As for dinner, you have two options. Traditional dining area on the 2nd floor and a more lively experience at raised tables on the ground floor.  We chose the ground floor and had a great experience.
The food is very expensive but worth the price. I had Dover sole and two dumpling appetizers. Delicious.",1
4,"This is one of the 3 Joel Rubuchon's I've eaten at, and it's definitely a very good place to try. Actually, it's probably my favorite restaurant in London! However, I should point out that compared to the locations in Paris and New York, I found this branch to be slightly behind, quality wise.
For my meal, I had the the beef carpaccio, the langoustine ravoili, and the beef and foie gras burger with caramelized onions. 
The carpaccio was scrumptious, lovely cuts of meat simply complimented with gorgeously flavored olive oil, garlic and chives. The langoustine ravioli was very good, but it didn't blow me away. I could barely taste the langoustine and the portion was so tiny I didn't get much of a second chance to try and search for more flavor! Finally, the burger was good, but a bit of a disappointment. The flavor of the the foir gras was outstanding, but the beef was a bit non-descript, and overall, as a concept, it just didn't work for me. They also gave me an ""order"" of fries, that had about 4 fries in it. I realize you go to a Joel Robuchon for the taste not portion size, but c'mon! Four f****** fries?
Finally, I just want to note that our waiter (or whatever you call the guys within the Atelier) was a bit obnoxious when talking to us, quite a contrast to the other Joel Robuchon's we dined at where they exude professionalism. I wish I got his name, but since I didn't Ill just say that the guy was coarse and made a few inappropriate jokes which I felt had no place in this type of environment.
Overall, definitely four stars, but surprisingly, not five due to slightly disappointing food and an oaf of a waiter. Still worth a visit!",1
5,"Oh goodness... simply amazing...what can I say!  You get to sit at a bar where you watch the chefs make everything in front of you. Holy molecular gastronomy, these guys know every trick. I loved every dish of the tasting menu, which was more dishes than I can count. I'm usually pretty picky and not a seafood fan but I tried and loved them all. The dessert was insane, melting right in front of you as liquid nitrogen gets poured over chocolate to reveal the surprise inside.. I won't ruin it for you but do try it for yourself. I know I'll be back soon!",1
5,"Despite 3 fruitful years in high school French and numerous attempts by my 18-year-old-self to trick people into believing I was French, I didn't have an effing clue what ""L'Atelier"" meant. Even upon entering the interior of the sleek restaurant with Asian-inspired decor, I still had no clue. Let's face it, I googled it just before I began this review. According to the free dictionary (yes, had to use the free one because it turns out places with apostrophes in the name are as expensive as they sound), L'atelier means ""A workshop or studio, especially for an artist or designer."" It all fell into place when I read that... 
Words to describe our experience and the food at L'Atelier: Superb, fabulous, wonderful, delicious, beautiful, surprising, gorgeous, yes-I'll-have-a-dessert-even-though-I'm-full-and-will-be-late-to-my-west-end-show-licious. First off, the service was wonderful. Not stuffy or overly formal, but friendly and extremely professional. I do think the Frenchman delivering our food may have amped up his accent just a bit to play the part of the French waiter, or it could be that in contrast to my ridiculously English boyfriend, it stood out. Disclaimer: The sommelier was also helpful and accommodating with regard to the price range we felt comfortable with. 
The food...scratch that. The Food (yes, it has to be considered a proper noun - it's that good) was spectacular. We began with a rich amuse bouche and a basket of 3 types of wonderful bread - traditional baguette, savoury olive bread and a sweet fig bread. If I could have bought a loaf of each to take home, I would have. We opted for 4 courses. I went a little egg crazy and got a cheese soufflé, followed by a crispy poached egg served atop parmesan mousse. A CRISPY poached egg! How does that even happen? I was sitting there while they made it in the open kitchen and I still have no idea what frankenstein science was used! All I know is that I want it to happen over and over again. I had duck for the main and it was every bit as delicious as I could have hoped. This is where my only criticism comes though - the orange sauce that came with the duck was far too sweet for my taste and reminded me of a melted down hard candy. I just ate around it and enjoyed the duck in a slightly purer form. I was, however, reminded of the time when my dad was making a ""new recipe"" which was ""orange chicken"" and when we didn't have real orange juice, he used Sunny Delight instead. We ended up eating pizza that night. 
My boyfriend was equally as happy with his dishes - a lobster salad with a very generous portion of lobster, a shitake chicken broth and a 'spit roast of the day,' which happened to be lamb and (surprise) happened to be delicious! We were also given a complimentary pot of the smoothest, creamiest mashed potatoes either of us had ever had. Despite running short of time, we decided to squeeze in dessert because, well, we are greedy, disgusting gluttons but it somehow seems more acceptable when it's not burgers and nachos... We had the same - chocolate fondant with a mint sorbet. No points for creativity here, but from the first bite it was obvious this had been perfected and shouldn't be messed with. 
The really outstanding thing about this restaurant is that they so artfully prepared ingredients, we each enjoyed things we otherwise wouldn't have touched with a 10 foot pole. Case in point: My boyfriend hates eggs so much that I had to get a hysterectomy (ok, not that much but you know...). He ate and ENJOYED the savoury crème brûlée amuse bouche. (*sorry Ed, you ate eggs. I didn't want you to spit your food up at this civilised establishment so didn't tell you).  I hate sea creatures and am actually scared of them. This probably all goes back to when I got sea lice as a kid but that's another story for another time. I ate a piece of lobster and didn't even flinch! Neither of us particularly like olives, we pounded all the olive bread like it was the last bread on the planet. 
L'Atelier is one of the best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. It's clear that there is a real passion for food, art and creativity here. It's front of house is well managed and they even walked us down the street to get us going the right direction to the show we were attending. It's not cheap and it's not everyday fare, but it's worth every penny and great for a special occasion or a good ol' fashioned splurge. I'll be saving up my burger and nacho money from now on and putting it in the L'Atelier fund!",1
5,Delicious food in an elegant setting.  The service was terrific.  My only regret is that I couldn't eat more...,1
3,"Went there with my girlfriend. I was expecting delicious food and a good atmosphere as the owner is one of the most reputed Michelin-Famed chefs. 
The food was excellent and I don't regret the fact I chose to go there to eat something delicious. Even if a bit pricy for what it was.
Unfortunately, the service was not what I was expecting for.
They have ""bar"" tables in front of the open kitchen and room tables, they didn't ask about our preference but just ""your seats are here"". If some people enjoy to see guys cooking food, I definitely don't recommend it as it quickly becomes really hot and all what you want to do is to leave the restaurant.
You can hear ""Service, s'il vous plait"" a large amount of time during your dinner, each time a plate has to be served. I don't know if it's to add something to the ""show"", but that's a way too much, and the french food doesn't require it.
Other than that, you can expect to have good time there. Again, the food was amazing :)",-1
5,"I decided to treat myself to a 'nice' dinner. This was far beyond my expectations- everything was perfectly prepared and presented. The staff was knowledgeable about the food and appropriate wines to accompany the food. 
It's a fantastic space focused on the kitchen. I sat at the bar, which I never do, ans wan amply entertained and intrigued by the mastery that was happening in there. It was like watching performance art. I highly recommend it, and will no doubt be going back in the near future!",1
5,Wow! This was an amazing dining experience with a rock star chef. My date got the egg with caviar apertizer that was a true work of art and tasted even better. I got the scalops with pumkin risoto that was so awesome! The deserts were equally impressive...we got the soufle and the chocolate dome. I hope to be able to go back again while im in london!,1
4,"What a great experience, both at the bar and later the restaurant.  Cocktails were excellent and I highly recommend starting your night in the bar; I actually wish we had more time there before our table was ready.  The menu is extremely flexible.  They offer two tasting menus (either 5 or 8 courses), both available with or without wine pairings.  They also offer items a la carte, including both small plates and entrees.  Like most places, they expect all members of your party to do either the tasting menu or a la carte but not a mixture.  We ended up ordering a la carte and asked the sommelier to pair wines with each dish.  The sommelier totally nailed the pairings.   Some of the dish highlights include the seared scallop, the lobster ""ravioli', the hot foie gras, and the filet.  Easily earns its Michelin star.  Expensive for sure but you get what you pay for here.",1
5,"Visited the new bar upstairs for some post work drinks. Very delicious. It's small and intimate and they're just opening up an outdoor terrace. Will be nice if the weather actually gets better.
Also had a few bits from the bar tasting menu.
The bar upstairs is perfect for a couple or a few friends. Not a place for a big group but wonderful place for catching up with a friend or two. Highly recommend the spicy martini!",1
5,"Amazing evening! The food is beautifully made, delicate and amazing flavors, pricey but worth every penny!",1
3,"This restaurant suggest a variety of French classics in a
reasonably price. Our family visited this place to spend our dinner. And I can't go wrong, I always remember this
place, for they servedone of my favourite foods.They also had a friendly and attentive
staff and it is the key for aneffective restaurant! The food was flavourful and
very affordable priced, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was
lovely. Verygraceful, but in a simple way! All that you want was almost there, surprising
and delicious foods, reasonablecharges, and a good environment. So what are you
waiting for, it is a highly suggested place for everyone.",-1
5,"We went to La Cuisine de Joel Robuchon, which is on the first floor, on a Friday evening.  The food was creative and just great .  The service was attentive and friendly, despite the French wait staff.  The decor was interesting, like sitting in a kitchen.  The first floor restaurant was less busy, and we were told to have the same menu and food as the downstairs - L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.  
The 2 of us had 8 dishes to share, and created our own tasting menu.  The bill including 3 cocktails, which were also very tasty, came to GBP138, which I thought was reasonable given the great food and the Michelin 2-star status.
The night before we went to the Gordon Ramsey Maze, and the price was about the same, and the food was terrible in comparison to the food here.
Definitely worth a visit.",1
5,"I had my Graduation meal there last night with my parents and my partner and I can't even find words to describe how amazing it all was.
 Firstly the cocktail list is very intelligently put together and I had an apple sour that had a shot glass full of Moscato Jelly! The textures and the sweetness offset the sourness of the apple cocktail beautifully. It was so clean and refreshing on the palate and very well mixed so there wasn't such an alcoholic back draft after each sip.
 The Rooftop bar too made all the difference especially in this hot, sultry weather. It was tranquil up there as well as nice and cool. L'Atelier is seriously one sexy place in terms of decor as well as everything else.
 If you want to take someone here to impress them then this would be a sure fire way. From the moment you enter the doors to the moment you are seated, the place seems to do a good job in seducing you in every single way.
 The food is a great concept too. We opted not to have the tasting menu on account that there was a bit too much Foie Gras in it (3 dishes had it in there) and we wanted to sample the other things a little more.
 My only criticism is that I felt that the tasting menu lacked imagination to provide 3 dishes with Foie Gras and before anyone states the obvious, I know it is a French restaurant in essence!
 That aside I felt between us we all chose well. We had a crab guacamole which was delicate and very beautifully presented, scallops and squid that were cooked to absolute perfection - I have never had squid melt so gently in my mouth. If this was to be a food erotica gastronomical moment then I would have sent my taste buds to Coco De Mer to be whipped, teased and tingled to a culinary orgasmic afterglow.
 There was another scallop dish too which had a baby leek, caviar, gently seasoned seared scallop and a lovely buttery lemon sauce that was like eating a slightly savory equivalent of something like lemon curd. It was delicate and gentle but gently cleansed the palate against the salty caviar. I could have eaten that dish a million times over.
 We tried the little hamburgers that had some foie gras and to go with that we had a lovely bottle of Pomerol. It is my absolute favorite red wine ever and it was so smooth it would have given James Bond a run for his money. For our mains we had Black Cod that was divine, some Veal that was beaten and topped with a salad and the veal was so good and so vegetarian friendly that it was more than suitable as a veggie option for one of our open minded members of our party.
 We were also served a delightful pot of mash that was so velvety and rich we literally found ourselves licking the pot clean. The french really know how to make potatoes taste good!
 We also had cheese, which was nicely ordered and slightly strong that was accompanied by some rather divine walnut bread.
 But for me the Chocolate Profiterole with vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell was the most amazing dessert ever. They poured chocolate over a chocolate shell which made the sauce that covered the profiterole and to say it was fantastic would be a complete understatement of the century. I rarely eat chocolate desserts either but this is going down as the best one I have eaten ever!
 There was also a yuzu mousse that was zingy and that was accompanied by a raspberry sorbet as well as a rum baba and meringue sphere that was accompanied by a 'multivitamin' sorbet which I suppose was there to make the diner feel a sense of some health after consuming the delicious calories offered.
 But saying that when you go for a dining experience like that it is about the food and the calorie counts will go out of the window.
 I would definitely go back again and it was certainly a graduation to remember!",1
4,"Joël Robuchon is kind of a big deal, as he's pretty much the most well-respected chef of his generation and was named ""Chef of the Century."" He's got restaurants all over the world, most of which have one or two Michelin stars. The two-starred London location is right by Piccadilly Circus, and upon arriving for my 1:30 pm seating, I took a seat at the bar, which is set right in front of the open kitchen. After placing my orders for the £28, three-course lunch prix fixe menu, I was served an amuse bouche, which is another thing about fine dining that appeals to my inner cheapass (more food!). Consisting of a spoonful of a potato-fish purée, the amuse bouche tasted very much like a white fish spread, and it was a tasty first bite. Served a bread basket consisting of white, wheat, and olive breads, I found myself going back for the olive bread again and again. I must have gone through four or five pieces of the olive bread before my meal was done; that's how good it was. And also because, well, unlimited bread!
For my first course, I went with what the waitress described as one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Described as ""Egg cocotte topped with light wild mushrooms cream,"" this dish was mind-blowingly good, and it's no wonder that it is a signature dish. A soft-poached egg nestled in a bath of creamy soup along with mushrooms and asparagus slivers, this was the highlight of the meal and had me using bread to sop up every last drop of soup.
My entrée, described as ""Razor clams fricassee with confit tomatoes, sweet onion, and macaroni,"" (pictured at top) was like a refined version of a pasta dish that you'd find at The Cheesecake Factory. I don't say that to slight the dish, but it just wasn't as creative or elaborate as the other courses I enjoyed. The creamy sauce actually tasted very similar to a vodka sauce, and the razor clams were cooked nicely. While I usually am not a huge fan of cilantro, I found the cilantro-bread crumb mixture on the razor clam shell to be quite refreshing.
For dessert, I ordered the ""Fresh strawberry and pistachio cream cake with mascarpone ice cream."" The beautifully-presented dish was just as appealing to the taste buds as to the eyes, as the moist interior of pistachio cake was really quite tasty, especially when paired with the fresh strawberries and sweet ice cream. I wasn't particularly crazy about the outer pastry layer, which I found to be a bit tough, but everything else about the dessert was superb.
Walking away from my meal at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, I can say that I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and service, which was friendly and helpful throughout the lunch. Okay, so perhaps the restaurant would be better served by not applying foam to nearly every dish, and £28, or about $45, is definitely close to the maximum amount for how much I'd be willing to pay for a three-course lunch prix fixe, but all in all, I was quite pleased with my lunch. Whereas Restaurant Week prix fixes tend to be disappointing and underwhelming, year-round prix fixe deals at restaurants like L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon mean that there's no need to fight the crowds and muck your way through mediocre food. Overall, this is a good-value prix fixe that gets my recommendation.",1
4,"The food was mouth watering as was the preparation and delivery. I only give it 4 stars because the restaurant was too dark and the seats were uncomfortable. Otherwise, a perfect 10!",1
5,"This was a well-rounded experience with delicious offerings, great service, and entertainment.
I enjoyed the pre-theatre deal at L'Atelier which included 2 courses for 28 pounds or 3 courses for 32 pounds.  I thought this was a great deal considering the accolades and 2 Michelin stars owned by this establishment.
My party was seated at the bar, which surrounded the kitchen.  This kept us entertained as we watched the kitchen staff put together our meal.  
For my starter, I had the warm asparagus salad with nuts and iberian ham.  It was well balanced and tasty.  My dining partner had Scottish salmon carpaccio, which I enjoyed more.  It was both refreshing and texturally interesting.
For the entree, I had the roasted cod bouillabaisse which sat atop a potato disk.  The bouillabaisse was really nice, with just the right amount of seafood flavor.  The fish was cooked expertly and I enjoyed the texture of the potato in the mix.  Our other entree was the braised pork belly, mild spices and served with celeriac mousseline.  This was very rich, unexpected in flavor, and all around enjoyable.
Lastly, the highlight of the meal was the dessert - Coulis and mousse of mango, Joconde biscuit and exotic sorbet.  The different textures of the mousse, sorbet and biscuit made the perfect, fruity, not-too-sweet bite!  I loved it!
I felt extremely satisfied after my meal here and can't wait to go back and work my way through more of the menu (and maybe re-visit that mango dessert).",1
5,"There is really only one experience from my first year in London that is worthy of my 100th review.  We went to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon back in March when we were first getting our feet wet in the London food scene.  Of course, I've been writing and rewriting the review, and it's been sitting unfinished in my account for nearly a year now--what can I say, I have an amazing talent for procrastination.  I wasn't sure (am still not sure) that I can do our experience the justice it deserves.  So, without further ado... my best London food experience of 2010.
The hubs and I made a pact that our time in London is going to be one of great experiences.  Chalk the first one up for Mr. Robuchon, one of the greatest culinary minds in the world.  We went to London's L'Atelier for my birthday in March. My husand has been to the one in Tokyo several times, and absolutely adores it.  We were seated near the far end of the sleek and sexy bar on the ground floor.  I was a little perturbed that we hadn't been seated in the empty seats smack in the middle of all the action.  My mind was quickly changed.
Nearly every seat at the bar has an amazing view into the kitchen.  Sitting to my right was a very well dressed Frenchman chatting it up with the sommelier.  Next came another European couple that took the two seats next to my husband.  Both impeccably dressed... the girl about twenty and the man somewhere in his late-40's.  Of course, I suspected the worst.  But after a couple glasses of champagne, we discovered that they were actually father and daughter, and the guy was Robuchon's business partner.  At which point, Robuchon made an appearance from the rear of the kitchen. He chatted with us for a few minutes. We mainly discussed the amazingness of the Chicago dining scene (he's tried repeatedly to open a place in Chicago to no avail--please keep trying! is all I have to say to that).
At this point, the evening becomes a fairly booze-fueled, and rather surreal experience.  We started the meal with the menu decouverte with the wine pairings.  This, however, was derailed after a few courses, because having made friends with the Monegasque father-daughter pair and the impeccably dressed Frenchman, who turned out to be one of Robuchon's most regular customers on the face of the planet--hey, if I could afford it, I'd make this place my own personal Cheers, too!--suggestions on what to try were made.  And wow, best, recommendations, ever! 
We ate rounds of butter-laden mashed potatoes and wondefully divine truffle dishes. The Frenchman was our ticket into samples of amazing, 20-year-old, first-growths served by the awesome Bulgarian sommelier. Of course, then he introduced me to ""Francois' Yuzu Souffle"". There really is nothing sexier than a Frenchman talking about souffles. And of course, Robuchon's pastry chef, Francois is a super crazy diva--a man diva, but a diva nonetheless. The man wears sunglasses in the restaurant and hits on the gorgeous women sitting at the bar in his spare time. Like I said, man diva. Anyway, it was one of the best things I have ever consumed. Done so perfectly, it was absolutely incredible. I cannot even do it justice talking about it. You'll just have to try it for yourself. 
By the end of the evening we had an open invitation to hang out in Monaco; a Polaroid with Joel Robuchon, that my husband proudly displays on his desk at work; and a bill that could have been far worse than it was (it was still the most expensive meal I've ever eaten). It was hands-down the best dining experience I've had in London so far. And while I can't promise anyone else the same experience, it is still my favorite fine dining restaurant in London, and my first recommendation to out-of-towners looking for a great experience. Robuchon is one of those chefs who wants his diners to love food as much as he does. And that in in itself is what makes this place so brilliant.",1
5,"If you love Fois Gras, and amazing wine, and service, and ambience.. in fact; if you like food - you will LOVE this place! I was spoiled for selection - not one but three fois gras options on the menu -each as delectible as you would imagine, truly melt in your mouth ah-mazing! My friend took me here and raved about it - and it definitely lived up to expectation. :)",1
5,"If you are familiar with L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, 
I'll highlight the main differences with the Paris rue du Bac mother-ship.
It's not just sitting at the counter around a plancha kitchen. They have a few small tables, and a bar/lounge. Which means that :
1) they take reservations.
2) you can wait in the lounge if no place is free!
For those who do not know Robuchon:
He is the most renowned French chef from the past quarter century. No less. You will not get very rich French classical cuisine. (and definitely not the over-creamy rendition offered to foreigners all over the world). But modern French cuisine at its best. You will be blown away.
For those not familiar with L'Atelier :
Similar restaurants been opened in Vegas, Hong-Kong, Taiwan and Tokyo. This is not the flagship 'High-cuisine' Robuchon restaurant ('La Table de Joel Robuchon', Michelin 3 stars), but a more convivial, less formal setting.  The Paris restaurant does not take reservations, for example... this one does.... 
You will still get a very refined and modern take on some French and international classics. 
A bit like tapas, you get to choose between small 'bites' and larger dishes. Mix and match, as much as you like / can afford.
The menus range from the 27 quids 'pre-theatre' offer to the gigantic menu Decouverte. 
The pre-theatre formula (27 quids) is definitely the best quality/price ratio food you're ever likely to get.
My advice is simple. GO!  If you can't get a seat right away, WAIT !
BUT. WHATEVER YOU DO. DO GET THE MASHED POTATOES.",1
5,"I don't know what it takes to get three Michelin stars, but i believe this restaurant has done everything except bribe someone.  I ate here on Christmas Eve, and it was one of the few restaurants in London that wasn't doing a set menu, and I was glad they weren't.
The restaurant itself is beautiful with a very unique setup on the lower level.  It has the appearance of a high end sushi bar, but with a warmth that you don't generally find in Japanese restaurants.  The majority of the seating is at the bar with a few scattered tables throughout the downstairs.  I believe the upper levels are all table seating.  I would recommend sitting at the bar.  It is a unique setting.
There is an open kitchen that is actually inside of the seated bar, but separated by a small run in which the waiters and sommelier's pour drinks, take your order, and expedite your food.  Essentially, you still see the Chef's working, but you get a real waiter.  The service was spectacular.
This was one of the largest wine lists I have ever seen for a small restaurant.  They must have somewhere between 200 to 250 wines available by the bottle.  They have both red and white wines from every major wine region in the world, but (of course-Joel Robuchon) the majority is made up of French wines.  I am not very well versed in French wines so I requested the assistance of the sommelier.  I gave her a very short description of what I like and she immediately pointed us to a 2008 Sancere that was a perfect choice.
The first dish was a black truffle and endive salad followed by a scallop carpaccio in lemon oil.  Both were amazing.  The next was a pumpkin soup, it was my least favorite.  I want to be very clear in saying ""least favorite"" as opposed to ""worst"" because even being my least favorite; had this dish been served in 98% of the other restaurants I frequent it would have been the best dish.  We followed with a lobester ravioli with savoy cabbage and a foie gras reduction, which was flawless.  Finally, we had black cod with a cauliflower puree (it was the tits)..
No flaws to be found anywhere in the service, atmosphere, or food.   We ate at ""Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's"" the previous evening.  That restaurant was good, but not great.  It was what happens when a really great chef is no longer in the kitchen; some laziness in the dishes.  The best dishes at Ramsay's were the off menu amus bouche and pre-desert.  IThis had me greatly concerned when we went to Joel Robuchon's the next night.  I thought: ""Well he isn't going to be in the kitchen so the food may be suspect.""  That couldn't be father from accurate.  Amazing food, kudos and my highest compliments to the staff, both kitchen and floor.",1
5,"This is a place to go for an experience. We went for lunch and the damage to the wallet was diminished with their 28 pound ($42) prix fixe. 
Really, you go to be stroked and coddled. They did and we felt like royalty (funny we were in London). The restaurant is gorgeous. The Mondrian inspired wall art with spices is original. The wall of ivy (?) cascading down brings life and color into the dark room. But the clear vases displaying vegetables above the kitchen radiate with carrot rings, perfectly green fennel, orange bell peppers. 
I'm sure the menu changes frequently. However the best part of our meal was the unexpected vegetables that accompanied our main courses. It was a bowl of cooked radishes napped in butter and the slightest hint of vanilla. After endless meals of meat/potatoes in England these vegetables made me so happy. 
After our entrees they invited us upstairs to the lounge to have our desserts. They went out of their way to provide the pregnant wife with enough pillows to support her back. Definitely would return!",1
4,"Summary: 3-course prix fixe lunch menu for £28, great interesting food.
Came on a Sat. around noon to try to lunch prix fixe solo. Got the egg cocotte, pollack stuff w/ squid ink, and a chocolate dessert. Also came w/ an amuse bouche and a bread basket with four types of bread and a great salted butter. All of the food was interesting, tasty, visually appealing, and well-prepared.
Service was friendly and pretty good, other than not filling up my water without having to ask (not a big deal, just not what I'd expect at a two Michelin star place).
Would come back again.",1
5,"L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon is one of my treats to myself when I'm in the mood for a wonderful gastronomic experience in London. It is a short walk from Leicester Square or Covent Garden tube stations.
I can see what other reviewers mean when they say that there is a bit of pretension here (Michelin star, etc) but I've never experienced anything but courteous and meticulous service when I come here - and once *gasp* without a reservation!
The best deals here are the lunch specials and the pre-theatre menu. I prefer to come for lunch since it is more relaxed. The food is always beautifully presented, absolutely delicious and very creative. My cousin, who detests fish dishes, will come to L'Atelier and devour their fish courses without complaint and even want more! 
I like to order a cappuccino after my meal, but I must admit that it's more for the accompanying house-made caramel than for the coffee itself. 
My one tiny complaint is that something in the L'Atelier restaurant seems to irritate my eyes - they get very dry and itchy. I'm not sure if it's the proximity to the open kitchen (onion fumes?), the lighting or some combination of both. I don't have this up in La Cuisine (or when I leave and step outside into natural light). Odd, isn't it? Ah, but I will suffer itchy eyes for the delicious food here!",1
5,Unbelievable dining experience. You've gotta do a tasting menu and get it paired with wines from Europe.,1
4,"My approach to restaurants that are SORT OF A BIG DEAL has always been to feign ignorance and not let my inner fangurl get the best of me. However, this was the second L'Atelier I've been to, though it must be said that the first was in Las Vegas so I'm not sure if the two experiences are even comparable. 
I arrived for lunch with a mid-sized group on a rainy afternoon and we were immediately seated (not too busy for a weekday). They were offering a type of set lunch with several courses, which all of us opted in for and turned out to be a great decision. After being well-oiled with several bottles of wine (though our server was rather stingy on the pours), we began feeeeeding. 
The bread basket (as expected) was amazing and contained a variety of bread choices. I'm a bit of a carb-hound so I was obviously delighted. The food was very rich and cream-based, which I guess is to be expected, and the portions (though moderate) pack a punch. Let's just say I was not hungry for the rest of MY LIFE/day. 
As others have mentioned before, the highlight may have been their mashed potatoes, which we all agreed were 90% butter and 10% potato. Either way, it was a decadent party in my mouth. I'm refraining from a five-star review because the service was rather lackluster. Though our group occupied two tables side-by-side, we had different servers and the other table's server was noticeably more attentive and GENEROUS WITH THE WINE POURS (yes, I am apparently fixated on this point). 
The venue was obviously decorated by the same quirky set designer behind Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain (yeah wrap your head around THAT for a minute). What this means in reality is actually kind of hard to articulate but silly to witness so perhaps you should save yourself the Google image search and see for yourself.",1
5,"Hubby and I were delighted to land a reservation at this restaurant with a Michelin-famed chef.  It is tucked away on a quiet street near the theater district. The interior is posh and swank, with a very cool sushi bar that is great for singles and watching the kitchen.  My husband is still raving about the cold avocado soup that he had as a first course.  All the chefs in the kitchen appeared to take incredible care in preparing their plates which were beautifully presented.   We blew some big bucks here, but it was worth it.",1
3,"This was my second trip to the London L'Atelier outpost -- it didn't measure up to the first.  The a la carte and the wine menus are not as extensive as it used to be; indeed, not as expansive as those of other L'Atelier locations (e.g., Hong Kong or New York).  This seems indicative to me of the short-cutting that London L'Atelier engages in, generally (e.g., non-existent truffle shavings on the scallops; three rather ""blah"" selections of bread; timing and temperature issues with entrees and frozen desserts, etc.).  
I was also sorely disappointed that our request (made at the time of booking of the reservation) to be seated at the counter was not honored when we arrived at the restaurant.
Not sure that I would go back to the London L'Atelier anytime soon -- especially when Robuchon's other outposts are so much better.",-1
4,"L'Atelier is a must do for a great dining experience.  
Searched through Yelp reviews and stumbled upon L'Atelier. Sounded fab and used the online booking tool to make a reservation. Unless you book far in advance, you're kind of stuck with either 1700 or 2100. Ah, what the hell...I'll do my workout and hit the restaurant at 2100--earn that decadent food! 
Since I was a table of one, they seated me at the bar which was fine with me though it is a tad cramped.  You're almost sitting in the lap of the person next to you.  One of my few recommendations would be to take a  couple of chairs out and give folks a tad more room.  The guy next to me elbowed me a couple of times.  BUT, you get this awesome view into the kitchen.  The service is very attentive as the variety of folks working behind the bar continually check on you.  Great looking wait staff also.
The food is simply amazing.  For a starter, I had a crab tourteau (15 pounds) that was crab meat with a blood orange topping.  For the main, I chose the lamb loin special of the day (34 pounds) which was a nice thick slice of perfectly cooked lamb loin.  While sitting there admiring the kitchen operation, I spotted this animal leg perched in a silver holder.  After inquiring from the hostess, found out that it was Iberian ham...YES PLEASE.  The sommelier recommended this flight of wonderful sherries.  Of course, something like that is going to set you back some coins...37 pounds to be exact...but well worth the experience as you just can't get Iberian ham in the States and our sherry selections tend to be crap.  
So...all totaled, four courses, wine pairings with each and a cocktail to start off the madness...175 pounds.  You only live once!!!",1
5,"Go for the fixed price lunch menu, and it will seem VERY affordable (for what you're getting) :)",1
4,I don't have that much more to add to the other reviews but really enjoyed the L'Ceuf and Roast Chicken.  Le Tropical was delightful but would recommend the Les Tartes if you're having the Menu Du Jour.,1
3,"I went here tonight with my Mum after sourcing the restaurant's pre-theatre offer on 
Lastminute.com
. Three courses for £27 at a Michelin starred place, courtesy of the 'chef of the century' doesn't sound too shabby to me.
We arrived a little early and had a drink at the salon bar upstairs. Just next to The Ivy, the place is hard to miss, but is surprising once you step instead. Any preconceptions about the kind of decor French cuisine might be served in are slashed immediately. L'Atelier is decked out in Oriental black and red, with the hostess & waiter's uniforms and beautiful Japanse plants to match.
The drinks upstairs were nice - the bar was nothing special, but empty and relaxing all the same.
Lovely service throughout dinner - as expected - and very tasty food. I had a country terrine with fresh bread, pickled mushrooms and redcurrant chutney, followed by haddock and mussels with pasta and a shelfish sauce. I finished off with a chocolate sorbet with mousse with a Oreo cookie crumb.
All very nice, but nothing that made me go 'wow'. I think my Mum picked the better dishes as she made yummy noises throughout eating. We had a nice bottle of white, but it was pricey at £38. 
I liked being able to see directly into the kitchen, and the chef's bar looked fun. I'd definitely go back to try the tasting plates, but I can't say it lived up to the over-hyped expectations.",-1
3,"It's a shame its fabulous reputation precedes it.  I can't help but feel disappointed.
Presentation was amazing.  Out of this world beautifully (and meticulously) composed.  
Unfortunately...  I took one bite of my main meal (white fish stuffed with basil and pinenuts) and was horrified.  In parts, the fish was translucent, lukewarm, chewy and definitely undercooked.  I took another small, cautious bite, and it was a letdown as much as the first.  I don't have a problem with sashimi, but I do feel like I need adequate warning.  If there's none, then I'll assume it's not supposed to be like that...
I really didn't know what to do.  Was it supposed to be like that?  In the end, I said something to a member of staff (as I couldn't stomach the idea of a third mouthful), and she vehemently said the fish was perfectly cooked.  Grudgingly she took it away.  I felt like I was in the wrong.
The manager soon visited me and profusely apologised, as did the chef who had prepared my meal.  A second was prepared, while my dining partner finished their meal.  To occupy me while I was waiting (and my friend who later had to wait for me to finish my main), the manager kindly and thoughtfully provided us with two complementary foie gras burgers.  But unfortunately I don't eat foie gras for ethical reasons.
All this aside though, and judging by the merit of the food alone, it wasn't anything special.  Food combinations were boring, ingredients were common, I didn't savour each bite, and it was pretty average.  It was just beautifully plated in a fancy setting.",-1
5,"the desserts, come here for a few appetisers but focus on the desserts because they're not only creative, but damn delicious and is what you'd expect from fine dining.
one of my must go when traveling abroad.",1
5,Worth the money. Amazing setting and great food. The pre-theatre deal is almost a steal. The wine list is amazing and has surprisingly affordable options,1
5,"No words to describe it... When we were sat at the bar, I was expecting the worst (I always find it awkward to sit at a bar - I feel it can be less personal and I hate people watching me eat...) but I need not have feared! We had the best seats in the house, since the kitchen is open plan - we got to watch all the food being prepared and really made us appreciate it more! This food is definitely an art form... I've never seen anyone select the right tips of some dill to place on a place before, nor have I ever seen anyone put tiny cubes of smoked salmon on a place using a pair of tweezers to get it in the right place...).  Sitting at the bar reminded me of sitting in a sushi bar in Tokyo, watching the chef make my sushi... 
The food blew me away - it looked amazing on the plate (almost too pretty to eat... almost) and tasted really good.  We had some tasting plates to share - my favourite was the crab wrapped in spicy turnip and the scallop carpaccio.  Definitely leave room for dessert! 
I'm amazed how full it was, just for lunchtime on a weekday... but totally worth it! The staff are great - they explain all of the specials, memorise your order and have fabulous accents (I'm still working out whether the accents were genuine or not...!).  My favourite thing about the whole visit is the apple theme - giant apples placed strategically around the restaurant, very juicy looking apples displayed in a bowl... is it any wonder that when asked what I would like to drink, I said apple juice?! 
Overall, we had a wonderful time and it's a fab place for a special treat! Give it a try! You know you want to!",1
5,"This was clearly one of the highlights in a while. Seated at the bar, you peek into the kitchen, looking at a group of gastro-surgeons about to carve and cut little works of art. It's all clean, sleek, modern - but unlike some reviewers, I didn't find it pretentious. It's French - but all in the best possible way.
And the food. The art. Aubergine caviar on coriander panna cotta is a flavour firework. Foie gras soft and rich, with a crunchy top. Jerusalem artichoke soup makes you sing. Highlights from the ""tapas"" menu were langoustine ravioli and milk-fed lamb, the latter as tender as a ripe pear. Desserts are all priced at £10, but each of them has a sweet wine recommendation for a surcharge of a few quid. Worth it. 
Speaking of worth - cheap is different. But then, you only live once. Eating at Robuchon makes this one life worth so much more, though.",1
5,"Outstanding. From arrival to departure, service was gracious and pleasant. Food was superb, and allowed us to choose from the a la carte for our 12yo, while 3 of us chose from small tasting dishes. Every mouthful was perfectly judged. Will definitely be back.
If only they could sort out the background music...",1
5,"Très magnifique! Outstanding all around. The whole wait staff, sommelier and chefs know exactly what they are doing here! It is a small and super intimate restaurant with the an open kitchen so if you want to watch edible art in action then sit at the bar. Do not eat all day if you want to do the tasting menu otherwise be brave and ask if the chef can prepare you something special, be adventurous!  You will not be disappointed. While it is dark and lounge-like inside it certainly doesn't cross onto the side of cheesy or kitsch.
A place for food lovers and those wanting something special and memorable without the cliche. I think there are even set menu promotions on other websites if your nervous about the price but definitely one of London's finest offerings!",1

 I love pre-theatre menus. How else would one be able to regularly dine at Michelin starred restaurants in London without for instance being a stock broker (before the credit crunch) or a professional footballer? One of these restaurants is L'Atelier de Joel Robouchon in the middle of the theatre district in Covent Garden just next to The Ivy which offers a 2 course set menu for 22 pounds, 3 courses for 27 pounds. The French chef Joel Robouchon who has achieved more Michelin stars than any other chef (25 if Wikipedia is to be believed) has restaurants all over the globe. Two of these stars are held by the London joint of L'Atelier Joel Robouchon. So believe me  my expectations were higher than high and I was looking forward to a stunning meal.
 The restaurant is impressively beautiful. The elegant and stylish dining area is dimly lit and decorated in a red and black theme (I was not so sure about the apples in the big bowl (see below) but what do I know about interior decoration?). There are high tables and bar stools and, around the central kitchen area, patrons are seated at the counter and can watch the chefs preparing their dishes.
 Sometimes the service in high end restaurants can be a bit patronizing but the service at L'Atelier Joel Robouchon was absolutely perfect. Obliging and polite and, when they brought as the wrong main course, three people came one after the other to apologise (which was maybe slightly over the top). Also a very nice touch was that, when the wine we had ordered was not available, the somelier exchanged it with a (very delicious) cheaper one. Even though we 'only' had the pre-theater menu, they did not rush us at all to leave after we had finished.
 Unfortunately the food was not as enjoyable and exceptional as I had expected. Of the 3 starters and 3 mains to choose from a very autumn-style, mushroom-based menu we commenced our meal with Egg Cocotte Topped with Wild Mushroom Cream. The soft-boiled egg was at the bottom of the glass topped with a very tasty mushroom cream. It was nice but did not blow me away and I did not like the consistency too much.
 The second starter also embraced the autumn theme: Wild mushrooms served with Puff Pastry consisted of perfectly cooked, delectable wild mushrooms on light pastry. This was rather enjoyable dish but again not terribly special.
 We choose two different mains: RS really liked The Razor Clams served with White Wine Emulsion and Leek Fondue. I only had a small taste of it, far too much dill for my liking.
 The Crunchy chicken breast with Curry Sauce and Pilaw Rice was rather mediocre. The nicely cooked chicken was too salty and the combination of elements of chicken katsu curry and the Indian influences of the Pilaw rice were not convincing, especially for a 2 star restaurant.
 Now the question is  if you have a pre-theatre/ good value set menu in a Michelin star restaurant, would you expect the set menu to be of the same quality as the a la carte? I do, and L'Atelier Joel Robouchon did not deliver. Does this mean now I have to save and go back to try the a la carte (assuming that the Michelin inspectors know their job)? Or do I just give up on old Joel?",-1
5,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was the best thing that happened to my fiance and I on our recent visit to London. The best thing that happened in our dining experience, that is. Being the foodies that we are, we did alot of research before we embarked on our trip and part of the process involved making reservations at must-eat places before we left Chicago for London. Needless to say, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was in our must-eat places.
We were seated at the bar. Actually, it's not really a bar either since you're not sitting in front of the bartender, but it's a high top counter that allows you to see all the action going on in the kitchen. What a fantastic experience seeing the kitchen crew prepping appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had baked clams with minced garlic and mushrooms and the clams were served on a thick bed of sea salt. I ordered an entree of spaghetti which will make you think, ""What?! You ordered spaghetti in a 2-Michelin star restaurant? How boring!"" But wait til you hear what the spaghetti came with: sea urchin! Sea urchin and spaghetti = divine. I've only had sea urchin sashimi-style in sushi restaurants and have always loved it. And now having sea urchin Joel Robuchon-style tops it all. The sea urchin was used to make the creamy and there were also bite-size pieces of sea urchin hidden in the sauce. When I bit into it, the texture reminded me of foie gras. I think they don't always have sea urchin on the menu because it seems like they constantly change what goes into the spaghetti. My fiance had fried langoustine, duck liver pate, and octopus salad which he all loved very much. For dessert, we shared the Rum Baba which was absolutely divine. The sponge cake was soaked with rum that you can actually taste very well. in fact, the rum was pretty strong. This was what stood out for me because it's not one of those desserts that claim to have liqueur in it although you can't really taste it. We also got Irish coffee to go with dessert. They have several types of alcoholic coffee drinks, depending on the several countries of origin of whiskeys they offer.
The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions. This place isn't pompous or pretentious at all. You can dress up fancy here or show up in jeans and you won't feel out of place. Ask to sit at the kitchen bar, if they don't already seat you there.",1
5,"I have to say that this restaurant single-handedly renewed my failing interest in French food. Everything was cooked to the exact millisecond for perfection and I couldn't help thinking, this is what French cuisine is really all about! Delicate, exquisite, satisfying. Each bite were mini explosions of all things wonderful in my mouth. 
Go there for their lunch menu where two courses are £19 or three for £25. With that and sharing a small tasting dish, we actually got to try quite a variety. 
+Egg cocotte 
+Sweet french onion soup with croutons (they pour the soup over the croutons when they serve it to you)
+Lobster (la langoustine) ravioli
+Suckling pig with polenta 
-Cod (was still very good but not mind blowing like the others)
Oh, and I really liked their bread basket, esp the mini baguette and ciabatta rolls! Seriously, we couldn't stop eating that bread.",1
4,"I heard they make fantastic cocktails, The L'egg coccotte was just amazing. good food with good vibe. Does create a hole in the wallet.",1
3,"This place is definitely not on the cheap side and the the portions of your meal is definitely not filling.  There are two sections to the menu, Tapas Style and Main Dishes.  They recommend that we order 8 tapas dishes (4 persons (2 of each)) and each order a main dish.  We elected not to take their recommendations and went with 4 tapas dishes and 2 main dishes.  It was still expensive, but fortunately, my friend picked up the tab since my girlfriend and I got engaged on the London Eye. (no, not where 30 other people were in the same capsule, but a private capsule)  
The food and ambiance was really good, but the service was less than stellar.  I would give them 4 stars, but the service really made the experience disappointing.  Our server took way to long to greet us.  We ordered cocktails in the beginning and that took forever.  Our server apologized and I looked over to some other tables and I noticed that there was bread at the table.  I asked if the bread was complimentary and she said it was and then she asked if we would like some.  We were starving at this time and we definitely wanted some!  If our experience was better, then I would've definitely given this place at least 4 stars.",-1
5,"Fantastic service, delicious food, and pleasant ambiance. I dined alone on a business trip, had no issues with splitting check into alcohol/food. Great wines and pairings.",1
5,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is perfectly poised near the Ivy. Although an international chain, it has that swanky, sultry glam factor matched with tiny plates of extreme deliciousness (including the truffle mash, allegedly 90% butter). Best seats are at the bar and witness the cheffy chefs at work. Not cheap though. (

4,"It's absurdly expensive, but if you've chosen to come here, this should not be a surprise.   It's great gastronomic fun to try the ""small tasting dishes"" but don't flinch when you see your bill and your stomach's still a-rumbling.  Even certain ""main"" plates are miniature.  This is indeed a fancy French tapas spot (with extraordinary food).  
What may come as an annoying surprise is that one scallop costs nearly as much as a generous plate of steak tartare, or that the sea bass - a ""main"" dish like the steak tartare - is just a small square and sets you back £30.  It's impossible to choose wisely with an eye on both your hunger level and budget unless you've been here a load of times (or have tried most of the dishes).  I've done neither, but I can tell you this:  if you like red meat - and your heart is good shape - you will never regret having the mini foie gras burgers and the steak tartare.  Eat it downstairs at the atmospheric bar.  And if you're not alone, split this and the cheese plate.  You'll be full and not too broke - but please eat your fruit and veg the next day.",1
5,"Michelin 2 stars, the only 3star in London is Gorden Ramsey, but if you're the type to book months before [called 5 times and was offered a table minimum 2 weeks away], get on the list, I'm not booking months in damn advanced [only open 4 days a week], i ate in a lot of 3 star Michelin restaurants and didn't book more than a day or better yet the same day, so we're here at Joel, the food presentation is five star, the food is 4.5 star.
The service is all synchronized and you don't have one waiter, all employees know whats going on, it can be a minus at some point..
The food presentation is really amazing and five star, seeing the executive chef preparing with his team of about 10 chefs prepare all the dishes is really cool and entertaining, also love the bar style seating, all friendly together.
The portions are tapas style and small, but really good. The martini menu is extensive and has some exciting mixes. The tasting menu [which the executive chef Olivier Limousin did me a solid, and made it for me alone, which usually is only done for the whole table [party] as it is a complex and hard menu] has some really award wordy dishes.
Why five star? ok because it's the best tapas I've ever eaten, it don't get better then this. Yes 105quid for a nine dish tasting menu is quite high but totally worth it. If you say this is no tapas, than it's a four star restaurant.",1
5,This was a delicious meal! We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching all the dishes get prepared. We will definitely return.,1
5,"If you are someone who really loves gourmet fine dining, this is the place for you. The food was brilliant. We had the tasting menu with the wine parings and every dish was incredible. The fois gras with the red wine reduction was to die for and the wine parings were impeccable.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen in action. All of the staff were extremely skilled and were wonderful! We also very much enjoyed conversing with other diners who were seated next to us. Three cheers for Chef Joel Robuchon! I hope to visit his restaurants in New York and Paris, next time I am there.",1
4,"This place is pretty good, but I can't say it was quite worth the price. The location is beautiful, managing to be both classy and colorful. Good quality overall, but some of the dishes were inconsistent and/or lacked imagination (e.g., the sea bass was basically blah). I found the desserts to be their main strength, and the service was adequate. While a nice and classy restaurant overall, I put this place in the category of restaurants to which I would only return if someone accompanying me insisted on it.",1
5,"Merry Christmas to me! I have to say that it does not take a lot of convincing for me to give this place 5 stars. Bob and I were in London over the holidays and I saw that not only was there a reservation available at L'Atelier, but that there was also a price fix menu we could take a part of. We (naturally) decided to go with the price fix menu with the European wine flights and sat on the first floor - at the counter concept restaurant. The feel is very loungy - dark red, black and dim lighting. The counter wraps around the entire kitchen and you then have the added benefit of watching the talented chefs prep your food. Although there is a slight downside... you do get to see how much fantastic butter is being used. The food was absolutely beyond amazing. Everything tasted delicious, fresh, inventive - all the good adjectives that you would use to describe a great meal. The highlight of the meal was the mashed potatoes. OMG. These were probably the best potatoes I have ever had in my life. Sadly, the server thought that we were done and did snatch away our remaining spoonful... I literally thought about jumping over the counter and tackling her for that last morsel. It sounds ridiculous that mashed potatoes could be that good, but these were velvety smooth and just absolutely delicious. We were a little surprised by how many white wines were in the flight, but everything was paired beautifully. The service was very good - it was very different than the traditional table seating since we didn't have an assigned server per se. It was more casual than the food suggests, but still prompt and friendly. Overall, if you're looking for a fancy night out - or just in the mood to treat yo'self - check out this restaurant. And be prepared to latch on to those potatoes with an iron grip!",1
3,"Went during restaurant week (coincided with an offer for the pre-theatre set menu). Being a two-Michelin-starred restaurants, I was expecting a really blow-you-out-of-your-mind experience, but the restaurant didnt quite deliver.
 The food was very artfully presented, and you can watch them cooking the food and searing things in the open kitchen. The restaurant decor was beautifully done, with a large living wall on the far end.
 But a couple of things put me off. One was the service was a bit too smarmy. Maybe I am just a troglodyte, but I dont need people hovering over me with every step and course constantly checking to see if I was OK, or if I needed anything. I suppose there are people out there who require this sort of attention to validate themselves, but I dont care for it; it was almost as if they were willing to cut my meat for me, and maybe even pre-chew it for me so that I wouldnt have to lift a finger. If that is what 2 stars gets you, then I can give it a miss.
 The other thing was that the portions are a bit small and the food did not blow me away. I was expecting every bite to be a mouth orgasm, but that didnt happen. Go there if you need to impress someone, and go there if you are the type that needs to be seen at michelin-starred restaurant. But dont go if you expect a full belly at the end of your meal.",-1
4,"My only visit here was not on a happy occasion. One of my best friends was leaving London (under less than ideal circumstances), and he wanted to have a treat at a good restaurant on his last day in town. He found out about a two course lunch offer for £19, and we walked in for my first visit to a michelin 2 star restaurant.
It takes a while to find this place, tucked away as it is in one of the many otherwise unknown alleys around leicester square.
The seating was unusual. Everybody were seated in tall stools next to the bar. I don't know what the purpose was, as it was pretty uncomfortable. We didn't interact with the chef ... but the guy who was serving us did spend quite a lot of time around us ... the attention was evident.
The food was exactly as i have come to expect from good french restaurants in London ... very good ... very tasty ... and very little. It tingles your taste buds, and leaves you craving for more (and if you indulge, be prepared for bankruptcy :p). The wild boar and foie gras was something i hadn't had before and i really liked it. 
With the wine and the dessert, our bill came to northwards of £40 per head even with the discount offer, so you can guess how expensive this restaurant usually is, but totally worth a visit (my friend had a pleasant last lunch in London) .",1
4,We had a 5* service from the moment of our arrival.  Good wine list without being the best like in NYC.  Robuchon has a great pride in his cuisine and it shows in every single plate!,1
5,"A magnificent restaurant, well-deserved of two Michelin stars. We sat at the bar, which provided a unique dining experience. Watching the meal preparation provided a greater appreciation of the culinary process.",1
4,"Great food and very cool decor. The duck ragout gratin was a standout!
Ordered the dessert tart selection, good but not remarkable.",1
4,"Hmmmm. For mere mortals, you can't look at l'Atelier Joel Robuchon in a purely comestible-based light. Wonderful though much of the food is, when you come to settle up at the end of the evening... well... can you feel that hollow sensation around your upper torso? That's where all your money used to be, as you just shelled out over £200 on dinner for two. And I didn't even have a digestif.
 It's a sort of Japanese-styled succession of very, very tiny French tasting dishes. Sorry, I should explain: not Japanese food, but served in a restaurant that's as close to being a bento box interior as I've ever seen. Now I know how salmon teriyaki feels.
 You're brought these tiny, delicate little courses, and you have this sort of explosion of taste, then it goes away, and you have some more wine, and wait for the next one. We ordered 2 mini-things and one more substantial course each and I have to say that we left feeling sated, if not (whisper it) full. Maybe it was just the sensory overload. Don't worry... neither felt the urge to scoff a pizza on the way home.
 It was a real experience, and one I'll think back to fondly on more than one occasion. If you're being taken, go easy on the paying partner though. You don't HAVE to order the lobster.",1
5,As good as you'd expect from an amazing chef such as Joel Robuchon.  Took some clients here for dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  The service is amazing and it is a fantastic space.,1
2,"I went here as one of the three others that I was with suggested it for our monthly michelin meal and as they do a three course for £25 pre theatre menu we could not loose
We were wrong - we lost £50 each for a large mouth full of not very good food
I started with the wild boar terrine with foie gras - poor flavour, foie gras flavour and texture was completely lost and the wild boar lacked something - it didn't work
My main was 
Pan fried hake parsley roots purée, crunchy hazelnuts.  My hake was perfectly cooked and delicious though the accompanying 5 hazelnuts and a teaspoon of puree left one wanting more.  
One us received their hake raw and when he called the waiter over the waiter knew before my friend had said anything and just picked up the plate and said 'Not cooked?' and swept it away, I guess that it is not that unusual in this restaurant
Desert was so so sponge with chocolate though two of my group thought it was very nice.
A bottle of wine and some tea and coffee and £50 each and we all went home and had something to eat.
Service was good friendly and helpful though somewhat slow
None of us will visit again
Clos Maggiore knocks spots off of it",-1
3,"I have been hearing stories about Robuchon himself regarding the myth etc. When I heard that l'atelier after Paris has opened in London, 2 things came in mind.. 
1. Wow!
2. Is it another business-man opening branches??
 Tried L'atelier twice. The ambience is really nice and cool, with modern and innovative decoration. Its more of a place to chill and have a bite instead of a proper long-stay dining place. 
You can sit on a bar or tall tables with stools, it's fine though, you enjoy.
 The mythological-must-try-speciality is the potato puree.. I know sounded weird to me as well but its really an interesting story!
 Everything fair and good enough till here. Now the downside. 
Although the food very good and tasty the portions. GOD really tiny ! And yes I know what gourmet kitchen is and what the word L'Atelier stands for. The story is that you cannot really sell L'atelier-styled food and charge for 2 big portions! Come on! 
From my experience so far this is the restaurant with smallest portions, except if you try the steak which will probably compensate a bit to your stomach. 
The two stars missing from my rating is because of the relation Price/Quantity. 
You really wouldn't wanna go there on empty stomach!
 Overall: A nice place with comfortable environment BUT very bad relation of Price vs Quality/Quantity.",-1
3,"The restaurant is quite stunning, a japanese red and black lacquer theme running throughout. Bathrooms are also absolutely beautiful. As a vegetarian my view is probably slightly slanted, I had the deep friend hens egg, followed by the leek terrine, both were interesting dishes (very flavourful), but not great. The others (who ate meat!) enjoyed their meal much more.
 Can't really add much more than the others have already written, except for they do a set lunch which is £19 for two courses or £25 for three. A good way to sample the food before you come here for a more expensive dinner.",-1
5,"The L'Atelier location in London is ten times better than the one in Vegas. So if you've been to the one in Vegas and didn't like it, then give this location a try. It's definitely worth it. It's about 8 courses and like the Vegas location you can sit at the bar and watch them make your food. The dishes that stood out for me here were the foie gras, butternut squash soup, quail and of course dessert. The dessert was ice cream mixed with a bunch of good things and sprinkled with Oreo crumbs (yum!). I give this place a B+. Just about everything tasted as good as it looked.
anitaeat.com",1
5,"L'Atelier is both a great food and ambience experience.
Maybe ease into it by trying their incredibly value for money pre-theatre diner (until 6.30 -7pm if you're lucky) that gives you an overview of their excellent food.
Or go for the tapas style mini dishes that will undoubtedly blow your mind (if not your appetite). The Egg or the Burger are to be recommended, as is the purée (50% potatoes, 50% butter!).
Sit at the bar, watch the cooks cautiously prepare your plate and relax, it's well worth it (also, note they have a vertical garden on the wall, very trendy!)",1
4,"Right around the corner from the Ivy, this place is something special. The food is spectacular, and the dining areas are sumptuous. The greenery and the colours on the ground floor will make you feel extra special. The service is typically French (a bit blase and well not quite up to the American service standard, but still better than most London restaurants).
 The bar upstairs is also very special. Very expensive, but well worth it. The lamb is spectacular, and the mash that comes with is buttery and delicious. Don;t miss the foie gras burger...mouthwatering.
 After Petrus, this is my favourite fine dining restaurant in London.",1
5,"A couple of my friends and I were vacationing in London and we decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.
We ordered the pretheatre menu, which came with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert for £25.  It's definitely a little expensive for a 3 course meal, but it's actually not too bad considering the fact that it's a very famous and renowned restaurant.
They started my meal with this amazing French onion soup.  The soup was served with crispy cheesy garlic croutons floating on top.  The crunchiness of the croutons was definitely a nice complement to the creaminess of the soup.  For my entrée, I ordered their flat iron steak, which was cooked to perfection, topped with caramelized onions, with creamy potato gratin on the side.  I have to say that it was the best flat iron steak I've ever had EVER!  It was tender, juicy, and well flavored.  I could tell that they used very simple ingredients to season the meat because the natural taste of the steak was preserved and didn't get over overpowered by the seasonings they used.  The potato gratin was very delicious as well.  It was very creamy and cheesy, yummy!  At last, they served this chocolate mousse/ice cream thing for dessert.  I still don't know the name of the dessert or exactly what's in it until this very day.  All I know is that the dessert was so amazing that it blew my mind away.  It was creamy, chocolaty, and crunchy (crisped rice, I think).  Overall, it was an amazing meal!",1
1,"I don't know where these other reviewers ate but it was not the same place we did! While the food was tasty, the portions were a joke- almost the equivalent of a bite each.  The service was horrendous-snotty waitress and sommelier- and the cost ludicrously high.   I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact, my only recommendation would be to stay away.",-1
4,"Went here for lunch with a friend one afternoon.  The Egg Croquet was especially memorable and went well for my Duck Confei.  
Modern decor, but felt a bit sterile.  I would like to go back to see what the atmosphere is like in the evenings.",1
4,My wife and I ate there this past week and it was truly a wonderful experience with great food and attentive service. While we only had the 27 pound 3-course prix fixe lunch menu we will def try to come back for the more elaborate degustation menu.  Well worth a try and a really great atmosphere!,1
4,A bit too dark but the food is perfect,1
1,"We arrived five minutes late for our reservation full of apologies, and were told that our table was not ready and we would have to wait another 15-20 minutes for our table! We asked if this sort of thing happens often, and we were told that they didn't rush people along with our meal, later we found that this simply isn't true. From the moment we arrived, the staff treated us terribly badly; they were so hot and cold that my partner asked me: 'what have we done wrong?'  I am convinced that our waiter was high, he didn't blink once, was sweating profusely, had no idea of personal space and kept saying 'YUMMY, YUMMY' every time he put our food down. 
 As there was a delay in seating us we missed the 10 course menu, a real shame as the majority of what we ordered was terrible.  We were given a bread basket to start with, with no butter or oil, the French bread was so stale I would have reservations about feeding it to pigeons up the road in Trafalgar square! We both started with the Ravioli of Foie Gras in a chicken broth, this was terrible it reminded me of instant chicken and noodle soup.  I then had the stuffed clams- these were average, frankly I have had better at a local bistro. My partner had the lamb; he said the best part of this was the mash potato.  We both then finished off our mains with the quail stuffed with foie gras served with truffle mash potato, this was really very good, but completely ruined by the lack lustre service we received the truffle mash 10 minutes after we received the quail. The dessert was the lowest point of the meal and tasted like a tesco's finest chocolate cheese cake. 
This year we have eaten at Gordon Ramsay's Royal Hospital, The Vineyard, La Trompette and Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons (my personal favourite); if you have £150 per person to spend eat at any of these other places. We both felt terribly ripped off at L'Atelier.",-1
1,"No, seriously?
 I was disappointed by this restaurant. It is overpriced, and I use that term with care having happily paid far more for a meal elsewhere. I am happy to pay a lot of money for an excellent experience, but this just wasn't. This was mainly down to the service, which was indifferent at best - I'd've been unimpressed being served this way at a chain restaurant. It wasn't 'informal' - it was disinterested, cold and not even competent.
 The food was excellent. But I've had far better meals for less money in places which - crucially - had a far better atmosphere.
 We sat downstairs in the 'atelier' - perhaps things might've been better upstairs in the formal restaurant, but we chose downstairs because we wanted to try out a tapas-y approach to fine dining.
 The service spoilt this place for me. I actually refused to pay the service charge, for the first time ever. I am the sort of person who gets embarrassed when things are disappointing and I once didn't send back a still-frozen lasagne in a pub because I didn't want to offend anyone(!!!!!), so this is a big deal.
 I emailed to say how awful the service had been and someone wrote back offering us a free bottle of house champagne next time we dined there.
 Our meal, with wine, cost £200 for two. No ta.
 We went to Clos Maggiore a couple of weeks later to try to erase the bad memories and that was much better.",-1
1,"This was a very dissapointing experience. 
Shockingly so actually. 
To be honest i feel ripped off. 
I am willing to spend an obscene amount of money at a restaurant but only if i am blown away. In fact, not only was i nowhere near blown away but i can confidently say that i did not consume anything that was anywhere near memorable!
This restaurant is way overpriced for what is essentially quite average food.
My dining partner and I, opted for the tasting menu at £125 each. The amouse bouche seemed to signal a good start but unfortunately there was no highlight, no surprises, nothing really.
The inclusion of expensive ingredients (black truffle,caviar & alot of fois gras) was, I felt, a way of justifying the ludicrous prices. However, as a discerning diner i must say that if it was simply about the ingredients anyone can buy them for less and have them at home!
The point of making the effort and paying so much money is to sample great skill and creativity with great ingredients. Sadly, this was most definitely not the case at l'atelier. 
The reputation does precede this restaurant and one does expect alot, but at these prices one should!
I do not advise anyone to dine here. 
Having said that, i think that the fixed price lunch for £27 may not leave you with as bad a taste as i have been left with!
Total failure. In fact i can honestly say : APPALLING!!",-1
5,"Joel Robuchon's new London restaurant brings with it the 'atelier' or workshop approach to eating, when one sits at a counter and watches the chefs prepare the food a few feet away. It's common in Japan and works extremely well here, particularly as the leather bar stools are comfortable. The menu has a page of delicious small tasting dishes, which are basically half a starter size, to encourage you to have several. In fact one could eat entirely from the tasting dishes and try 90% of what's on the menu - but they are not cheap - between £10-20. We went for the £19 set-price lunch and experienced exemplary cooking - particularly a richly-reduced sweet onion soup. The waiter behind the counter was instantly accessible and although Hungarian, recommended an absolutely superb Grune Veltliner which came by the glass and caused us to spend much more on the wine than the food. The whole place (there is a standard-type restaurant and a bar as well) has a well-managed feel and with cooking and prices (at least at lunch) of that order, it should quickly become a favourite",1
5,"Very good restaurant where you can enjoy delicious french food!
The staff was delicate, polite and quite helpful! Such a pleasant atmosphere to have dinner with friends! The dining sections are sumptuous!If you wonder where to go out for dinner, choose this restaurant, you'll be amazingly surprised!",1
5,"Highly recommend this place.  Everything was excellent.  We did many small sampling dishes.  However, I would say that their seafood dishes outshine the others.  This sentiment was echoed by my husband (a true red meat fan) as well.   Desserts were excellent... can't go wrong with French desserts.",1
5,"we decided to treat ourselves here during our visit to london and it did not disappoint. the restaurant is down a somewhat sketchy alley in the bustling touristy area of covent gardens, but once inside you get quickly absorbed and lost in the cozy, dark environment. we were there for lunch but passed on the lunch tasting menu, instead we did small tasting dishes - everything we ordered was cooked to perfection: carpaccio (one of the best i've ever had, so flavorful and tender), egg cocotte (basically a poached egg topped with mushroom foam), ravioli with langoustine, lobster w/turnips. our favorite dish was the sliders with foie gras and caramelized onions. BEST sliders/burgers i've ever had! the bun was soft/fluffy, and every bite had the perfect amount of beef & foie gras.",1
5,"The Bar Boulud is located next to the Mandarain Oriental in Hyde Park area, London.
I have to say Daniel Boulud's Bistro has a nice open area on the floor, modern/hip style to it. Glad the group ate here and it is a GEM.  Oh and its close to Harrods!  
Yeah, I did have the James bond Martini, shaken!  lol 
The wines are great and as a group we bottles of the Chateau De Fonsalette, Cottes 1999.  Quite exquisite!
Appetizers - 
-rillons croustillants - (Its crispy pork belly) - Not surprised how delicious it was!
-foie gras, pork and truffle
-italian coppan sun dried tomato
-Gruyere cheese puffs
All  were delicious and amazing.. I recommend!  They have salads too.
Main course - 
-Sea bream a la plancha, almonds and romesco sauce (broiled/baked fish)
-harissa spiced lamb loin
Sides -
-pommes frites (couldnt resist)
-truffled mashed potato ( I know potato potato) can you blame me.
Dessert - 
Fleur pistache framboise - this was wrapped in a chocolate sphere and they poured more hot chocolate sauce on it which delicately opened the additional delicious sweetness hidden the sphere.  Yummy!",1
1,"Absolutely abysmal service... Even for London. 
Boulud in Manhattan runs circles around this joke of an eatery.  It should never take 20 minutes from being seated to be recognized and get in a drink order. 
The waitstaff is too busy talking amongst themselves to really care. 
Go elsewhere. There are too many decent brasseries in London to put up with this level of unprofessionalism",-1
3,"This is a great restaurant, when we stay at the Mandarin we love having breakfast here because Service, food and price point. As a couple who enjoys healthy salads and fish this would not be a good lunch spot for us. If you enjoy having a splurge I'd suggest diving into the burgers here. I personally have not experienced it but this is what this place is known for. Also a good place to have a pre dinner cocktail as long as there's not a company outing that's occupying all the seats at the bar.",-1
4,"Probably the best burger I had in London. The patty was just awesome and the foie gras perfectly complemented it. However, the fries were a bit weak and the price a bit high. I would however recommend it to anyone looking for a nice burger.
My girlfriend had the paperdella and she loved it. So this place is also much more than just burgers",1
5,"We were looking off a steakhouse for my kids and I who have gluten intolerance. The kid's steak dinner was prepared perfectly and they loved the gluten free bread. 
My escargot appetizer and my main course, cod, was amazing! Going back before we head home to California, for sure!",1
4,"Amazing food and lovely ambience. Servers are a bit snobby; however, the food is so delicious, I'll overlook the pretentious.",1
5,"Bar Boulud is just one outpost of renowned chef, Daniel Boulud's empire.  The French chef, who is originally from Lyon in the Rhone River valley, became famous in New York after moving there in the early 80s.  Boulud's centerpiece - three Michelin star restaurant DANIEL is located in NYC - but his empire spans the globe with locations in Florida, Singapore, Beijing, Montreal, Toronto and London. Bar Boulud sits in the ground floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park hotel, one of the poshest addresses in London's Knightsbridge area.
The Boulud American-inspired French bistro concept is a majorly relaxed and welcoming environment. And unlike many other restaurants in this price range, it attracts people who aren't dressed to the nine's and just want a chilled out, but very nice meal.  The slightly-underground Bar Boulud is designed to feel like a French wine cellar with vaulted ceilings and recessed, red-leather booths.  It's open kitchen does make things more lively than your average wine cellar.
I, of course, had the burger.  Bar Boulud features four delicious burgers on their regular menu, priced between £17 and £24. Now, this is pricey - it's prohibitively pricey.  And considering just a few short years back, the Boulud burgers were priced between £13-19, Boulud has realized that there is money to be made in a delicious hamburger.  
However, I do say that these burgers are worth it - considering the Hawksmoor burger for £15 without fries; Bar Boulud includes the pommes frites, and it's on par with Hawksmoor.  Boulud's beef comes from the Castle of Mey; aged Aberdeen Angus Cross chuck steak (grass and silage fed from the North of Scotland).
Their burgers include: the Yankee (£17) - a classic beef burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle on the homemade glazed brioche bun.  The Frenchie (£19) is topped with confit pork belly, tomato, and dijon on a morbier peppered homemade bun.  The Piggie (£19) piles bbq pork on top of the beef patty and then includes jalapeno mayo and cabbage on a cheddar bun.  And finally, the piéce de résistance is Boulud's £24 BB: a beef burger with foie gras, short rib meat, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes on a black onion seed bun.  
They also serve up a sampler of three burgers, cut in halves so you and some select friends can divide your attention amongst these four 8oz. burger delights.  The beef absolutely melts in your mouth and remains the focal point of the experience.  Even though the house-made buns are exquisite, they are purely a bit-player to the beef.  Even the toppings, though fresh and wonderful, are purely there for slight variation, not to overpower the burger patty.

5,"Bar Boloud is just amazing. I would actually think it's the best overall restaurant in London, because it's so excellent always, and also because it's a great fit for any occasion - from dinner with your mother, to a work beer, to a romantic date or business dinner. It can be a place to splash out for superb French food and expensive wine (they go up to £400 per bottle) but also to have probably the best value meal in London (the set menu is simply the best deal in London) with extremely good value wine serviced by the glass. So it's just perfect for any occasion. The French food is superb. Everything is great, from the fine dining cuisine to their burgers, and if you like a bit more rustic country food I can really recommend their sausages.
And the service is just always flawless and genuinely friendly and caring. I had a person in my party spill red wine on their expensive cashmere sweater, and one of the waiters solved it with some soda water - it was gone!",1
4,"Bar Boulud in 3 easy steps: 
1. Make a booking. 
2. Get the burger. 
3. Don't fuss too much about your attire, it's fairly casual in a nice way.",1
4,"About four or five times a year, I get an overwhelming craving for a burger. But being a lady of high standards, I want a burger that has real beef inside and I want to eat it in a nice restaurant on a plate. I can't stand plastic wrapping, or themed restaurants that try to pretend they're in America, when you can quite clearly see London buses going past the window.
Anyway, rant over, I was so happy with my burger at Bar Boulud. The texture was divine and there was just the right amount of lettuce and tomato with a delicious burger sauce. There are some more adventurous burgers on the menu, including one with foie gras inside, but I stuck to a Yankee burger with cheese and salad. Not that three bits of lettuce can be included as part of your five a day, but it probably saves some calories.
Saving calories on the main course is important as you'll want to indulge in a dessert. I had the chocolate lava cake, and held my breath to see if molten chocolate would oooze out as I've had some disappointing experiences with chocolate desserts recently. Thankfully, a river of chocolate flowed over the plate and I spooned up every last drop. A raspberry sorbet cleansed the palate so I could keep going back to the chocolate.
Not only was the food divine, but the location was a plus. As it is inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, which is just down the road from Harrods and Harvey Nichols, I expected it to be much more expensive than what it was. My Yankee Burger was just £18 though so it was cheaper than Burger and Lobster and some gastropubs. Service was excellent and the clientele were cool and civilised. 
Next time I'll go back a bit further after Christmas, so my stomach can handle a foie gras burger. It's the poshest setting for a burger I've found in London so far.",1
5,"This is a very hip, semi-casual place, for young attractive professionals, to come grab drinks and plates to share. The ambiance is lively and happening, in a classy environment. The bartenders behind the large bar, are ready to mix you a drink in a calm and engaging manner. Martinis are stirred, not shaken, and filled all the way up in a large chilled martini glass. I like when my bartender take his job seriously! All about first impression of the establishment. It's packed in here on a Wednesday night, and our large table is ready at 7pm sharp (19:00 Hours). Our French waitress is attentive, and so is the rest of the large wait-staffs. Four appetizers are ordered for the table: The Calamar is good but forgettable. The Petite Friture (Crispy White Baits W/Aioli dressing ) are tasty and a great table conversational piece. The Rillons Croustillants (Crispy Pork Belly on a stick) is a clear winner! The Boudin Noir has a surprising preparation and presentation, as its flat and seared? Innovative, but not rocking my boat...  Wife and I ordered the Piggie and ""BB"" burgers, to share and taste. Oh boy, they did not disappoint! Juicy and full of flavor of the different ingredients really came through! You know, this BB burger, with a 8oz beef patty, foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes, with black onion seed bun,  truly is a piece of art! Surprisingly, the food menu is quite extensive, with many proteins and veggies option, with a twist, for entrées. The wait staffs pacing furiously the floor back and forth, are visibly stressed. Not sure who's running the front of the house, but this tension should not be shown. It was never brought to our table during the entire meal, as the staff displays warm professionalism and attention, but just pointing my observation...",1
5,What an excellent find in London. Ask for the back dining area if you want romantic.  The bar area if you want action. Celio waited on us. The service is first class.  The menu is perfected. The wine list is extensive.  WONDERFUL,1
3,"Average. Decent service but as a steak restaurant, to tell me you've run out of the 1 portion sirloin but you have the portion for two is a bit silly. There are better places to go.",-1
5,"The Phantom anoints Bar Boulud in London with the best burger in the world! When I appartitioned in London last year during Christmas my phantom date and I spent a lot of time in and around Hyde Park. When we walked passed the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, we popped in to take a look around and we happened to notice the adjoined bistro Bar Boulud and their spectacular menu. It wasn't even a question of whether or not we were going to eat there, we immediately manifested ourselves inside. The Phantom is always searching the world for tasty burgers and found absolute perfection Bar Boulud's BB Burger. The BB Burger consisted of 100% UK beef that is ground daily in-house, with foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes on a black onion seed bun; it was worth every bit of £24! My phantom date and I also shared the truffle risotto with delicious foam, our meal was so amazing that we went back in the next day or two for a second round of the same meal. Not only was the food delicious but the atmosphere and decoration are extremely sophisticated and modern with a classic touch, it is a very romantic, non-pretentious, classy experience. The waitstaff were all extremely attentive and super friendly. The Phantom is honored to write the 100th review of Bar Boulud!
Five Stars for Bar Boulud!

Onion soup, boudin blanc with amazing truffle mash and the royal for dessert were the highlights. Service was very knowledgeable and very friendly.
Will be back....",1

We especially loved the butternut squash soup with pumpkin seeds and truffle marshmallow.  Great for a late-night dinner.

5,"Started out walking into this amazing restaurant, with no reservation. The hostess imediately made room for us with a given time slot of 1 hour and 30 minutes which was plenty for a quick dinner. Nicholas our server greeted us with 5 star service and advised me that all the beers are home brewed from all over Europe! 
The blonde beer from Italy was amazing! Then comes the BURGER! The Yankee was to DIE FOR! this thing was almost too big I almost wanted to cut it, but I dove in and it melted in my mouth! 5 star place, 5 star service and 5 star food!",1
2,"The service was great and everyone was very accommodating, but the food was really not great.
The serving of onion soup was big, but very bland. I would have preferred less with more flavor, given the choice
The burgers were ok, although I asked for medium/well and was served something one step away from saying moo...They fixed it asap!
The real bummer were the fries. Greasy, with no real flavor whatsoever.",-1
5,"As a New York resident, I have been to almost every Daniel Boulud restaurant in NYC.  Needless to say, I am a huge fan, so when I come to a city that has a restaurant of his, I am there - especially if they have USDA steaks.  This restaurant is in the ground level of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and the place was a beehive of activity.  The crowd was lively, young-ish and very upscale.  It was last minute so I had to sit at the chartreuse table attached to the open kitchen, which was ok, since it was cool to be able to see all the action.
Also, when I found out that Daniel Boulud himself was there in the kitchen, I almost ran to my seat!!
Yes, Daniel himself was in the kitchen.  Although, he is New York based these days, I guess he was in town for something and while in town, he was working in his kitchen.  Pretty cool.
I had a glass of red and a USDA sirloin steak with béarnaise and a side of frites.  The steak was fantastic, as this was a USDA grade cut of beef, not something you see often in London.  The frites on the other hand, were rock hard and lukewarm.  I asked for fresh frites and I got a dish of piping hot frites no questions asked.  Awesome.  
Bar Boulud was the same as all Daniel Boulud restaurants - the food, the atmosphere and the service were amazing.",1
4,"Not sure this place needs too much reviewing. Basically I thought highly of their charcuterie board, bb burger and steak tartare, but I would recommend to stay away from their seafood. The fried calamari rings looked shriveled and sad and the breaded scallops were rubbery, indicative of being over cooked. 
Loved the cocktails. I tried the Venezuelan old fashioned and give it 2 thumbs up.",1
4,The burger seems to be what all the tables around me ordered.  More casual than other Boulud restuarants. Ordered the special of the evening which turned out to be the biggest piece of meat I've ever had brought to the table. While it was tasty..I regretted not ordering the burger.,1
4,"Thanks to Andrew M for organising Burger Quest 4.0, which turned out to be one of my oddest dining experiences
Bar Boulud is the brainchild of Michelin starred New York legendary chef Daniel Boulud and has been reproduced in London from its original version in New York. Senior maitre d' Paulo de Tarso, which eventually turned our evening into a special one, told us the origins of the London version from its humble basement beginnings at the swanky Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge
To be honest, the evening didn't start well. The first 4 of our party of 10 Yelpers arrived to find that they had split us up into tables of 4,4 and 2 and that they were unable to sit us close together. Having now spent an evening in the buzzing and impressively full dining rooms, I'm still not sure why our tables couldn't be placed closer together
The other unfortunate policy at the restaurant is that no photo taking is allowed, especially of the food. At the end of the evening, we all agreed that it was a real shame that they didn't allow us to take photos of the food, which was beautifully plated and presented. A little bizarrely, they did offer to let us return to photograph the food with professional photographers and they would set up the food professionally, which rather goes against the spontaneous joy of Yelp. I really hope that they re-consider this policy as I, in common with a lot of others I'm sure, have chosen to eat somewhere when we've seen the beautiful photos of the food
However, once Mr de Tarso worked out that we were serious foodies, he did put in a lot of time with us to share his obvious passion for the food and to make sure that we had an enjyable evening. He was the perfect host
We had some nice cocktails to sip on - my non alcoholic 'Exotic Breeze' was a nice combination of lychee juice, fresh berries and tonic - as we perused the menu
Very generously, Mr de Tarso sent over some complimentary charcuterie boards as he wanted us to try the terrines, which reflects Daniel Boulud's rustic origin and style of cooking though elevating it to perfect execution and appearance. Despite it having a bistro air in the dining room, they don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients or cooking
The many terrines and hams on the board weren't shy on flavour, which was nice. The mustards served alongside added some lovely bite but the pickled veggies could have had a little more zing
Being Burger Quest, we all went for burgers. I had already decided beforehand on their signature BB burger which is a beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, frisée, horseradish mayonnaise and confit tomato all on a sesame black onion seed bun, costing a reasonable £19.50 considering the top class ingredients. Yinnie C bucked the trend on our table by having the Piggie burger, which was personally recommended by Mr de Tarso
So, the BB. It was very good but just a couple of notches from perfection. The beef patty is made in-house with a carefully measured ratio of fat to meat and this results in a wonderfully light patty. The foie gras and short ribs were nice too but as all these main filling ingredients are of the same consistency and flavour, everything just merged into an amorphous mouthful, nice though it tasted. I felt the foie gras was wasted in this mix and extracted it to be eaten separately. Similarly, the truffle was a bit lost in the meat feast. Linzi M had requested no horseradish in her burger and I did wonder if they leff it off mine as well as it did lack a little bit of different texture or a a little kick, which would have elevated it into the great division
However, Yinnie's Piggie burger was a little star. With the addition of barbecued pulled pork and chilli mayo, it had interesting contrasts on the palate
Happily, the truffle in the truffle mash was more obvious and was my favourite side. The fries, mushroom fricasee and cauliflower cheese gratin were good fillers but not in the same class
Somehow, we found space for a dessert each. These were yummy. We had a nice range with pineapple souffle, chocolate tart, peppermint chocolate sponge and mango with orange mousse
Mr de Tarso had a last surprise for us with a batch of mini madelaines fresh from the oven. Though we were stuffed by then, these all disappeared and I even spotted some fellow Yelpers pouring chocolate sauce into them!
So a big thanks to Mr de Tarso for being a perfect host and making our visit special",1
5,"This was my best restaurant experience during my recent trip to London. The atmosphere at the restaurant is wonderful: ritzy but comfortable. The decor is an eclectic mix of old and new, antique and industrial. I loved it from the moment I walked in. My party of 3 was seated by 3 waiter--one to pull out each of our chairs. 
From the point of seating we were perfectly attended to all evening. My water glass was never empty and our bread basket was always full of a delicious mix of fresh, warm, breads. 
I had the fruit de mer grilles--a mixed grill of scallop, octopus, prawn, heritage tomatoes, lobster croquette, and basil mayonnaise. For dinner I had the volaille rotie-- a chicken breast perfectly prepared with polenta, roasted peppers, feta, charred courgette, and harissa vinaigrette. For dessert (of course I had dessert!) I had souffle baie des ronces--an incredibly light raspberry soufflé with thick tangy raspberry jam in the bottom of the ramekin and a side of fresh, nutty pistachio ice cream. 
Others in my group tried the sole limande--a whole roasted lemon sole with brown butter and lemon and capers (it's typically served on the bone, but she requested it boned and it came completely boneless). And one person had the Prix Fixe 3-course meal and adored every course. 
Everything was perfect: the atmosphere, the temperature in the restaurant, the staff and service, the timing of the meal, the drinks, the food (OMG the food!), and the desserts. 
I am dying to go to the Bar Boulud in NYC now and cannot wait to go to London and eat at this Bar Boulud again. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.",1
5,"Clean and classy with top quality food and a suckerpunch of a 5 star customer service experience is exactly what this restaurant is all about. 
Ambience/Décor:
The way in which I can describe the ambience and décor within this restaurant would be of a subtle nature. The restaurant (in my own opinion) is in a league of its own with having the ability to be well lit, calm, peaceful and down to earth, yet also possessing the qualities of having an air of elegance, class and of high quality to it's list of ways to describe the experience and memories it leaves with you.
Food/Dessert:
Due to having a semi full stomach, I decided to skip the starter and head straight for the main.
For the main course, I had one of the notoriously talked about burgers, the ""BB"" burger which consisted of: the beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, frisée, horseradish mayonnaise, confit tomatoes and black onion seed bun. I can honestly agree with all past reviewers about why the burger is London's best. The beef patty, foie gras and the ribs all complimented each other. The burger had a unique and overly satisfying taste. It is of decent size, packs in a lot of ingredients, flavours and good quality beef patty with it being filling, yet won't leave your stomach bursting with agony. I would definitely  recommend this to anyone who knows about good quality burgers.
For dessert I had the 'Coulant Au Chocolat' which consisted of a chocolate lava cake, raspberry sorbet and vanilla milk. What a collaboration of flavours and textures. This dessert is just one of those desserts that is better tried than described. The warmth and sponge like texture of the cake with the flow of hot chocolate mixture pouring out of it is to die for. It is sweet well baked and having the raspberry sorbet on the side is definitely a plus. The raspberry gives you a wake up call and definitely shockwaves your tastebuds back into action with it cold temperature and raspberry sour kick flavour. Great portion and really closes the meal in the best way possible. 
Price:
I guess there is not much to say really apart from you get what you pay for. What I can say though is if you want a meal that is like an experience then that is sure what you are paying for. On the plus side, I didn't think the pricing was expensive at all and the food was by far definitely worth it.
Customer Service:
It is rare to receive such customer service that has you talking about it for days. The waiters & waitresses really show that they care about ensuring you get the best experience possible. The waitress who served on the day I attended was very informative about the menu, very patient and engaged in general conversation. Customer service is just one of those things tjat in order to understand, you have to experience ir yourself, but, being an active restaurant diner, I have seen my fair share of customer service and yet still, when you receive a new moment of excellent customer service it does leave you in awe.
***Non-pretentious, chic, elegant and top quality restaurant serving top quality food with the sprinkle of excellent customer service in a modern building in the heart of London is where you need to be. Bar Bould is the restaurant where you need to be.***",1
4,"Burger Quest 4.0 has descended upon Bar Boulud and have also left with lighter wallet. The minute we walked in, it was clear that these people were serious about their food, and they only seem to serve tables of 4 and under because it means it is more intimate. So as a party of ten, we split into 4,4 and 2! Also no photos of the food please. It is THAT serious and crazy classy. 
The Maitre d' Paulo de Tarso (who has a 'small' following of 200,000 followers on twitter) was lovely, he talked to us about the beginnings of Bar Boulud and how passionate he was about the place since, he has a major hand in opening and managing the place, starting from it's basement origins. 
We also had the pleasure of trying the charcuterie board, and I totally agree with Linzi M, the foiegras and lamb terrine STOLE the show on that board. The Jambon Ham was also quite nice. They also had a pork and parsley terrine and a rabbit terrine as well. (Veggies look away!) 
Then, the burgers came, the beacon of our travels across, uhm, London. 3 BBs and My Piggie Burger. Although I did sample their shortribs and foiegras on top of their patty and it was so rich and so good. I polished off my piggie burger is fast timing too. The Chilli Mayo on top of my pulled pork and beef patty with the sour tang of the red cabbage slaw lifted was was a good burger to a great burger. It had a kick, it was medium rare and it had the extra juicyness of the pulled pork. AND I DIDN'T GET ANY ON MY WHITE TOP. WIN.
Since we pretty much shared EVERYTHING on the table, the sides were no different. But,the sides were hit and miss, which is why I had to knock a star off. The fries weren't great, B+L does better chips. The Mushroom fricasee, had great flavour but was really oily at the bottom. The great sides were the truffle mash,and the cauliflower cheese gratin. 
We went ALL OUT, and ordered desserts. And, the desserts were special, like Linzi's Peppermint chocolate dessert is something I'll order again, it's got a really unique taste, and it worked so well. and it came with hot chocolate sauce. LOVE! Yee Gan's Souffle was super super light and hot pineapple and coconut ice cream ALWAYS works. The chocolate tart that Andrew ordered was decadent and I'm glad we shared! My mango saffron crumble was light but the biscuit at the bottom really changed the dynamics of the dessert. I got dessert envy from Linzi's dish FOR SURE. 
And the madeleines, how could I forget the ones that were BETTER than paris. These were light, and fluffy and just too cute. AND added bonus to the staff who showed me how to the do the basket. (3 times 1 side and 2 times the other and then pull up from the bottom) Don't judge me, I am an origami freak!
I am meated out though. Beef Patty/pulled pork/meat board. I was like, my arteries are clogging up on the train ride home. LOL",1
4,"Lovely restaurant in the basement of mandarin oriental hotel. Classy yet trendy - it has that NYC French brasserie take replicated well. Good is slightly more American as well that French and I think this is what is nice about this place.
Really love their burgers, salads and crispy pork belly were definite yum! Would definitely recommend for nice but casual meals - highly recommend it!",1
5,"It is really good value for a decent French place with great location. Because they offer the choice of ""petite plates"", we decide to order several small plates to try as many dishes as possible instead of two or three large ones. So we end up ordering eight dishes--two real appetizers and six petite entrees. It turns out, I'd say, the petite ones are actually in good sizes(compared to those entrees served in similar high-end French restaurants) , especially the mussels!!! Among all the plates we order -- scallions, prawns, sausages, pork belly, chicken oysters, mussels and crab rolled in cucumber, I really recommend pork belly, scallions and crab rolled in cucumber, the last one is creative too in the way they make it. So if you ever have he chance to be in London, find a time to try out this nice restaurant in mandarin oriental hotel near Harrods.",1
5,"This place is even better than it was two years ago.  The people working there, who all seem to be from somewhere other than the UK, are all extraordinarily pleasant and eager to please, and very attractive without being like models and robots.  
I started with a cocktail, a killer Aperol spritz as good as any I had in Milan.  Followed that with a special of grilled calamari served with an aubergine (eggplant) pureé and a small pork croquette.  The calamari was both tender and flavorful and that aubergine was good to the last dot on the plate.  
I followed that with a single Merguez sausage served with red bell peppers sauteed with a moderately spicy harissa sauce and also served with a yogurt mint sauce.  Everything was wonderfully seasoned and the sausage was perfectly cooked and of wonderful texture.
Dessert was a piece of simple Basque cake served with brandied cherries and a light vanilla anglaise.  It reminded me of the type of baking my grandmother's generation loved - in the very best way!  
My server was a very nice young guy from the Czech Republic who made some spot-on menu recommendations and could not have been more pleasant.
I cannot wait to return the next time I visit London!",1
4,"I got so much love to give... to you Baby Boulud! 
As all good church going girls know, after a thought provoking talk, one needs time to mull it over and digest what was said. So what better way to do this than with a glass of bubbly or two!
In total I and my companion spent about 5 hours drinking, eating, chatting,  people watching and getting checked out (I'll come back to that - stay tuned.)
We opened with glasses of champagne and was convinced by our waiter that our afternoon drinks would be incomplete without some petite madeleine, which are small shell shaped cakes, dusted with icing sugar. They were light fluffy and warm. Mmmm, just delightful!
After more hours of more champagne and talking, we thought it would be rude to leave without having dinner, plus I had heard that the burgers were pretty good. I opted for the Piggie - beef burger with a pulled pork crown, but I was a little disappointed as there really wasn't that much piggy in the Piggie and certain not enough to make a difference to the taste. Still, the beef was as I requested it, a gorgeous medium rare, could have perhaps done with a little more seasoning, but overall nice cow.
Needing to wash the cow juice from my hands I popped to the ladies and needed to walk through the restaurant, and who was drinking in my form, but a German ginger sports man. Being a married man I think it's only fair that I do not disclose his identity, but I will say I'm just glad I was nowhere near a broom cupboard!",1
4,"Right next to Knightsbridge tube station at the Mandarin Oriental, this is a great laid back restaurant where you can enjoy a lovely meal.
I've tried the coq du vin with the truffle mashed potatoes and it was delicious!
I came back with friends for burgers and we were not disappointed! The service is great as well. Highly recommend!",1
5,"I was taken there for my birthday. Very good wine menu, mouthwatering steak and their truffle mash.. Oh my god! I still dream about it! And nothing beats a surprise cake with compliments from the chef!",1
5,"I chose Bar Boulud from a well culled list of the top ten burgers in London. Each entry stated the case for the burger and was accompanied by a picture to illustrate its worthiness.
The Boulud offering jumped out and clearly warranted a visit by me and a fellow burger lover.
There are three burger choices at Bar Boulud:
YANKEE
Despite both of us being Yanks, the iceberg lettuce featured on this hamburger
and the fact that it didn't have any other redeeming or fun toppings summarily reduced its appeal.
FRENCHIE
What's not to love about confit pork belly, rocket and tomato-onion compote on a 
peppered brioche bun? 
PIGGIE
Pulled pork atop a patty just seems like overkill, no?
Of course, we went with the Frenchie. In an attempt to tamp down our gluttony we ordered one to share. Along with the fries, it made a nice, not too terribly heavy lunch for two.
As we waited for our Frenchie to arrive, we watched the professional kitchen with rapt attention. This operation is firing on all cylinders and frankly reminded me of kitchens I've usually only seen in New York and occasionally, San Francisco. I loved the buzz coming out of there.
The restaurant's interior is a little too tricked out for a burger but man, what a burger it was - juicy, true medium rare, umami busting at the seams. The flavours were harmonious and the fries were phenomenal. Not much more you can ask for, really.
Knightsbridge may not be the most obvious choice for a burger, but if you find yourself in the area craving one you'd be crazy not to come to Bar Boulud.",1
3,"This place has a nice ambience and can be relatively quiet on week days.
I shared the Piggie and BB burgers with a friend. The BB was the best for both of us - A beef patty, with foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes and black onion served on a seed bun. 
You can appreciate the quality of the ingredients used and they are cooked to perfection but both burgers could have done with more flavour and 'wow' factor. Especially for the price!",-1
5,"Erin and I enjoyed a perfect Christmas dinner at Bar Boulud our first night in London.
 
The flavors matched those I expected to satisfy me on a chilly, northern winter's night.
 
The amuse bouche distiller all such flavors into a spirit lifting broth of white bean and white truffle soup. It's steamy heat enlivened me from the outside chill. 
 
 For my first course, I had a delectable duck / pistachio  terrine served with a spoonful of cranberry jam and miniature ginger bread biscuits. I paired this with a dry burgundy. New rule - I serve duck terrine at all my parties.
 
I zeroed in on my second course from the word short-rib without realizing it came with a rib-eye steak as well. These meats were accompanied with a compressed spinach packet and the cutest potato dauphine. We had a glass of a 1995 Bordeaux with this richer course. 
 
For dessert I had buch du Noel for the first time, though I've fantasizes about this holiday treat since my 8th grade introductory French class. Was the stuff of dreams!",1
5,"My goodness, what a fabulous dining experience - from the service to the food. I like that the servers are French. The occasion was my birthday, so we ordered a fairly priced bottle of Ayala champagne. I started with the escargots, cooked simply with butter and garlic - and accompanied with potatoes dauphin, which were like little balls of mash heaven. That was followed by the sirloin steak with lightly creamed spinach and a salade frisée. The steak was cooked to perfection and oh-so tasty and juicy. My mum had the boudin noir, with mashed potatoes and sliced apple - and she said it was delectable. 
But the best part of the meal was the dessert. We were both so full, but our server, the funny and charming Thibault, encouraged me to choose something , as he knew I was celebrating my birthday. So I chose the madeleines - and good lord they were incredible. Thibault told us they're not baked until they're ordered, so they arrived warm and fluffy and amazingly tasty, lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Oh my gosh they were just out of this world. 
Definitely recommend this place, birthday or not. I did like that they didn't sing to me. Thibault quietly but sincerely placed a plate in front of me, garnished with ""Happy Birthday Jennifer"" in chocolate, along with a chocolate cupcake and a small candle. Right up my alley. Bravo!",1
4,"I have never been to a French Resteraunt. So please excuse me if my review makes you want to go here and it's not great. I thought it was absolutely delicious.
The staff make you feel so comfortable,  they take your coats, pull out your chairs and are there for your every need. The decor is remarkable and the food is absolutely amazing (in my opinion), I would love to go here again anyway.
The reason I have not given this venue a 5 star rating, is due to the area (Knightsbridge) it is very pricey, well for me being a student it is anyway. For two of us, with a starter and a main course it cost us 100 pounds for the meal. However, as it was my friends birthday, he did get a small cake free! With his name on which was really sweet. 
Would recommend to anyone that likes to try out different cuisines or has a taste for French food. It was a pleasure being there and I would go again if I could afford.",1
5,"- the Bar Boulud is the sister restaurant to the popular New York outpost
- located at Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park
- reservation is highly recommended! very busy and popular
- the service staff is impeccable, from the front door staff to the barman to our waiter; very very obliging, friendly and alert staff!!
- great atmosphere, nice interiors (sleek open kitchen, vaulted ceilings, red-leather banquettes and zinc-topped bar create a comfortable and welcoming surrounding); however, very narrow seating (this is really a minus!)
- the seasonal bistro menu includes an impressive selection of house-made terrines and pâtés, as well as a handful of signature sausages and burgers, adding an American touch to this French inflected bistro and wine bar
- the wine list focuses on Burgundy and the Rhône Valley, including many fine selections by the glass, as well as a wide array of draught and bottled beers
- starter: ""CHARCUTERIE DE GILLES VEROT"": chef's selection of pâtés terrines,sliced meats, hors d'oeuvres, pickles & mustards (small 16.00 GBP | large 32.00 GBP); delicious! I loved the mustard as well as the terrines very much!
- main: 
""MOULES À LA CRÈME"": steamed mussels, white wine, leeks, celery, parsley, crème fraîche (16.00 GBP); extraordinary; best mussels we had for a long time
""RATATOUILLE"" with goat cheese and crisp bread; loved it!
Conclusion: Expensive, however great atmosphere, delicious food, great service! Highly recommended! Only minus: seating toooooo narrow!",1
5,One of the best meals I've had in my entire life! I came with my parents to celebrate my 21st birthday after a recommendation from a friend and I cannot think of another place I would have rather been. The whole experience was nothing short of wonderful - the service is fantastic and the food is nothing short of wonderful! I would definitely recommend it - even just to grab a drink (like a champagne mojito!),1
5,"This restaurant deserve a five star rating.  Best ever squash soap and burger I've ever eaten!
You can not miss from ordring these dishes:
- Soupe de Potiron (butternut squash soup, pumpkin seeds caraway marshmallow, pain dépices)
- Crevettes Grillées (grilled tiger prawns lemon & garlic butter)
- BB Burger (beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs truffle, frisée, horseradish mayonnaise confit tomato, black onion seed bun)
An unforgettable vegetarian dish I cannot recall its name neither could pull it from the online menu, nevertheless, I attached it's photo for reference.",1
5,Wow!! Really good flavoursome cooking- very classic French done nicely. The set lunch menu (£19 for 3 courses) is really great value for this place and making it accessible and affordable for diners who want to try this place!,1
4,"After carting around two rather large suitcases from Berlin to London via plane, train and on foot we were ready for something tasty for dinner.
Our local hosts (friends from Australia) promised a quick local bite, so I was rather surprised to be led into the glam interior that was Bar Boulud at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge.
The french onion soup and burgers were recommended by both our friends and the waiter, but being a non-red meat eater I opted for the bouillabaisse followed by  baked chicken breast on polenta which were both rich in flavour and very tasty.
The bouillabaisse arrived in several different dishes and was constructed at the table. Deliciously fragrant!!
All staff were attentive and either authentically french or had excellent french speaking accents :)
We left around 11.30pm and people were still arriving for dinner on a Monday night so I'm guessing this place is popular anytime of the day or night.",1
5,"BB burger is amazing! The extensive wine list is perfect for wine lovers and connoisseurs -  
Service is attentive, friendly and efficient.
Book in advance, specially during the weekends",1
5,"Wow, what an incredible evening. At the next instalment of our 'Burger Club', we just had to try the legendary BB at Bar Boulud*. With its origins in New York, this is a burger of 18 years fame! Situated in the beautiful Mandarin Oriental Hotel, this is a lovely space and from the second you walk in, you can tell these people know their stuff and service is of paramount importance. 
We had the pleasure of meeting maitre d' Paulo De Tarso, the main man formally of The Wolesley and Scotts, who set up this entire place. He was truly a delight, highly knowledgable and treated us like family. We discovered Paulo is a more than a bit of a respected  celebrity in restaurant circles so it was lovely of him to spend so much time with us describing his ethos for the restaurant and how much attention goes into each dish. 
We started with the charcuterie board and were won over by the flavours of the terrines from lamb terrine to coarse country foie gras. As always cured meats are my favourite, I couldn't get enough of the different flavours and textures of this board. Try them all! 
As was the theme of the evening, everyone ordered the burgers, 3 BBs and a Piggie. We had to go for all the sides, truffled mash, mushroom fricassee, cauliflower gratin and of course, fries! The burger was a revelation, the most moist, tender patty you could ever bite into. I wasn't relishing enough enjoyment from the foie gras in the burger, so I began spreading it on the bread provided and that was divine! Back to the burger to really taste each part then, the highlight of the BB is the combination of the braised short rib with the foie gras sitting on an unusual black sesame seed bun.  
Sides are almost always my favourite, maybe because I used to be a vegetarian. But I could have eaten that truffled mash all day long. It was decadent! Same for the gratin. 
Of course, we were a greedy table and ordered a round of desserts. At a place like Boulud, how can you not?! Coconut crusted pineapple soufflé with coconut ice cream, this was like eating a fluffy delicious cloud of air. Andrew had the coffee and bittersweet chocolate tart - this was decadent and divine. Maybe too rich to eat a whole one, but I was too taken with my coupe peppermint, a flourless sponge topped with mint chocolate icecream and a chocolate 'lid' that melted when poured over with chocolate sauce. Hello! 
Paulo then treated us to fresh baked madeleines, straight from the oven. What a delight. Light, airy and with a hint of citrus, I think they may have been the highlight of the meal for me. 
This was truly a fantastic experience and we were wowed by the charm of Bar Boulud. If you are looking for something special or have someone special to treat, take them here! 
* Boulud had actually been on my list to try for quite some time.",1
5,"I had the BB. It was the best burger outside of the States I've had. Ray's Hell Burger in Arlington, just across bridge from DC, is still the world supreme. 
The burger was the perfect size. Quality of meat was good. It was cooked evenly, not the half raw, half burnt, interpretations of MED rare I've run across. The bun did not take away from the flavor of the burger and foie gras. I had the roasted veg as a side and downed a Bellenrose to wash it all down. It was a good day.",1
5,"Just met with a business associate for lunch here, great staff, very nice and clean restaurant. I had the menu du jour. Salad as entree and salmon. He had the beef. The table next to us had burgers, I regretted my choice with the first wiff of the burger... Now I'll have to go back and have a burger!!!",1
5,"This place was a great post workday treat. The cocktails are amazing and worth £14 - and the charcuterie was clearly made by someone who knew his stuff - it also was helpful that the staff knew the menu so well and could walk us through our amazing assortment of meaty goodness. 
Can't wait to go back! Next paycheck...",1
5,"One of the best burgers in London. Go for the ""BB""; a burger served with foie gras, braised short rip and truffle. Heavenly.",1
5,"Great food, great service, and very hospitable. Bar Boulud is my new ""best dining experience in the world"" winner. As a Californian, I had the foie gras burger; hopelessly politically incorrect back home, and utterly yummy. We had three generations at the table, from my grandson on up, all very happy. 
On top of all that we were able to get a booking on 20 minutes notice. The prices are reasonable; in theory, you could get in, get a burger, and get out, with change from 20 bucks or the UK equivalent. Of course with all the good stuff available it's likely to go a bit higher, and take a bit longer.",1
4,"Meant to go to the NYC one for ages, but never have the time. Solid dinner.  The utter lack of mayonese was definitely the highlight of the meal. :)
The service was competent, the food was very good and our red wine was delicious.  The only thing, it was awfully hot - either it was the heat from the kitchen or the glaring lights set up for the not very good wall photographs, but it was very uncomfortable.  We asked to change our table and were reseated away from the kitchen -  a decision that took 20 minutes to make in a nearly empty restaurant, for which they lose a star.",1
3,"Menu is always changing, but all I can really remember is ordering fries. I didnt want to spend too much and my friend wanted to get an ice coffee to go. They told us they had it but when they came back with a glass of coffee they insisted they dont have ""to go""
Pricey!",-1
3,"The Piggie at Bar Boulud was a rare example of a burger trying too hard. Pulled Pork, Green Chili Mayo, Bibb Lettuce, Red Cabbage Slaw, and a Cheddar Bun all combined for too many textures and flavors going on. The interesting fact here is that none of them stood out and the burger was lacking any salt/acid to give it that mouth watering effect. The burger was also quite tall and difficult to handle/enjoy while eating. Overall, the Piggie has potential however it seems to be a little confused about what it is trying to do. I'd suggest subbing the lettuce for fried onion strings and topping the burger with a healthy dose of vinegar based BBQ sauce.",-1
1,"I'm gonna start with, their christmas dinner 2011-2012 was absolutely WONDERFUL. It was every bit of delicious juicy velvety piece of goodness I can ask for around the holiday season (while eating out). BUT...
I went there a few more times after that and it was more disappointing than ever. So disappointed that I've lost my last bit of faith in this place. my pork belly was so overcooked that it tasted like leather, fish was way fishy, pate was half frozen, sausage tasted frosty.. and most of all, service was crappy. Mandarin Oriental's are normally great with services. Except for this one.. for some reason I've witnessed more customer dispute and unsatisfactory comment at this particular MO than anywhere else in the world.
So yeah, the one star is the one redeeming quality for this restaurant and it all goes to the christmas dinner from last year. Bar Boulud has really gone downhill!",-1
4,"I too joined the rest of the Yelp krew for Burger Quest 4.0 here. I'll cut to the point and much has already been said. Bar Boulud is a great restaurant but we all felt a bit conflicted once they figured out that we all wrote reviews about restaurants and other services. It would have been really great to experience the restaurant without the ""extra attention"" for lack of a better term.
Either way, the burgers are quite amazing. The juice and crumble of the patty is outstanding. I do wish that they had less patty and more toppings though! The pork belly was severely skimmpy on the toppings.",1
5,"I got the 3-course prix fixe meal. It was quite the bargain. Just £23, about the same price as restaurant week in NYC. Chopped salad, steak with bearnaise, and the french cake. All very good. I got the sommelier to pair a good wine, and it was a fantastic cotes du rhone. But I want to come back here to try the burgers, which seem quite special.
All in all, you can trust any Boulud restaurant or a solid, fine French dining experince.",1
4,"The ambience of this place is great, chic but not pretentious, the moneyed on a casual night out. Staff are efficient and pleasant too. I've been a handful of times and if you don't book, then there will often be a wait. I went on a Monday evening and it was packed. The consolation is having cocktails by the bar whilst waiting for your table.
Of course I went for the burgers, which are on most of the top 10 London burger lists. In fact I have never tried anything else off their menu, although the other food looks great too. Burgers are good-patty is well cooked. Perhaps I am fussy, but I think there is too much bun in proportion to the burger, which obscures the taste of the patty a little for me. It's simple enough not to eat both halves of the bun though.
Burgers are £11.75/12.75 except for the foie gras burger. Chips are extra. This is great value for a good food eaten in a lovely environment.
We returned a burger because it was overcooked. A perfectly cooked replacement was brought without fuss, in super quick time, and with a free side of chips.Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, in the very same hotel, could learn a thing or two from this place- but that is for another review.",1
4,"So different than I expected. It's tucked inside the Mandarin Oriental. We walked in knowing the food would be good, but would the experience be too snooty. It wasn't. It's a very cool place. Great lighting and decor. The service was top notch. They work in teams, so there's always someone to help. We both had the burger. I had the Piggy. It was fantastic. But note, anything cooked beyond ""medium"" takes 20 or more minutes. The Pom frites were basic, but the cauliflower au gratin was succulent. Also can't say enough about the French onion soup. It was perfectly balanced and flavorful. We skipped dessert, but we're definitely intrigued. Overall, it's a 3.5 star place, but with a more robust menu could be a 4 to 4.5.",1
3,"This is a decent French restaurant in the Hyde Park area. The price of the food is responsible and so is the quality. It's nothing that's going to bring you back for a second tasting, however it is far from disappointing.",-1
4,"Great burgers, amazing service. Overall a big fan!",1
3,"I was taken to Bar Boulud for a surprise birthday dinner by the mister however I was really unimpressed. Of course, I did not tell him this thought because I did not want to hurt his feelings. It was double thumbs up to him for the effort and the choice but food-wise it was really A-OK. I had a better French food elsewhere especially for the price. I must admit I enjoyed the freshness, quality and the presentation of the food here. In addition, I commend the service here (it better be excellent as it is part of high service charge paid the mister). The ambiance here is definitely posh as you could imagine but its all right, a girl can play and pretend to be posh sometimes especially on her birthday. Enough said, a single visit here is adequate for a lifetime. On the other hand, I would go back tirelessly to Asia De Cuba.",-1
5,"On my venture to taste London's best burgers, I finally made it to Bar Boulud in Knightsbridge. It's a beautiful simple room with nice warm colours and very friendly and attentive staff. Speaking about staff, the sheer number of staff is almost scary, but as all are very obliging, I did not really mind.
I started with a really great Trinity Hill, Viognier, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand 2008, a delicious white wine that reminded me a lot of dry Rieslings. 
For the food, I chose the Frenchie burger. To be fair, it is not a very large burger. But that's probably a good thing. I agree with many others, this burger deserves a mention in any top list. The taste is rich, the bun doesn't dissolve half way through the burger and I cannot think of much that would make this burger better. The Pommes Frittes, as they call it, are thin and crispy, well seasoned and a good complement to the burger. 
The strawberry dessert was simply amazing, the pastry  that was mainly for the eye anyway, but nice and crunchy  even came with some gold on top! Whether it was gold or not, you clearly pay for it. But I have to say, it's worth every penny! 
To finish off, I ordered an espresso. I didn't expect too much, and I didn't get too much. It is really a pity, that almost no restaurant offers decent coffee. So unfortunately, the last impression was by far not as positive as the rest. 
After all, I definitely recommend Bar Boulud. It's a very nice place, the food is great, the wine delicious, the staff friendly, and if you don't order an espresso but go straight for a walk in Hyde Park, you will perhaps have a perfect time there!",1
4,"Good place to stop in for a bite. A little 'scene-y' on the weekend, loud, but dependable for drinks and some good food.",1
4,"Bar Boulud is pushing the bar for burgers in London just for a bit higher with some innovative creations, epic attention to detail that really shines through in the taste and texture of the meat, and a high level of service to back it up.
Bar Boulud was the location for the latest Yelp BurgerQuest, picked for its appearance on several top 10 lists on London's burger blogs and the fabled BB burger topped with foie gras and coming in just shy of £20. It's a posh place (located below the Mandarin Oriental Hotel) with a suitably luxurious décor. It's burgers are no less fancy with all four offerings being based on a bespoke beef patty. But is it any good? The short answer is yes, yes it is. From the Yankee to the Frenchie and of course the BB, the burgers are very tasty with one of the best patties in London and a solid set of buns to support them.
Two important things we learned are 1) groups of more than 4 need to book several weeks in advance to have a chance of sitting near let along with each other, and 2) NO PICTURES!
Anyways, we eventually got seated and the night properly began. Our waiter was pretty cool and, despite being fairly new, really put in a lot of effort to make sure we had everything we needed and also answer all the questions we threw at him. Mr. de Tarso also spent quite a lot of time with us over the course of the night to discuss his vision for Bar Boulud and also a bit of his personal history. He's worked with some of the top names in London and is a fairly impressive chef in his own right. 
At this point, I need to disclose that we didn't have a completely typical experience as Mr. de Tarso was kind enough to send some free charcuterie plates (as they say, you really know a chef by how he puts together a plate of meat) and some fresh madelines for dessert. Now I'd love to think it's because we demonstrated an obvious passion for food and thus inspired Mr. de Tarso to ensure we tried the best Bar Boulud had to offer. But, the smart money is on the fact that we let slip at the start that we were all Yelpers. If the latter is the cause, I attribute it to Alex S's (Yelp London Community Manager) efforts to really put Yelp out there above its competition. Regardless, there was free food, and it was good.
The BB burger is average sized with a fluffy soft white bun, the aforementioned patty, seared foie gras, and red-wine braised short rib. It's a bit tall and may prove a challenge for those who can't unhinge their jaw, but each bite is full of tasty meat and soaked bun. I give extra points as the bun actually holds together for the entire burger despite the copious amount of juice running out with each bite. The foie gras was delicious on its own but was lost in the taste of the combined burger. At best, it added a bit more richness to the whole thing but it was a poor value-add. The braised short rib was likewise a bit lost in the overall combination although it did add more textures to the burger which was sorely needed. I could have eaten it as a side dish alone though, absolutely brilliant flavours and tender shredded meat. Overall, a pretty good burger but not quite worth the nearly £20 price tag. At £12-15, I'd be quite happy and perhaps if they took off the foie gras they could do just that.
Finally desserts! We started with the mini-madelines as ordered by Mr. de Tarso which were brilliant. Light and airy with a slight lemony flavour, they are very moreish and incredibly hard to put down. And when you dip them in hot chocolate sauce then you pretty much won't bother stopping until they are all gone (I know that's what I did). The chocolate tart was my next favourite with a  deep bitter chocolate although the chocolate sauce soaked sponge was a close second (or third rather). Finally, for a bit of freshness, we managed to take down a pineapple soufflé and a mango mouse. Both were light and refreshing and a great option if you feel stuffed from your meal but still want dessert.
Overall, an excellent experience and a definite burger win. I only wish we could have taken some photos but perhaps Mr. de Tarso will be kind enough to send some professionally taken ones for us to use. Get over to Bar Boulud (make a reservation first), and try the the Piggy or Frenchie burger for a good time. And a special thank you to Mr. de Tarso for being an absolutely brilliant host - he even got a waiter to teach us how to fold a napkin into a bowl for serving madelines!",1
3,"Summary: Decent food, nice setting, small portions, not as good as I'd expect for the price.
Came with two friends late Fri. night - I ordered the boudin noir (blood sausage), frenchie burger w/ spinach, and we split desserts.
Boudin noir was small but great. Moist and flavorful.
Burger was dry (both the bun and the meat) and underwhelming. Small as well. Spinach was not too creamy and good.
Desserts were decent.
Wouldn't come back again unless someone else wanted to come.",-1
5,"The food was very good- most notably the Coq au Vin ( the sauce was divine); the sampler charcuterie plate was good (but wished they included the Foie Gras since is illegal in my home state, CA). 
The service was excellent, esp from Felix the Asst Manager and Oliver who was the sommelier. Had a white burgundy and an amazing Languedoc (poured from a 3 L) Always on point and offering service at just the right time. Went above and beyond by offering suggestions for my stay. 
Top notch.",1
3,"Vibrant and ""big city"" place"", nice decor crowded place. 
Food is pk, some dishes good and some not. We where 8 people and all dishes where in different quality, strange. 
Prices are OK for this kind of place. 
Its good to combine with a pricey great drink in mandarin bar one floor up.",-1
5,"Never thought I'd eat the best hamburger in my life in London at Daniel Boulud's. According to the menu it has ""beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs truffle, frisée, horseradish mayonnaise confit tomato, black onion seed bun"". It is simply amazing.",1
3,"Great burgers, good people watching.",-1
3,"Not as good as the New York original -- the charcuterie was excellent, but the other items on the menu were universally lackluster.  Everything lacked flavor: steak tartare was bland, as was the choucroute and the lamb.  I didn't care for the basement location; the dropped ceilings make the interior feel claustrophobic rather than cozy. 
On a positive note, the service was quite pleasant (but I would expect nothing less from a Mandarin/Boulud collaboration).",-1
4,"Went to Bar Boulud to check out the lamb burger specially created for their one year anniversary. I'd been meaning to go to BB for a while, but never quite managed to find the time. This time around, the fact that the lamb burger was only going to be around for a week enticed me to come down, even though I was not able to find a dining companion at such short notice.
 Despite the fact that I was on my own and a small eater, the service I received was impeccable. Batiste, my waiter, introduced the special (the lamb burger) right after handing me the menu and helped me choose a nice wine to go with it. I also asked whether I needed to order a side to go with my burger order, and he said, no, as he thought the burger was quite 'significant' in size. I'd read a couple of reviews that said the burgers were a little on the small side but as Batiste mentioned that the kitchen could turn out sides in double-quick time if I thought the burger wasn't big enough, decided to just go with the burger.
 And a good thing I did! I'll just say that the burger didn't look that big, but I had to take a break midway because I was getting really full! The lamb was good, not gamey, while the chickpea fries were a delightful surprise.
 I really wanted to give the desserts a go, but, as you might have guessed, that simply wasn't possible. Contrary to popular belief, sometimes, there simply isn't space for dessert.
 I mentioned it earlier but I simply need to mention it again. The service is incredible. The staff checked on me several times during the course of my meal, but not too many times as to make me uncomfortable. My water glass was topped up almost the instant it was emptied, and my dishes were cleared in an efficient manner. Batiste was also friendly and smiley to all of the tables he served at all times.
 I'll have to come back another time to try out the regular burgers. I strongly suspect I'll enjoy the Piggie Burger given my love of all things pork. But, first, I'll need several weeks of gym visits, and a friend to eat here with so that we can order more food!",1
4,Great service. Very attentive. Fun scene. Really good burger. Tiger prawns were marvelous.,1
4,"I have been there 4 times for dinner now and I really enjoy dining here..... from dinners before a movie to special occation celebrations, I have never been let down by the food, service and experience. 
I can always find someing I enjoy eating and this is a place where you will eat more than you want because it is so enjoyable. 
The beer braised feather blade is one of my fav things on the menu, the sorbets are super refreshing and comes with these rich warm chocolate sea salt cookies.... mmmm.... Everything is presented beautifully, not only does the food taste great, you really enjoy every bite! When my parents come to visit me in London next time, this is definantly one place I would like to take them as a treat! 
You might want to make reservations as they can get quite busy no matter what day of the week.",1
4,"Same menu you can get in NY, but mixed with a bit of DBGB.
Really nice interior and exterior!",1
5,"The name matches the reputation. This is one of the best meals that I have had in quite some time. Bob and I were able to get a Christmas Eve prix fix menu for an excellent price - naturally, we decided to just go with that. The service, was absolutely impeccable. Our server was fast, friendly and exceedingly polite. He was very accommodating as we asked to substitute one the courses for something else, and he happily obliged. We had the onion soup to start, Bob had the beef, I had the chicken and for dessert I had the Napoleon and Bob and the chocolate gateau. Everything was delicious - but my chicken was phenomenal. Fall of the bone tender and crispy on the outside. The ambiance was lovely - very comfortable and casual but still with a touch of formality. This is one of the best restaurants we had the pleasure of eating at in London, and I highly suggest you all do the same!",1
3,"Bar Boulud should come with a health warning:  ""Serious indigestion and/or illusion of time being sped up around you""
Put it this way- we had a 3 course meal with souffle done, dusted and paid within 1h30 minutes.  And Oh the WINE!  They managed to douse away the bottle by the time the mains came.  And there were only 3 of us.
Having discussed about this ""Daniel Boloud hates patrons going to toilet because he has to recook the whole table"" episode as featured in the quasi biography ""The Fourth Star"", I stood up to go to the bathroom about 1 minute after they cleared the starter.  Urm, NO; the steak was being served already and I was essentially ushered back to the seat.  
To be honest, the food itself was delicious and the chacuterie was amazing value for the amount of delicious food you get.  The steak was well cooked; the crab salad was very fresh and the lamb well seasoned with a tip top chickpea stew.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable and friendly.  
Unfortunately this was all overshadowed by teething problems and a slightly heavy handed attitude towards selling you more wine by pouring quickly (literally after every sip) and ""attentiveness"" and keeping good time.  I personally prefer my nice dinners to be enjoyed leisurely and not in a hectic, chaotic and comical ""everything-around-you-is-going-at-light-speed"" crazy blur.
Bar Boulud has a lot of potential, but honestly, I now totally understand why the Guardian spent the whole review complaining about their 2 hour turn around policy.",-1
4,"Bar Boulud London is possibly better than the one in NYC, which is saying a lot! The restaurant just opened a couple of weeks ago, but so far, after dining here 3 times, I'm definitely a fan. The food is solid - excellent charcuterie (my favorite is the Pate Grandpere made with the creamy bits of foie gras), beautifully rich Boudin Blanc, excellent grilled lamb chops, a delightful fresh shellfish platter featuring periwinkles, langoustine, lobster, crab, king prawns, tuna tartare, whelks, clams, and mussels, and a superb wine list. The decor is not my favorite - there is something about the mix of maroon red colors that is a little off-putting, and the artwork on the walls that are supposed to be different types of wine spilled onto white tablecloths and framed, look more like.. well to be perfectly frank... women's used maxi pads hanging on the walls. But the service and food more than make up for the odd decor.
The prices are surprisingly reasonable as well considering it is smack dab in the middle of Knightsbridge, AND in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.",1
4,"We dined here a few days after arriving to London.  Being jet lagged and all, we were perfectly happy and were able to score a reservation to take advantage of the prix fixe menu!!  For £23, you get an appetizer, entree and dessert?!  And mind you, this isn't some crappy tourist joint serving you 3 day old fish and chips.  Reviewing the prix fixe menu, half of the options seemed interesting while the others were okay.  I had the rabbit terrine for appetizer and the blood sausage/mash for entree - both were excellent and I would order them again if they weren't on the prix fixe menu.  Service was excellent and they were very accommodating to our 3 year old - who knew that Bar Boulud would have crayons and coloring sheets for kids?   At the end of the meal, my son exclaimed ""Boy, that was fun!"".  Kid and parents smiling at the end of the meal?  Almost too good to be true...",1
5,"Really great location and food. I wish it had more windows, as it felt like we were in a bunker... but the atmosphere and food were great. I'd go again.",1
4,"Bar Boulud is listed as a French restaurant but if there was a rustic/homey category, it would be listed there.  We made reservations for a late Friday night (10 PM) and were seated immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the art on the wall.  There were various wines spilled on a canvas and framed to give some type of 'Rorschach Test' effect?  But to me, it kinda looked like ummm the problem that women have once a month so it was a little disturbing.  With my appetite built up with that thought, let's talk about the food.
We had the grilled pork belly, aka really thick bacon pieces, which I devoured and grilled sausages for appetizers.  Very rich and delicious.  I'm not usually into fatty cuts of meat, but these were seared to give it a nice texture outside and the fat really melts in your mouth when you bit into it.  My heart is going to hate me for it later.  Next course was the yankee burger.  A good fancied up burger, but nothing spectacular.  Third course was food coma back in the hotel room.",1
5,"Am not going to write a long review here as it was quite a while ago now and It would not be fair to go into detail.
What I would say though, is that the food was amazing and service was up there with the best I've encountered. The ambience and decor was superb and thoroughly deserves 5 stars from my dining experience.",1
3,"The service was excellent but the food decidedly average. We were underwhelmed by our menu choices including cod croquettes, duck and sable dessert. Other items may be better but then why offer these on the menu?",-1
4,"Hard not to give this place 4 stars, strictly for the food. After checking out theLondon spot, I prefer the New York location, but the food maintains the same Daniel quality. I tried a ravioli special with some autumn squash and it was delicious - just the right amount of food and excellent flavor. The french onion soup as a starter might have been the best F.O.S. I've ever had. Great for a special dinner occasion, especially if you're dabbling in the wine list. Private room in the back is good for ~15 people.",1
4,"What we ate on a Saturday evening around 6.30pm..
6 Rock Oysters - £12.00 (accompanied by brown bread with seaweed butter, shallot vinaigrette, sauce 'américaine', lemon )
The plump juicy oysters were served on ice in a raised platter and shucked well enough to be nearly overflowing with briny juice. The homemade seaweed butter was a thoughtful addition but did not come close to the same from god of butter, Jean-Yves Bordier. Their sauce américaine had much more bite and spice than any Heinz replica, a meaty substitute for Tabasco.
Frenchie Burger - £13.75 (includes chips)
This is a burger with confit pork belly, rocket tomato-onion compote and Morbier cheese served on a peppered brioche bun. The bun was delicious and a soft peppery pillow for some serious ingredients. The burger was huge and heavy with meaty flavour thanks to the additional porky belly, the nutty Morbier and jammy compote lifting the meat with some huge hits of flavour. There was some additional french mustard in here somewhere which was not listed in the menu. The chips were good, just good, skinny and lots of them but scoring a 6/10.
Piggie Burger - £13.75 (includes chips)
This burger is served in a Cheddar bun with bbq pulled pork, Bibb lettuce, green chili mayonnaise and red cabbage slaw. The cheese on the bun was strong and gave a great pungent bite to the beautifully soft pork and then the firm burger. The lettuce, mayo and slaw added softness, heat and crunch so there was lots going on in every mouthful. The pulled pork was so good we would have easily eaten a whole plate of this smothered over the 6/10 chips.
Soufflé au citron - £9.50
A super light lemon soufflé was served with a jug of spiced sugar poire william and vanilla coulis. A bit pricey but was nice enough.
Île exotique - £8.00
This dessert was amazing, the lime floating island was filled with a mango crémeux and sat on a coconut anglaise. Dotted around the plate were tiny bites of spiced pineapple, pomegranite and basil leaves and little bit of everything on the spoon was divine, it was a random choice but worth it.
Drink
1 glass of Nittnaus Pinot Noir 'Kurzberg', Burgenland, Austria (2007) - £8.50
1 Sierra Nevada pale ale - £4.75
2 Peppermint teas - £9.00 (they used fresh peppermint but still expensive for water and leaves)
Atmosphere
We ate at 6.30pm on a Saturday and there was a great atmosphere with a busy mix of tables, banquets and booths of dates, family meals, groups of friends and single diners. The open kitchen is exciting and honest and adds to the buzz of the diners and staff. Very attentive service keeps you looked after and there is reasonable 2hr 15mins turnaround in place. Plus, as in all good hotels, toilets are clean and attended.
Offers
Three course set menu meal for £20 served seven days between 12pm-2.30pm and 5.30pm- 7pm
Verdict
GO! GO! GO!
We will definitely go back to Bar Boulud. The burgers were ordered medium-rare but were served medium so in future we'll ask for rare. The set menu looked excellent value and the location is perfect for popping in when shopping around Knightsbridge. Always book, we saw lots of people being turned away.",1
4,"I was first introduced to this place by my parents friends who have lived in London for about 4 years longer than I have. We came here as a party of 6 on quite a busy Friday evening, but made sure we made it in time for the Prix Fixe menu (before 7pm). The atmosphere was very nice, posh, contemporary with a dash of NY flavor (just like the one in NYC). It was good to be able to share a nice meal with my parents, who only visit London once a year, and who do love a good meal every now and then. 
We did order from the Prix Fixe menu along with the token burger just to try it out and assess what the fuss about Daniel Boloud's burgers are all about. I still remember starting with the French Onion soup au gratin and the Coq au Vin for the main. The food and service were absolutely delightful and I would have given it 5 stars back when we were Boloud virgins. Since then I've come back here 4-5 times and service and food quality have suffered a little.
The last time I came here was a couple of weeks ago when my roommate and I were celebrating this new gig that I got (see my profile for related reviews from getting a new job :P). The Prix Fixe menu was of choice again, since I'd come other times and have already had the wonder of the a la carte stuff. Anyway, I started with an AMAZING terrine a la morocco, which was just delightful, but a less exciting main. It seems like the main choices have become a little dated and tired, less exciting than when I first popped by Boloud cherry back in Nov 2010. I had a grilled chicken breast with creamed polenta, all were very tasty, and the grilled chicken was done almost to perfection... I've never thought I could have had chicken breast that moist. Anyway, I devoured that sucker, but got to the last piece, and with grilled chicken, if you want to get it this moist, it almost has to be just at the right temps. I must have gotten the fleshiest part of the meat on my 3rd slice and it was just a little too underdone for me. So... being the perfectionist that I am, I sent it back (oh for shame!!)... They returned the dish as if I hadn't touched it and it was done just as well as the first time. 
Lets just say, I still LOVE coming to this place, the service is amazing, and the food is REALLY good. I'd say that the glassed-wine selection needs to be a little improved and that the Prix Fixe menu needs a little defibrillator action, but overall, still a place I would love to come back to and bring people on dates. 
4 stars, only because Yelp doesn't do 4.5 stars!!",1

hungryinlondon.com/2010/…
 
 Finally I have made it to Bar Boulud, next to Knightsbridge tube station located in the ground floor of the exceedingly posh Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Bar Boulud has been written up to death (e.g. MarinaMetro, AA Gil, Jay Rayner, and a myriad of bloggers) so I will keep myself short.
 The owner and chef, Daniel Boulud, is a successful restaurateur in New York where he doesn't only have a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars ('Daniel') but is also famous for his up-market burgers .
 For me  coming from Austria  burgers did not exist until I moved to England apart from in the form of McDonalds hamburgers. It took me quite a while to get my head around the fact that a burger should be taken seriously and can be truly delicious. So the burger slowly made its way from being my favourite hangover food to actually being eaten for real enjoyment even without prior alcohol exposure.
 Anyway, what I want to say is that my burger experience is limited and I am far from being a burger expert  so I approached Bar Boulud and its famous burgers (which I of course had to try) with a relatively unbiased attitude but with high expectations.
 For Knightsbridge and for being in the Mandarin Oriental I thought the atmosphere at Bar Boulud was rather pleasant and it was frequented by a mixed crowd. It was Wednesday evening and very busy  we only got a table in the bar area (with stylish but hugely uncomfortable chairs). In fact it was so busy that we were more or less ignored by the waiters for the first part of the evening. Later on service picked up however and the waiters were friendly and seemed to be doing their best.
 I started with the beetroot salad with goat's cheese and walnut (8). I was not terribly impressed actually. Everything, even though tasty, was slightly underseasoned and especially the salad leaves could have done with some kind of dressing.
 Then of course the DBGB Yankee burger (12 + 1 for cheese). Maybe I expected something like an orgasmic burger experience (which might be too much to ask from pour Daniel Boulud) but somehow the burger failed to induce any culinary arousal. Don't get me wrong, it was quite nice. The meat was extremely high quality and perfectly medium rare as requested. It was however bordering on cold when served and in the end it was just a not very exciting burger and I was a bit disappointed.",-1
1,"We have been so far to three Daniel Boulud's restaurants and this one at Mandarin Oriental hotel was the worst.
It was our first and last visit there mainly due to overpriced menu, intimidating staff, noise and absolutely ordinary food.
This place does not have any identity whatsoever and definitely does not to live up to Daniel's reputation.",-1
3,"Where: Bar Boulud, The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Knightsbridge
With whom: The Masticator
How much?: £110 for the two of us. That was four courses (Prix Fixe plus an extra charcuterie course)
 This was the week that we got news of another American import, Keith McNally, bringing a feted and famous New York brasserie to London (Balthazar, in partnership with Richard Caring's Caprice Holdings). Both McNally and Daniel Boulud, at whose new London outpost we were dining, are considered by many to be American chefs, and both made their large reputations there however both were born in Europe, Keith McNally a few miles up the road from his planned new home.
 I came to praise Daniel Boulud, but instead walk away strangely unsatisfied. As a dining experience overall, it wasn't one that will live long in the memory. 
It wasn't the staff. They were as well drilled, knowledgable and friendly a brigade as I've seen... 
It wasn't the decor. The light, well proportioned space is a graceful place for the well heeled to dine... Admittedly I was less sure about the arty splashes on the wall. The blot art of famous red wine vintages intrigued but were only vaguely reminicent of blood stained rorchach drawings. 
Sadly, and more fundamentally, it was the food.
 We went for a so-so Corbier, fair enough, but a little too earthy for both of us. It came from a large and excellent winelist priced squarely for the Four Seasons clientele. There are only a handful below £50, the rest quickly hit hedge fund levels.
 The relatively long and involved menu presented a thrill as it was knowledgeably announced by our gallic host. There were certainly sparks of excellence here. Themes of charcuterie, sausage, pâtés and burger were highlighted and so we decided to go for the Prix Fixe with an additional charcuterie course (supplied by expert Parisian charcuterie supplier Gilles Verot). The small plate was more than ample and made a very good pre-starter paired with a moreish (light in texture but richly flavoured) boudin blanc sausage and its accompanying garlic mash. A very good salami made up for the dry and too subtle ham. Pâtés (particularly the tagine dagneau, a heavily spiced Maroc influenced lamb and aubergine mix and a superb pâté grand-mère) really excelled and the portions of the small plate were the ideal way to sample.
 The chilled pea soup was simple elegance and one dish I'll remember for a long time. Fresh, creamy and with an occasional snap of tiny rosemary flavoured cruton, it hit the spot perfectly.
 Sadly it went a little down hill from here. The Masticator's burger was initially dry, tasteless, unseasoned and lukewarm with a shredded lettuce, 'special sauce' and thin, limp tomato combination eeriely remenicent of a certain golden arched chain. Only a tasty brioche bun saved it. The team were swift to offer a replacement due to the temperature but this arrived in the same state (albeit warmer). The chips were inedibly saline.
 My roasted chicken breast had a rich rustic and flavoursome taste of pure perfect poultry and arrived, in comparison, piping hot. Slightly dry too though sadly, it was helped by a rich (if salty) gravy but badly let down by rather floury fingerling potatoes and overcooked artichokes.
 The Masticator had further problems with his desert (though this time arguably of his own making). A pervading scent of lavender that put him off his two (small) scoops of mint and coconut ices was tracked down to the overpowering handwash in the Mandarin Oriental bathroom. That aside, a powder dry hazelnut cookie didn't add to the experience. My exotic fruit sundae was preceded by a long spoon hightening childish anticipation before it arrived in a Martini glass. A pleasant but not earth-shattering mélange of passion fruit purée and cream came with nuggets of an excellent coconut macroon to give some needed bite.
 Will I come again? Absolutely. It's a great space for a business lunch in the area, a safe menu overall with some excellent notes and very good charcuterie. It isn't somewhere I'll be rushing back to though. For the price, I'd rather take a day trip to Paris and pop by Gilles Verot's shop in person.",-1
5,"This is such a fabulous find in London. I've been to most of his NYC establishments, and this one was such a wonderful experience that my husband and I dined there twice in one week! Service was impeccable as was the food in a quasi-casual brasserie atmosphere.",1
3,"I'm a devotée of Daniel Boulud. I've enjoyed many wonderful meals at every single NYC restaurants of hison many occasions. I got engaged at Daniel and my last meal on earth would be at Daniel. (DB's fine dining restaurant on the Upper East Side, NYC.)
My husband and I had many excellent après-theatre dinners at Bar Bouloud in NYC, so visiting Bar Bouloud in London on a similar occasion seemed like an obvious choice. (Besides, we were curious to try one of the latest additions to the DB Empire.)
Bar Boulud London is very much like Bar Boulud NYC. On steroids!! They have a capacity to seat AT LEAST 200 ppl. (BB NYC has about 75.) Similar menu (with old time favorites like the ""Frenchie Burger"" and ""Coq au Vin"" and artisan sausages) with very similar decor and similar winelist but that's about it. Granted, we went there on a Friday night, but BB resembled a nightclub where they happen to serve food. (That's a serious mistake as Daniel's food is normally as good as it gets. At least in NYC.)
I'm not sure if it is the culprit of the location (BB is very unfortunately nested at the Mandarin Oriental at Knightsbridge) but it is the service (from the hostess all the way to the sommelier) that seriously kills it. Honestly, the service could not be more clueless, rude and snotty even if they tried hard. So un-DB. (Truth must be said, the guy who looked after us seemed quite pleasant and I was just thinking to myself, he doesn't really fits with the rest of them.)
It might be London, it might be the Mandarin, it might just be the particular night we were here, I'm not sure. To be honest, I'd never come back to find it out considering how many wonderful choices there are in London. What a disappointment.",-1
3,Popular casual dining that's known for its burgers and sausages.  The Piggie burger was great (and messy) though the Frenchie was drenched in horse radish that ruined it.  Atmosphere was great for Friday night but service was only okay,-1
4,"Of all the Bar Boulud's I've been to (4 now), this one seems to do it best.  The service is excellent and the food amongst the best (haven't enjoyed the NY West Side location as much). The sommelier recommended a fine bottle at a reasonable price and given everything in London is relatively expensive for everyone, the damage was not as great as I expected.  The burgers we had are great, on par with what you get on 44th Street in Manhattan at Bistro Moderne.",1

 Daniel Boulud is pretty much a superstar of the USA dining scene. He can lay claim to being the chef patron of many an acclaimed restaurant and his 3 Michelin starred Daniel in New York (a darling of The New York Times - it has received 4 stars from 3 successive critics no less than 5 times since 1986) was recently ranked 8th in San Pelligrino's World's 50th best restaurants. (The Greedy Diva had a solid but slightly less dazzling experience there in 2008 - which I'm sure has The New York Times thinking twice.) And now Monsieur Boulud has pitched his flag in the heart of London. I had my table booked before you could say ""steak fri..."".
 While M. Boulud was born in Lyon, which plays a heavy influence on the food at hand, Bar Boulud has a swanky, New York feel (the music on it's website says it all).
 Sister to New York's Bar Boulud, the London bistro decor is intended to be a modern interpretation of a wine bar. Elegant, sleek and sexy, there's a zinc bar, oak panelling and wooden floors (intended to be reminiscent of wine barrels), chandeliers, and swathes of red leather (intended to ""conjure the warm depths of a delicious Burgundy"" - the hint was lost on me at the time, but I suppose I get it in hindsight). Overall, the decor is fairly understated - it's not going to bowl you over before you taste anything.
 The classic French bistro menu holds much to allure. We took longer than usual deliberating over so many appealing options - the Boudin Blanc truffled white sausage with mashed potato is calling me, but so is the beetroot with horseradish and hazelnut, the fish soup and the coq au vin. But then what about the signature charcuterie plates from renowned charcutier, Gilles Verot - such as the Lapin de Garrigue - Provencal pulled rabbit, carrot, courgette and herbs terrine? Tempting.
 In the end, we opt for the £20 menu prix fixe (we'll come back again if we like it), before my deliciously oaky Marsanne steals the last shred of my decision making ability (Andre Perret, Marsanne, Vin De Pays Des Collines Rhodaniennes 2007 - £6.50 - absolutely lovely).
 I start with the luxurious rabbit terrine with cornichons and cocktail onions, toasted bread and a hearty mustard. Elegant and wantonly good, the 2 Frenchmen on the table next door have a serve each, then order another to share. Oui.
 The Peanut Gallery starts light, with the Salade de Roquette - rocket salad, garlic confit toast, stewed tomato, tapenade and buffalo mozzarella. Each element is nice enough, although, not surprisingly, there's nothing here to showcase the kitchen's real strengths. TPG is pacing himself. I'm still in some shock over his choice here, but if we're looking for that silver lining, it certainly gives us just one extra excuse to come back for a face to face with the Boudin Blanc. (Can you tell that it's still playing on my mind?).
 It's hard to go past the chance to devour a New York style burger - it's been a while. We both order the DBGB Yankee Burger - a grilled beef patty, iceberg lettuce, tomato, sweet onion, sesame brioche bun, cheese pickle and fries (£13 with cheese on the a la carte menu). In this price bracket, it's got to compete with my beloved burgers at Hawksmoor and Goodman. It does.
 It might be the messiest thing I've eaten for some time (think shredded lettuce in a train wreck), but this baby is the closest thing I've had to that much sought after, but highly elusive, US style burger in London. It's reminiscent of Shake Shake (and this, for me, is a mighty accomplishment). But it's loftier, even if there's a little too much foliage. The meat is loosely packed, moist and sumptuously flavourful and mine at least was perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. Surprisingly, TPG's patty was a little more well done than mine. (But I still didn't share). The accompanying thin cut fries were are good as they looked.
 On the a la carte menu, the Frenchie Burger comes with confit pork belly as well as the beef patty and there's a Piggy Burger with a beef patty and BBQ pulled pork. While these other combos sound tempting, the flavour of the beef can really sing in the classic DBGB Yankee burger.
 Quite satisfied, I could eat no more than 2 scoops of refreshing mint ice-cream and a decadent chocolate sorbet. More could be made of the sugary biscuit in between if they're going to bother at all.
 TPG finished with the Gateau Basque - custard cake with brandied cherries (£6). The cherries packed a strong punch, but the custard cake itself was boring and dry with a hint of orange that didn't succeed in lifting it out of the doldrums. Disappointing.
 Next time, I'll be trying the freshly baked madeleines (£4 - if they're the same ones we had at Daniel, they're divine) or the macaroons (£5) - among other things.
 We finish with a sweet Domain De Trapadis, Rasteau 2007 (£9) (rich, grape juice",1
3,"The food was only average.  They were also out of a few dishes our table was interested in ordering.  I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but if I was in the neighborhood I'd give it another try.",-1
5,"Bar Boulud can be found in the depths of the Mandarin Oriental, opposite Harvey Nics (perfect pit-stop during the sales). This is a smart (posh jeans-friendly) French with a New York edge buzzy bar/dining room. Highlights are the perfectly porky piggy burger and a rather sumptuous, smooth coq au vin (£17.50 and worth it), although, there is a dazzling range of equally tempting dishes on the menu. Bar Boulud has a surprisingly relaxed vibe in a very poncey postcode. (

5,"I feel like everyone has already fangirled over this (yes, it is possible to fangirl over a burger), but the BB burger is so so so good!!! One of the food highlights of my recent trip to London. Also close by to Harrod's and South Kensington.",1
5,"I made a reservation for Christmas Dinner and they called once to get my email to send me a confirmation and 2 days prior, they called to confirm. I showed up 10 minutes early and was surprised to find the restaurant half full as other places were fully booked up. Since it was Christmas, we had the fix price menu and the whole meal was wonderful.
The service was discreet but swift when you looked up with a question. The plating was beautiful and the taste was top notch. I wold go back to try their regular menu to see if it was as good but loved it overall.",1
5,"I visited Bar Boulud expecting to have a brunch like i had in the New York restaurant. I had anticipated that the place would have the same menu as in New York (a yelp review being the reason for the expectation) but sadly the London establishment didn't have a brunch menu at all. So my friend and i had to settle for a French lunch.
The place is classy ... you feel the elegance everywhere. One thing i noticed was the extraordinarily high staff to table ratio. We had a reservation for 12 noon when most of the tables were empty. So we did see dozens of staff members just whiling away with apparently nothing to do.
We went for the set menus ... the two course version costs £16 while its £20 for three courses. For the first course both of us had terrine made of leg of lamb. The dish was borderline raw meat, and i am not a big fan of meat that is not well cooked. But this one was great. Minced lamb has always been one of my favourite foods and to have a brilliantly made meat loaf made of it was a great experience.
For the main course i had a tagliatelle pasta with lamb bolognese. I was surprised as i was under the impression that bolognese sauce was invariably made from beef. However this variation proved to be a very good choice. The pasta was excellent. My friend had a dish of chicken breast. The chicken looked dry but was actually quite juicy, and it was served with cubical pieces of bacon. Every dish had been interesting so far ... i was beginning to love this place :)
I had a glass of Greek white wine (my little contribution towards helping them tide over their debt crisis) while my friend was ""persuaded"" to order an expensive red worth £14 per glass (he asked for suggestions ... he deserved what he got). The red was thick, with a strong odour. The white was milder. For dessert, i had a Muscat de Rivesaltes, which was quite good, while my friend went for the chocolate ice-cream (a safe option ... you can't screw up chocolate, can you ?).
Initially i had thought that the portion sizes were small ... but i was wrong, proven by the fact that i was full at the end of the meal.
The service was excellent, right from taking my jacket to returning it. We did finish our lunch quickly, in less than one hour and a half, but unlike some of the other reviewers here, i never felt rushed. With drinks and service, we paid about £37 per head. Based on the location and ambience, i am sure they can charge much more. We did save by going for the set menus, but even a-la-carte wouldn't have cost much more as many of the main courses were priced in the teens.
Another interesting aspect of Bar Boulud was the many options that i found in chicken and lamb. This is a French restaurant which even my parents would like (they don' t eat pork or beef).
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. Next time i plan to try some of the American dishes (mostly burgers and steaks) on the menu. I have all the excuses i need for returning to the 89th best restaurant in the world :)",1
4,"Really decent food, patient waiting staff, nice atmosphere.",1
1,"We've been to this restaurant over 20 times since they opened.  But on my most recent visit, the service was unacceptable.  We waited 15 minutes for our menus.  Then we waited at least 15 minutes for the starter plates to be cleared.  We waited 20 minutes for our mains to arrive, and that was after we complained to the duty manager.  I'm not sure what's going on, but it's gone from a very good service establishment to a very poor service establishment in very little time.  Perhaps the training managers from NY went back home.",-1
4,"Had a girly Friday evening at Bar Boulud. Located in the heart of Knightsbridge with its own private entrance at ground level of the prestigious Mandarin Oriental hotel, it's as one would expect, very classy bar/restaurant. I arrived at about 8pm, and there was a nice atmosphere, not too overly crowded, we all managed to get seats at the bar. Dress-wise, there was a mix of people in suits to those more casually dressed. I came smart/casual - skinny jeans and high heels, but my friends braved the cold in their little black dresses. It's a really nice place to catch up with friends or go out on a date, and conveniently moments from Knightsbridge underground station. Would like to go back and try the food next time...",1
4,"Recommend: mixed meat udon, steamed shrimp dumplings, and steamed pork buns.
Skip the short ribs.
If you are the type that does not like to flag down the wait staff, it may not be the place for you.",1
5,"The service here was helpful and welcoming and the dim sum was just as I'd expect at a good restaurant.
The roasted pork bao was probably my favorite. Second to that was the yam croquettes. Also wouldnt kick the  prawn d dumplings  or garlic prawn eggrolls out of bed.
We also tried the seafood noodle soup which was a generous portion. Would have liked more depth of flavor in the broth but it was good.
A nice little spot in Chinatown for anyone looking for dim sum. I'd go again!",1
5,"Simple authentic and tasty. The turnip cake with shrimp and pork suggested that we were in for some fun. The curry octopus? Wow. So delicious and tender and not your Indian style of curry. The bao, steamed bbq pork buns, were a little too much thickened sauce and not enough pork, but very tasty. Luck of the draw. We had a pork shrimp and scallion with coriander dumpling that was delicious. We finished with egg custard tarts that were warm, light, and flaky wonders. 
The menu has a lot of variety. A lot of Asian patrons on our floor were eating beautiful greens and a congee or two that looked great.
The restaurant has rooms up three stories of the building. They have a lift as well as stairs. Service was very good. The gentleman who served us was very pleasant and checked on us. Excellent food and great prices for theatre-adjacent Chinatown!",1
4,"If you're in Chinatown, I highly recommend Joy King Lau. I was very impressed with how fast food comes out of the kitchen. We ordered and began eating within a few minutes - SO speedy. They have a lot of menu options and big portions. Their staff are efficient and the operations seem to run smoothly. The seating is a little cramped and is kind of wheelchair accessible.",1
3,"Joy King Lau is located on Leicester St (China town) London.  It has 3 floor Chinese restaurant and pretty old fashioned dim sim.
We came here for lunch to meet my old friend in London.  I couldn't compare the size, taste and price with other Chinese restaurant in London coz this is the first Chinese dim sim restaurant we visited.
The deep fired taro cake so crispy and tasty.
The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf pretty wet (mushy) but still tasty.
The shrimp dumping just mediocre.
Overall, the dim sims were good but not great.  I start missing HK and Vancouver's dim sim restaurants.",-1
4,The only dim sum spot I went to in London. Not bad. There are there levels of seating and u order from the waitstaff who brings the food over (vs the push cart). The dishes were flavorful,1
3,"A few years back, the dim sum was so-so and I thought I'd give the place another chance. Again, it was average. Nothing horribly wrong but no standouts either. 
The har gow were overcooked and the wrappers fell apart when you took them out of the steamer basket. These are always the benchmark for any dim sum restaurant and they could have been better. 
Everything else was decent enough but overall, a pretty average experience. There are better dim sum places in Chinatown so I would go elsewhere before coming back here again.",-1
4,"Typical dim sum restaurant, this place is one of the closest to Chinese restaurant which is in mainland China. In particular beef brisket noodle soup was excellent, soup was deeply and nicely tasted, really impressive one.",1
5,"Authentic Cantonese cuisine!  Quick, efficient, competent service.  Went for dim sum and a separate time for dinner and was pleased with food overall.  Excellent taste akin to what I get back home in NYC.  I ordered a whole steamed fish as one of the dinner courses - very surprised and impressed to see that that they deboned the fish.  I was impressed with the authenticity of taste.  Everything was spot on except for the fried crullers I ordered with the congee (they were crispy throughout and very oily) - that's the only thing I'd avoid.
I'd definitely return again.",1
3,"I really like this place. I was in London for almost two weeks and ate here three nights while I was there. I'm hoping that next time I'm in London I'll have a chance to try their dim sum. On a regular night it's not too busy, and their staff is very quick. But you have to understand that you're going to an authentic Chinese place, the service is not going to be super friendly. 
Since it was cold all the nights I visited, I kept ordering different versions of their rice noodle soup. And that's the best thing about this place, you can kind of create your own dish with all the broth flavors and noodle options that they give you. The one night that I ordered to-go the waiter was rude and lied to me, telling me that they didn't give out to-go chopsticks when a few nights before I was given a set of chopsticks with my leftovers. I didn't let that bother me, even though it was a to-go (takeaway) order, they warmed it up well that I was still able to enjoy hot soup back at my hotel. This place is good, the service is what it is, I would ignore it for good Chinese food.",-1
5,"So good my friends said they would eat the exact same meal tomorrow! Dumplings, egg rolls, quarter of aromatic crispy duck, followed by salt and chili squid, Szechuan king prawns, and glazed char siu  (pork)...mouth watering right now to go back tonight!",1
4,"I went on Chinese New Year so the wait was terrible but not the fault of the restaurant. What was the fault of the restaurant was making me feel like I wasn't as important because I was traveling and eating alone. I had to wait forever, then they gave my table away, then I had to wait 15-20 more minutes for another table. At least the food was delicious. The beef in the beef noodle soup was absolutely sensational and the pork bun was sweet and perfectly soft. Another thing I didn't like was the lack of hot chili oil on the table, you had to ask for it just to receive a tiny portion. The food was great and would go back on a normal day. Maybe the service will be better under those circumstances.",1
4,I've had some of the best dim sum in the world and this place comes close. The place was packed which is always a good sign. Lotus leaf rice wrap was amazing.,1
5,"AT LAST. A five-star dim sum place. I was beginning to wonder if they existed after being in Seattle so long. (No offense, Sea-Town, I got nothin' but love for ya, baby.)
A local friend of ours recommended Joy King Lau and he did not lead us wrong. I had planned on going to Yuatcha, but its format of serving dim sum sounded... un dim sum-like.
I wanted a huge variety of well-executed dishes to choose from. Price, location, or the level of service made no difference to me. 
Outside their door, I read the stickers plastered all over the window, 'Best of this' and 'Best of that.' Upon entry inside, the door is opened for us. And... and... they SMILED at us. 
What kind of dim sum parallel universe have I fallen into?? I touch my chest and legs to make sure I'm not dead. 
We are the first people in the restaurant, and promptly served Oolong tea. The menu is so expansive, I forgot what I read by the time I got to the end of the menu. You'll want to write your choices down; trust me.
- Rice noodle roll filled with shrimp covered in fried bean curd sheet. PERFECT.
- Roast duck with bok choy served over rice. Standard dish and solid here
- Tong Choi - stir fried greens in garlic. They did an awesome job of cooking these; they weren't slimy from overcooking and had the right amount of salt and broth
- Curry octopus: the octopus are so teeny and adorable you may feel bad about eating them. But then you take a bite of the tender body and all bets are off
- Sticky glutinous rice - my date loves this dish. Sticky rice steamed in leaves; I don't think he counts it as dim sum unless he orders this. What was DIFFERENT about this one was the filling. Huge chunks of meats are inside! One inch+ chunks of pork, fat cuts of Chinese sausages (not the teensy eensy cubes) 
Dishes are cleared quickly, without feeling like they're rushing you. Teacups are continuously topped off, and all around, the service was far above what I'm used to.
All these dishes were under 38.00 GBP. Wicked deal plus the quality (and service!) means I'll be heading back here.",1
1,The food here is not authentic. Salted fried rice is too salty. Found hair in our food. Dim sum over cooked. It's all froze and reheated.,-1
4,"A great spot for dim sum in Chinatown!
I was in Leicester Square with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and came here for dim sum after a quick search on Yelp. Most dim sum restaurants had lines but we were seated almost immediately at Joy King Lau. The restaurant is multi-storied and we were directed to the second floor upon entering.
Menus were already at our tables when we sat down. You'll see two menus - the dim sum one is laminated and has pictures of all the dim sum they serve, making it really easy to order. If you wanted other Chinese food, you could also refer to the full menu. 
My friend and I ended up getting thai style chicken feet (cold), shu mai, dough stick cheung fun (jar luen), yam croquette, char siu croquette, and preserved egg and pork congee. The food came shortly after we ordered, and they were delicious and in my opinion, closer to HK standards compared to other dim sum I've had. The yam croquette and char siu croquette are fried dim sum but they were not greasy at all. The shu mai and jar luen were flavorful!
Overall, Joy King Lau is a fantastic place for delicious dim sum. Everything came out to be under £15 per person too, which makes it pretty affordable. I highly recommend getting your dim sum fix here!",1
2,"I was discriminated by my own kind!  =O
The moment you walk in, I feel like they vet who stays on the main floor and who they send upstairs to the second floor. I noticed if you're coloured, you're on the second floor.
I had the equivalent of what is considered Cantonese fried noodles. It was unimpressive. The meat was cheaper, like fish balls, cut in half. There was 1 shrimp. The portion wasn't a lot. Maybe I'm used to the Toronto standard (i.e. Congee Queen)?
They also charge for tea!!!  £2.10 per person. It's hot water with a few tea leaves. Come to Toronto. Chinese food and dim sum is much better and cheaper.",-1
4,"I take back what I said before, I love this place! You just need to come for the dim sum, forget the rest of the menu (which I reviewed with just two stars). I think dim sum is served until 5pm  and it is served steaming hot and delicious. The prawn dumpling is my favourite but the prawn cheung fun is also really good and very satisfying. This place is seriously yummy in my tummy and is my go-to spot for good dim sum in London. 
The room is a nice place to sit down and I like going upstairs here to enjoy a leisurely weekend afternoon of dim sum in a spacious room with endless refills of hot tea and good company. The service is good and I would say this is my favourite place in Chinatown.",1
3,"Would go 3.5 if allowed. We were two of the very few non-Chinese in the restaurant. A real positive in my book. We were looking for Peking Duck and other dishes pre-theater. The (half) duck we shared was very good -not Great - but very good. Very thin steamed pancakes, good amount of skin and meat along with traditional garnish. We also had cashew chicken (a bit bland but with tender chunks of chix) and Sichuan Green Beans (quite good). Very limited in their alcohol selection but not unusual for a Chinese restaurant. We had Tsing Tao beer (icy cold). Service was attentive but my wife was bothered by the cleaning of the men's toilet in her full view while we were dining. Given the location I'd say the value was fair.",-1
1,"What a rip off, food was only $22 and they managed to add all sorts of charges we end up paying $31 and the worst part is the food isn't even good",-1
4,"We really enjoyed Joy King Lau.  It was as authentic as you could get.  The restaurant occupies to what seems like 3 floors of dining.  It was packed for lunch, but they got me in pretty quickly due to the size of the restaurant.  All of the food looked and tasted excellent.  I ordered a duck noodle soup.  The duck was excellent.  They didn't remove the bones or cartilage, so don't order if you can't handle that.  The beef brisket soup was quite good as well.  They had a large dim sum collection which was extremely popular with the other diners.  For an authentic China Town lunch this is a great place.",1
5,The best cantonese restaurant in London. Don't miss the steam chilie sea bass and stewed lamb brisket taste like heaven!,1
5,"Dim Sum is one of my favourite meals and Joy King Lau has a very competitive offering.  Had been here many years ago but for some reason had not come back.  Went today and it was quite good.  The stand out was a fried garlic and prawn spring roll.   While these are often rather generic this one stood out, primarily because of the garlic.  I ordered the other standbys (Prawn/Pork dumpling, char siu bun and prawn cheung fen); all were good, not greasy and hot.  The only thing I didn't love were Shanghai dumplings but it was just an opinion, they were well prepared and interesting.  Overall, a good option for dim sum.",1
5,"I'm happy to report that this place is Excellent. Much better than dumplings legend (which kind of makes me sad bc I've been there many times)
It's not lively and it's on a side street but the quality of the 3 dumplings we had was very above average.
Need to go back to try more. Mostly did steamed.
I should deduct one star as the waitress was AWFUL. So mean!! But whatever, the food was fast and good.",1
4,"Nice yum cha place with a lot of choices, nothing fancy. 
Service is not the best, had to ask 4 times before they would serve me my Diet Coke. 
Come early to be sure to not queue to get a table as it gets really crowded after 12:30pm. 
Salted egg yolk custard buns were to die for!
We paid £45 for two.",1
1,"**They don't serve dim sum at night. Hot and sour was extremely sour, it was like drinking vinegar. Service was subpar - they had 5 or 6 servers but I wanted water half of the time we dined there. Egg noodles with prawn had a very confusing taste and the noodles were over cooked. The veggie dish we got was soggy. Don't recommend for dinner.",-1
4,"I ate here because the view from my hotel room was this place. I didn't know what exactly they had, but after seeing a picture list of dim sum from a distance I said why not.
They didn't have the carts rolling around, but they had an extensive dim sum menu. I walked in about 5 minutes before they were going to stop serving dim sum and I was able to get a few items. I tried the shu mai, bbq pork bun, beef meatballs, and black bean pork ribs.
This was some of the best dim sum I've ever had, and for about 15 pounds. Everything seemed like they made it fresh in house, and the portions were slightly larger than what i'm used to.",1
5,Wonderful and attentive service.  Efficient without rushing.  Authentic Cantonese cuisine that ranges from common dishes to specialty cuisine.  Very flavorful dishes.  It's so wonderful that we went back twice during our short stay in London (once for dim sum and another for dinner). I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for authentic Chinese food in London.,1
5,"Best dimsum I have ever had so far (Compared to all the dimsum places I've tried in Boston and NYC). The two staples of dimsum, har gao and shu mai, are amazing and made with the freshest ingredients. The har gao had ""real shrimp"" taste, not like the frozen shrimp used in the states. The shu mai was completely different (a much better different) than anything I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was made with pork but it was perfectly flavored and had great elasticity (many people don't get what I mean by that). But the most breathtaking item on the menu had to be the DEEP FRIED CUSTARD BUNS. These custard buns went from 0-100 real quick in the fryer. The outside layer was a beautiful golden brown and it was the perfect toasted crunchiness achievable on a bun. 
Definitely making the trip back here when I visit London again!",1
5,"This is a review of the dim sum at Joy King Lau.
Over 3 days, I ate at Yauatcha, Joy King Lau, and Beijing Dumpling back to back. Joy King Lau was the most authentic tasting Chinese dim sum out of the three restaurants, and the best, in my opinion. I've eaten a lot of dim sum in my lifetime all over California, and this place is a solid ""I would take my family to eat here if they visited London"" recommendation. The cost to eat here for 2 people was less than half of what I paid at Yauatcha. I will be coming back to Joy King Lau, but never returning to the other place.
Recommended:
- Har Gau (steamed shrimp dumpling). Delicious flavor, fresh-tasting shrimp
- Pan fried turnip cake. Nicely fried with crispy edges. Very little Chinese sausage in it though.
- Beef rice sheet rolls",1
5,"Best place to get dim sum in London, HANDS DOWN. I don't care what anyone else says Joy King Lau is the best. Always packed for dim sum lunch on the weekends but they know how to move people to seats quickly and you're never left waiting too long. Extensive menu and staff are knowledgeable for the inexperienced! My favourite is definitely the cheung fun with shrimp and chicken bao. DIE DIE MUST TRY.",1
4,Decent place for dim sum. They offer most of the traditional dim sum dishes. Prices aren't too bad either.   They also have picture menu which make ordering dim sum easy.,1
5,"Dimsum was so good! I tried shrip dimsum, scallop with shrimp dimsum and soup dumpling(shanghai style dumpling?) and service was so nice. I think it was one of my best meal in london",1
4,"I've heard frequently that Joy King Lau has the BEST dim sum in Chinatown. This is not true. They do decent dim sum that is better than a lot of Chinatown, but still not the best. Where Joy King Lau really shines is the cooked noodles/rice dishes they do, which have a great fresh flavour, aren't too oily and are good sized portions for the price. 
We came here as a large group and booked a table which was a pleasant surprise in itself, and were pleased with not only how quickly the food came, but how polite the service is. Friendly waiters are not generally the main aim for when you go to Chinatown, but it's good to know that it isn't entirely gone from the restaurants here! 
I'll definitely be coming back here as the food is pretty good and cheap, plus the service + reservations means extra high points from me. It's not my first choice for dim sum in Chinatown, but the chefs change regularly at all the establishments so it's hard to keep up!",1
5,"Best Roast Duck in Chinatown! Great service. Awesome egg fried rice to go along. Look around, and you'll see stars of the theater eating here... Truly a gem in the area!",1
2,"We stop by for dinner early one night and we sat on the second floor. Its a very small restaurant and the seating areas are divided into different floors. I wasn't really impressed by the food that they served. For some reason, I felt that it was lacking flavor to it and it was true for all the dishes that I had. 
We had two different waiters that waited on us. The older gentleman was very nice and polite and helpful when ordering food , but the older lady that was there at the same time tends to ignore you. I've asked her for extra rice and salt and was ignored and she never brought it to the table. Weird. Be aware that they automatically include the service charge. Sneaky 
We ordered a Chinese watercress cooked with shrimp paste which was above average , it lacks a little salt in it which I probably wouldn't have mind if I could have gotten my waiter to bring me some salt. Per the waiter's recommendation, we ordered a tofu with seafood plate which had a decent serving with a lot of seafood in it. 
The food was a little cold. I don't know why. It's not freezing cold but just luke warm. I prefer my food to be hot , straight off from the wok. Maybe it sat on the dummy waiter for a while before the brought it to the table.",-1
4,"We only stopped here for a quick, light and cheap dinner. 
As we stepped in the front door, the aroma of food just reminds me of home and comfort food. Everyone seems to be feasting on hotpot and I didn't want a big and elaborous meal. I was surpised that the place seemed to be smaller than it looks. 
We just had a portion of dumplings and noodles to share. The dumplings, I was not so keen on but those noodles in broth was irresistible. I could not stop myself from having more. The sweetness, spicy, tangy and saltyness were very well balanced. It was definitely my favourite hot and sour noodles in town. Highly recommended!
it was cheap, light but not as quick as I thought. It was not necessary a bad thing, just expected a quicker service.",1
1,Really bad chinese food. The food looks and tastes plain. Service is also under UK standard.,-1
5,"This dimsum spot was really good. It might even be better than the dimsum places in the United States. I liked how you order first and then it's brought out to you, where as in the United States, most places have the carts that get pushed around from table to table. The food was hotter this way when we order first and then had it brought to us. There's many options to choose from, and I tried about half of the dim sum menu. Order just about anything and you won't be disappointed.",1
4,"I had to dim-sum when I was visiting London, since there are a lot of them at china town I had  a hard time picking one. But fortunately I picked the right one!
They have everything you want when it comes to dim-sum. The menu is both in Chinese and English, the staff also spoke those languages (Cantonese). The food was delicious and nothing really to complain about.
The restaurant might seem small but there is a second floor, so don't be intimidated if it looks full. The interior is generic Chinese restaurant, a little bit dirty and rusty. The only bad thing really is that the restaurant is very tight, you don't have any privacy and people will bump your shoulders many time if you don't face your back against a wall.
If you are in London and looking for dim-sum then this is the place!",1
5,Had no idea you could find Chinese food this fresh (the vegetable spring rolls are SUPERB) in London. Will definitely be back next time I visit the city.,1
1,Horrible Service. Dining room smelled like piss from the toilets.We were treated really badly by the waitress.The food was terrible and all the 5 dishes we ordered had the same sickly flavor.Definitely never coming back here again. Worst meal in my visit to london.,-1
3,"Short story: Meh.
Long story: 
If there's one thing I'm crazy about it's going to Dim Sum on weekends. I almost never get to that, so I when I do, it's always super exciting.
We got to Joy King Lau through Yelp reviews. Here are the points worth noting for other lovers of the genre:
1. Get there on time minus 10 minutes. They start letting people in at ~11:50.
2. There are no dim sum carts. You get a special menu and order from that. The menu includes most of the solid favorites. 
3. The crowd in this restaurant is mostly Asian, but not only.
4. Prices are average. For 2 semi-hungry people we paid £37, 10% service is included here. 
5. Food taste is okay. It's not bad and it's nothing you'll remember later/think to come back for. 
Personally I would have wanted to have a better tasting meal at Dim Sum. Apparently there are 2 other good spots in London's Chinatown area: Wan Chai and Beijing Dumpling that are similar as well.",-1
5,"Wow, just amazingly good.  Walked in on our way home. Dim sum was outstanding was mixed seafood hot pot, the vermicelli was a little weak but the mix of seafood was outstanding as was the overall flavor",1
5,"If you're looking for the best(!) and freshest(!) Dim Sum in Soho - look no further! Joy King Lau on Leicester Street (adjacent to Lisle Street) offers a fairly large menu of steamed & fried dim sum, including some more exotic varieties - and a selection of cheung fun, of course.
Just returned from London, where I always have dim sum several times during my stays. So far, I mostly frequented the Wan Chai Corner (on Gerrard Street) for its broad selection and solid quality, or Beijing Dumpling (on Lisle Street) for its absolutely freshly made dumplings. The two I will still recommend strongly - but Joy King Lau is different. All the dim sum are made freshly and have a better (firmer, more al dente usually) bite to them than those of the competition. Also, they're about 15% cheaper in comparison to the other Soho establishments, which also makes this restaurant great value! The regular dim sum are just UKP 2.80 per dish.
Three times I had lunch at Joy King Lau in early to mid-August of 2015 - three times I chose 5 or 6 different dim sum each. This might seem too much for the average single traveler, but I wanted to sample as many different dim sum from this place as possible, having read some rave reviews on the Internet (the reviews here are mixed, which I don't quite understand). Expect 3 or 4 dim sum per person for a tummy-filling meal. They made only 1 mistake, as they served me the regular salty fried squid instead of the squid cakes I had ordered.
The atmosphere is quite typical for a Soho Chinese. It's always rush-rush-rush - this is no place to linger with friends for a party, or with a large family on a get-together. OTOH, for a quick lunch or early dinner with a friend or wife, it's great. You can always hang out for chit chat at one of the many pubs in the neighborhood (there's a good Fuller's pub a stone's throw away on the same street). Having said that, the waiters *never* forced the bill on me after I'd finished my meals - I had to ask for it!
The fact that Joy King Lau is also a small(!) restaurant tends to add to the atmosphere of slight chaos and rush.
What's less typical is that the service is very attentive - they're always around to fill up your cup of Chinese tea (which you'll get automatically once you've been seated - so pay attention if you don't want tea!). Sometimes too attentive - there are so many waiters and waitresses around it can happen that one hands you the menu, then turns away, then another one steps up to ask for your order - 30 seconds after you've been seated! It may sound like pushiness - but it is not. The waiters just don't pay attention to what the others are doing.
If a little chaos does not deter you, the traveler looking for first class dim sum, then you shouldn't hesitate and include Joy King Lau in your Soho roster of Chinese joints. See the photos for the variety of steamed and fried dim sum I had (not a fan of cheung fun, so I can't comment on those). Particularly recommendable are: the pork & prawn dumplings with Chinese mushroom, the fried skin of chicken filled with four delicacies (just called ""Chicken with Four Kinds"" on the menu!), the beef with spring onion and ginger, the spicy beef tripe (not quite so spicy, actually - it's made with ginger), the siu mai (a standard dim sum, but of higher quality here than elsewhere!) and the chicken with Chinese dumpling (Warning: the chicken here is on the bones!). But ALL of the 17 ones I had were of superior to excellent quality.
The bill includes a ""mandatory"" 10% service charge. With 6 dim sum + chinese tea + service I ended up with a UKP 20-21 bill. Very reasonable considering the quality.
Dim sum can be ordered up until 5 p.m. (17.00), which is customary in Soho.
Almost all of the other guests during my three visits to Joy King Lau were Asian - I always consider that a good sign. Make sure that when you want to have lunch there with 3 or even 2 people that you show up at 12 noon when they open on weekdays, because the small restaurant will fill up quickly.
Please have a look at my photos, which also includes snapshots of the menus.",1
5,"Been to a lot of dim sum places across the USA. I wanted to try dim sum in London and decided to come here. The fried meat dumplings, ribs in black bean sauce are my two favorite things. Very good here! Eating in chinatowns have never disappointed me. This was place was good!",1
1,Food was fair. Everything we ate was below average taste for a decent Chinese restaurant,-1
4,"Very good and cheap Chinese restaurant! 
the yum croquette are by far my favourite (and my mom's too), the dim sum are good and the place is pretty much packed by Chinese people. This restaurants is not in the main china town street which make him less ""commercial"" as the other ones.",1
3,"We brought my wife's parents here for a yum char lunch on their 2nd day in London. It is on the Leicester Square side of Chinatown, just up from M&Ms World. Looks very popular. We walked up to the 3rd floor. Lots of Cantonese speakers around and the in-laws felt like they were back in Hong Kong.
We had jasmine tea for the table and washed the utensils as you would do in Hong Kong. My wife ordered a good variety of dishes, both fried and steamed, for the table to share. The food came out fast and all was as expected. They did the basics well: I liked the prawn dumplings.
We were all satisfied with the lunch and I recommend it as a reliable destination if you are looking to have a meal in Chinatown.",-1
5,Very delicious and authentic Chinese food. We came back twice as they ran out of dumplings the night we got in to London.,1
4,"This was the first place to visit after arriving London in order to understand the developments in the London's food situation - 3.5 stars, not bad at all (4/9/2016). As people talk, I could feel the food situation has gotten a lot better in the recent decade. The food they make is fairly authentic and good. We ordered several dim sum including black bean pork rib, Fujian fried rice, kailan.",1
4,"The 4 is for food, specifically the crispy duck with plum sauce and pancakes.  It is stellar.  It is so good, I have never eaten anything else here.  It all looks over sauced and gooey.  But the crispy duck is heaven.  The service is decent when the restaurant is not over crowded.  The decor pretty Chinese retro, and that's a compliment.  But the duck: 5 quacks.",1
5,"The best dim sum I've had in London by far.  Particularly recommend the turnip paste, which I honestly thought was fish, and any of the many custard based items but everything I had was very good and the service attentive.  I guess a menu with pictures would have helped but I really have no criticism.",1
3,"Okay, the congee was so amazing after our long flight and a two hours walk in cold and damp New Year's Day, but everything else is pretty average.  Sorry I'm comparing the food to NYC Chinatown!  The place gets busy very quickly, so order all your things or the later additions won't make it to your table until late.  The waitress who force you to sit in a small table if you are dinning in pair, just ignore if there are open tables (especially if you know you are going to need the big table for all your dishes!)",-1
4,"I used to come to this place every Saturday lunch time to have Dim Sum, and dine here in dinner time from time to time.  My visit to my old favorite spot has not disappointed me.  All the staffs still remember me, that was a nice touch.  Service is efficient, and there are plenty of choice of different type of dim sum.  The quality was good.  The Rice Lasagna stuffed with prawns, the wrapping is so much lighter than those I have had in the Chinatown in DC.  The pan-fried pork dumpling is home made, with thin wrapping also.  Steamed Prawn Dumpling and Pork Dumpling was good too.  
I wish I can go every Saturday.....",1
3,"As many of the China town restaurants, Joy King Lau doesn't look particularly tempting but this one in particular was recommended to me. The comforting traditional Chine food makes up for the unimposing interior. The Sweetcorn and Tofu Soup was all right but the Aubergine with Garlic and Chilli was irresistably yummy.
The restaurant is visited by lots of big groups of Chinese who sit around round tables full of sharing platters. So the atmosphere is quite agitated and casual.",-1
4,"This place is hidden in the side street of London's Chinatown. The restaurant occupies the whole townhouse. We went there with a group of friends.
As we entered we were directed to the (2nd!) floor. Yes as you go up you feel you are walking in the hallway of some traditional English townhouse. And yes, that means it's fairly packed there. While we were waiting for our table on the 2nd floor landing (yes it looked like a landing :) I had to let people in and out of nearby toilet.
The venue itself looks elegant but it's not a kind of in-your-face decor. We had a great Dim Sum there, particularly I remember trying a fermented egg for the first time and it was a delight! The service was very professional and quick. Overall, it's a very decent place and the food is worth its monetary value.",1
3,"Perfectly decent dim sum. A little pricier than my current chinatown favourite Young Cheng just around the corner. The room is a little more spacious here however and the staff extremely attentive. Ensuring items get to your table in as few visits as possible. There were only 2 main visits to our table and we had all 8 dishes we'd ordered.
Nothing was stand out delicious, and whilst the chicken's feet were very nice and meaty, the sauce left me disappointed. And this was a case for quite a few dishes. Portion wise fantastic, but taste wise, extremely lacking. However this this instance you can normally expect the chilli oil to save the day, and save it indeed. It was excellent.
So I have no quibbles recommending this place if you're after good value dim sum. However just don't expect anything to surprise or tantalise your tastebuds. This place has a large number of regulars so they must be doing something right in terms of consistency, but sometimes that is at a price and for my it was the lack of that any one unique dish that you absolutely must go back for.",-1
2,"Came here for the dinner.  Is this what London considers good Chinese food?  Even the worst restaurants I've had in LA and NYC are better than this place.  The portions really small for what you were paying.  The hot and sour soup had too much vinegar, a lot of the food was too salty, and overall it was just incredibly westernized fare.  Not sure what I expected from a restaurant in a touristy location.",-1
5,"Excellent location near soho and Chinatown combined with reasonable prices and friendly service make this one of my favorites.  
The dim sum is outstanding.  We got the usual har low and shiu Mai along with curry welks. All were freshly made to order and came out piping hot.  The aromatic crispy duck was great and retained its crispy skin.   The only thing we didn't enjoy was the wonton noodle soup which was a little bland.  Overall this place is great and highly recommended.",1
5,"Our group really enjoyed the food. The servings were very plentiful and we were able to share across all persons in our group so we could sample all of the dishes we ordered. To maximize the variety.
The food came out quickly and staff was very friendly.",1
4,"Excellent: garlic prawn spring roll;  Good: har kau, salad cream crispy prawn dumpling, char siew roast pork bun;  Average: siew mai (inconsistent- one too much pork no shrimp, another with pork fats, third good shrimp but include bonus shell), scallop cheung fun (shrimp better); Avoid: salted egg custard bun (dry, not lava moist). Overall decent dim sum in quiet street off Chinatown.",1
4,"I've lived in London for 3.5 years now and have never eaten in Chinatown.  Yelp suggested this restaurant and I made a booking.  My friend and I, nevertheless, were impressed.  We weren't really hungry and therefore shared a quarter crispy duck from the appetizers with plum sauce and pancakes with a side of bean sprout noodles and it was the perfect amount of food.  The duck was delectable and the noodles were perfect - it had just enough grease without feeling too heavy.  The final price was alarmingly cheap.  Even though we didn't order much, it did fill us and we didn't even finish all of the duck.  The service was good, although we had a bit of a wait for the table, even though we had a booking.  By the way, this place gets jam-packed, so I do recommend reserving a table, particularly before 8 PM because the queue was out the door when we left.  I would definitely come back!",1
5,"A wonderful Dim Sum place, I have only been here daytime. I try to go every time Im in London so its been quite a few times now. The pork buns, salt & pepper squid as well as crispy duck pancakes are always on the order list. Can't wait for the time.",1
4,"DH and I came here to check out the dim sum and were not disappointed. Then menu was pretty extensive, but we restrained ourselves and ordered har kow, char siu cheung fun, sticky rice, spare ribs, and stuffed tofu skins. 
We found the prawns in the har kow to be fresh with a nice crisp to them and the cheung fun was really similar to what we have experienced in other restaurants. The sticky rice was not too gloopy and was prett flavorful. 
The service was friendly and prompt. We were seated and able to pay our bill without difficulty. We were seated in the back of the main level and the air conditioner was almost too cold, which just made us drink more hot tea to warm up.  We may consider coming back if we were in the area again.",1
5,"My boyfriend and I went in for some afternoon dim sum based on the good reviews, and what a treat! The prices were comparable to dim sum places in the states. Menus were in both English and Chinese, and staff spoke English and Mandarin. They had all the classic dim sum dishes, and the quality of food and service were fantastic. We really enjoyed our meal here and highly recommend!",1
4,"The following conversation took place before we went to have dim sum at Joy King Lau:
Me: Let's go for dim sum today, shall we? I've found this place on Yelp called Joy King Lau and their reviews are really promising?!
A: Oh no, let's go to our usual place (New World), at least we know that it's good...
Me: Oh come on, let's give it a try...we should broaden our horizon and try out new places...here, read these wonderful reviews...
A: Mmm...only one Chinese person has reviewed this place...I don't know...plus they don't have the push carts, and I really prefer dimsum places where they serve the food on trolleys...it's so much more authentic! 
Me: Let's at least have a look, shall we? We can always go to New World, but let's at least have a look from the outside...ok?
A: Mmm...if you really want to...but...
In any case, as you might have guessed, we ended up having dim sum at Joy King Lau and believe it or not but even A ended up liking the food very much:
A: Yummy...their food is really tasty! And even the chicken feet, which are my ultimate test for a place, are delicious!
So, even though I'm yet another Caucasian reviewing this place, I was accompanied by two very picky Taiwanese friends and they both have approved of this place! 
By the way, as for ordering dim sum, I particularly liked the BBQ pork buns, the sticky rice in lotus leaves, the tarot croquette and the meatballs. As for dessert, I can highly recommend the taro-tapioca soup (aka Cold Yum Pudding)...that was absolutely delicious!",1
5,"Authentic & delicious  at a very cheap price !
Don't hesitate to ask for extra stuff like Soy sauce, as the staff are quite responsive.   Long list of steamed and fried dim sum.  Be warned, there's always a long line for weekend dim sum.  Plates between £2-3 each.
But don't go here for dinner.  Although not bad, there are better places.
See my pictures at 
somacheapeatslondon.word…",1
5,"This is a fantastic dim sum place, my personal favourite in all of china town. It isn't fancy but as authentic as you get in London. Ribs in black bean sauce are amazing. Would totally recommend.",1
4,"Excellent service.
Food was very good, but not memorable. I had to think for a minute to remember what I ate there just a few days ago. I should mention that I was in a serious dim sum mood and it was too late for dim sum so I was a bit miffed.
*However* when I asked for the spare ribs in black bean sauce (on the dim sum menu), they were happy to make a special batch for me and it was quite good. For dinner, there isn't much that's 1-person sized. Everything is large. Dining room was full of happy-looking patrons.
Located in a small alleyway behind the W Hotel / M&M store so it's easy to miss but worth the visit.",1
5,"Looking for Dim Sum? You found the place. Full of Chinese locals. Decent service and good prices. Yummy food. We had calamari, pork buns and the house special noodles that are not on the menu. We overheard the people next to us ordering it and copied them. Not disappointing! Yum their tea is good too.",1
4,"If you took Windsor Dim Sum Café in Boston and duplicated it over four or five storeys, you'd pretty much end up with Joy King Lau. Same delicious food, same brusque and business-like service, and shockingly... Cantonese-speaking staff.
I was particularly impressed with the perfect consistency and crispiness of the luo buo gao. Their do miu ended up being just the tops of the more mature plants - I draw this conclusion from the fact that there were no stems, and the leaves were much heartier (yet still tender) than the veggies I'm used to.
Pass on their Shanghai xiao long bao. Whilst they're satisfying and have the right taste, -none- of the dumplings that came out in our steamer tray had the 'soup' part of 'soup dumplings' going on. Disappointing.
As far as the food goes, Joy King Lau probably ranks at the top of my list for London dim sum. There's still plenty to explore, but I'd be totally willing to come back here for another round.",1
4,"A hidden gem for dim sum lovers.
This is one of the smaller, low key Hong Kong dim sum houses. Though it's no match to Golden Dragon's expansive menu, delivering the basics right is where JKL excels.
An example of such would the humble shrimp dumpling: though steamed like any other, these feature a delightful burst of soup reminiscent of the xiao long bao (steamed pork dumplings encased in soupy dough). For the more adventurous among us, pairing with the house chilli is highly recommended.",1
5,"My friends and I decided to go get some Dim Sum while walking through Chinatown. This place was surprisingly very good! The service was great, and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!",1
4,"Lovely place, a bit crowded but they accomodate us quickly even with a long queue. Just a suggestion: if you want a dessert order it with the rest of the meal....",1
1,"Joy king is dead. Long Live the depressed queens. 
If love feeling like a dollar sign, the stress of city life and flute remix melonane... This restaurant is perfect for you.",-1
3,"Seven of us ordered pretty much all the major types of dimsum on the menu plus beef hor fun and a fancy plate of fried rice.  Everything was solid, though there was no stand-out dish in my opinion.  Furthermore, I didn't like the ambience / decor as much, which for me, is an important part of the overall dining experience.  Having said that, the price was VERY reasonable; having had our full share of dimsums, each of us ended up paying only 14pounds.  Therefore, a great place to go for a low-key and quick satiation of dimsum cravings, but I'd go for another place if in the company of anyone important or for a special occasion.",-1
4,"This is one of my favourite places for yum cha (or dim sum as Westerners would call it) in London's Chinatown. 
It's very popular with the local Chinese crowd and they serve decent Cantonese dishes. I would recommend Joy King Lau for lunch rather than dinner as their dim sum is the highlight. 
Everyone has their favourite dim sum or yum cha dish, but I always order the chicken feet, prawn & chive dumpling, sui mai, prawn/bbq pork cheong fun, beef balls, beef rice noodle (dry or beef hor fun), turnip cake and a plate of stir fried vegetables (gai lan, dou miu, or choy sum). 
You can also book in advance if there is a big group of you, but just make sure that everyone arrives on time. And you would never end up paying over 20/head, even if you over order! Also note that a 10% service charge is included in the bill, which is often quite ambiguous.",1
4,"I was a little disappointed that it wasn't quite the authentic Hong Kong dim sum experience, with gruff service staff threatening to run you over with their trolleys. This was rather more civilized. Food was fine. Steamed stuff - har kau, siu mai, cheong fun et al - were decent enough. Not a fan of the fried stuff but that's just me.",1
4,"Dim sum you want ???
Dim Sum you get !!!
I cannot remember the name of all the dumplings we got but really, everything was great, at a very cheap price !
Don't hesitate to ask for extra stuff like Soy sauce, as the staff are quite responsive, though not very friendly (alas, a habit among all Chinese restaurant staff....),",1
4,Great dimsum at decent price. Efficient service. It gets quite busy for sure... Will definitely go back next time I get a craving for dim sum.,1
2,"Holy wow, this was cheap. For 7 of us, it was £9 each.
Menu had a pretty good spread. No chrysanthemum tea. The service was fine. But the food was just so completely un-noteworthy. Maybe it used to be better, but it truly is the poor man's version of dim sum.
You're right around the corner from Chinatown here. Go somewhere else!",-1
1,"Went there yesterday craving for dim sum with my friend... well it was quite disappointing! I do not understand the good reviews here. We are back from a trip to Asia missing it, and I am from asian background, but being served defrosted poor quality dim sum when you crave and dream about yummy original ones is really frustrating!! 
We ordered classic things, such as Har gao, Xiaolongpao, cheung fun... really bad sorry. Nothing tasted like original homemade. The cheung fun was made of three poorly defrosted old prawns stuck into an insipid dough sheet. It was not even cut into pieces, did not even have the onion, and the prawns inside were disgusting. The har gao strongly felt like a poor quality ready made from the freezer with weird dodgy mushy shrimp, and the appaling xiaolongpao was made of a disgusting dough, if I don't mention the inside! Please bring Din tai fung here! Aside those, we also had vegetable dumplings, with veg inside tasting almost like they were not good to eat anymore...
I understand it can be difficult to manage offering such a huge choice of dim sum on the menu, so that not everything can be homemade and fresh, but I am shocked that none of the things we ordered seemed homemade. Especially coming to standard choices.
On top of that, staff is really cold and not welcoming like it can be the case in some asian restaurants, but still if only they were serving good food!",-1
4,"It was late and we were on the hunt for congee and noodles and decided to try this place. It is a decent restaurant, unlike noisy Hung's (opened all night).  
We ordered the beef congee and beef brisket noodles.  Food arrived promptly and piping hot. The beef was well cooked and still tender, a sign of good quality cooking as it is very easy to overcook beef in congee and noodles. 
Service was pleasant and friendly and although we were the only customers and it was closing time, we didn't feel rushed. 
I've docked one star on account of the MSG in the food, the effects of which were felt later.  But then all Chinese food served in restaurants have some MSG.",1
2,"To the people that gave 5*
Excuse me? You never had good Dim Sum before? If this is a good DimSum restaurant? Than you must have compared it to those all you can eat joints or the other devil's choice: DimSum Buffets... wwwhhhaaa!! Me? Never... Please just dont. Just dont.
My 13 yr old Stepson's review (yes, he is spoiled with good food): 
- veggies were good, everything else was bland and crap.
- staff was friendly but you cannot eat that.
- Lets never go back?  :(
My review:
- No cart: i like! I prefer my food fresh
- Meh. I've experienced better... i've had better.
- The vegetables, chinese brocoli was good, so was the paksoi,
- Most Dimsum were too fat and didnt have the interesting texture i like,
- Very friendly staff, 
- Boring, overcooked, 
- Stir fried noodles were good,
- The crunchy Squid was very chewy, very very chewy.
- 5 people, 90 pounds
- Never come back unless i'm back in university and have that hangover-food-feeling with friends.
- Would rather spend a bit more and go to Yauatcha 
- Lets never go back...
Just don't. 
Don't, when you have had really good Dim Sum, ever. 
Don't, when you like Dim Sum.",-1
4,"Wasn't sure whether to give this place 5 stars or not. After reading some of the other reviews some of the criticisms are justified so in recognition of that, perhaps 4 is more conservatively just - that said some of the criticisms are the very paragon of asinine ignorance (mainly those complaining about yum cha only being served until 4.30).
Ive been eating at this place for almost 20 years (since i was around 15). So it's fair to say it has a special place in my heart. That said i wouldnt have kept coming back if the food was sh*te. Not that it's always mind-blowing, but it is consistently tasty, well prepared and of an authentic high standard. Also due to it's location in chinatown the prices are competitive. Over the years i have brought hundreds of friends here, all of whom have been converted to adopting it as their regular yum cha place in central.
These days i mainly go here for yum cha (dim sum). I truly believe that along with Yi Ban (docklands) and Lotus (Canary Wharf) it is one of the best ""dim sum"" places in London - head and shoulders above the overpriced and often underwhelming and sometimes rubbish Royal China, or Phoenix Palace.
By way of exemplifying the caliber of this joint - a close friend of mine, whose old man who owns a couple of chinese restaurants in Chinatown, eats here with his family.",1
4,Great Peking duck. Good quality chinese dishes.,1
5,"Very good mixed vegetable chaomian, and generally a pretty nice atmosphere. I've been here quite a few times with friends and colleagues and generally get a quite speedy service. The tea is also very nice. Minimum credit card charge is £10.",1
3,"Finally came here for dim sum. It is one of those multi-floor monstrosities that Chinatowns are known for. Where the guy at the bottom (at primetime on a weekend) manages the queue via his cohorts upstairs on walkie talkies. From there, they send you to a floor and tell you a table number.
You get to your designated floor, and flag down a waitress running around who then barks at you (in a way oh so familar and even sort of cherished part of Chinese customer service at places like this) to just wait. Who cares about the table number, they never asked for ours. We waiting another several minutes at our floor level (always feeling in the way between the staircase and the women's loo), then when a table finally left, were seated. I think you have to be a little bit assertive (like, stand visibly in the hall), or they might forget about you. 
There aren't any rolling carts or pieces of paper to write your dim sum order on... you just order like at a standard restaurant. The menus appear in both Chinese characters and an English 'translation', i.e. 'roast pork bun' or 'shrimp lasagne' and you just have to sort of guess to figure out what you want if you know it by romanized Chinese (i.e. Char Siu Bao). 
That said, the Char Siu Bao were good, as were the 'mixed croquettes', and the 'egg custard tarts'. Once we ordered, the service was prompt and really, really solid. Tons of food for two ended up around £28.
Oh, also, we were pretty sure they added on a service charge without telling us. Sneaky. Easy to do since the bills are in Chinese.",-1
1,"The dim sum was disgusting, under cooked and chewey. The mains were boiled chicken with vegetables that came out of a can that were boiled in chicken broth. Nothing authentic about this place. Absolutely vile and not worth £1",-1
2,"After reading pretty good reviews for this place, my sister-in-law treated me to some dim sum for my birthday.
It was ok. I can't recall any stand out dishes. Just seemed boring and bland.
Staff were attentive, I will say that, but that's not enough for me to go back again. Sorry! =(",-1
3,"Hmmmm! I had pretty high hopes having read both Yee Gan O and Kevin L's reviews, but honestly it was just okay. Granted I didn't have the Dim Sum but still I expected the food to be better than it was. 
The rice wasn't seasoned.
The squid was greasy.
The crispy shredded beef had too much batter.
The aromatic duck on the other hand, was rather nice but it's not difficult to get it right. However saying that the scallions and cucumber were both dry. I can only imagine how long they had been sat on the side. Poor!",-1
2,"After reading the Time Out Eating Out Guide, we went to have dim sum  but left disappointed.  Har Kau had stodgy pastry - it should be light and thin.  Prawn Cheung Fun was flavourless and stodgy.  The staffing of  the BBQ Pork Steamed Bun was very small.  The only good dishes were Fried Squid Cakes and Steamed Glutenous Rice with meat.  We had much better dim sums at other restaurants such as Plum Valley and Royal China.  Don't trust Time Out.
Also they tried to charge extra Har Kau and tea which we never ordered or drank, so make sure to keep a tab and check your bill before paying.",-1
3,"What can I say?  Pretty good dim sums, though a bit bland.  The decor was not bad, and the wait staff were very cheerful.  They did have to repeat their recommendations a couple of times though.  
Will I go back?  Probably not.  I only went as this was tone of the very few places that served dim sum after 5 pm.",-1
4,"Choose from the Chinese menu, even if you cannot read Chinese. It contains dishes not on the standard menu. Be adventurous!!!",1
4,"Damn. Good. Dim sum.
When i fancy a bit of deep fried squid, pork buns, prawn & chive dumplings, egg fried rice, Vietnamese spring rolls and mango pudding...
This is at the top of my list.",1
5,"Needed a place to take the parents to try Dim Sum and we were pinched for time. Thank you, Yelpers, you delivered us to Joy King Lau!
Called an hour ahead and made a reservation for 12:15pm for 5 people. No problem! Almost everyone in the restaurant was Chinese, so it was like stepping out of London right as you walk in the door.
Food came slowly at first then all arrived at once. Delicious! Service was efficient and friendly. I'll definitely be back for more!",1
4,"Need Dim Sum! Had a craving whilst in town & was hooking up with a mate for lunch in Soho. I heard good things on Yelp so off we went to JKL, it wasn't too busy so we were seated straight away. This place reminds me of an old school dim sum place, it's not trying to be anything else, it's where family's get together for their weekly Yum Cha.
The menus is quite extensive featuring all the favourite steamed, fried & cheung fun dishes, they also have the obligatory noodle & congee dishes...nice.
We ordered, siu mai(prawn & pork dumplings), chiu jow gau, char siu bow(steamed pork bun), pork cheung fun, fung jow(chic' feet in chilli), Vietnamese spring rolls, taro puffs, steamed ribs, steamed beef balls & cheung fun with dough stick.
Not going to go through each dish, but all were tasty! 
My only complaint is the waitress never asked what type of tea we wanted.
All in all, a decent old fashion type of dim sum place, no messing around, no fanciness here & great value, we spent less than £30 for two big lads & we couldn't finish it all!",1
4,Service could use improvement but the food is excellent! I got the Malaysian noodles and they were delicious along with scallop dumplings.,1
4,"Classic Cantonese dim sum restaurant in Chinatown. We went on Saturday AM and they were pretty full. We were seated on 2nd floor. They don't have dim sum carts but you can order a good selection of dim sum dishes from the menu. The food was good but not great. The congee was bland and sticky rice (glutinous rice) was too salty. Better than average but not at the same level as the best dim sum places in NYC, SF, or Hong Kong.",1
3,"OMG the  most expensive chinese food I have ever eaten. And I eat a lot of chinese food. This stuff is so expensive for very random things. I mean what I ordered wasn't even the ""expensive"" stuff. 
I don't know about the rest of you but when I look on yelp and i see a chinese restaurant for more than one dollar sign i stop looking at it. A sad but true thing about chinese places. 
However I have to admit that this place does have some pretty good food. I don't know if it was because we were so hungry or if it was really just that good. 
The waitresses were really nice and they really work for their tip. We ordered one chicken dish and one duck dish so there were a lot of bones everywhere. So we places all the bones on the plate of course. When the plate was only like 1/4 filled with bones the ladies came over to switch to new plates for us to it doesn't get too messy!!! nice! I like a place that's all about cleanliness.",-1
4,"Ode to Joy (King Lau)!  
Yum yum, every time I've been, the food has been delicious and a great value. I can't really compare this to other dim sum places in London, for some reason this is the only place I've been too but from what others have told me it's really authentic ""chinese"" dim sum (I don't know that either since I've never been to China).
I can't really be helpful to tell you what to order either as I don't know the names of most of the food I ate but the shrimp dumplings were divine and they have this kind of noodle ""lasagne"" that is out of this world.  We had the shrimp one and one with some fried bread in the middle and really really I could have eaten 3 of those it was so tasty.  So I can't be really helpful to you here except that you can take my word that it's delicious and you need to try it yourself!!! ;)
Only down side I can think of is this place on the weekend gets really crowded and not only is it a hard time for the host to get people to form a line outside (their entrance are is very small), you constantly need to remind him where you are in the line because people are constantly ignoring the line and just walking in trying to get a table (clearly I'd say there's a reason people are waiting in line but that's just my logic).  He was not very organized, no way to take names, etc. so it's NOT for those who don't like a bit of chaos in their weekend routine!",1
4,"Wow! This place lives up to its reputation. We ordered a selection of 7 dishes, and each one was just perfect. The chee cheong fun (with pork) came sitting in a puddle of sauce that I was worried would overwhelm the flavor of the pork. Nope! Instead, the sauce added a nice counterbalance to the blandness of the noodles, while the pork flavor still came through. 
The prawn and pork dumplings and seafood dumplings were also nice, as were the minced pork and mushroom dumplings. The last of these looked really pretty repulsive sitting in the basket, with the mushroom sitting like a lump on top of a ball of pork, but the flavor more than compensated for the crazy appearance.
My favorites, though, were the char siu bao and the veggie dumplings. The roasted pork flavor was not too overwhelmingly sweet (as can often happen), and there was the perfect amount of pork in the bun. The veggie dumplings were so subtle and so nice - I'm not even sure what every vegetable was in there because we wolfed them down so quickly. 
The service bordered on surly, but wasn't bad - the dishes came quickly, the tea pot was always full, and the check arrived right when we wanted it - so I can handle a little surly in exchange for this kind of dim sum!",1
4,"Surprisingly authentic and good value for money.
We ordered a wide range of the usual suspects for dim sum including pork dumplings, siu mai, steamed rice with meat, spring rolls and all came up trumps.
Service was attentive and between 6 of us it only came to 65 quid.
C",1
4,"Decent Dim Sum and service. No cart service, order from menu. I will be back next trip.",1
3,"Let me tell you, I like their lo mien.  Not the greatest Chinese restaurant ever but I enjoyed my meals here.",-1
4,"I've been going here for over a quarter of a century, and it's still the best dim sum in Soho, IMHO. There are no trolleys, the food is all freshly cooked to order. We love the prawn chung fun, yam croquettes and lotus wrapped glutinous rice. Dim sum is a great value cuisine. Our meal for two today was about £18 with Chinese beer and service. If you haven't tried dim sum, or are looking for the best, this is the place to go.",1
4,Good dim sum place in the London Chinatown area. I should know - I grew up on dim sum. Cantonese (and English) is spoken here.,1
2,"We went there tonight really wanting some dumplings, but dim sum is only sold till 5PM. We had to wait a long time for our order to get taken. 
Roast Duck
It came being almost cold. I asked the waiter kindly to heat it up, but it came back just as cold. It was very fatty and only little amounts of the meat were actually eatable. Tasted a bit old. 
Sweet Sour Tofu
Was very bland, nothing special.",-1
2,"I was at my friends house and decided to get a takeaway, so I checked on here and saw all the great reviews so decided to get a takeaway.  I got beancurd in blackbean sauce.  It was so average! I wanted to join in with all the good reviews :( 
I am so sad, I was looking forward to a good chinese, but I have tasted much much better. 
Maybe next time I will have to try the dim-sum and hopefully I can update my review =D",-1
4,"This is where I take my out of town friends when I want to show them nice, reliable, well presented Anglo-Canto cuisine. It's off the main drag of Gerrard Street and so must rely on quality to draw repeat custom rather than tourist drop-ins.
As Tom E has mentioned, you can be passed between floors - they're lacking the customer manager with walkie talkie that some other multi-floor establishments have!
As you're in a generic albeit high-quality Anglo-Canto establishment, you might as well give your friends the standard British experience of crispy aromatic duck, crispy chilli beef, beef in black bean sauce and chicken with cashew nuts with egg fried rice! If you fancy venturing a little more off the beaten track, the crispy oysters are lovely as are the lamb dishes.
I hear good things about their lunchtime dim sum but yet  to sample it for myself.",1
4,"If you come at a busy time on a weekend night it can feel like one of Asterix's Twelve Tasks to get a table here. Not because it's difficult to get a table but because it's such a mind-boggling system.
Do you have any tables?
Ground Floor: ""Hmm, try upstairs""
First Floor: ""Go upstairs""
Second Floor: ""There are some downstairs""
First floor: ""Try upstairs again""
Ground Floor: ""Sure!""
But it's worth the hilarity of going up and down the stairs to your own mind's Benny Hill music - because the food here is really top class for Chinatown and you can have a great time here with a big group on one of the large round tables. I'm a big fan of the starter here that comes with lettuce leaves for you to wrap the food in, but more than anything it's the MaPo Tofu here that makes me come back. It's simply the best in London. Flawless on every floor.",1
5,"Authentic, tasty, and cheap; what more can you ask for?
I came into Joy King Lau with my Dad one afternoon for lunch based on its solid rating on Yelp (thanks guys!) and needless to say it lived up to its stellar reviews.
We ordered explicitly dim sum because that's what we came for, the selection was exhaustive just on the menu alone but beyond that my dad ordered a few things that were not on the menu and not only was it not a problem they knew exactly what he was looking to have.
The week prior my dad had been in Hong Kong on business eating dim sum and he said this place was nearly identical in both quality and selection. If that doesn't say authentic I don't know what does.
To top it off the bill came to 11 quid a head including a beer each, talk about icing on the cake, I only wish I lived in London so I could come here more often!",1
3,"Atmosphere was ok, nothing appealed to me about it. Service was fast, but not very friendly, and not very good at recommending what to eat. The chicken with nuts (whatever it's formal name) that my brother ordered was good, but I do not recommend the seafood lettuce wraps- tasted a bit like mush, and seafood mush is not a good thing. Way too expensive for what they offer.",-1
5,"When it comes to Cantonese cuisine this truly is ""As Good As It Gets. 
Cleverly tucked away from Gerrard Street (China Town) and just entering Leicester Square, Joy King Lau boasts the some of the best food you'll find in London if it's Chinese your looking for. The place has a very interesting appearance on the inside, merging both Traditional Chinese ornaments and general setting with very modern yet simple furniture, giving it a very laid back feel about it. 
The service is terrific the waiters are all highly experienced, I know, because for the past twenty years I've seen the same waiters in different restaurants all over the West End. The food is Amazing, however it does help if you get to know the staff or you do know a little about Chinese food because they are not scared to make things that are not actually written in the menu. 
I was once told that this is the restaurant that the majority of the London Chinese community go to when dining , and many of the other restaurants in the City especially China town are filled with tourists or those who don't really know the cuisine too well. 
The food comes in reasonable time and the portions are generous, Joy King Lau is a perfect spot for group dining, with tables that can fit two families on. On many occasion have I been a part of a banquet here, where the entire floor is booked for our Tai Chi group, the waiters seem to double in their attentiveness.
Finally something many people ask... the price range! Now despite being a fan of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant (two things which are most important to me in any resaurant) and the friendly staff. I also like the fact that two families of five can eat there for slightly over a hundred pounds, which comes to just over ten pounds per head which is not bad for a restaurant dubbed ""The place of choice for the London Chinese"" 
  
  All in all I give it top marks Joy King Lau ? certainly As Good As It Gets",1
4,"5 stars on food,  0 stars on layout,  but I came to eat, not understand things.  The tables and restrooms are split between 3 or 4 floors, weird decorating, weird stair system but... The dum sum is killer, I can't even tell you what I was eating , just bring more of it.",1
4,"Pretty decent dim sum for a reasonable price. The wait wasn't too long, and everything was very efficient. We ordered some dim sum staples and they were all pretty good. The congee was nice and flavorful! Also, service is attentive and pretty fast.",1
4,"Joy King Lau is a very popular Dim Sum restaurant.
It is always packed with people on Sundays. A large variety of dim sum and dessert choice in addition to the ala carte and set dinner menus.
It is worth waiting even for over an hour on the Father's Day last month.One thing I dislike is that it is lack of customer attention but you have to pay a compulsory 10% service charge while many other restaurants in the China Town London the service charge is optional.",1
3,"Authentic chinese food in the heart of Chinatown. Very reassuring when we entered and there were more tables occupied by customers speaking Cantonese with the servers and ordering from Chinese language menus. Service was not what you could consider friendly, in fact they asked us within a few seconds of being seated what we wanted and when we asked for another minute seemed irritated. When the third server approached to ask if we wanted to order I just pointed to what the table next to us had and asked for that. We also ordered a chicken in a spicy chili sauce, steamed dumplings, and veggie soft noodles. I would get all but the noodles again. In fact, the best item we had was the pork dish that I had seen at the table next to us. I would recommend giving it a try but go in knowing that you may need to ignore the brusque almost rude nature of the servers.",-1
3,"This is one of the typical chinese restaurants in china town. It's been around for many years, since I was a little kid as we used to come here almost every weekend with the family for Dim Sum.
 Dim Sum and dinner are not bad here, you get most of the dishes that you get in other chinese restaurants.
 It's a pretty big restaurant too as it's over 3/4 floors and they cater for big groups of people.
 You will find all sorts of people coming to this place from families, to large group of friends to tourist groups.
 There are lifts in the restaurant too so no need to walk all the way up to the top floor if you don't fancy it.
 Overall, one of the better restaurants to go to in china town as its been there for years...",-1
5,"A bit pricy but best sushi and 'sticks' you will ever have! Also friendly staff and nice atmosphere. 
You should definitely give it a try if you like sushi.",1
1,"some of the items were special and the waiter was very kind during the meal. They use a lot of cooked items in the offerings and bad scallops by the way. I guess people like pretending they are eating raw fish. Then if you are from another country they add gratuity instead of letting you decide, I am sure this works on a lot of people who don't ask . Then when you question it they say no it's an option but they already added to the check they present. We would have tipped tonight because the server was very helpful, but in the end we did not and left feeling hustled what a shame",-1
5,"Was in London for 2 weeks back in July and went to this place 3 times. Just loved everything about this place. Me and my girlfriend are vegan and there was tons of options. The drinks were great as well. Make sure to make a reservation though, it will be worth it.",1
5,"Sushi lovers... look no further !
Creative, tasty, good service, a bit pricy though... but one of my favorite when traveling to London !",1
1,Decoration nice. Fish not so good. Sushi too salty. We took the menu for 2. Around 40 pounds. Generous plat however not so good quality of fish.,-1
3,"Had lunch here- walked in an asked for a table. Got seated outside.. while there were open tables indoors- (80% empty) - was told they have big groups reserved for the day. Not a big deal- but was surprise that two guys could not get squeezed in, it blessing in disguise- the one out door table was not bad. (for the record when we left - restaurant was still half empty. We also got the rookie server) 
The food was okay- it didn't do justice to their pictorial menu. (If you're going to glamor shot your menu and present it to guest- I suggest you make sure the kitchen executes) - that menu is one if the best I have seen- so might be a little unfair to kitchen to set that expectation. 
We ordered the Gala menu and a chirashi bowl- I enjoyed the bowls. Sushi was so-so and ""sticks"" were only okay. I
Overall - it's a good spot for showy first dates and client dinners. But the service we received felt perfunctory and I think we got dismissed as riff raff by the staff.",-1
4,"Decided to go here for a quick dinner on a Saturday evening. Didn't realize the wait would be so long (about 45 min), will definitely make reservations next time. 
This was my first visit to sticks n sushi & they do have an extensive menu! Took sometime to decide our order
About the food:
Ebi bites- was ok. Didn't have much of a flavor of anything
Mamma Mia & Ebi Panko maki - loved the rolls. Can't wait to go back and try more of the maki
Will definitely be visiting again to try the sashimi, sticks & the bowls",1
3,"A colleague of mine I was visiting in London took us here for dinner. I am a visitor from San Francisco. 
I am no expert on sushi, but I thought it was good. However, my sushi had a little too much rice than what I am used to. Presentation wise, the sushi and bowls were just like the pictures on the menu which was great. In all honesty, I wish I got a bowl myself you'll definitely get your money's worth. Customer service was great and we were seated right away on a Friday evening.
London itself is expensive! I'm a tourist with a budget so I just wish it was a bit less pricey.",-1
5,"This place got tons of awesome reviews, so we decided to check it out. First off, from our experience and what we were told, the Covent Garden location is packed, all the time. We came during the week and it was mayhem. So just know this before planning - we snuck some bar seats after a while.
On to the food - the menu is huge! We grabbed a variety of stuff.
Grilled avocado - delicious starter
Seaweed salad - overpriced, I'd skip it.
Spicy edamame - awesome, done perfectly
Spicy miso soup - with salmon and shiitake! Wow!
We then ordered the ""perfect day"" menu combo for two, and it was amazing! Also, they put all sauces on the side since I hate mayonnaise. Here are the highlights -
Crab croquettes were crazy good. Super crispy and not too gooey.
Spicy tuna maki - perfect amount of spicy, and not too much rice.
Seared salmon tataki was good, not that memorable
All nigiri was fresh and delicious (tuna especially)
The yakitori was good, not amazing. The chicken meatballs were by far the best.
An awesome spot! Very good service and lots to choose from.",1
5,This is my favorite sushi place in London. There are a variety of choices and they all taste legit! Our favorite is the black cod stick.,1
4,"Great sushi with some delicious variations on your typical sushi dishes.  Sampled a few of their 'sticks'.  Great flavors and unusual dishes for a sushi restaurant.  The asparagus with bacon was fantastic.  Veal.....meh.  Had to send first one back due to the grizzly texture that made it inedible.  Server quickly replaced it, but was duly unimpressed even with the more tender version.  Amazing place over all and worth a visit.",1
4,"Yum. Did not disappoint. Love the tuna tartar, salmon carpaccio, and the skewers and vegetables. The broccoli was so delicious!!!",1
4,"Try the Green Grass Salad!!!  It's incredible and the name doesn't do it justice. We started with that, had great sushi, and then finished with another Green Grass Salad because we loved it so much. We sat in the basement and found it rather warm.",1
4,"I was strolling around Covent Garden with my best buddy and a sleeping baby and we realized this was the perfect window to grab lunch somewhere a little nicer. I was pubbed out, and sushi sounded perfect.
Sticks'n'Sushi is a seriously swanky lunch place.  In Toronto, where I hail from, there is a spectrum of types of sushi restaurants. In lovely Londontown, but it appears there are only cheap sushi places or fancy shmancy ones.
Due to the shmance, I was a bit sheepish about bringing a baby, but after cuddling up in a corner with some sake I was soon over it. She woke up, she watched an ipad and ate lots of rice and soya. No one seemed to care. Everything was fresh, beautifully presented, and yes, very pricy.",1
5,Delicious food  and the service was excellent. Also Price  was reasonable. The ambience and the servers were attentive as the environment was very clean.,1
3,"The sushi restaurant was quickly booked via the website. We could easily take our table. The atmosphere is relaxed. Maybe a little dark to study the menu. The waitress is very nice. The selection large. All in all, the sushi tasted great. However, I could enjoy much better sushi's. Overall, however, a good impression.",-1
5,Group of 16. We split the 9 kids in a separate table across the restaurant. 5 stars for that alone! Menu is huge! Saki is fantastic. They have creative sushi choices they were yummy. What they don't have is Unagi (eel). Apparently endangered and not allowed in London. That is not the case in Paris or the States. Seemed odd but whatever. Didn't take away from the ambiance and the great food. The adults sat in the very front by the door and had no issues with being cold or traffic. Even our people with dairy and gluten allergies found food they loved.,1
3,"The day we had a reservation here we got an email that their grill broke and they couldn't make the sticks. We decided to come anyway. It turns out they use their grill to make a lot of other things besides the sticks and the menu was basically cut in half.  That really put a damper on things. We just ordered a few rolls and an appetizer and some drinks. The cauliflower was good, the rolls were good, the drinks were good. Nothing great or memorable. Oh well!",-1
5,"Love it!  yummy food, reasonably priced.
Nothing fancy but good value for the money. You can order from the menu, or just pick up food from the conveyor belt. I would come here again. Also, I would advise to call ahead of time and check if they are open.",1
5,"If you're looking for great Japanese cuisine near Covent Garden, Sticks'n'Sushi is the place for you.
We were 7 guests and we were welcomed by a very friendly waiter who tried to speak French to us, which was as cute as funny. We were given oshiboris to freshen up our hands moments after we arrived.  
The menu features detailed pictures of every dish, so it is very easily understandable, even for non-English speakers. 
The yakitoris were perfectly cooked, the sushis, nigiris and makis were succulent and the fish dishes were so fresh that we even found a scale chip on a slice of salmon. 
I definitely recommend this place to anyone willing to have an unforgettable Japanese experience in the heart of London.",1
4,"I can echo Alex's review. However what I loved about this sushi menu is that you can be strategic. I went on my own for a little treat before the theatre. I was able to order two rolls and an app and not break the bank. 
The daikon roll is cheap and flavorful. I loved the fried shrimp starter too.
The staff was really friendly with explaining their menu, which is more like a photo album. 
Will go back to try more things!",1
5,"This was my first visit to Sticks'n'Sushi and it certainly won't be my last. Upon arriving at Sticks n Sushi, the first impression is of a modern environment. All of the streamlined furniture amidst the rustic backdrop of brick walls and wooden floors give the entire restaurant a homey feeling. Not only that, but I was greeted by a friendly staff that was happy to show me to my seat and advise menu items based on my preferences. They were always prompt with their service and everyone was very personable.
When I first looked at the menu, I saw several options that I wanted to try. With the staff's recommendation, I started off with ebi bites. The ebi bites were brilliantly mouth watering. Featuring shrimp with several spices to bring out their flavor, the ebi bites were a an excellent start an excellent meal. My friends and I chose the Four Meal Drive Big (6 types of nigiri and 6 of maki)  to share, we began with the nigiri selection. I sampled each of the 6 nigiri - the salmon and seared seabass being my favourites. Among the maki selection preferred the spicy tuna and salmon ceviche. On to the dessert we couldn't help but choose the taster, which consisted of 12 different kinds of sweet delights! The mochi ice cream, yuzu sorbet and creme brulee were definitely the standouts for me. 
The entire night was full of great service, excellent food and certainly left a wonderful impression. A must-visit for anyone in the area who loves sushi.",1
4,"Great, fresh, flavorful food. The cooked meats were suuuuper good too! Awesome ambience, good crowd of tourists and locals.",1
2,"This restaurant is ok and mediocre at best. They brought out the ""bites"" (starters) with the main meal. I ordered the mackerel but ended up with salmon. It had no flavor and was challenging to break apart. The average and the rib eye with herb butter was well seasoned but very small. The spicy miso soup was not spicy yet had good flavor. Overall overpriced and not worth it.",-1
5,Really amazing food experience here. Get some of their set menu pieces because everything they bring out is delightful. Staff is somewhat aloof but when they actually attend to you - they're pretty helpful.,1
2,"The hype brought me in, It was Packed!, we almost didn't get a table (make a reservation ahead) I love that they offer a unique sushi/menu selection, What we tried was good overall. The lack of stars is for our server, She was extremely rude and condescending, I wish I remembered her name, she was super short and had a dark tan with black/maybe black and ombré hair. She totally ignored my guest like they weren't even there and had a super snippy/sheisty tone the whole night ( bad attitude overall and skipping on refilling my guest while making sure my drink was filled the whole time, She almost entirely ruined our experience here.",-1
3,"Friendly staff. The place felt very hip and trendy. However the food is only mediocre. I ordered 5 sticks (pork belly, wagyu beef, oyster mushroom, blackened cod, and scallops wrapped in bacon). In general, my sticks were not even hot, just luck warm. The cod was a bit disappointing - I definitely had it better at other Japanese restaurants. The pork belly and the oyster mushroom were good. The scallops and the wagyu beef were ok, but nothing special. I would recommend the place for its ""trendiness"" and it's location, but not for its food.",-1
5,"Wow! Best sushi I ever had and for a reasonable London price! 
This place was recommended by a local to me and I am so happy to have been here. I tried many different veggie makis and inside-outs as well as the cauliflower in truffle. Wow! 
Friendliest service, food came quick. Busy place suiting everybody. Will be back for sure! 
Paid ~100£ in total for 3 people including drinks.",1
5,"I have been to three Sticks N Sushi locations, including Wimbledon, Cambridge and this one. And all three have the same consistency, albeit different ambience. 
All sushi at Sticks n Sushi is amazing. However, there are other items that really stand out. For instance, their Ebi Bites are incredible (Shrimp tempura with chilli and coriander). The Hotate Kataifi (scallops) melt in your mouth delicious. The Black Cod and Wagyu Yaki are divine. 
If you like to drink, they have an amazingly fragrant sake a la prosecco which I quite like, but just a fair warning, it goes down very easy, much like everything else at this restaurant. 
Happy sushing!",1
4,"We wanted good sushi while in London for Christmas holiday and read about this popular spot.  I was little skeptical being multi-location.  There was a good vibe here.  As far the food, we ordered a wide assortment of sushi, sashimi and sticks (skewers).   I enjoyed the sashimi platter, sister of sushi, with tasting fish but the pieces were a bit small.   My family liked the Hell's Kitchen and NYC roll both variation of the shrimp tempura roll.  We tried different sticks and liked the wagyu and chicken meatballs best.  The menu is a bit overwhelming and waitress did not offer much help.  Overall, the food was solid but not outstanding.",1
4,Sticks n sushi is one of the best sushi I had. We ordered the tuna tartar and miso soup and edamame for starters. And a big plate of sushi maki and cucumber skin roll and sashimi. It was very good!! Great service. Our waiter was very nice. A little bit pricey but the place food and service worth it!!,1
5,"Yummy food and so much space for seating. The food comes out so quick, literally 5 mins after we ordered. And the menu is so extensive and has pictures of everything. Ended up ordering a few smaller plates then adding more. All fresh ingredients, great sushi and other side dishes.",1
5,"Delicious modern Japanese restaurant!
Great sashimi  platters with a fresh and modern twist
Delicious sushi  selections with impressively creative options including duck, caviar and waggyu beef ! 
The setting is beautiful and the ambience really chill and relaxed, cool music  
Totally recommend",1
5,"Happened into this place, and they happened to have space at the bar. One of the best menus I've ever seen. Both salads we had were amazing. Tried two of the edamames and several of the sticks. Will have to come back for sushi!",1
4,"Danish sushi chain, why not?  The food is decidedly Japanese but with a strong dose of Western bravado. If you're looking for the normal subtleties of Japanese cuisine, you're barking up the wrong Scandinavian tree. But don't let that deter you. Sushi N Sticks is loud on cool wood design and big flavours. 
A copious meal for two with drinks came to £99. The menu is a beautifully photographed but slightly ridiculous (and overwhelming long) menu of sushi, yakitori and other bits and bobs of Japanese food items. There is a shorter book of preset menus to help those who can't muster the energy to work through the main menu. 
We had:
Grilled and green salad:  there must be something ridiculous like 20 ingredients in the salad. It's pretty to look at and topped with a bold salad dressing. I enjoyed this but my eating partner found it too strong. 
Spare ribs:  delicious! Fall off the bone meat coated in a super tasty sauce
An assortment of sushi rolls:    
- crab coal sushi roll was with black coal rice which was a cool contrast to the normal white. I didn't really like this as much as my friend. I thought there were too many things trying to happen at the same time.
- Hells Kitchen Roll:  I was slightly apprehensive about the BBQ sauce but I liked this roll. Pretty to look at, tasty to eat
- crispy ebi roll:  this was my favourite. I thought the shrimp and the crunch came through really well to contrast with the rice
We also had two smaller rolls which were good but not necessarily outstanding (ebi and chilli and salmon and scallion). 
Our waiter was awesome. He was a bearded Asian guy with a fab smile and friendly demeanour. Why can't all service in London be like this?",1
4,"I think the concept of this place is genius; it's a true crowd pleaser and a fun dining experience. I went here on a Sunday night and the place was bumping - which I liked. Service was great and the food was good. We got a sampling of pretty much everything and I liked it all except the fried bacon wrapped cheese - this was just a bit.... gross to me. But thankfully there were many more ""fresher"" options for me to choose from. Although the sushi was not the best I have ever had, it was good and the roll combos are creative and fun. A good place for a fun night out and a great place for groups as there is truly something of everyone.",1
5,"Probably the best sushi I have ever had! It was great to eat here after having sushi from Yo! Sushi the previous week. The inside of the restaurant is modern and comfortable. Servers are friendly and very helpful. 
My fiend and I ordered a large plate that we shared. A little pricy but very worth it. The shared plate of a variety of sushi was plenty for both of us. Served on a layer of ice, you could smell the freshness. 
The sushi tasted extremely fresh and we could tell that it was just made, maybe even just caught from the water! The fish was extremely fresh and did not taste too fishy or old. I'm not a big raw fish eater, but this restaurant was a great place for lunch. If you want some great sushi, go here.",1
4,"This place was delicious! It's pricey so I don't know if I'd be able to come here again unless it was a special occasion, but I was visiting London for a few days and I decided that I wanted to try some good Japanese food. First about the ambience: it's a very modern, sleek, and clean design. I think that if you're a fan of minimalistic design and you like the dim lights, it's perfect for you (I tend to like that kind of design as well). Oh, also, they have beautiful pictures displaying their menu items so it really gets you excited for the food.
My friend and I wound up getting three dishes: the rice paper (it's a unique roll with duck), the salmon sashimi, and a dish called man food. My friend got the rice paper and couldn't stop raving about it. It didn't fill her up, but she had already eaten and said that the flavors were delicious. The salmon sashimi was actually my first time eating sashimi and it was pretty good, though I have no reference points so I can't say much about this. My main dish was the man food dish which provided me with a ton of different meat on sticks (duck, beef, chicken) as well as some ribs. All of this meat was fantastic and even though it cost quite a bit, it was delicious and filled my craving for meat. It also came with edamame and rice which was a nice touch (I love edamame). Overall, this place was wonderful and it gets a solid 4 stars and would be 5 if their prices weren't so freaking high.",1
3,"I had high expectations from this place as I saw some great photos from here so I knew I needed to come try it out! I went for 3 sushi rolls (16 pieces!), including Rainbow Roll, Crispy Ebi Roll and just a normal salmon and cucumber roll. Also had some cooked duck breast with Apple sauce. Of course I had some sticks too, pork belly and sweet potato. 
The food was tasty, but not that authentic Japanese food (nothing compared to the food I ate in Japan). The restaurant was very busy and very loud! The waiter I had was lovely! 
I probably won't be going back unless my dining partners want to... However I would recommend everyone to go visit this restaurant at least once! 
Overall, I give this restaurant a 7/10. Paid £75 for 2 people. 
More reviews on my instagram: mattzard",-1
5,"Definitely a must try for London sushi. Went to Nobu the next night and honestly thought this was better. The vibes were great with fun decor and architecture. 
I liked how it was more Asian fusion than just sushi but don't worry, the sushi was still top notch. Will definitely be back.",1
4,"Ever since my friend told me about this amazing sushi place I had to pay a visit! I finally managed to get some time and off I ventured out for lunch. 
Been scoping the menu online so I knew what to expect when I got there and could just order my food. The interior is beautiful, high ceilings, they have two entrances making life a lot easier, beaming with light, nice black tables with comfy seating, and eyes staring at you from the walls. The menu once presented immaculate, the waiters and waitresses are a joy, they give you the best advice and what to choose. The food is presented really well too. 
Nothing is amissed. The spicy edamame is the best I have had!! It's so modish, juicy packed with an abundance of flavour. For drink I opted for the rhubarb fizz as it was only 12 noon when I had arrives. 
For sushi I think I played it a bit safe, I didn't want to overeat and have food left, I don't like leftovers. So I opted for the hand rolls, veggie and crunchy. I'm not usually a fan because of the seaweed but wow these ones are beautiful, the seaweed is not even noticed, packed with loads of flavour and sauce inside till the end. Matched with the Wasabi, soya and pickled ginger I could eat that all day. Only little hitch is that it does make your mouth dry, the seaweed I mean once it gets caught on your lips. But that is so minor!!
Then I opted for sticks, a variety of mixed yasai yakitori, chicken wing, tsukune and grilled oyster mushroom. I loved them all apart from the wing, even though the skin was nice and crispy, the whole thing lacked flavour. It was just a wing, nothing special which was a let down. However the tsukune (chicken meatball) was delicious, cooked to perfection and could taste all the spices and less of the chicken which is what you want. The vegetables accompanied the meat very well and the sauces of yakitori and teriyaki was perfect and the extra lemon slice goes a long way. 
Service was very attentive, always making sure I was ok and the food was up to scratch. I wish I had stayed for dessert but will definitely go back again and be more adventurous and perhaps take a date so can share a lot of dishes. 
Price is not too bad either, it's a beautiful place. Highly recommend it. 
Make sure you book in advance though, I was lucky to get a table during lunchtime, they were pretty packed! Even for a Thursday!!",1
5,"Great sushi!! They also have meat skewers of all kinds. Really good/ quick service. In a fun area of London, right next to Trafalgar Square. Try to make reservations ahead of time! We had to sit at bar but still worth it",1
5,"Sticks and Sushi was highly recommended to me by my friend I was staying with in London this weekend. I live in San Diego CA and my friends from home told me I should check out Sushi Samba but he said that was very touristy, hard to get a reservation and the food at S&S was much better.  Now I eat a lot of sushi and sashimi and I am beyond impressed with the food I had at S&S.
First of all we had a very nice server by the name of Sebastian who was from Denmark, my friend let him know it was my Birthday and he wished me a happy birthday.  He walked us through both menus, took our drink orders and gave us some time to look through the menu.  I could have ordered everything, it all sounded delicious and their menus are mini booklets with a photograph of each option next to the bite and description.  I've never seen a menu like that before, it's a great idea as it makes everything look and sound more appetizing.  We picked out several things we wanted and out of that Sebastian gave us his recommendations and I'm glad we listened.
We started with edamame, you can never go wrong with that, we had the plain but they offer a spicy option.  Next we had the tuna tartare which was my favorite bite out of everything we had on this day, it had pine nuts, avocado, was full of flavor and truly was to die for.  Next we went for rolls, I chose the salmon rice paper roll which was a very neat concept and something I've never had before.  It was more of a wrap, it had lettuce, carrots, cucumber and shrimp tempura (light on the batter side) all wrapped up in rice paper and then sliced into 6 pieces.  I personally avoid to many rolls with rice so this was a perfect option for me.  We also had the gipsy big roll which was very good then we had one of the small tuna chilli rolls.
I wanted more and if I come back I really would like to try their mini sides of vegtables.  From looking at the pictures the oyster mushrooms looked good along with the cauliflower, broccoli and mini corn on the cobs.
We didn't have cocktails as we had a busy day ahead but they have a variety of cocktails, beers and non-alcoholic beverages. 
I highly recommend Sticks and sushi for their service, atmosphere, food and my favorite part...looking through their cool menu booklet with the pictures!",1
5,"For me it's one of the best sushi chains in London and it didn't even open up its first restaurant in London but Denmark. 
Even during the busy Christmas season for our annual Christmas lunch, high quality of food and service delivers. 
We started with some soy cured salmon with minced shiitake mushrooms. The salmon was beautiful and rich in flavour. The texture was smooth and the minced mushroom was a lovely companion adding more depth and silkiness. An excellent start. 
Next was the Japanese potato salad, a lovely simple potato mash contrasted nicely with the crunchy vegetables of carrots, cucumber and onions. Tasty light and healthy.
The salmon and avocado maki were perfect. The rice cooked well and held perfectly when you held it. The flavour of the silky rich salmon shone straight through the roll. Quality right there.
The only dish that didn't tickle my tastebuds was the green salad. It was too dry for my liking, too crunchy with the softer quinoa being lost in there. More softer leaves would have been preferred for a more equal texture so the avocado could be enjoyed and played its role.
Amongst us all we also ordered a  sharing platter from the set menu. We chose the Upgrade platter that came with a variety of rolls and meat on sticks. Beautiful glistening sushi, all so incredibly fresh and the rolls were paired so well with the ingredients it came with too, all perfectly balanced in texture and flavour. So much creativity. 
The sticks consisted of fresh tender flakey pieces of tuna, flavoursome, herby chicken meatballs and succulent juicy lamb chops. All delightful.
Last to arrive in the savouries were the scallops in a light kataifi pastry. The texture was amazing. A light crispy pastry incasing a fresh and bouncy scallop with burst of saltiness from the trout roe for that little extra bit of joy!
Dessert could have been the steal of the show itself. All presented beautifully and made with such creative flavours, fusing Japanese and Western flavours together. We had the coconut cake, creme brûlée, dark chocolate fondant, dark chocolate and sesame balls and vanilla icecream. All delicious and was the perfect ending to dinner.
I cannot recommend Sticks n Sushi enough. The atmosphere is fantastic, romantic and sleek as well as being child friendly. Bar seating downstairs for those who want to watch the chefs at work or large group tables for families and celebration. They have everyone covered. Of course the food is fantastic, of the highest quality and staff are trained to be knowledgable and as friendly as could be.",1
5,"I'm very picky when it comes to sushi, and I'm always careful when traveling. I came across this place while being in the neighbourhood and the good reviews lead me to give it a try. I'm glad I did! Everything was SO fresh and so good! The restaurant is beautiful, their menu is endless and literally everything is worth the price!",1
4,"A great dining experience. We were first seated at the bar directly in front of the grill which was hot as hell but once we were moved a couple seats down things became more comfortable. The waitstaff was helpful and the menu itself somehow achieved that rare balance between being visually appealing and informative. It's anomalous to say the least. 
The wait for the sashimi combo was more than 45 minutes but since I was able to drown my sorrows in champagne it didn't matter too much. The only reason I had to knock a star off was that we were told it would be right out something like 15 minutes in, but ended up still having a lengthy wait. Aside from that minor incident, presentation, freshness, and level of service were all exemplary. From apps to drinks to sushi to sashimi to dessert and whatever else came our way, I was impressed. I wish we had tried the sticks.",1
3,"I needed 24 hours to think prior to rating Sticks n Sushi's food.  Overall, for the prices they charge, three stars represent a very generous rating.  Here we go:
- Sushi - I had Hells Kitchen roll (maki).  The tuna it was topped with was anemic and laked the intense color of a good sushi grade tuna.  The tempura shrimp that is in the roll has more tempura than shrimp and was overcooked.  2.5 stars.
- Yakitori - overall rating 3 stars. Individually, some sticks were better than others but none exceeded the above rating.  ALL skewers were overcooked!  I had two different steak sticks and on both steak was well done (overcooked). Same was the case with pork w/basil, chicken w/chili and bacon wrapped swiss cheese.
The service was very friendly and efficient which is the main reason the rating score is not lower.",-1
4,"I like this restaurant, salmon are very fresh and tasty. I will go to next time, but really need reservation especially at the weekend, even the lunch.",1
4,"Sushi restaurants are popping up all over the place at the moment, which is great. The problem is lots pop up that are not so great...Stick n Sushi is not one of them! Considering it's in the middle of Covent Garden it is also one of the best value Sushi Restaurants around!
It's a great modern setting, with great service which is always important. But as usual it's all about the food for me! 
Sticks n Sushi has a great menu...delicious sushi, along with some great meat sticks which is what makes these guys a bit different.
Make sure you share as there is so much to choose from, and you don't want to miss out. Some of my favourites include...
Sashimi Mix
Ebi bites
Yakiniku steak
Sushi Rolls-Mix it up, we love Duck and Crab the best
Spare Ribs
Emmental in Bacon sticks
Black Cod sticks
Scallop in Bacon sticks
That will give you a great mix, but go for what you like..it's all good!
The sticks are really good, but don't go overboard as the usual suspects on the menu are great. 
Sticks n Sushi also has a great cocktail menu, so try and wok your way through them as well!
Go with at least 3 other people, and give yourself a couple of hours to enjoy the place!",1
4,"60 pounds for a meal with no dessert and tap water  
Pros
- very fresh sushi, good variety, big menu
- good value for money
- big place, very cosy 
- enjoyed the salmon ceviche and hotate sushi
Cons
- Sake in their soya sauce - watch out non alcoholics 
- uncomfortable chairs downstairs; not good for chubby and fat people 
-waitress kept touching my sushi when explaining",1
4,"I was pretty impressed with Stick N Sushi. We ended up ordering a combo plate for two so we could try both sticks and sushi. They brought out the cold (sushi) part first, which involved a couple rolls and the four common nigiri you'd expect: salmon, tuna, shrimp, and sea bass (I think sea bass is common - the others definitely are!). Anyway, everything was fresh and tasty. 
Next came the skewers, and I have to admit, although I was more excited for the sushi, the skewers were really good! Chicken teriyaki, pork belly, and chicken meatballs were all excellent, and it was all the right amount of food in the end. I was full, but not overly stuffed. 
The food came quickly, but it took a little while to actually order - it was incredibly busy, and we didn't have a reservation, so I wasn't too disappointed by that, and the food and drinks more than made up for it. I'd go back, which is the main thing I look for in a restaurant!",1
2,"The restaurant is beautifully designed and the shape and use of the shared tables are brilliant.  You are certainly impressed when walking in, and equally so (if a bit overwhelmed) by the massive but beautifully photographed menu.  So my disdain for the crass name of the restaurant quickly disappeared... yes for that 1 second I was being a complete restaurant snob. 
Anyway as I reminded myself that I am sometimes partial to a McDonald's cheeseburger we proceeded on our way through a few snacks and a few platters.  The sushi was not bad nor was the teriyaki.  However the more and more I continued through the meal there was this absolute feeling that we were being fed ""Japanese"" inspired food by people who didn't really get Japanese food.  The constant yelling of Irasshaimase in a very un-Japanese restaurant grated on me even more as I put another mouthful of soulless food in my mouth. 
I get that it's Japanese with a Danish touch, and the food isn't bad - neither the sushi nor the teriyaki were bad, a notch above Yo Sushi or Wasabi.  But I'm not going to be conned by the great decor here.  
Fish quality was distinctly average and seasoning was all over the place, often meat would not be seasoned enough and batter would be over-seasoned.  But it's ok the distinctly average fish and seafood would be smothered in a spicy mayo so any semblance of natural sweet ocean freshness was gone, scallops tasted like shrimp etc. etc. Perhaps the most underrated part of sushi is the rice.  I'm sorry but if the rice is not fluffy and bouncy or even seasoned correctly then you shouldn't be charging these prices. 
And this is my biggest grief with Sticks and Sushi.  I feel like I've been conned with the beautiful decor and menu.  The food is a notch above your average London high street sushi place (and the quality of sushi in London is not great in general), yes a single notch.  We paid £120 for 2 at lunch (with 2 beers and 2 cocktails) for very average soulless food.  Staggering!  It saddens me to think that restaurants like this who focus on image and looks more than the food itself can become popular.  And don't get me started on that melted cheese wrapped with ham on a stick.",-1
2,"Sushi was lovely, sashimi and tepenyaki were all undeniably good. But I was extremely disappointed by the arrogant attitude of the waiting team, the tricks playing around the waiting system, and the way they manage customer makes me felling like idiot. It is one of those tricky restaurant that I am feeling being fooled. 
We walked in, didn't book. The host by door told us will take us to the bar and having few drinks till the table is available. I certainly respect that and have no problem to wait. As soon as we were led to the bar, the waiter told us will be dinning at bar. To be honest I have no problem to eat on bar, but I hate the way they lie, this waiter was right standing at the door with the host. I wish to point out that there were plenty seats at that time, and I respect that reservation goes first so that I nicely asked if we could wait in case there are free tables. Anyway that never happened. 
We felt exhausted and hated the service.",-1
5,"Wide offer of nigiri, sushi, sashimi, salads, etc. It is a great place for knowledgeable eater of Japanese food as well as those looking for traditional menus. I highly recommend.",1
4,"Great place, really beautiful, and delicious food! Portion sizes are quite small though!",1
5,Best sushi I ever had in my entire life lol. First time having raw fish also and it was  amazing!,1
5,"Again, I'm taking seriously good Japanese food with great creativity!
It's a place MUST GO! You and you friends will for sure have already time there.
Food was so nicely done and you can tell the chef really cared about the style and flavour of the each plate brought out.
Don't go for the big plates of sushi/sashimi for share, try the small plates such as grills, tempura, caviar and those creativity dishes. They WILL BLOW YOU MIND!
In addition, their cocktails are amazing as well!
Book early m, otherwise you really work on your luck and charms...",1
4,Good restaurant all round from service to food to decor.The chicken wings skewers were fantastic and the sake also tasted pretty good. I think this venue is probably better for a smaller group or even just for two people so you can sit side by side at the sushi bar area downstairs.,1
3,"Brilliant, efficient and enthusiastic service. Why couldn't everything meet the same standard? I love that one of our waiters took the time to explain to us which fish are currently sustainable, the ethical element really added to the experience. 
Sadly there were some issues, and for the price, I'd expect a little better. Firstly, our drinks: the glasses were all wet, and had been garnished with an old lime peel. It really should have been freshly cut. The menus were also dirty, which is a shame because they're so nicely designed! It's just poor attention to detail.
The positioning of the tables isn't good. There is not a clear route through the ground level of the restaurant, which lead other customers to squeeze between tables. We really had to keep an eye on our water glasses, in case of rouge butts and elbows! 
So as for the main event : the food, they have a huge selection, so it felt a bit like ordering from a canteen. The dishes we tried included the scallops, Jerusalem artichoke, sashimi selection and avocado nigiri. The artichoke and crab balls were a bit too salty and the nigiri did not hold together well. The quality of the fish overall, was not great.
Sushi in London is often disappointing, and I think that this place falls in to that category. But I will say that it is  better than many others.",-1
4,"Great sushi, fresh and well cooked. Very hard to get a table,have to book in advance . Nice seating at the bar in case you don't manage to book or find a table available. Nice desserts. Quite pricy but worh  eating there from time to time",1
4,"I know lots of people complain, but I really like Sticks'N'Sushi. Excellent menu with a good variety, fast service with a smile, fresh food. Modern decor. All good for me.",1
4,"Popped by for a brief dinner, and the food was great but the service was very disorganised. 
We had time for only small dishes. I went for an 8pcs plate of rainbow rolls. The ingredients were very fresh which I appreciated. However, perhaps it was too fresh -- the rolls disintegrated very easily and I would have expected better, neater rolls than that from a restaurant of this price range.
Service, once again, was very disorganised. They messed up my friend's plate, and it took them some prodding to finally bring it out. 
Ambience was quite nice. A bit noisy, but posh enough for dates. 
I'd go back to try out some of the other dishes -- the menu looked good. I do hope their service will have improved by then.",1
5,"I am an avid lover of SUSHI! 
I was recommended Sticks and Sushi by a friend, again very chic and modern (slightly pretentious). 
Cocktails are lovely, mostly made with Japanese influenced alcohol, including sake. 
There is a lot of varieties on the menu from ramen to raw fish sushi and steak fillet sushi. 
For starters I had the scallops placed in a light batter with a mustard base sauce. Very pleasing for the pallet.
The food is beautiful presented, for mains we ordered a variety of sushi fish based mains. I'd personally pick out a dish on every page of the menu to give yourself variety and a choice of flavours. Throughly enjoyed my experience and the food was definitely vibrant and flavoursome. 
HIGHLY recommend sushi lovers to visit, the only downside to the restaurant is that is very pricey.
Don't be afraid to add a pinch of wasabi to your sushi!",1
4,"Love the food hate the menu. 
Its a great place to eat and enjoy yourself. Staff is great and helpful but very busy pretty much most of the day. The only problem was the menu, little description and a lot of pictures. Great for eye candy, but not for ordering.",1
5,You need to experience this. I am a pessimist but it's hard to find a single flaw in this establishment. Flavour is at an all time highs within these walls. If your gonna have sushi in London go to Stick N Sushi.,1
3,"I don't understand the hype.
The food was average. The famous skewers were nothing special and there was some weird flavours. Desserts was OK but I'm not a sweet tooth so not gonna comment too much.
The bill was very expensive as well. Too overpriced for what was offered.
Staff were very friendly and helpful though even though it was very busy.
The place was OK, but I'm not desperate to come back here any time soon.",-1
4,Great great great great sticks. Yakitori style hot food on sticks. But posher in fact. With its Denmark meets Japanese influence the best bit about this place it the sticks. Sushi is quite good but the hot food stands it in my opinion.,1
1,"I actually can't review the food since we were never served before giving up and leaving.
After 15 minutes, I was going to bother the bartender for drinks but realized the couple sitting at the bar hadn't been served either and they were sitting right there trying to get his attention.",-1
4,"This place didn't have the best sushis and I felt that it wasn't authentically Japanese, the food and the atmosphere were both quite westernized,(still nice tho) but somehow I liked this place. Anyways I think it's worth a go.",1
3,"This was a solid 3 star experience. 
Things they did well: The service. We were seated promptly. Someone took our coats. Our waitress walked us through the extensive menu, made some suggestions, and continued to check back in on us throughout the meal. Can't say anything bad about the staff or the service. 
Things that were just ""okay"": The food. My boyfriend and I split the tuna tartare, which didn't taste like a whole heck of a lot. In fact, it sort of tasted like it has been sitting in a refrigerator for a while. The tuna as well wasn't a great cut, it was hard to pull it into bit size pieces. 
My boyfriend ordered one of the sushi platters. He said it was ""pretty good"". It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. 
I ordered a few of the ""sticks"" - oysters wrapped in bacon, grilled vegetables, and salmon. The oysters came without the bacon, and instead of a ""miso butter"" were smothered in teryaki sauce. So was the rest of it. I was hoping for that smoky Japanese grill taste but it was really just speared meat and vegetables slathered in really sweet teryaki. I was kinda bummed. 
All in all, it was affordable and the service was prompt, but the food was just average. Beats the other chains in the tourist swarmed Covent Garden area but I wasn't mega",-1
4,"So much yes for SticksNSushi! 
I have mad love for any place who can sit two overdressed and under-dated ladies on a Saturday night sans reservations, so... props guys! 
The lowdown as follows: had a crapton of sashimi, because carbs before marbs are the death of my social life, and it was sensational. 
Also had a few ""sticks"" and non sushi items, including this cauliflower thing with truffle that was excellent, and a lamb with miso and butter stick (very good) a beef with garlic stick (good, tad chewy), an emmenthal and bacon (oh mother) and some rolls, including the Shake Daikon (good) and a hell's kitchen roll. 
Now I'm reading all of this, and what the actual fuck did I write that whole thing about carbs if I was going to order an entire wagon of food? Who knows anymore. 
Anyway, the place is LOVELY and their menu is easily the most visually stunning I've seen in mah laaaaaf. Seriously. Great place, shall return upon becoming thin again.",1
4,"If you want proper Japanese food you've likely come to the wrong place. It's not a bad thing though!! It's just that the portions are relatively small compared to some other Japanese places that I've been to that were priced the same. THAT BEING SAID, their food is really good and they have such a wide variety of things to choose from! I also love their popped rice dessert and the sesame chocolate truffle thing. I think it's ideal for group dinners cause then you can order a selection platter - which is probably more cost effective - and share all sorts without having to order a bunch of small portions.",1
4,Very fresh and very good! We had sushi and sashimi and it was delicious. This place has a cool yet elegant vibe. The service is impeccable.,1
2,"Having read the reviews and heard good things about the Copenhagen branch I had high expectations for sticksnsushi.  This place turned out to be overrated serving mediocre fusion sushi, the scallop starter although visually pleasing tasted bland.
The highlight of the meal was the keroppi cocktail!",-1
4,"A great place and very innovative way of presenting sushi. Would have received a 5 star, if they wouldn't have sent us away the 1st of January at 10:20, after we reassured the same afternoon, that we would be served until 11:00 PM.
So don't come to late, the kitchen doesn't forgive any minute.
Otherwise very high recommended.",1
4,"Copenhagen's finest Japanese cuisine is now available in...Covent Garden? Come again? The Danes are known for many things: great design, Lego-blocks, and even the little mermaid....but sushi....isn't Copenhagen a bit far from Tokyo? The thought of going to a Danish Japanese restaurant in Central London shows how truly global we've become.
Nevertheless the concept of this hip Nordic chain of Japanese fusion restaurants works rather well. This location (apparently the first London location was Wimbledon, yes, Wimbledon really) that oozes Scandi-cool---think clean lines, high ceilings, stark colours, lots of exposed wood, and unusually shaped communal tables. 
Once you navigate through the complicated menu (it's almost comical how complicated it is...way too many choices of set menus and individual items on offer, all slightly oddly named...it took a bit of explaining from the waitress on how it all worked), you're in for a treat as the food does impress. 
The main premise here is quality sushi combined with an assortment of grilled ""sticks"" which are skewers of meats and fish. I shared the ""upgrade"" set menu with a friend. For about £60 you got an assortment of rolls, several delicious slices of salmon carpaccio, and skewers of shrimp, chicken and tuna. The salmon in particular with its fusion-y sauce was a highlight as were the rice paper wrapped duck rolls. The skewers were ok but not super memorable; I expected more from the chicken wing skewers. Surprisingly the side of broccoli was amazing, some of the best broccoli I've ever had. I definitely need to figure out how to make it at home. While £60 sounds steep (£30/person), it actually is a lot of food, no room for dessert!
There is also a nice selection of fusion cocktails and Japanese whiskeys on offer though they're on the pricey side (Yamazaki 18, a great whisky to try for sure, but at £35 a go is excessively steep).
4 stars overall, worth the trip even if just to try their Danish take on Japanese cuisine.",1
5,"Well worth the wait for the sashimi. Excellent taste and strong wasabi made it one of the best I've ever eaten. Would definitely recommend! The sushi rice, in particular, were amazing.",1
4,"I ended up at this place on a whim when I was wondering Covent Garden looking fit some grub, and may have gotten a bit over excited when I saw sushi! I wasn't disappointed though, and could quickly see why it was such a popular restaurant. There wasn't any space for us to sit at the main restaurant, so we went for the bar menu. To be honest, it was more than enough! We went for one of the sharing plates for two, which had an array of sushi rolls. A little on the pricey side, but there was plenty of food and we ended up having to take the left overs home as we couldn't finish it between the two of us. The staff were a little slow (I think it was a busy night), but very polite. Definitely a place to go if you want to treat yourself (or someone else).",1
4,It's crowded for a reason. Excellent but basic sushi selection and very good yakitori. Nice selection of cold sake and very good helpful staff. I was in London for five nights and ate here two of them. I will definitely be back when I am in town.,1
5,"I went in to the restaurant to order take away. I was seated by a table while deciding what to order. The service was absolutely fabulous! The waitress checked in with me several times during my visit to ensure I hadn't changed my mind about beverage and updating me on remaining wait time. Ordered a couple of different Uramaki roles, incredibly delicious. 
Definitely the best sushi place in London!",1
5,"I absolutely loved the place. I believe service and the setting are almost as important as food and it counts in my notation of a place as I find it hard to enjoy good food in a discouraging environment. Well, Stick n Sushi got that admirably. 
When coming in you can't fail to notice the interior design. Subdued light, wooden furniture in sometimes funny shapes, dark dark dark (I like dark). It's big on the ground floor and there is even more sitting downstairs. The wooden chairs are comfortable
You're welcomed at the entrance by a waitress/waiter. We had the chance to find a table for 4 within minutes but they recommend you make a reservation for they are packed even with so many tables available. It's a hot spot and it's in the heart of Covent Garden. 
Our waiter came to introduce himself. He was jovial, kind and very energetic, we had a good time with him. He even summoned all the remaining french he could find within him to chat with my parents. He was very thoughtful without over doing it. He helped and advised us on the huge menu.
Speaking of the menu.
You'll find anything and everything from roasted cauliflower, edamame (nicely roasted in a spicy sticky sauce and tasty) and broccoli to teriyaki (meat sticks), nigiri sushis, makis, meat and salads. 
We tried a bit of everything.
I had the kimchi, the black cod dragon roll, the shake daikon and the panko breaded duck. I found the kimchi too salty and too full of flavour, but I had wanted to try it for a while. It's fermented vegetables so obviously, it would taste strong. The black cod dragon roll was my favourite and it's worth its £12. Flavours are well put together and it's melting in your mouth. The shake daikon is an interesting concept. It's a maki roll but they replaced the rice and the seaweed with a sort of radish (the daikon). It tastes good without the rice taking the podium on the flavours and it's perfect for those on a low carb diet. Finally, the duck stick was a good surprise as I didn't know what to expect. I have eaten duck in many forms and this one was a novelty. The meat was very well cooked and melting in the mouth, the bread coat was crusty and didn't taste too oily and the wasabi sauce it's served with, perfect. 
I heard same praises from my family as they enjoyed their dishes. 
For the dessert, we had an assortment of chocolate fondant, crèmes brûlées, chocolates and the coconut cake which is the only thing none of us appreciated at all. 
My brother tried the Japanese soda, which is basically sprite in a Japanese bottle (which does make it funnier), and a french Chardonnay to our taste. Note that they offer a sufficient range of wines from different origins and for a wide pricing range (from £20 to over £50 a bottle).
It was a no mistake for Sticks n Sushi. I would recommend it to anyone on the lookout for a very good yet not too expensive Japanese restaurant in London. I mean, it is pricey, but not as unreasonable as we expected. If that make any sense.",1
5,"I came here with a group of 5 girls on a rainy weekday evening after work for some sushi & sake combo (well it was gin actually but you get the jist) and this place was perfect for this purpose. Firstly the place is huge but still oddly cosy which is great when you want to talk freely without eves droppers. The atmosphere is a mix of professionals and creatives which makes you feel hip and the service seemed busy but the right level of attentive. The food was AWESOME! Sushi can be hard to great right but I loved the slight twist on standard dishes (grilled edamame - why hasn't it happened before?!) with the platters a great selection for when you're so hungry you can't choose. The price point was right with it costing £50 for 3 courses, a cocktail each & some wine. I plan to bring the hubby here for one of our date nights, he definitely won't leave hungry!",1
1,"As a Japanese food lover, who has almost tasted all Japanese restaurants that I can find in London. I got to say that this is the worst Restaurant for Japanese food, but the best restaurant for English food!
I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone! If you are really fancy Japanese food you won't be happy for the food in there. However I have to say that the presentation of each dish was absolutely gorgeous, but the taste was just ....!!! 
Don't worry you may like the food here if you like English's fish and chips! 
The following is my rating (5 is the highest)
The price: 4 stars
The taste: -100 stars
The presentation: 5 stars
The atmosphere: 4 stars
The service: 5 stars",-1
4,"I've been here twice. The first time was awesome the second time only okay. Get the yellow tail sashimi; it's amazing. Also, their salmon carpaccio dishes were quite good. Seabass was a little off (served too cold), and I really enjoyed some of their salads and roasted broccoli, weird to get at sushi place but it was delish! You don't need a reservation often if you don't mind sitting at the sushi bar.
One big downfall is the menu layout...it's just annoying (you'll know what I mean when you read it)...it has nothing to do with the food.",1
5,"Fantastic food, great aesthetics, superb service. Overall, truly exceptional experience. Definitely returning!everything is good and fresh",1
3,"Second visit in three months, I probably won't return.
Great people, nice space, quite average food. 
The sushi rice was overly moist and slightly too heavy and definitely hadn't been prepared to any decent standard. The sashimi was served extremely cold so the taste of the fish was very muted. 
The Yakitori was good, particularly the tsukne (chicken meatball) which was very good. They didn't bring out part of my order but it wasnt on my cheque so no harm no foul. 
Service was a little disjointed but the people there are really wonderful. There must be better sushi in London than this, as for Yakitori it's good but my search for a Yakitori restaurant to replace the outstanding (and now closed) Bincho must continue.",-1
5,"Great food,great ambience and exceptional service! Been here twice now and can't wait to go back, the sparkling lemonade is a must try!!!!",1
5,"Delicious sushi, great service, nice atmosphere. We got a place at the bar even without reservation, the sushi was just great and the service more than friendly. No wonder they are always booked out!",1
5,"I am so sorry I didn't review you earlier Sticks N Sushi, I really wanted to keep you my little dirty secret so that next time I come along you will not be stuffed full with other guests and leaving no place for me in your heart.
It would seem that I am wrong. You have already reached the hearts of more people than I would ever want, with my mentioning your name to my friends and them already knowing about you and they say they will join you soon....
The first time I savoured your food I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Literally I was about to cry because the sushi was so fresh, the service was so amazing, from the warm napkins handed to me at the start, to the free water given to me without prompts, to the great explanations of which cocktail to choose when I said I wanted something sweet.
If you too would like to join me in my love quest to Sticks N Sushi, I would recommend you order the Ultimate (enough for two), make sure you go on a weekday night (for fresh fish, do not go at weekends), and seriously, enjoy everything from the service to the food.
If you order matcha, they do the tea ceremony in front of you. How can romance not blossom in this fabulous establishment from Copenhagen?
I'm in love. I might just marry this restaurant for the food.",1
4,"Quick glance:
+ beautiful menu
+ beautiful sushi
+ patient and attentive staff
+ good decor and atmosphere
- Soho prices
Full review:
A friend invited me to lunch at Sticks N Sushi after she missed visiting the original concept in Denmark. So there you have it, it's a Danish import and hence why you'll find quite a few Danish beer on the menu. 
The restaurant has a hipster feel to it, in a positive way, giving it a good ambiance. The menu is beautiful - every item has a picture and laid out like a guidebook rather than a normal menu one would scan from top to bottom, left to right. It was distracting at time as my eyes dart from picture to picture, but I enjoyed the novel experience. 
The food that arrived at our table looked as beautiful as the ones pictured in the menu. The flavour of the sushi wasn't mind-blowing, but they tasted good and looked even better. On the other hand, the beef we had came with a wonderful sauce, and the dessert I had (black sesame ice cream) was packed with flavour. 
The staff was very attentive to allergies requirements and double checked with the kitchen to make sure we don't ingest anything we shouldn't. The only downside is the Soho prices, roughly £30 each for lunch (a plate of beef, two plates of sushi, two desserts and one tea), but it is worth a treat. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends over some visually enticing food.",1
4,"Wandering around Covent Garden, hungry but not sure what for, we stumbled upon Sticks n Sushi. After a quick glance at the menu outside we decided it was worth a shot.
A chain serving sushi and yakitori platters, Sticks n Sushi started in Denmark and this is their second London branch. It's lovely inside - dim, music isn't too loud and tables aren't crammed too close together. The staff were very friendly too - we were made very comfortable and welcome (and one waitress even stopped to compliment my homemade flower brooch!).
Now the food. We decided to order the 'Table for 2' sticks n sushi platter which is a selection of sushi rolls and yakitori sticks served with all the appropriate embellishments and dips. It took a little while for our food to arrive, but it was all fresh and delicious when it did. We were told the providence of all of the seafood in our sushi. Believe me when I say everything was DELICIOUS! This type of food is deceptive - because everything is served to you in little bites you don't realise how much you've eaten until you are rolling out of the restaurant, fit to burst. This worked out about £30 each for the platter, drinks and tip.
Definitely one I'll make a return visit to.",1
5,"Hands down the best sushi place I have been to thus far in London.  I was incredibly surprised at how packed it was, yet the service was great. We ordered a different selection of the sashimi, rolls, and sticks, all of which were delicious.  My favorite was the assortment of beef sticks with chili and garlic as well as the duck sticks.  Even the duck heart was delicious, which I had never tried before.  The sashimi was incredibly fresh to the taste and light as well.  I definitely have this place on my list to return to when I get the chance.  
Reservations are a must because it gets packed on the weekends!",1
5,"Amazing don't miss it if you are in London. It exceeded our expectations and is also great with kids since they have a menu for them. Cod sticks, Salmon ceviche roll and coral crab were amazing.",1
4,"Summary: 
+ Fresh sushi and Japanese skewer grills
+ Tasteful interior and excellent food presentation 
Sticks N Sushi is a restaurant chain from Denmark that serves quality Japanese food in a stylish space that is characterised by its chic minimalist interiors. As the name suggests, they specialise in sushi and sticks (skewers). The dishes are served with elegant presentation.  
The restaurant in Covent Garden was pretty busy when we arrived for a little late lunch (2-ish) on a weekend. Since we had reserved a table beforehand, we were shown to our group table without a hassle. 
We ordered one shared board each from sushi and sticks sections and a few small dishes. 
My miso soup came in a china bowl with an old-school wooden top. (See photo) The sticks (skewers) board, which consisted of chicken, pork and salmon with veggie sticks as side. The sweetened miso-based dip sauce which accompanied the sticks board was very tasty. The sushi board consisted of salmon carpaccio, cucumber and crab meat roll, duck roll, as well as the usual nigiri sushi. This board was served with a slightly spicy mayo-based dip sauce. 
Overall, the food was delicious and presented beautifully. I particularly liked the elegant but functional approach to presentation with no gimmicks. 
This place is not cheap but definitely worth a visit when you want to treat yourself with fresh Japanese food in style.",1
4,"Amazing place for sushi lovers, a bit on the expensive side but definitely worth trying. The service was quick and the food was great. I had not booked the table but luckily there was space at the bar so I didn't have to wait. Highly recommend to book in advance as they are usually quite packed.",1
5,Sticks 'n sushi is exceptional. The staff is absolutely attentive and so helpful. The menu is quite large and the servers do a great job of making suggestions. The ambiance is very chic yet comfortable. I would highly recommend the salmon sashimi inspired by gravlax. The Danish/Japanese fusion is unexpected and oh-so-tasty.,1
2,"the food was okay as i was rushing to the theatre.  Service at he bar was poor.  Apparently 'George' when asked to recommend an roll couldn't and so the bartender did instead.  After which the service fell further and the waiter didn't bother to come round to ask how my food was or if I wanted another drink. The bartender gave the best service and outside of that, keep walking on.",-1
4,Always love going to sticks n sushi. Love the man food plate with cold beer and Ginjo sake,1
5,Best sushi I've had outside of Tokyo. Solid 9.5/10.I haven't had anything on the menu which 'isn't great'. Can't wait to revisit next time I'm in LDN.,1
3,"We went here as we were staying at a friend's flat in Convent Garden.  
First, the menu is oddly laid out and takes about 5 minutes digest the first time you are there.  Second, our initial server seemed to be a bit overwhelmed to the number of tables she was serving.  The staff also seemed to be going through the first set of cuts so the server rotation got a bit messed up.  Once we got our server, I'm blanking on his name, he was legitimately the best server I have ever had at any restaurant.  I was extremely impressed.   
Second, the food was good.  It was also a welcomed break from the starchy British food I had been consuming.  I decided to order from the set menu as it came with a nice mixture of both sushi, nigiri and a few yakitoris.  Again, food was solid but it seemed over priced and this was with a favorable USD to GBP conversion.
If I lived near there I would probably grab takeaway if I was in a pinch but would definitely venture out elsewhere before I made this a staple in my restaurant rotation.",-1
4,"The waitress was an absolute dream - charming, funny, appropriately flirtatious, and very attentive without being overbearing. She deserved five stars. I felt sorry that she (and everyone else) seemed to have to shout something unintelligible in Danish to signal our arrival - this seemed to be a little artificial and unnecessary. Perhaps I missed the cultural context. Anyway, I digress.
The sashimi was marvellous, and not too pricey - I could have ordered double the amount. However, I felt that the rest of the food was a little hit and miss - the hits were absolutely brilliant - like the Ebi Panko maki roll, the spare ribs, and the oddly named 'Hell's Kitchen' roll. On the other hand, the salmon ceviche roll tasted a bit like fairy liquid, and the teriyaki sauce on the marinated salmon was a tad sickly.
The atmosphere, layout etc are all very good, and, strange as it sounds, their soy sauce was really delicious! Overall, I would recommend trying this place, and would probably come back again; though perhaps next time I'll be better off asking the delightful waitress for recommendations, instead of her phone number...",1
5,Amazing sushi and great atmosphere! Make sure to try the black cod roll - our favorite!!,1
5,"Highly recommended sushi restaurant.  Great location, just off the main square at Covent garden.  We had a 30 piece sushi platter and spring rolls, the chilli edamame are particularly delicious.  Service is really friendly and attentive.  I took a friend for birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon and they gave us a birthday dessert and sang to us for free, so cute!",1
5,"Fantastic.  I miss good sushi having spent the last 8 years on the Pacific Coast.  Iwona and the rest of the crew provided incredibly comfortable and attentive service, all-round a must repeat night.",1
3,"The menu here is pretty confusing and it's quite hard to choose what to order.  Its also quite likely that if you're not willing to spend at least £25 a head then you are going to leave kind of hungry.  The prawn tempura was fab, as was the salmon/trout roe platter.  The beef carpaccio was far smaller than the picture indicated.  The waiter seemed overwhelmed and quite rudely called a lady I was with a ""very impatient woman"" - not in a jocular way - not good enough.  The waiter was also very keen on topping up my Meantime IPA so that it had a ridiculous head of foam.  If you are going to try and make people drink faster at least don't mess up up their beer!",-1
5,"This was one of the best dinners I've had. I ate with five colleagues. We called ahead by about 20 minutes, and they had a table ready for us when we arrived despite being busy. Our server was delightful - knowledgable and funny. The drinks were excellent. I had the Kumahi (or something like that) and a great gin martini.
The food. Oh, the food. My friends and I are still talking about it, and my somewhat uppity friend even said this was top 5 restaurants he's been to. That's a rave review.
We shared the big sushi platter. It was perfect between six. The bacon wrapped scallops made me want to cry; they were so good. The salmon sashimi (and the rest!) was extremely fresh. I loved everything I ate. Perfect for sharing.
Overall, an excellent place that I'll be back to. It's a beautiful atmosphere with awesome staff and delicious food. Don't need anything else!",1
1,"Summary: bad quality, bad service and bad value, I will not return.
Review: I'm usually one to give a bad restaurant experience the benefit of the doubt and try a second time but my experience today at Sticks N Sushi was undeniably bad.
I chose to go here because it was a nearby and good quality (according to its Yelp rating) sushi restaurant. First impressions were good - a comprehensive menu with a balance of traditional and fusion in addition to great decor and welcoming staff.
I sat at a high table in the bar area and after sitting for ten minutes figured it was traditional London, requiring me to order at the bar. I ordered a drink and a few minutes later a waitress arrived to take my drink order; turns out there was just a 15 minute wait from first sitting down and seeing a waitress.
By that time I had ordered food. I wasn't very hungry so ordered a light meal and the waitress seemed insulted that I was not ordering something more substantial-- I got two small sushi rolls and some nigiri.
The food took about 45 minutes to arrive, after needing to ask about the status of the meal from another server. When the food came my server was lightly apologetic.
The food was not good. It was bland, the fish was low quality, and the sushi rice was poorly made. The serving sizes matched the pictures on the menu, however, so I was not surprised by the size.
After finishing and waiting several minutes to ask for the cheque, I gave up and paid at the bar.
All in all for a light snack, I was at the restaurant for about 90 minutes.
I will not return to Sticks N Sushi. The food was not good, the service was remarkably bad and the prices were not at all good value. There are many other nearby London sushi restaurants which beat Sticks N Sushi in all of the price, quality, and service categories.",-1
4,"Nice spot near the Covent Garden market. Large menu with lots of selections. Pretty solid food and service.
Rather large dining area with a ground floor and lower ground for seating that is dimly lit and pretty good for an intimate dinner. Several friends and I came here for a weekday dinner. 
The name of the restaurant is aptly named as they serve sushi and yakitori. So we grabbed one of the platters for the table which included various maki sushi and skewered meats (mainly chicken). Quality of the sushi was rather good. The yakitori was well made as well. These platters are huge, so be warned and bring enough people. No way could 3 of us finish a single platter alone.
Drinks are so-so when it comes to the cocktails, so stick with standbys of sake and beer. Don't get their take on an old fashion.. overly sweet and comes with chocolate chips... a bit weird for me.",1
1,I heard good things about Sticks N Sushi but it was such an episode of endless disappointment. The services was very good and friendly and the restaurant atmosphere was very nice. Everything was nice apart from the FOOD. Sushi rice was so dry and dense as if they have to really push it together for the rice grains to stick. I asked for recommendation and turned out that the dish recommended was the worst. We had 'Coal Crab' the coal black rice inside was especially bad. The price is relatively expensive for what you get. It was not worth it. I guess if you are not asian then it would have been an amazing experience.,-1
5,"One of the best Sushi I have ever had. Price is worth it, and the place is wonderful!",1
5,I went several times and it has never been disappointing. The sticks are good and matches perfectly with the tasty sauces on the side. they're just a bit expensive. I always ordered different type of rolls to share and they all have an amazing taste. From traditional Japanese to fusion. I'll definitely recommend it.,1
5,"I had heard good things about Sticks N Sushi and was so glad when a fellow sushi addict wanted to meet up for lunch. From the outside, it looked shut as it was dark and there was no sign of life. However, after trying the door we walked into an open spacious room with the sunlight streaming through the glass roof as we were welcomed by a member of staff and shown to our table. We made no reservation as it was a weekday and relatively quiet.
We had a lovely waiter who talked us through the menu and offered suggestions. The menu itself is quite impressive with images of each dish. With many, many options it took us a while to decide. We even ordered seconds. The best sushi I have ever had and the most fresh.
As addicted as I am to sushi, the highlight was the fresh green juice! Not being much of a juice drinker I decided to give it a go and I am so glad I did. I've already made plans to visit again..can't wait.",1
4,"Stylish chic venue to take a date or a girls night out, however during the day, becomes casual and you can un-embarrassingly take a baby. Mouthwatering dishes although the sushi and small plates are better than the sticks.  com",1
1,"Terrible place. Was told that the wait would be 30-45 mins and shown to the bar. After more than an hour, entirely neglected and watching guests who arrived long after us get their tables, still no sign of getting ours. I'm never ever going back. This is apparently what happens when a place gets too popular for its own good.",-1
3,"Girlfriend had sushi which she really liked.
I had a few sticks (steak and chicken) which were fairly bland and tough.  
Prices were pretty high for what you get.  Definitely could go somewhere else and get better food and bigger portions for a better value.  
Service was not very good, but I guess for London standards was decent.",-1
4,"This was the best meal we had in London.  We stumbled on it and were attracted by its look.  We were impressed by the number of service people they had, and they were all  very attentive.  We also liked the great graphics and photo of the menus, which made they food look very appetizing and helped us make a decision about what to order.  The food was very good.  This is definitely on our list to go back to next time we are in the city.",1
3,"Good location in front of Covent Garden, fabulous service. However, unimaginative sushi (salmon, cooked prawn, maguro), beef ribs with no meat on them, bland miso soup from a packet, overall boring menu despite being visually appealing with lots of photos. The yakitori sticks were nicely charcoaled and there was at least variety in the meat offered.  A fusion Japanese-Danish experience, not an authentic Japanese restaurant.",-1
5,Best Sushi I have ever had.  Service was fantastic.  Atmosphere was hip.  Love it!  Definitely going back!,1
5,"Not gonna lie. I'm a Gordon Ramsay groupie and the only thing I wanted to accomplish during my London layover was to check off this box. 
ATMOSPHERE:
Intimate, minimalist, no music, no wall decor - aka the 3-Star Michelin formula to make you pay attention to the food and service.
SERVICE:
Flawless - inconspicuous, fluid, comfortable. The manager and sommelier made frequent rounds and were very engaging. We had a very annoying dietary restriction that they accommodated beautifully on the fly. The only bummer was that we were the last table before closing, so we didn't get a kitchen tour, which is fine because the last time I had a tour that late, all you could see was a sparkling clean kitchen and a lonely pastry chef.
FOOD:
The two of us each took one of the tasting menus and shared - the only thing better than having one Gordon Ramsay meal is having two! Only one suckling pig course was overworked and weird, everything else was tasty and we cleaned the plates. Most of the food wasn't knock-my-socks-off-keel-over-delicious, but solid. To me, I'm pretty happy with a meal if I can walk away feeling like one thing was exceptional enough that I will remember it - for us it was the foie gras terrine, absolutely the best terrine I've every had. The sorbets were also killer.
DAMAGE:
2 tasting menus + 1 wine pairing with gratuity automatically added came out to be ~ $700 USD. Considering that the average bill in a 3-Star US Michelin for one person is often more that that, we can't complain.
Overall, an exemplary 3-Star, worth a visit when in London. I will continue to binge-watch Masterchef when the next season comes out.",1
3,"In my opinion, the experience of a Three Star Michelin restaurant is comprised of the total experience.  We had the last 2:15 pm lunch seating and enjoyed all but the last 15 minutes of our meal when housekeeping decided it was time to start steaming the tablecloths for the evening service which was to begin in 2.5 hours. My wife asked if they could hold off until we finished but for some reason they would not.  We were moved to the lobby at which time my wife was escorted to the ladies room only to have a male attendant remain in the room.  With that, she was disgusted and left the restaurant and I followed.  
We had the menu Prestige with the wine pairing.  They set the pacing of the meal and everything was perfect until those unfortunate final minutes.
The service was outstanding and the finesse was superb.  We have dined at numerous great restaurants but have never been moved out of the dining room so they could prepare for the next seating.  I did ask for a manager but none was available.  We did not get to enjoy the dessert or the wine pairing for it.  We won't be back.  I would suggest that a manager stay in the establishment until the last service has been completed.
My original rating was a one star but in reflection the food and service was amazing until they were ready to begin preparations for the dinner seating.  A management failure.",-1
5,3 Michelin Star Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Definitely must try! You will need to make a reservation well in advance and it is a bit pricey - we had the Seasonal Inspirational Menu at £185 per person (USD $240). Everything was delicious and beautifully plated. The Maitre d' was very friendly and even offered us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our dinner.,1
5,"****1000th Review****
This was my first Three Michelin star restaurant I have dined at and it did not disappoint. This small, intimate restaurant lives up to the hype and will be one of the best experiences you will have. For the price, I believe it is very reasonable for what they charge. Tasting menu with a high profile celebrity chef could easily cost way more than that price they charge.
I suggest planning ahead on this one, it's a very small restaurant with a paced tasting menu. This isn't a place where you will walk up and get a seat. Plan ahead! The experience is awesome and I highly recommend trying to get a table here. The service is excellent and flow of the menu is just right. One piece of advice is to ask for the check, from what I was told USA vs Europe has different etiquette surrounding the check delivery. If you don't ask for it, you may sit awkwardly for a bit.
The food is amazing, this was the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. Everything start to finish was delicious and perfect. They cook at such a high level here, every dish on the menu is something I would order again. The food was so well prepared and lived up to the Michelin accolade, can't get much better than what they offer. I would go back here the first chance I got, wish this one was closer to me. This is my #1 meal and I encourage you to try them out!",1
5,"I planned for my Europe trip few months in advance and booked Gordon Ramsay restaurant to celebrate for my hubby's birthday dinner.
I have been to a few 3 Michelin star and 2 Michelin star restaurants in Tokyo, HK, NYC & Vegas.  Of coz, I would expect more at one of 3 Michelin star restaurant in London. 
It was NOT incredibly expensive as 3 Michelin star restaurant (compared with Paris).  
We ordered tasting menu and dishes were phenomenal!  
Pressed foie gras - It's light but tasty
Lobster Ravioli - It's so delicious
Poached Halibut - presented beautifully but halibut taste a bit raw...
Lamb in 3 ways (Braised, confit and roasted) - it's cooked perfect on each way.
Roast Pigeon - I would say Chinese Roast Pigeon a bit better.. LOL
Soup **So different and special** - Pineapple coconut, it liked a drink than a soup to us. Taste so fresh and good.
Sorbet - English breakfast tea with mint.  We needed grind the mint by ourselves and put the sorbet into stone mortar and pestle. 
White chocolate covered strawberry sorbet balls - That's so cool with dry ice presentation
Lemon Parfait - I personally don't like sheep milk and didn't expect bergamot would taste so good with lemon parfait.
After big meal, the manger chatted and  offered us to visit the kitchen.  It's pretty impressed for medium size kitchen and staffs can make such quality of dishes.",1
4,"I ordered the £145 prestige tasting menu at Restaurant Gordon Ramsey, and while most courses tasted good, none were quite mind-blowing. It's usually the other way around, but I actually thought the entrees were significantly better than the appetizers or desserts. In particular, the lamb was delicious but the ravioli and lemonade parfait were ordinary. I was hoping that this restaurant would top my list of favorite Michelin experiences in London, but unfortunately that didn't happen. Oh also, what's up with the co-ed bathroom?
// Peas, radish, mint, onion, goat's cheese*
// Pressed foie gras - green apples, turnips, watercress, smoked duck
// Ravioli - lobster, langoustine, salmon, oxtails and wood sorrel
// Poached Isle of Gigha halibut - Atlantic King crab, finger lime, ras el hanout infused broth
// Braised, confit and roasted Herdwick lamb - spring vegetable 'navarin'
// Soup - pineapple, coconut, kaffir lime
// Pineapple coconut and kaffir lime mousse*
// Sorbet - English Breakfast tea, mint
// Lemonade parfait - honey, bergamot, sheep's milk yoghurt
// Elderflower jelly, strawberry ice cream coated in white chocolate,",1
5,"It had always been my dream to eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. While my friend and I were traveling and exploring London I made sure to make reservations here. I was a little under the weather and had lost my voice. The staff was so kind they brought me hot chamomile tea with honey, on them. 
The food was incredible. So flavorful but lite. I had a wonderful plate of roasted vegetables with a balsamic reduction and my friend had Gordon's signature suckling pig cooked 5 different ways. We enjoyed every bite surrounded by the most attentive service we've ever received. 
The manager even offered us a tour of the kitchen! I guess it was obvious we were tourists but getting to see all of the chefs at work bustling around and how organized the back of the house was just made our experience that much more memorable. I am so thankful that I was able to experience something like that!",1
2,"Shame on you, Gordon Ramsay. I feel robbed. I'm no food expert, but I do know what a true 3 star restaurant should feel and taste like. I had the pleasure of dinning at French Laundry a couple of years ago. This experience was a joke compared to it. 
For my first trip to London, I begged my husband to dine at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. I was a huge fan. He agreed, and I was able to book a reservation 2 months in advance. I looked forward to this for 2 months. 
When time came to it, we dined, and I left feeling like I wasted my money. My husband and I both ordered the prestige tasting menu. (priced at £145 + added £10 cheese supplement)  The food was okay. It started good, then went down hill significantly after the main dish. My pigeon was overcooked, my dessert was lackluster, and the server forced me to eat bleu cheese even though I specified that I don't like bleu cheese after he asked for my preferences. 
Then it took the servers 30 minutes to give us the check. They ignored our table for the last half of the meal. This was such a disappointing experience. At £155 each, I expected much better. Not worth it.",-1
5,"Such an amazing moment with my wife. The Best Gordon ramsay restaurant ever tested.
Ravioli was amazing, foie gras better than in France, dessert so tasty and Light. Amazing",1
2,"It was my first time visiting London and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was one of reasons why I booked tickets to London. I watched every single tv show Gordon Ramsay was in because I was his big fan!
We went there on Oct 20, 2017. I have been checking opentable consistently every day for weeks and luckily got one a month before our trip to London.
My bf and I ordered the tasting menu each. Everything was wonderful and very flavorful.
We had Lemonade parfait and there was a piece of paper towel in my dessert. I have been to many michelin restaurants... but that never happened to me once, but it can happen. people can make mistakes... so I understood. I called the manager right away and notified the issue, and he brought us a complimentary dessert which was Manjari chocolate delice and guess what. I had a hair in that dessert this time.. hair stuck inside my dessert.. having issues twice in a row.. haha I couldn't believe it. what a great experience when you pay more than $700 for dinner and wine.. I was very surprised and disappointed at the same time. I immediately notified the issue again to different server (spoke to the oldest waiter.. because I couldn't find the same one)... and he brought a new dessert which I left almost more than a half because I already lost my interest in their food. He offered a kitchen tour and also offered some dessert wine as well. He tried so hard to make it up to us which is why I am giving them 2 stars, instead of 1.. 
Atmosphere here is great and very quite. so many waiters though.. they had almost the same number of waiters as customers. I also didnt understand the purpose of having a ""wine open performance"" - lighting up the candle while opening the wine, etc..
I understand that Gordon Ramsay is a big inspiration to people, but I personally think this is what happen when the main chef is not in the kitchen.. All of staff was very kind. but I am truly sad and disappointed about what happened. I will still love Gordon Ramsay though!",-1
5,"We just had a delightful evening.  For us, this type of thing is an annual splurge, not a regular event.  The service was excellent.   Attentive to the max but not in the way.   The courses each arrived seamlessly, and each had distinctive flavors and presentation.   The whole evening had that feeling of being a special evening, just as it should be.   Well done!",1
5,I went for lunch to celebrate my 1 year anniversary. We did the lunch pre-Fixe 3 course and the create your own pre-fixe menu. The food was nicely presented and tasted great. Service was beyond impeccable. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you can get a reservation. Special thanks to Jean-Claude for being so hospitable and friendly!,1
5,"Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a restaurant where I would travel back to London just to eat here. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a truly pampering experience. From the amazing service to the incredible food. Words cannot experience how wonderful our experience was here. 
Hubby and I visited London a few months ago and while preparing for our trip, one of the first things we did was book a reservation several months in advance for dinner here. You can book your reservation on Opentable. 
On the night of our reservation we hopped into a black cab and off we went to experience a night we will always remember. 
Do you know why I liked it? It is a restaurant is where you can chuck your tie, girls can wear flats, take a bottle to the face, and enjoy heavenly 3 star Michelin food with first class service.....with no judgement. My kind of night. 
Here are some of the highlights of our night : 
* The hilarious bellman/doorman out front who is the worlds best photographer. 
*Ladies, there is a small seat behind your table to place your purse. I loved this little touch of detail and consideration. 
*Intimate elegant dining room with cozy-comfy dining chairs. 
*If you are going with multiple people, have some fun sharing a seasonal menu and prestige menu. Although each experience is exquisite and delectable on its own, it becomes a higher level of complexity and extravagance when combined (in my hubby and I opinion). Especially during white truffle season. The planning of ingredients merged with platting of choice heightens ones senses boosting the excitement of sampling each piece of artwork(dish).  
*Get a bottle, not a glass. Its acceptable/expected to get wine drunk here.
*The great staff and service will keep you laughing and smiling the whole night. Their teamwork also is commendable. No one is ever sitting with a dirty empty plate, empty glass of wine, nor crumbs on the table ever. To pull off this feat in such a tight and small space while also working in sync with the kitchen staff is amazing.  (I probably appreciate and value this more due to the fact that I use to work in the food industry).  
*Heavy fresh shavings from the enormous and fresh white truffle? Yes please! 
*People watching within any restaurant is always fun. For example, here it was fun to watch the different styles of table manners from around the world being used.
*The staff in addition to their professional service are extremely open, friendly, yet chill which I love. They are open to telling you about their background/life and travel/food tasting plans. Its always fun to meet people from around the world and just simply have a quick chat. 
Michelin start restaurants are all about the experience and journey they take you on during your visit. Here, it is enough to make a special trip for another visit, which is what a 3 Michelin star stands for. 
Excellent!",1
5,"My second UK three Michelin star experience left me even more impressed than my first in February. From the moment I stepped into the waiting room, I was attended to by a staff member at one point or another throughout the entire night. Michelin says that execution here is flawless and it really is-- I've griped about the waiter bumping into my dining partner's chair throughout the night at Eleven Madison Park and the bizarre music that was played at Alain Ducasse, but the attention to detail given at Gordon Ramsay was unbelievable. The maitre d', Jean Claude, is world class. He memorized my name and addressed me by it every time he came and chatted with me.
For food, I selected the menu prestige option:
 1) Pressed foie gras: Foie gras doesn't really do anything for me regardless of the restaurant, but this course was still extremely pleasant.
2) Ravioli: a single piece was all that was needed. Absolute savory perfection, it's been on the menu for 23 years for a reason
3) Poached Isle of Gigha Halibut. Looks like a pillow of air, and tastes just the same. It melted in my mouth with no bad fishy after taste.
4) Braised, confit and roasted lamb: a selection of five different cuts of lamb, all of which were  the most tender I've had. The confit lamb was unbelievable.
5) Selection of cheeses from the trolley: I selected one of each of the different groupings of cheese, and told my waiter ""the stronger, the better."" He did not disappoint. Their fromagerie is local in the Marylebone district of London
6) Sorbet: I had to work for this one-- my instruction was to crush the liquid nitrogen dried mint in my mortar and pestle bowl, and roll the sorbet around it.
7) Lemon parfait: Simply exquisite, and a perfect finish to this meal
8) Bonus course: I'll leave this one for you to find out on your own ;)
I'll be back to England in February for a visit to the Waterside Inn so I'll have a third of now five (to include Araki's addition to the three star list) to compare then.",1
5,"Long awaited review! Let me start by commending Monsieur Jean-Claude. Your customer service is impeccable. What a genuine good hearted man you are. Service was definitely what was expected from a three Michelin star restaurant. The food surprised me. Each dish had an individual taste that foreign to my taste buds. I adored how there were so much contrast in each dish that made the flavors pop. Presentation was well put together. The only complaint I would truly say I had was that towards the end, I did feel that timing was a little off. It might be from my slight jet lag, but I was nodding off during the last two courses. Great experience and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great food.",1
4,"I won't be posting all pictures as I think they are the same as all recent reviews. So just the two worth noting is one on duck foie gras - excellent crispy on the outside and buttery inside. It was quite heated-warm on the outside but just cold-warm inside. The halibut was superb. Never had it this way. Very soft like sashimi.
 
Pros - when you go to a 3 stars mich resto, you expect your dishes to be superb. Yes you will get superb food.
 
Cons - We were 10min late. And upon arrival, we were advised that we may need to drink our coffee outside at the reception area. Is that how you treat your guest?
 
Tables are really small for two-persons. Need to relocate my glasses everytime when food came.
 
Tables are really crowded as well. The person from the other table next to me was really just right next to me.
 
The dining area is really packed and busy. Waiters and waitresses were walking back and forth non-stops, not serving food tho, just checking on people to see if they were finished or not. Keep on coming up to refill the water even just after one sip. Gosh, so stressed. Not really fine-dinig atmosphere.
 
Waiters were fine. But the waitresses all look so uptight and no smile at all...
 
I think what put together a 3-star resto means more than just the food. Also the atmosphere, services, comfortness. Gordon Ramsay's resto only has quality food. All the other 3 points are lacking. I would just give it a 2-star...",1
5,"Had the opportunity to dine in Chef Gordon Ramsey's 3 Michelin Star restaurant while in London. 
The restaurant was surprisingly small, but didn't feel crowded at all.  The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed.  
The service is impeccable from the moment you walk in. 
The food was exquisite to look at and as delicious tasting.  We had the menu prestige and every course was worthy of all three stars.",1
5,"This was by far, the most expensive, yet the most amazing gastronomic experience I've ever had in my life. 
With 3 menus to choose from, I did the classic tasting menu to get the full treatment. To make a long story short, each of the items that I had were prepared beautifully (just look at the photos), oh and they all tasted very good to brilliant. 
I was up sold on the truffle pasta special, The fancy ordeal of the truffle shavings and the sauce was great fun at 35 pounds.
What made my bill go so astronomical after it was all said and done (346 pounds but who's counting), was ordering glasses of wine, willy-nilly, not realizing the price or not caring, to be quite honest.
Overall, I was completely satisfied, amazed, and had the best eating experience of my entire life! In fact at the end of the event the maître d' took me into the kitchen to take a look! I loved that. I don't know if he did it out of pity or they normally do that but I loved it. 
Was it worth the cost, no... but would I do it again... yes - but knowing what I know now, I'll be a little more strategic in what I order and thus, more cost-effective.",1
1,"My wife and I ate at the restaurant on Monday, November 20th, 2017. We were one of the first tables seated for the evening.
Initially, things were going great. We were greeted nicely, the staff helped us to take off our coats and escorted us to our table. We both ordered the Menu Prestige and asked for the selection of cheeses to be added on.
Then, our experience went downhill. I ordered a wine supplement with my meal. This included five glasses of wine for a price of around £110-130. This price range was specified in the menu. After ordering, one of the servers came up to the table and asked us who is paying for the bill. Then, he opened the menu to the page that listed the price of the wine supplement, and asked us if we are aware of the cost. I was very confused by this - I've never been asked if I was aware of the cost of something I was ordering. It seemed a bit insulting - as if we would not be able to afford the (very reasonable) price. Neither my wife nor I were under-dressed for this occasion of a fancy dinner. I even wore a tie. The service continued to be rather pretentious throughout dinner, as if we were being looked down upon.
On to the food. The initial courses were outstanding - the foie gras, the ravioli, and the poached halibut. Unfortunately, the mains were underwhelming. My wife did not enjoy her roast pigeon and I did not feel that the lamb was anything special - definitely not for a three-star restaurant. The dessert was tasty but not particularly memorable.
The experience of the cheese course was strange. Our server brought a trolley, from which we could make a selection of four. My wife and I asked our server for recommendations and he asked us what cheeses we liked and did not like. We stated that we did not like bleu cheese or similar cheeses. He insisted that we must try it and placed it on our plate against our wishes. We decided not to make a fuss about it.
After eating and having our table cleared, we awkwardly waited around 20 minutes for the bill. Eventually, we got the attention of one of the servers, who did apologize for taking so long with the bill. We felt that given the price we were paying for the experience, such a wait was unwarranted.
When the bill did arrive, we seem to have been overcharged for the selection of cheeses. The price on the menu was £10, but we were charged £18 each. I did not notice until we have left the restaurant, and going back or calling to complain over £16 seemed unnecessary. The lack of attention regarding billing was a bit disappointing. Perhaps the menus need to be updated if the price did, in fact, change. I've uploaded a photo of our bill, along with a screenshot of the menu from the restaurant's website.
Overall, my wife and I were not happy with the experience. We have eaten at three-star and one-star restaurants prior to visiting Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and have had much better experiences at each of them. We did not expect to be so disappointed by Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.",-1
2,"Decor:  Kind of small.  Too much white.
Food:  Lots of frothy things.  Ok presentation.   Foie gras portion was too large.  Sorbet at end of meal looked kind of like a turd.
Wine:  not sure how a wine pairing with their tasting menu isn't a standard request...  
Service:  A member of our party had a nut allergy.  They served her a dish with a nut in it.  They said there wasn't a nut in it.  But there was.  She could have died.  Good thing she mushed up stuff under the fish before taking a bite.  Staff didn't really care about how big their fuckup was.  The reason for the fuckup is because:  a) too many people involved and b) they take the weekend off so when Friday night comes around, everyone is already checked out.
Bottom line:  Gordon Ramsey checked out of this place a long time ago to move onto bigger things.",-1
5,"It was a good idea to visit this restaurant when we were in London. I visited this restaurant for the first time in 2017 and it became my favorite restaurant in town. It is a great restaurant because there is a good atmosphere and tasty dishes are served. I would recommend this restaurant to people who like good and tasty food. The food was incredible. I had a wonderful plate of Ravioli and I fell in love with this kind of food.Definitely, this is my favorite place !",1
5,"This place is well worth whatever you happen to pay and whatever trouble it might take you to get there (which hopefully, isn't very much- it's easily found).
Service: impeccable. Not hovering, but exceptionally cognizant of what you need. They're attentive & friendly, willing to answer questions.
Food (vegetarian review):  outstanding. And filling. By the 4th course or so, it was getting to the point of uncomfortably full. 
They have a vegetarian menu that has several choices to piece together a 3 course meal. It does not include dessert- it's an add-on.
You can opt to make it a 7 course ('prestige') meal as well, which is pretty much everything on the vegetarian menu (you have to choose between a cheese plate or a soup). It comes with both desserts. 
I'm sure the menu changes, but they did some cool things- I crushed leaves in a mortar w/a pestle as part of dessert, balls of ice cream came out in dry ice, and there were all sorts of crackle-y, crispy things to crunch your way through. 
Dress code: 
Men- no running shoes, Vans or Converse. They'll make you change into a loaner pair, and they might not have your size- my husband had to wear a pair that looked like clown shoes. 
Ladies- jeans are ok. Same as above. I assume guys can wear jeans as well (nice jeans), but not 100% sure. 
At the end of the meal, they'll offer to call you a cab.
Great experience!",1
5,"Best restaurant ive been to yet.  We truly felt like the entire staff was there to serve our every need.  The food was amazing, but it was the service that truly blew us away.  Made the trek across the Atlantic worth it.",1
4,"Being one of the most famous chefs in the world, Gordon Ramsay is a must try during my trip to London. While I had high expectations, I was also quite excited to try this restaurant.
Seared foie gras (5/5): this was very well done. the pairing of the flavor with the sauces and the cherry was outstanding. Also because i just LOVE foie gras.
Pigeon (3/5): while I do like pigeons and the skin was crispy and delicious... this dish was way too salty. The saltiness overpowered the taste of the pigeon and the other wonderful ingredients.
Lemon yogurt dessert (4/5): i forgot the exact name of the dessert but it was kind of citrusy with some goat yogurt, if I remember correctly. It was delicious but not something that was spectacular. Though, the presentation was beautiful.
Service was lovely though, and the ambiance top-notch.",1
4,"The food: Delicious. Beautiful presentation. My particular favorites: The ravioli. The pigeon (the pigeon was so tender and perfectly flavored). The cheese selection I added onto our menu. 
The service: Awkward? I don't know how to better describe the service experience. They were constantly buzzing around in this tiny room and I just felt like I had no personal space. The servers were also not as eloquent and refined as I expected from a restaurant of this caliber. At one point, a server poured sparkling water in my glass half full of still water...And it was quite clear that the still bottled water was in front of my glass and the sparkling water bottle was in front of my boyfriend's....So that was strange. There was a lot of hovering and a lack of smooth rotation, in my mind. I don't quite know how better to explain it.
I'd of course recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion or visiting London with a desire to have an exemplary fine dining experience. I just was expecting a 10/10 experience.",1
5,My first UK three Michelin star experience! I ordered the prestige tasting menu and everything from start to end was AMAZING. Foie gras was my favorite. For the price- I think its very reasonable for what they charge.,1
2,"I have eaten at many 3 Michelin resurants and this one just didn't stand out to me. None of the dishes stood out to me and i have to say i was a little disappointed.
Amuse-bouche:
1. Truffle bun: This was delicious
2. Salmon wrapped in seaweed: had something crunchy inside that was so yummy
3. Prosciutto wrap:
Bread:
1. Bacon onion brioche: Yum!! Didn't even bother with the other bread options.
We Ordered:
1. Egg shell filled: Tasted like creamy bacon potato soup inside
2. Pressed Foie Gras: I am not a fan of foie pâté to begin with, but then i found a piece of what looked like string or i'm thinking part of the animal in the pâté i pulled out, which is a big no no for a restaurant of this caliber.
3. Lobster Ravioli
4. Poached Halibut in infused broth
5. Lamb: Confit, braised and roasted. Delicious. My favorite was the lamb confit
6. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup (option instead of cheese trolley)
7. Cheese Plate
8. Muddled freeze dried rose petal with lemon sorbet refresher
9. Coffee Soufflé - perfect
10. Lemonade parfait - very light and delicious
11. Chocolate Hazelnut praline dessert
12. The petits fours - the chocolate brittle was delicious
Overall, It was good. Compared to other Michelin restaurants nothing really stood out to me as being amazing or innovative or just down right delicious.",-1
5,"Had a difficult time deciding on which Gordon Ramsay restaurant to try in London, but so glad we were able to book a spot at his flagship 3 Michelin star restaurant. This was an dining experience we will never forget and well worth it.
Food and service was superb, not to mention the many complimentary chef surprises. We loved our conversations with Jean Claude the maitre d.  He has a fantastic way of connecting with people and made us feel so warm and welcomed. 
We decided to go.with the 3 course lunch menu and ordered the Buckwheat gnocchi and Dexter beef tartar, followed by the Roast Cornish skate and roast venison and finally finishing off with the custard tart. It's hard to say which was our favorite because they all tasted so fantastic and hard to single out one.
In addition to what we ordered, we were presented with many surprises from the chef that were so delicious that words alone cannot describe what we had. The complexity of the flavors and beauty of the presentation was phenomenal. Hats of to Matt Abe, head chef, which we had the great pleasure of meeting when Jean Claude invited us to a kitchen tour. 
There is a reason this is a 3 Michelin star restaurant and it was well worth it.The food and staff shine here.",1
3,"This is one of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in London so I have decided to splash out and try it since I am a foodie.  
This establishment is located in Chelsea and it is quite a walk from the tube station so do plan your journey a bit.  We were lucky to get a table for 2 about 3 weeks before the reservation date as I think there was some cancellation.
The restaurant is actually quite small and very intimate.  I was hoping the atmosphere was going to be quite chilled and relaxed.  However, due to the number of people in the room, everyone was talking away and it is actually quite noisy for a Michelin starred restaurant.  I was here with a friend and not a date so it didn't really bothered me.
The service was beyond perfect and I give them full marks for it.  Very attentive waiters and waitresses and no mistake done.  We are not locals and we could see quite a few tables with foreigners here but everyone was treated with respect and with no attitude.  This is what makes a good restaurant.  
The wine list is extensive.  We asked the sommelier to recommend wines that go well with our courses and all of them were perfectly paired.  If you want to pair it with your 7 courses, it is usually about £100 per person but you may have less and pay less so it really is up to you. 
I am not going to go into details on each of the dishes that I have tried.  I had the seasonal tasting menu and my friend had the prestige tasting menu.  The pictures that I have posted speaks for itself and what you will be expecting from the dishes.  We also tried a bit of each other's food so that we know how the food was compared to other Michelin star restaurants.  
Unfortunately for us, the food I have to say is not up to a 3 Michelin star quality.  Maybe we went in expecting too much from this restaurant but I have been to some 1 & 2 starred restaurants and the flavour and taste of their food did surpass Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.  I believe that the quality and taste of the food is more geared towards a 1 star quality especially for the price that I am paying.  The Prestige menu was priced at £145 and the Seasonal menu was priced at £175.  Of course, the Seasonal menu tasted better than the Prestige menu since it is more expensive.  
I think this is a one in a lifetime experience which I agree as it is after all a 3 Michelin star restaurant from Gordon Ramsay.  However, I don't think I will come back as we came here to give a 3 star a try.  Just not value for money and definitely not a 3 Michelin star I was expecting food wise.  Sorry but I do think you guys can definitely do better on the food.  The rating I have provided reflects the value and also the quality & flavour of the food when compared with other Michelin starred restaurants I have tried.",-1
5,"Just... wow.  
My tastes usually run a bit cheaper than this, but Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is something to be experienced.  The food is delicious and complicated.  The wine matches perfectly.  And the service is impeccable.  Like, ludicrously impeccable.  Watching the intricate way that the staff members weave around each other to keep the maximum number of people doting on the guests the entire time is almost as much fun as enjoying the meal itself.
This will very likely always be the most expensive meal I have ever eaten, but it was absolutely worth it.  Eating here is the perfect way to explore what real artists can do with food,and with the dining experience.",1
5,"Three Michelin stars since 2001 huh? 
They definitely deserve it. 
The wine list is extensive and detailed. Have fun with that if you're a connoisseur.
Impeccable service à la russe in an unassuming location, with 3 prix fixe menus to choose from. My cousin and I each had the menu prestige, and made slightly different choices to try to cover as much variety as possible. (see photos)
My favorite dish was the ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon. What really blew me away was the texture of the dish. It was perfectly folded and completely packed full of seafood. 
To keep it short, every dish was cooked exactly as described to perfection. The dishes are influenced by local flavors (you'll see it in the herbs, especially) so it is a good way to become intimate with that cuisine. 
The decor could have used a little help. The wood paneling on the walls makes me think they're getting ready to pack up and close shop. The seating is intimate, and we had a wonderful table right next to the window. 
The service itself from making the reservation to leaving the restaurant was beyond expectation. No detail is too small for their staff.",1
5,"Believe the reviews, it's wonderful . I was very impressed . Being that it is a Gordon restaurant you would think that it would be exceptional. It is expensive but worth it . All the courses were on point. My mother has not stop talking about her meal. The flavor presentation was out standing ! The service was perfect and the place is gorgeous .",1
5,"Lived up to expectations. The end. 
Just kidding, we had a great meal and experience. The staff, food, wine list and decor are 5 star.  They brought out a small starter to awaken the taste buds which was a truffle mouse in an egg shell.  My first Course was the lobster ravioli which was stuffed with delicious lobster meat and my husband had the homemade pasta dish w a frothy prosciutto sauce. For second course I had the lamb which prepared in a few different ways and my husband has the Red Deer Venison. Both were great...of course my lamb was the best! ;) For dessert we both had the cheese Course which came out on a large cart. It was glorious! We ended with coffee which they bring to everyone with some tasty little treats. 
I was so stuffed!! The wine list was all I could have hoped for too with plenty of Bordeaux to chose from! And they even took us on a tour of the kitchen! 
I highly recommend! Of course as a Michelin star restaurant be ready to pull out your wallet!",1
5,"Had a lovely meal of late with my partner and our 18 year old son - who had no idea about the experience of which he was to partake. The fare matched or exceeded the finest of our US dining experiences, including the French Laundry. Our son had a huge smile and his camera ready as each impeccably-served course was laid before him, including the apple gratin with caramel sauce for 2, which he polished off all on his own. We were prepared to splurge on a 'prestige' wine and were pleasantly surprised when the sommelier (1 of 3 on duty that night) helped us choose a reasonably priced and delicious Argentinian Carmenere. We typically prefer our meals a bit more rustic, but would count this in our top 3 meals of all time.",1
5,Excellent food and services. I ordered seasonal menu and the menu prestige. The pigeon and the dexter short rip are the mains and they are very very good.,1
5,"It really doesn't get any better. You really do get what you pay for here. The fois gras and sweetbreads were food heaven. I have no vocabulary to describe the Suckling pig. Crispy, sweet, the absolute essence of pork. Sublime. The caramelized Tarte Tatin with a glass of chilled Sauterne. It's really beyond words. Wonderful service, subdued atmosphere and not a hint of snobbery. In a class on its own.",1
5,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer, performance is the perfect description of the dining experience here.  I was really looking forward to this, I've been a Gordon Ramsay fan for a long time and couldn't leave London without experiencing this for myself.  As a matter of fact, I picked the dates for our visit to London based on the time I could get a reservation!
Our reservation was for 6pm, and our plan was to come a little early and start with a cocktail at the bar.  We accomplished this, except Restaurant Gordon Ramsay wasn't open when we arrived, so we found ourselves at Maize Grill also owned by Gordon Ramsay.  That was a great experience too, but back to this review.  
Everything at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is very precise. Every member of staff gives you a great deal of attention. The dining room itself is fairly small, it can't be easy to maneuver around room without running into each other, but they do a flawless job.  They don't quite stand by your table, but they politely guide you through the experience.  There were two sommeliers to make recommendations as well as to serve and explain the wine with each course.  
Even as efficient as the staff is our meal lasted three hours (and I was trying to go slowly!) This is the first Michelin stared restaurant I've ever been to and it sets the bar quite high for any experiences yet to come.",1
5,"Once we arrived in town we went to our hotel dropped off our bagged and took a Uber straight there.  We had the last reservation time for the afternoon service and you could not tell that it was the end of service.  We were treated like anyone else without any rush or hurry.  Service was excellent and white gloved.  Waiters, waitresses and head of the house was very informative, friendly and very knowledgeable of their food.   We had their seasonal menu.  Presentation of each course was absolutely a work of art! It broke my heart to eat them but once I took the first bite my heart mended and was filled with love and warmth of the chief's hard work.  
Being the last patron in the dinning room, we were invited by the manager to take a tour of the kitchen.  WOW! We were shocked on how many chef's were in there.  From entrees, pastry, and dishware section, it was such a delight to go into the kitchen and to be shown around.  Too bad that we didn't run into Gordon Ramsey but we were told that he does stop by often to cook and run service.  
The experience was a delight and I am truly honored to have eaten here.",1
5,"Wow.
Honestly, did you expect anything else? The volatile celebrity chef really does know what he's doing when it comes to restaurants. 
Easily the best dinner experience of my life.
Came here on a Monday evening with 2 other acquaintances visiting from Italy. Since we are all from America and only staying in Europe for short time, we figured we might as well treat ourselves to a extremely special dinner. 
The service was wonderful. The sommelier, instinctively telling that we were college students, gave my friends (I don't drink) a cheap but wonderful wine recommendation, which they eagerly accepted. The matire'd, apparently renowned in London for his welcoming nature, greeted us, asked where we were from, and genuinely seemed interested in a trio of kids that didn't seem to belong. 
All three of us got the tasting menu, The food was stunning. Everything was prepared incredibly carefully, and the presentation was a visual masterpiece. We couldn't help but to take pictures of the food, which I feared would make us stand out in a room of the mature and sophisticated. 
It started with a small collection of starters that included scotch eggs. Next camethe pressed Foie Gras, which had a smooth texture and sweet tartness to it due to the green apples.Then we moved onto the Isle of Gigha Halibut, which was presented with this ras el hanout infused broth. The flowers that laid atop the delicate fish were a delightful surprise, both visually and in flavor.
The Ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon is undeniably the star of the show, being one of the signature dishes. Easily the best ravioli I've ever had in my life, I was saddened when it so quickly disappeared off my plate. I eased the pain away by licking the delicious bisque that accompanied it.
Next were the Cotswold lamb, Mango Jasmine and passion fruit soup, Cucumber sorbet (which was used as a palate cleanser), and finally dessert with Lemonade parfait. The Lemonade parfait was truly an incredible way to finish off the meal. It was possibly the most beautifully extravagant concept for a dessert I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The transparent sauce that aligned the plate was especially delicious. 
After our meal, the matire'd actually invited us into the kitchen. We were eager to see Claire and thank her for the meal, but unfortunately she had left by the time we finished. The kitchen trip was a unique experience in its own right, as I have never seen the kitchen of a restaurant before, much less that of a 3-star Michelin one!
Afterwards, our maitre'd bid us farewell, wishing us a good night and safe travels back to our respective homes in the states. I was astonished he actually remembered all of our cities, but in retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised such an impressive man would be in charge of such an incredible restaurant.
It's been a few months since that night, but I still look back upon it with fondness. Hopefully one day I will be able to return to Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and enjoy another unforgettable meal.",1
5,"Gordon Ramsay is an amazing chef and his restaurants never fail to deliver a fantastic meal regardless of city. Although his restaurant within Trianon Palais Hotel in Paris is my favorite, I absolutely loved dinner here. The lemon parfait dessert was perfect icing on a five star dinner that was creative and full of delicious flavors. Service was five stars and flawless as expected.",1
5,"The lobster ravioli and suckling pig are culinary perfection. The ravioli was fresh and meet of the lobster was creamy, sweet, and perfectly cooked. The pig skin was the best I have ever had, ever. To get that texture takes a lot of experience and time. Great great dishes.
The compressed foie gras is complex. The texture and temperature were done perfectly but the dish came out underwhelming in taste and seasoning. With the garnishes it does bring the dish to a different level but I believe the foie gras should be able to stand by itself.
Staff was friendly and attends to the tables well. I had a tour of the kitchen and it's superb as you'd expect.",1
4,"I won't go into a lot of detail here, there are legions of other reviews for that.  The key points about my experience:
1.  The food was phenomenal
2. We were treated a little weirdly at times
Here's some detail on point 2: We are American, we are well versed in fine dining.  Does anyone come here who isn't?  You can't exactly walk in off the street or stumble into a reservation...  Anyway, the first weird thing was that we requested the wine pairings.  The pairing isn't like a typical tasting menu where there is a published price, they give you a range because they claim to select wines on a case by case basis after discussing likes and dislikes with you.  That's fine.  The weird thing was that when my husband told a server that we were interested in pairings, she asked us who was hosting the dinner.  We were perplexed, never having been asked that question before, there were only two of us (married couple).  After a painful few moments we discerned that she was asking who would be paying for dinner and then verified that we were okay with the range of prices that had been printed on the menu that we had *just* been perusing.  Yes, we ordered the pairings, we are prepared to pay within the listed price range.  The second weird thing was when we selected our chosen main course.  I ordered the pigeon (or squab as we yanks call it) and the server (I think the GM?) asked if I was fine with it being cooked med. rare.  I said yes, that is fine with me, that is how I prefer it.  It seemed as if he didn't quite believe me and then basically proceeded to try to talk me out of going with the chef's recommendation.  He said ""I don't know, are you sure?  It is served *quite pink*, we can cook it more for you if you prefer...""  I'm not sure what this was about, perhaps they've been burned by too many stupid Americans sending back a beautifully cooked dish to be cooked more?  Or I was just being profiled as a dumb woman who doesn't know anything?  I can't be sure.  Regardless, the squab was perfection and I ate every bite.  Perhaps this gentleman recognized that he'd misjudged us, he gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal, presumably to compensate for his somewhat poor behavior earlier in the meal.
Ultimately, the meal was fantastic, the food was fabulous and the weirdness didn't ruin it, but I thought it was notable, I've never been treated this way in such a highly regarded restaurant before.
Hopefully someone from the restaurant reads this so that they can take the feedback, but I have a feeling that management at establishments such as R GR don't give a hoot about yelp reviews...",1
5,"So we made reservations for two people six months ahead of time as that was how far out they were booked 
I had the Menu Prestige (£145) and my date had the Season Inspiration Menu (£195)- both choices were terrific in their own right. The evening started off with three little sets of complimentary dim sum-like gems from the kitchen. Each bite was exquisite and we saw that no two tables had quite the same complimentary gems to start. Good touch! 
The plates from Menu Prestige are as follows: 
1. Pressed foie gras, green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - This was good but it wasn't as good as the other dishes. 
2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel - This was easily the best savory dish from the whole set. It was just heavenly. 
3. Isle of Gigha halibut, Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth - The prettiest broth I have ever seen - it reminded me of colorful sakura blossoms drifting about on pond water. 
4. Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey, orange and sautéed foie gras (you can opt for the Cotswold lamb if you wanted to) - this was the main dish. They used every part of the pigeon and it was cooked to perfection. 
5. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Simple, wildly fragrant and not too sweet - it was perfect 
6. Green apple sorbet with chamomile and marigold - This dish had the most interesting presentation; you are given a mortar and pestle to pound away (gracefully of course) at the frozen herbs to be eaten with the green apple sorbet. Refreshing!
7. Lemonade parfait, honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet - The most amazing dessert presentation that I have ever seen. The honey had been crystallized to form a perfect centerpiece to complement the yogurt sorbet. 
After we were done with our dinner, we were invited back to see the magic in the kitchen. Amazing service and superior attention to detail from the whole staff. Best dinner experience in London.",1
5,"I appreciated the elegance of the lunch course, where the light and flavorful sauces really took the main ingredients to the next level.  I like it when chefs exhibit restraint and incorporate elements of authenticity and tradition; it shows true confidence in one's palate.
I was especially impressed with the hospitality by the very professional maitre d'.  We spoke some light French and enjoyed a tour of the kitchen.  Lunch was $285 for two.",1
4,"If one is to pay ~300 pp for a meal (that's how much the menu prestige will come to after london tax, tip, water, etc.) then this better dinner better knock your socks off.  I better walk away with something to remember, something deserving of praise, and something that will make me say...i will never be able to make that myself.  Well, the halibut in the lime and rose infused broth is to die for.  I spent a good minute just smelling, starring, and appreciating this work of art.  It was so beautiful, my heart cried a little as I carved into the masterpiece.  But then the joy was restored as a party ensued in my mouth.  Unforgettable. 
My party was the last to leave the restaurant and it was already past midnight, but we didn't feel rushed at all.  If every dinner was like this, I think I would die an extremely happy and round-bodied glutton.
The loss of a star is simply secondary to comparison with other 3 michelin star restaurants I've been to...gotta have some standard of comparison!  But this is like saying Tom Brady is a 4 star QB and Peyton Manning is 5 star QB (heehee...just wanted to stir some waters with that comment :)",1
4,"I had to try out a 3 michelin star restaurant so I picked Gordon Ramsay to be the place. 
{ABOUT}
- Booking: Online, I reserved less than a month in advance and I had no problem 
- Photos are only allowed on your phone (No DSLR's as it bothers the experience of the other patrons) 
- Dress: Smart Dress Code (jackets are preferred, shirt with a collar required for gentlemen, no T-shirts, shorts, sportswear, sneakers or trainers of any kind)
- Cancellation / No Show Fee: £150 /person if you don't cancel within 48 hours - so don't miss it. They will call you a few days ahead to confirm your reservation. 
{ATMOSPHERE}: 3/5 
- A tiny lovely little restaurant. From the outside, it looks so unsuspecting 
- It gets quiet noisy actually as the people fill in
{SERVICE}: 5/5
- One of the best, always someone to be folding your napkin when you go to the restroom or to help you out of the chair. 
- Staff was very welcoming and took the time to explain the menu to us commoners and give recommendations :p 
- They even took out my fish and showed me how it smelled before serving it to me all nicely plated 
{FOOD}: 4/5 ~ Everything was good and plated amazingly, but it was nothing impressive. My family ordered 3 courses off of the a la carte menu (£110 per person). They give you a bunch of entremets in between courses.  
[Appetizers] 
- Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel: Um it seriously looks like a giant wonton and taste like a wonton. I wasn't very impressed with this dish. The server told me it was one of their signature dishes that had been on the menu for 10+ years.
- Pan Fried Sea Scallops: Yum, the sauce was especially lovely. 
- Cornish Brown and King Crab with radishes, kombu, sesame and oyster emulsion: Similar to a crab salad? I kept thinking it looked like a imitation crab salad from a Japanese restaurant. But it tasted way better and was quite delicious
[Entree] 
- Roast Pigeon: Never tried pidgeon before and it was a intriguing experience. It's definitely something to try! I liked it very much and just taste a bit like duck.
- Cotswold Lamb: Definitely worth to get. The meat was so tender and great. 
- Cornish Turbot: Just amazing, the fish was so buttery and just melted in your mouth. They bring out the fish for you to see before they plate it and smelled wonderful.. 
- Filet of sea bass: was alright. 
[Dessert] 
- Souffle: a MUST get. This was the best dessert by far. The souffle was so poofy and tasted absolutely like a cloud. Just stunning. 
- Caramelised tarte Tatin of apples with tahitin vanilla ice cream: Just like a giant apple pie honestly. Two people have to order this but I thought it was too much for me to handle half so I just ended up eating the apples lol. 
- Caramel Milk Chocolate, praline and malt mousse with treacle granola and hazelnut milk: A very beautiful chocolate cake pretty much. Would recommend if you like taking photos of pretty food or chocolate desserts. 
Overall, the experience was quiet pleasant and nothing less expected from a 3 michelin star restaurant. However, I saw nothing special and unique about it.",1
5,"For being my very first restaurant in London and first 3 star Michelin restaurant. It. Did. Not. Disappoint.
The whole ""performance"" the waiters put on is just perfection. You can not find service like this in america. From the pulling out your chair, to a brand new glass/silverware with each plate, to sweeping the crumbs off your table because the pig you are. Every single dish I had was an eye opening shock. The combination of flavors were out of this world. I had a very late reservation so I was able to get a mini tour of the kitchen which makes you feel a little important. This place is a must if you're ever in London and are prepared to spend at least 350 pounds on yourself alone. 
treat yo self.",1
5,"Three Michelin stars does not disappoint!
My husband is a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and so when we were planning our trip to London we had to stop off and eat at one of his restaurants!
We planned the trip very last minute so we were not hopeful of getting a reservation. As everyone says, looks like you have to book months in advance to secure a table, we had weeks lol. I watched the opentable reservations like a hawk and managed to score a last minute lunch reservation for a Thursday!
Make sure you leave ample time to make your reservation as we had to call an uber to get over to the Chelsea area as there was a tube strike occurring. 
We made it on time and were seated at once. The service was impeccable. We were started off with a glass of champagne followed by our choose of butter and breads. There's one with bacon, a pretzel roll, and Irish soda bread. All the breads are delicious so you should have all of them and a lot of them as much as you can!!
Then comes the hard part, what to eat? We were really tempted to try the prestige menu which had 7 courses which is what the restaurant was known for but it was lunch time and we wanted to save room for more snacks and food as we explored London a little more. So we went with the 3 course lunch menu and added on wine pairings for our starters and mains. I had the agnolotti with fresh peas as a starter while my husband went for the steak tartare. My agnolotti pasta was soo good. The flavors were very delicate but had a lot of flavor! My husband looked happy with his steak tartare as well.
For the mains, I ordered the Cornish cod while my husband ordered the poussin. I loved all the flavors of the cod and loved the shiitake mushrooms. The poussin was cooked very well as well.
The funest part was the desserts. Not only were our desserts delicious, we got extra desserts as well! The white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls were served in a tin with dry ice so that was a fun effect! My favorite of the extra dessert with the peanut butter brittle. Soo good.
Yes it's worth the money to come here! The service and food here are all top notch! I'll be watching the dinner reservations on opentable to come back for the prestige menu!!!",1
3,"As many have mentioned, the restaurant is elegant with great service but unfortunately I was not super impressed with the food. I think my expectation was too high. 
We got the 7 courses menu. 
Pros: 
I thought the portions were just right. 
Great service! - but with one oops at the end by the biller. For some reason, she was unable to comprehend splitting the bill by 1/3 and 2/3. It took 3 tries to get it right. 
The food overall looked good and tasted decent. 
This was by far the most expensive chef choice I've tried so far likely because the pound is so expensive. For some reason, the food just did have enough wow factor for me. Definitely not bad food though. 
My favorite were the cucumber sorbet mixed in the mint, lemon verbena and burnet salad. Very creative and tasted refreshing. 
We also had:
Foie Gras with green apples, turnips watercress and smoked duck. - well prepared but did not leave a lasting memory in my palate. 
Lobster Ravioli - somewhat bland for my taste. 
Halibut with King Crab and lime, Cauliflower Cous-Cous and Ras el hangout infused broth - The broth compliment the halibut really well. The flavor was fresh. The fish was cook to perfection. The dish was also very pretty. I enjoyed this dish a lot. 
Cotswold Lamb with vegetable  
Bresse pigeon
- both decent but not memorable.
Good one time experience.",-1
5,"Had the opportunity to come here for Valentine's Day. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the world. Things to take note of is that this restaurant and it's staff/chefs are extremely well trained. The design of the restaurant is simple and elegant, allowing for the service and food to shine.
- The service staff is phenomenal. They are attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable. They seem to make it a priority to anticipate your needs. It is almost as if they can read your mind. Their timing and delivery of service is impeccable.
- The cooks/chefs have food put together and delivered in appropriate time. Every dish was always spot-on, well plated, eye catching, and of course delicious beyond words. Every item we received from the menu had obviously been very well thought out. Flavors worked/melded in a way that accented the ingredients used to develop a symphony of deliciousness. Though I enjoyed every dish, the one item that would consistently bring me back to the UK and this restaurant would definitely be their ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon in a light bisque with lemongrass and chervil velouté. That is bar none, one of the most wonderful things I have ever had. I was literally licking that plate clean. 
In my experience with all the restaurants that I have visited in the world, this is by far one of the front runners and very deserving of it's Michelin stars. The service is a dream and the food is so wonderful that I doubt even the magic of a unicorn and skilled fingers of Santa's elves could possibly make any better. Bravo Mr. Ramsay, bravo.",1
5,I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Life changing dining experience. Staff and food was exceptional. Highly recommend.,1
3,"Without question, the food here was great. And I say great, not AMAZING the way a three Michelin starred restaurant should be. They say that you should go out of your way and even travel to a country for a three star restaurant, but this food was more on par with the one stars I've been too. In fact, my favorite part of the meal was the dessert, a grapefruit custard with mascarpone sorbet. The main, roast venison, was quite well-prepared but nothing to write home about. It was not impressive. The service, too, was quite rude. My group of 6 was not treated the same as the other clients, as we were obviously half the age as everyone and were from America. We were not seated immediately because our last party member was not there yet, but another group after us was seated immediately even though they said they were waiting for someone as well. What's more, our friend was made to change into leggings from her jeans, which is totally acceptable given their dress code, but then we saw another woman with shorts on who had not been made to change. Additionally, the host kept on asking us if we knew what tartare and venison were and asked us to tell him what it was just to make sure we knew... if we didn't know, would we be there ordering it? Overall quite disappointed by the incongruence between price and taste as well as the rudeness of the service.",-1
5,"It was an unbelievable experience ! From the moment you walk in , it feels different ! Everybody is so attentive to you . The food ? Every dish was just a little masterpiece ! Every flavor , every new dish just create fireworks in your mouth . Me and my boyfriend had prestige menu , it let's you try more for a very good deal . We had an amazing time !",1
4,"Being a foodie, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is definitely on my bucket list. Having gone to most of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in the Bay Area (aside from Manresa at the time of writing), I was looking forward to trying out this place on my visit to London. We came during lunch time (they open their reservation MONTHS in advance, and at 4 months before, I was only able to grab lunch spots). Their menu availability is the same for lunch and dinner, in addition to a lunch special menu that they only offer during lunch time. My boyfriend and I went a la carte during our meal. As always, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and I decided to go with the option that lets you try every dessert they have. I didn't realized how big their portion sizes are, so by the time dessert came, I was already way too full. I got the foie gras for appetizer and fish for entree. They're definitely more of a ""traditional"" fine cuisine place. So if you're into traditional French cuisine such as The French Laundry, this is your place. My boyfriend and I prefer more adventurous takes on cuisine (our favorite is Benu in SF), so the food here is a bit boring. But don't get me wrong, the food was amazing and perfectly prepared!",1
5,"This was a fantastic dining experience on my recent honeymoon. We booked a table months in advance and it did not disappoint. I will say that the restaurant was smaller than I thought it was.
My husband and I both had the menu prestige. I was wonderfully surprised when my husband actually liked the foie gras! (He tries to be adventurous.) His favorite was the lobster and langosteen ravioli and mine was too. The lemon sorbet dessert was also to die for!
The service here is top notch and I would have expected nothing less. The bathrooms here are unisex, which is unexpected. So the moment you stand up, there's always someone who spots you and walks to you the bathroom. Bread plates were always full and glasses were too. The staff were definitely not sleeping on the job!
Lastly, we got to tour the kitchen! The Matre'D was very nice and brought us in. Great touch to the perfect night!",1
5,Best food even and all the money was worth it I hope it gets the full 5 stars. Also the location was perfect and at the perfect time to go to the restaurant.!! Hope I can go again,1
5,"Gordon Ramsay creates the most unsurpassed French cuisine in London's culinary scene.
For some, the word ""London"" spawns images of famous monuments like Big Ben, the London Eye, and Buckingham Palace. Others imagine the cabbies, fashion, and pub scene. 
But hardly anyone can attest that London is known for delicious food. The statement itself is an oxymoron.
Until you try Gordon Ramsay's in Chelsea.
I have been a huge GR fan since the first season of Hell's Kitchen. Attending a live dinner service is on my bucket list just to try a dollop of his award-winning sauces. And even though Gordon may have his anger management issues on the show, the man can cook. Then I realized, what am I waiting for?? I should just come to him! So I did...
But don't take my word for it. Ask Michelin. Gordon Ramsay is a recipient of three prestigious Michelin Stars, the highest accolade one can receive by the Michelin brothers. 
The Michelin guide began in 1900 as a handy-dandy manual for those traveling within Europe for reliable gas stations, eateries, and service tips. In 1933, it launched its Red Guide that inspected restaurants all around Europe under the highest caliber of secrecy and standards. The inspectors to this day are anonymous (even the parents don't know their line of work), and the secret diners are funded by the Michelin company, not the restaurant. 
The grading scale is 1 to 3 stars: One being good in its category, two being excellent and worth a detour, and three being exceptional and worth a journey in itself. The Michelin grading system has received worldwide respect and to date, less than 100 restaurants around the globe have been bequeathed with the 3-star honor.
With that said, I was beyond excited to try this place. I had booked my reservation at least four months before I set foot in London. Service was spot-on with our waiter epitomizing the perfect blend of cordialness and humor. He grew up in Dijon (France) and was extremely passionate about the menu. My bf and I ordered the Prestige Menu and the Seasonal Inspirations Course. 
Each seven-course dish was impeccably crafted and presented. The poached lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli held remarkable flavor. My foie gras was embedded with the sweet juice of duck confit and pickled pears. The next protein courses were the halibut and suckling pig with crispy skin that I could have nibbled on the entire evening. After the soup, cheese and fruit course, we were pretty stuffed. But lo and behold, the desserts shined brightest for us. 
One was a Milk Chocolate Truffle Tree. This literally was a silver tree stand with truffle-infused chocolates awaiting our degustation delights. Like Ancient Romans plucking grapes off one-by-one, we fed each other these signatures confections with smiles and laughs. The second dessert was a White Chocolate and Strawberry Ice Cream platter on dry ice. As if that wasn't enough, the best was yet to come.
The most memorable part of this experience was being secretly escorted ""behind the scenes"" to the kitchen where all the magic happens. When the manager found out that we had visited all the way from Hawaii, they asked if we'd like to see the chefs at work. Unfortunately, Chef Gordon himself was in New York but Chef Patron Clare Smyth (Chef of the Year winner by UK Food Guide and the only female UK Chef to win 3 Michelin Stars) was leading the team, mastering the finishing touches on every dish sent out. Their kitchen was absolutely spotless, and every member of the kitchen was working harmoniously like instruments perfecting the tunes before it hit the audience's ears.
I still remember the tray of mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup about to be served to the dining room, poised in a champagne flute and glass straw. Chef Clare stopped the waiter and placed a drop of sugar water on the end of each straw to ensure it was perfectly presented in taste and vision. 
This experience took my breath away and we talk about it every so often when we relive our European getaways. I look forward to meeting Chef Gordon in person one day to express my gratitude to him and his staff for a lifetime of delicious memories.",1
5,"The easiest five-star given.
The service was impeccable (be forewarned, lots of superlative adjective will be thrown out in this review). From the greetings to the last gesture when we were leaving, the service was not too much or on your face. The maitre d, knowing we were tourist, chatted with us a bit, sharing his story too. It was a nice touch. My glass of water was never empty for more than 8 seconds, it was that attentive. All were professional and friendly, definitely the true definition of dining service. 
The food was too perfect, every single bite was memorable and if only I could keep the sensation in a jar and savor the moment again and again. We ordered the 3 course dinner menu, and let me tell you outright, the amuse bouche were as good, and some were even better than the 3 course menu. My personal favorite is this white egg, potato soup and truffle serve in an egg shell. I did not know it was a potato until I asked (I guess I missed their explanation at the start, probably admiring their accent too much). And also this strawberry ice cream dessert something. 
I had the lobster ravioli for appetizer and it was super juicy and easily be my second favorite. My friend ordered the foie gras. We ordered pigeon and suckling pig for entree and then we opted for the all-dessert menu. I would run out of vocabulary to describe all the food here and will sound repetitive because every description will entail the word ""excellent, perfect, outstanding, impeccable, splendid and unmatched"". 
A true and special dining experience.",1
5,The best dinner I have ever had.  The food was impeccable.  The service was perfect.  The staff were very friendly and always around to make sure your glass was never empty and/or if you needed anything.  It's not a cheap dinner but it is absolutely worth it.  I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in London.,1
3,"Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a 3 Michelin Starred Restaurant in a quiet area of London. I unfortunately made the same mistake of booking a very late reservation (the only one available a few weeks ago) and sure enough, this was not as great of an overall experience as I'd hoped. Made the same mistake of booking 9:30 PM reservations at three other NYC 3 Michelin Star restaurants (Le Bernadin, Jean Georges and Daniel before it lost a star) and all of them were just OK to me - nothing special whatsoever. You would think that a restaurant is responsible for quality no matter what the time but I'm finding that this just isn't the case consistently. 
When it comes to high end ""French"" restaurants, you hold a very high standard to how every dish is prepared and that the flavors of the courses are that which you only find at that restaurant in the entire world. Other Yelpers had a great experience but again, I'm assuming that the late reservation impacted our total experience completely. 
My girlfriend and I entered and were walked to our table in the very minimalistic yet cozy dining room. Most of the tables were filled but I can presume that since it was already 9:30 PM, some diners already finished their dinner.
You have the option of an a la carte, a traditional Prestige menu or a ""Seasonal Inspiration"" menu. What is cool is that you aren't obligated to order one menu per table so my girlfriend requested the Prestige and I did the Seasonal.
The Seasonal one:
1) Poached Langoustine with caviar and celery - Surprisingly very fishy and did not taste at all fresh. Did not finish.
2) Linguine with black truffle and mushroom - Excellent!!
3) Dover sole - Another fishy flavor unfortunately. Did not finish.
4) Roasted loin of Highland Venison - The gamiest venison I've ever eaten at any Michelin Star restaurant.
5) Vacherin Fondue - So good!!!! A very great flavor on a traditional cheese fondue.
6) Lime Sorbet with shiso and coconut mousse - Pretty good but not memorable
7) Clementine Parfait with orange mint and lemon thyme - Pretty good but not memorable
The Prestige menu:
1) Pressed Foie Gras with green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - Enjoyed
2) Ravioli with lobster, langoustine, salmon, oxalis and wood sorrel - Again felt was fishy but she enjoyed
3) Poached isle of Gigha halibut - Alright but not memorable
4) Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey and blood orange - GAMEY
5) Soup with mango, jasmine and passion fruit - Good
6) Sorbet with green apple, chamomile and marigold - Alright but not memorable
7) Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt - Very good
They ended the meal with pretty cool white chocolates (I believe) that came out in a very smokey box. 
Service was impeccable for sure. The food and experience were just not my taste compared to every other 3 Star around the world - the fish were fishy tasting and the meats were gamey and difficult to cut and eat (not cooked all that well).
Also not a fan that they didn't leave us with any takeaway, not even a takeaway menu of the experience. :( 
DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING LATE NIGHT RESERVATIONS!!",-1
5,"Easily the best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. 
The whole experience is exactly what you'd expect from a three Michelin star establishment.
The setting is beautiful and with only only 12 or so tables very exclusive so book well ahead. Chef Patron Clare Smythe is absolutely brilliant at the helm, her dishes interesting, delicious and beautifully presented. 
The Maître D' Jean Claude is extremely attentive, knows every dish, and gives you the full explanation upon its arrival. The staff are excellent, always there when you need them, while never hovering or interrupting. All of the staff make you feel extremely welcome. 
Jean Claude asked if we would like to see the kitchen and meet the Chef before we left which we did. Clare was also very welcoming. The kitchen was very well organized, and probably the cleanest I've ever seen.
I had the pressed foie gras, braised confit and roasted Herdwick lamb and Lemon soufflé. The wine selection is excellent and they add nice touches between courses of little complementary tasting dishes from the Chef. One of which after desert and before coffee were handmade ice cream sweets in white chocolate shells served in liquid nitrogen. 
The prices are very reasonable for the experience you get and well worth paying. I'll definitely be back.",1
4,Classic and modern. I've been there for the first time and I loved it. The wine list and the food are exceptional. Next time I would like to taste something good from their vegetarian menu.,1
3,"Gordon Ramsey was absolutely delightful. Maitre d' Jean Claude immediately came to our table.  He was the perfect host to us and the other diners that was joining me.
I enjoyed every dish  that came out. My favorite dish was the ravioli of lobster But don't get me wrong the service was amazing. I expected a little more for a 3 Michelin star restaurant i will defiantly return",-1
5,"It's a very small dining area with about 8-9 small tables at the most. I came in for lunch because all the dinner reservations were booked in advance, but either way, you can still order the 9 course meal during the lunch hours too.
Unfortunately, I had another 9 course meal waiting for me that evening so I just settled with their 3 course lunch menu. It was cheaper too at only  £45. And even with the 3 course meal, it still fills you up. Because you actually get more than 3 courses. It just keeps coming and coming.
I was even entertained by Jean-Claude, the maitre d' of Gordon Ramsay who gave me a book to read while I was waiting for my meal. And he also gave me a tour of the kitchen and got my menu signed by Clare Smith, the head chef of Gordon Ramsay.
I realize now why dinner reservations book up so quick. I really enjoyed my time here and when I come back to London, I'll make it a top priority to come back and this time to try out their ""Menu Prestige."" 
Job well done there, job well done.

4,"One expensive meal. Had the menu prestige with all oh chefs original masterpiece.  The sequence on how the food was served was great it really gave good balance. There are dishes that are not that good, but one can only satisfies someone so much.  The king crab halibut was bomb the aroma of the broth that was poured on top of it gave it a very balance feel, I'm not big cooked fish fan...I'm not sure if they cooked the halibut more mushy to blend with the consistency of the king crab. Main course was the lamb served in 5 ways (can be a bit gamey for some) but prepared right in my opinion with the different cuts. Cucumber sorbet was bomb. Overall the service was the best I've had out of all the Michelin star chef choice restaurants. At the end of the meal even visited the kitchen. If only the bill clerk knows her math than I would say the service is as flawless as it can be",1
5,"My wife and I are so lucky to have had this experience.  We had the perfect lunch.  On a scale of 1 to 5, it was a solid 10!
We were greeted warmly and taken to a great table in a relatively small restaurant--and a place they do not strive to turn their tables.
Maitre d' Jean Claude immediately came to our table.  He was the perfect host to us and the other diners at this sold out service.
Head Sommelier Jan was flawless as he helped Nancy select a wine that was just right for her.  She sampled several as he narrowed down to the target wine.  It must have been over the top, as she had 4 glasses of it.
Words cannot describe the seasonal tasting menu prepared by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.  The food was delicious and plated so beautifully.  This was their first day back following a long Christmas holiday.  She and her staff did not miss a beat.
The manager for the front of the house left about 6 months ago and his assistant has been promoted to manager.  He was absolutely delightful and his staff took excellent care of us all day.
On a sad/happy note--Chef Smyth will soon be moving on to captain her own restaurant.  We we fortunate enough to be able to catch her for a brief moment to wish her well and assure her that we would find and support her new endeavor.
Any who follows Chef Ramsay must see how he supports women in their efforts to achieve greatness.  This is a prime example of just that.  I hope Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In organization is taking note and giving credit to this fine man and great mentor.",1
5,"Michelin Three-Starred, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, London. This is Gordon's very first restaurant opened in 1998. In 2001 it was awarded the three michelin star restaurant. There are two three michelin star in London: 1. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay 2. Fat Duck. This is the only three michelin star restaurant in London at the moment since the ""Fat Duck"" has been closed down for its renovation. Hence booking a spot for lunch or dinner is very difficult for even some celebrities and politicians. This was probably one of the best three michelin star restaurant I have dined. Purely elegant, service was excellent, I would like to dine here again in the future.",1
4,"Everybody knows it, lovers and haters. In two words, Gordon Ramsay. And this is his flagship restaurant. Here you do not dine out, this is a food experience, this is a culinary trip. You don't get here by chance, and every single dish, every single instant will be stuck in your mind for a long time. But yet, small imperfections caused the lack of the ""top quality seal"" approval (yes we have a seal!) from me and my lovely lady.
As soon as we entered here we got the feeling this was a place like no others. The cure for details is maniacal, from the door to the tables. But here we also started to notice the first issues: the place is quite small, as it should be, but it's rather busy: we were lucky in receiving a table on the wall, but a couple in front of us (really, at less than 1 m with the corridor for waiters in between) was right in the middle of the hall, something completely uncomfortable giving the amount of tables on the wall. It seemed to me they really pushed their capacity over the limit, and that's a serious error.
But as we said, the decor both of the place and on the wall is incredibly refined and classy. Quite minimalistic in the style, it has several little classy touches both me and my lady love. Incredible.
The waiters were nice and warming, very accommodating (even too much perhaps, given that we were on a romantic dinner) and they spoke to us in several languages. But from the other side, some of the waiters lacked in appearance, with a wrong make up messed-up hairs. Something you don't want to find in a three stars restaurant.
But then, let's speak about the main reason we get there, the food! First time we came here, we wanted to try all the classical dishes the restaurant is acclaimed for, so here we go with the tasting menu. We chose a half bottle in order to get something a little bit more special, and we received the service we expected considering the age and the caliber of the wine, candle, decanter and so on.
At first I prepared an awesome review with every single dish carefully described, but the maximum size of 5000 words on yelp is really too much for me. Hence, I just want to speak to you about two dishes, my personal favourite ones.
The first one is a dish I waited for years: ""Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon"". Wow. Already the name is something to blow up your mind, putting together the sweetness of the lobster, the delicacy of the langoustine and the heavy and powerful taste of salmon. And the result is so good it can't be described, you need to taste it. Served with a delicious bisque with sorrel giving that extra citric needle, it's just one of the best things I ever tasted in my life. A dish so delicious they should name a star with its name.
The second one is another famous masterpiece for Gordon Ramsay restaurant: Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth.
Now, let's start from the beginning: presentation is ridiculously perfect: the dish comes with the halibut and the crab on top, and they proceed to serve the broth (at room temperature) all around the halibut (like they do with the bisque and the ravioli). The difference is that the broth is liquid, transparent and with flower petals and the composition of the dish rapidly becomes a painting. A wonderful painting, relaxing and intriguing. And the broth, oh my the broth. Incredible, powerful, with 4 thousands flavor all balanced between each other, it's like a Kandinsky frame on your mouth (yes keep going with art paragons!), you can always feel something different and something new, evolving and moving, but the big picture, the big screen is always appealing and entertaining. This dish alone deserves a dinner here. Full stop. If you don't like such a perfect combination of taste, smell, sight I don't even want to be a friend of yours on yelp. And I'm serious.
It's painful not to speak about every other dish, as every single plate on our table was a piece of art, even the ones we didn't like, but each one had a history and was perfectly concepted and realized. It's amazing.
Unfortunately, as every adventure, we had to end our trip. We started good, we had some initial issues, we had some awesome surprise and we reached home safely. All in all it's a wonderful dining experience, but because of some strange errors I found it does not deserves the 5 stars. Not now, not this time.",1
4,"Went to Gordon Ramsay to celebrate my birthday. When you make a reservation they take your credit card right away and warn you that they will charge you if you don't show up (100 GBP per person?). 
The service staff is phenomenal, super nice and super attentive all the time (3-michelin star alright). Food was also very good but to be honest I had better in places with fewer michelin starts (Kitchen W8). 
All in all, we had a very pleasant evening but expected more for what we paid.",1
5,"Went here for one of my most memorable birthdays and thoroughly loved it! The food was very good as was the service. If you're looking to get bottles though, just be careful as some go for well over a thousand quid. I would recommend going with a couple of people so that everyone can try a few different dishes.",1
5,"I loved Gordon Ramsay, even though I was seated next to a loud Chinese party of ten. If it weren't for the attentive service, that could potentially have ruined my night. The restaurant is very intimate, so you'll see how that could have been distracting. 
I was stuffed by the end of the Seasonal Inspiration Menu. The server was extra generous with the truffles, but I can't say I preferred the overall experience to Petrus, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Try both and see for yourself!",1
4,"Service at Restaurant Gordon Ramsey was perfection. The dining room is cozy and intimate with an abundance of staff operating a quiet symphony. The maître d' was so friendly and made his rounds multiple times to every table. He even provided a kitchen tour at the end of our meal.
We had dined at another Ramsey restaurant a couple days prior and we were very excited to hear they also were serving the white truffle linguine here. We absolutely loved it at Petrus and could not imagine the dish tasting any better. Somehow the one created here was better!
I am a sucker for souffles and get excited when the flavors are more interesting than chocolate or grand marnier. It was heavenly and had some shredded coconut around the top crust.
White truffle linguine with cep mushrooms and aged parmesan
Soft cooked egg ravioli

Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, spiced shoulder sausage, chou farci with crushed potatoes and spring onions 
Coconut soufflé with mandarin and lime sorbet",1
5,"Outstanding in every respect. As we were visiting from the USA, I had made reservations online for the 4 of us and the restaurant called the week before to confirm the time. It was nice to speak someone prior to our arrival and let them know how much we were looking forward to the meal. I knew it was going to be expensive and wondered if it would live up to the expectations and it way exceeded them. Jean-Claude the maître de was phenomenal. The service was impeccable, he regularly checked back on us without being intrusive. The other wait staff were polished and smooth throughout the service.
The food was the best that I have ever had, every course beautifully presented. The taste out of this world, the menu descriptions do not do justice to the taste on your tongue.
At the end we were shown the kitchen; smaller than I expected and was able to thank Claire for a most wonderful experience.
I think it speaks volumes that although Gordon is hardly ever there, his high standards are maintained.
Once in a lifetime experience, wish I could do it again",1
5,"The wife and I managed to secure a booking on very short notice and after a quick trip on the tube and a short walk past the home of the Chelsea Pensioners (fun!), we arrived at the unobtrusive door of Gordon Ramsay. One look at the tiny dining room (with 30 seats, tops) and the large number of servers (about 10, by my count) told us that we would be in for a pampering.
And it was. What a feast for the senses! We both ordered the Menu Prestige prix free menu and a lovely bottle of chinon to go with it (recommended by the friendly sommelier who also suggested that my wife pick up a pair of Hunter wellingtons to make our trip extra-British). 
Every dish was thoughtfully prepared and engaging to all the senses. We were invited to smell the sauces before they were poured. The dishes themselves were works of art and tasted like heaven. Some dishes delved slightly into molecular gastronomy- honey that crunched and bread that literally melted in your mouth. The sight of the squad of waitstaff moving through the dining room with poise and precision fascinated everyone. And the invitation to walk through the kitchen was so thoughtful.
Sure, we blew a good chunk of change on this place, but it was worth every penny. We left excited, full (which always surprises me at places like this), and invigorated.",1
5,"I was so anticipating this visit as one of the highlights of my London trip that I was worried I would end up disappointed. Not so.
The restaurant's atmosphere was pure understated elegance. I was slightly intimidated walking down the long entrance hallway, but that feeling mostly faded as the friendly staff guided my mom, sister and I past the waiting space and into the single-room dining area. It was surprisingly unassuming, filled with soft beiges and mauves. Throughout the meal the servers were warm, helpful and professional--the only hiccup came when my sister's turbot arrived a bit too early and had to make a brief retreat.
Now for the food. The meal began with three tiny, unexpected hors d'oeuvres: a fluffy little parmesan dumpling (good), a cheesy, crunchy ball topped with salty iberico ham (excellent) and a seaweed-wrapped, sashimi-like cured salmon (excellent). The next surprise item was a bright green ricotta dish, beautifully plated with fresh vegetables (tangy and salty, every bite slightly different).
Then the appetizers: I was a served a single giant lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli, surrounded with a wood sorrel sauce (also bright green). It had a balanced, hearty seafood flavor, and the savory wood sorrel was oddly addictive. My dining partners both had the scallops--I'm not normally a fan, but these were probably the best I've tasted. They came with two sauces: a nice sweet apple-based one and another (even better) that was concentrated with walnut flavor.
Entrees: My sister had the turbot with greens and an unidentified vegetable (sea beet?)--nicely seasoned and meaty, but not really a standout. My mom and I had pork five ways. The chou farci (stuffed cabbage) was my least favorite, salty but otherwise unexciting. (There was also a smidge of applesauce that I tried but mostly avoided.) The sausage was also slightly disappointing, but still well-spiced and quite decent. The loin was elevated by some slightly acidic potatoes and bite of thin, perfectly crisp bacon. The suckling pig was tender and flavorful, accented by sweet bit of pineapple...
...And then there was pork belly. Oh, the pork belly. This razor-thin rectangle of salty, fatty goodness was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The brilliance of it was the contrast in textures: immaculately crispy on the top layer, melt-in-your-mouth tender on the bottom. It came with two preparations of apple--one baked, one fresh and thin-sliced. It was good with them, it was good without them. It was just good.
Another intermission: a sweet, brightly flavored mango-passion fruit beverage that was a lovely pre-dessert palate cleanser. We split our three desserts evenly between us. The peppermint souffle was immensely fluffy--so much so that it was essentially a minty egg foam. A bit strange, but better with the chocolate sorbet (which there should've been more of). The chocolate, praline mousse and granola dish was very nice, possibly the best of the three and a nice mix of sweet and pleasantly bitter. The lemonade parfait was easily the most interesting one, jam-packed with sweet and sour flavor. It came with a beautifully spun honey tuile ring, a creamy sheep's milk sorbet and a tangy bergamot gel.
Finally, three more mini-surprises. The elderflower Turkish delight was an appropriately floral gelatin treat. The thin wafers of chocolate peanut brittle were nothing very unusual, but delicious with a balanced sweet-saltiness. The white-chocolate-dipped morsels of strawberry ice cream, immersed in dry ice fog for maximum effect, were a memorable end to a spectacular dinner.
My meal here was delicious and inventive, with several hits and only a couple of partial misses. I would love to make a return pilgrimage someday and try their even more elaborate ""prestige"" or ""seasonal inspiration"" menus. I'll look back on this dinner with fondness for a long time to come.",1
1,"Although the food was exquisite, the service, unfortunately, was not. 
I had lunch at the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant on Nov 4. I showed up and was charged 200 pounds directly to my lunch meal. I understand the importance of no-show fees, but here's what was wrong. 
- 2 people in our party of 4 couldn't come, and my friend had called a week in advance to change the party size (the restaurant requires 48 hrs advance notice)...only, the restaurant didn't actually change our party size. 
- The people who showed up (myself and a friend) were charged 100 pounds/person for the people who didn't show, even though I wasn't liable for the reservation. My friend who couldn't come had made the reservation, and the charge should've gone to the card on file for the reservation (her card).
- Gordon Ramsay restaurant has conflicting ""no-show/cancellation"" policies on their OpenTable home page, their website, OpenTable confirmation email, and information relayed by the restaurant representative. Only the person making the reservation on OpenTable had access to the ""accurate"" policy -- which apparently is that the party size has to be successfully changed. Notifying the restaurant isn't enough.
- Also note, the per person no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch menu is only 65 pounds per person.
During the actual dining experience, the manager stopped by all tables except ours, and I was told to contact the restaurant via email. 
It then took 10+ emails for the manager to admit that Gordon Ramsay should've charged the card on file. Turns out, he didn't charge the card on file because the process is longer and more complicated (he has to go through an account executive at the main office). Regretfully, the manager didn't realize that as he cut some corners on the correct process and charged the fee directly to the meal of people who did show up, my dining experience was negatively affected. I still have yet to receive an apology for the miscommunication from Gordon Ramsay and the way in which the no-show fees were handled. 
  
So here is my sad, but quick tip to you: 
- If your complete party can't make it, order the lunch set menu for the ""invisible people"" in your party. You'll save 35 pounds per person. The no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch set menu is only 65 pounds.",-1
3,"The dining experience at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay's London Mother Ship is wonderful, memorable, elegant and unparalleled in service.  The servers are all good looking in their formal attire, and friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and professional to boot!
We chose the 7-course Prestige tasting menu, and along with 2 extra chef ""surprises"", took 3 hours to complete.  The interior is cozy and elegant in dove gray, muted whites and crystal, so it is a soothing place in which to spend lots of time savoring the atmosphere and food presentation.
And it is all about the presentation.  Each dish was uniquely creative, sometimes with surprising ingredient pairings.  Each plate is a visual masterpiece, which led to much speculation about how they actually do it!  Razor thin slices of baby vegetables and roasted shallots dressed the foie gras with amazing grace.  This could be said of every single plate in this menu, which contains many of the restaurant's signature dishes.
But here comes my inner comment:  the food mostly looked  better than it actually tasted.  A small square of poached fish surrounded by delicate flower petals and broth was-- bleh.  A beautiful mousse of egg white, potato and toasted truffle served in an almost-whole egg shell was -- hard to swallow.  It's like deliciousness was sacrificed for artistic merit.  I almost feel like it's The Emperor's New Clothes, where everyone is so busy oooohhing and ahhhhing and being devoted foodies that they have not stopped to taste the food and admit that this was not the best meal they ever had.  
Having said that, I'll run and hide from all the rotten tomatoes that will be thrown at me.  
Signed,
Desperately Seeking Umami",-1
5,"The two-hour meal I savored during my first trip to London in early July ranks as the best belated birthday present I have ever received. My father and stepmother treated me to a lunch I will remember for the rest of my life.
The petite dining room features a mere 14 tables, yet it packs enough charm and splendor to fill a big box store. Never attempt to eat here sans a reservation. Secure a spot at least one week in advance just to be safe. My sister, who lives in London, placed a call almost a month prior to our visit.
Gordon Ramsay's posh flagship on Royal Hospital Road employs enough wait staff to allow each member to serve a specific course. Another paramount consideration: This is not a fast-food, dash-in and dash-out establishment. A leisurely, glacial pace of food consumption is essential if you want to appreciate the myriad flavors married by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.
We ordered from the lunch menu and elected for the three-course option, which costs 55 pounds per head. As the five-star rating should indicate, not one pound of the exorbitant bill was wasted.
The extravagant cuisine adventure commenced with a complimentary consomme. The made-from-rich-flavored stock was drinkable, with baby radishes, heirloom tomatoes and chives delicately assembled in the center of the bowl. I did not leave a trace of this delightful opener on the plate.
I opted to start with the roasted quail with soy honey, togorashi, pickled vegetables and herbs. The house-made soy sauce and dijon mustard rim delivered a perfect accompaniment for the two wing cuts of soft roasted bird. I cannot remember enjoying another quail dish more than this.
Next, I selected the roasted rabbit loin with Bayonne ham, salted baked turnips, toasted hazelnuts and pickled mustard seed. The exquisite presentation of this and every other dish served at the restaurant merits museum enshrinement. The many components at work on the wide plate bonded beautifully. The mustard seed and savory sauce enhanced the wonders of each diminutive bite.
Throughout the afternoon, one wait staff member offered three different breads paired with finely sculpted salted and unsalted butter towers. The onion bacon brioche ranked as my favorite.
For my last official course, dessert, I chose the chocolate bars with toasted milk mousse and tonka bean ice cream. As much as I love caramel popcorn, I would not have pictured it as a sinful ally in a gourmet dessert dish. Each bite of popcorn with a splash of the milk mousse was even better than the previous one. The caramel, dark and milk chocolate bars melted in my mouth. You can't buy candy this delectable at a convenience store.
Patrons also receive a complimentary dessert tray with four ice cream balls served in a bowl of steaming dry ice plus two lemon Turkish delights and two chocolate ganache squares.
The championship clincher of this five-star experience: Waiters had eavesdropped on our table during an earlier birthday toast and brought me a sixth course, a miniature but wicked chocolate-hazelnut cake complete with a candle. That they nailed my favorite sweet combination, most often referred to as Nutella or Bacio, has to be the greatest instance of dumb luck ever. Wow!
Wait at least one minute after receiving each dish because servers tend to return in a few moments with extra goodies and garnishes for your selected item.

Undeniably a caricature of his own creation, and perhaps nowhere more than back home in Las Vegas where his most highly regarded restaurant flaunts ""a fury for flavor,"" it was with a cautious sort of optimism that I approached Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and thankfully sparred from any semblance of shtick nearly every moment of my three hour lunch would prove a delight.  Still Ramsay in name but maintaining three stars from Michelin under the direction of Clare Smyth as each of 45 seats are pampered by formal yet friendly service amidst an art deco décor bathed in white it obviously comes as no surprise that a visit to Royal Hospital Road proves a far more elegant experience than fans of the Scottish chef's celebrity might expect and although some may call the cuisine a touch too 'safe' I prefer the term precise, not a single element of the ""Menu Prestige"" out of place as a parade of ornate plates shined bright.  Admittedly not the best way to showcase Chef Smyth's skills yet at the same time far more broad in scope than the shorter prix-fixe it was of several Ramsay signatures that my meal comprised and with courses such as the tender ravioli and delicate halibut every bit deserving of their legendary status served alongside Milliat nectars, a top tier bread program paired to Bordier, plus a cheese cart rich in selections from Antony not a single detail seemed overlooked.  Delving into a few modernist flairs as the meal transitioned to sweets it was only here that I diverged from the ""Prestige"" path and although commanding a £20 premium the Assisette de l'Aubergine was every bit worth the price - a trio of the restaurant's daily desserts paired with an individual portion of the restaurant's signature tarte and capped by a full sized soufflé, itself bearing a £20 tag if ordered a la carte.  Beleaguered by some due to its namesake's antics but every bit worth its celebrated status suffice it to say that whether Chef Ramsay himself has cooked on Hospital Road recently is irrelevant, the kitchen remains in good hands while the front of house flows with an effortless affability far too infrequently seen amongst Europe's mostly highly ranked.",1
5,"Absolutely astounding.
My wife and I visited this restaurant as our last stop on our 2 week vacation to London.
Amazing service and amazing food.  Drinks were always topped up, food was prepared to perfection, and the servers were easily the most attentive and informed we've ever encountered.
Worth every penny.",1
5,"A real 5 star yelp experience for a 3 Michelin star establishment.
Starting with the friendly welcome from the doorman and the greeting from the staff, we were shown to our table, a snug table in a comfortable, relaxed dining room that was both luxurious and slightly understated which created an exclusive yet completely unstuffy vibe.
We started with champagne, of course, served from a magnum bottle, several varieties on offer in ascending price.
The wine menu weighs as much as an encyclopedia. The sommelier came over to discuss the style of wine we were looking for. Her reco was spot on.
The starter of scallops with apples and walnuts was perfect.
For mains I chose the suckling pig cooked four ways.
Desert choice was chocolate cylinder with ginger mousse.
Each course was perfectly presented and composed with winning taste combinations. I could have been happy with any of the dishes on the menu and making a choice was hard. Fish & seafood seems to be a particular standout here so maybe I should have opted for a fish main course also. The dishes are sophisticated expertly created yet the menu descriptions are straightforward. I like that lack of pretension.
A good variety of interesting of amuse bouches added more excitement between courses and the Maitre D' stopped by for a chat. A nice touch which just added to the overall pleasant and relaxed ambience.
Every member of the staff excelled and the whole meal was so well coordinated it was perfection.
A special dining experience that I would love to repeat again. A key metric for me is value for money but that doesn't mean everything has to be cheap. But expectations are high when the price is high and Gordon Ramsay delivered.",1
5,"4.5 star (Yelp) and 2.5 star Michelin.
Food and service were executed perfectly.  But there was no longer excitement in the dishes.  
I first ate here 15 years ago when Gordon was still cooking in the kitchen, and the 9 course lunch was fantastic.  The food woke me up despite the jet lag after having just arriving in London from California.   I was awed by almost every dish.
The current chef still deliver a superb meal, but flavor and texture of the dishes are very predictable.
Service was perfect.  Wine list was very good as many bottles are reasonably priced.",1
3,"Booked a birthday lunch here earlier in July. Despite being a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, this was sadly the most painful 3-Michelin star dining experience I've had in ages, and I'm not referring to the price. The service at Ramsay's was well-balanced and not overly stuffy. Everything about the restaurant was immaculate--elegant and on point. But that was it, it was a bit too sterile and the dining room was not particularly inviting.  
We opted for the Menu Prestige. The only items that stood out for me were the lobster ravioli (which was both nice to look at and had great flavour) and the desserts (which were all very pretty but unpalatable -- it took a great act of will to finish my plate as I did not want to be rude, but hubs didn't even bother and pushed his plate back). The entire meal looked amazing but the focus was too much on presentation and not enough on flavours and textures. So this was a massive disappointment. 
Sadly, we shall not be returning after an unimpressive culinary experience.",-1
4,"I came here for my recent birthday dinner and I had a very pleasant evening. The tasting menu that I did was really delicious, and the presentation was superb. I think the presentation was a bit better than the actual food, but hey, I am a picky girl. The service was outstanding, but what really stood out was the wine list. They have a separate champagne list which absolutely excites me. They also had a Salon '99 by the glass. How can you pass on Salon? Overall, it was a beautiful night and I am glad I finally tried it.",1
4,"""Who's hosting?""  That's the first question we were asked.  (Turns out, the host is the only person who gets the menu with prices.  Sweet.)
Terrific food and impeccable service. The lunch prix fixe was great.  I loved the small, cozy, elegantly decorated dining room.  Just wished it wasn't 100% tourists (yeah, I'm discriminating against myself) and oh-too-quiet.
Would I come back?  Nah, once is enough, not because of price (I'm willing to spend, baby) but because the meal was very good, just not memorable.",1
5,This place is truly top notch in terms of food and services. We went with the Prestige menu and I opted for the pigeon option whereas my husband did lamb. I loved the pigeon so much better! The pace was great and ambiance was really relaxing.,1
5,"Usually places like this are over-hyped but man, I was so impressed! Everything was   exactly what you'd expect from a 3 Michelin star restaurant: beautiful decor, stellar service, and amazing food. 
Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. We made a reservation for 12PM lunch and half the room was taken up by 12PM (by 12:30PM it was completely booked). It's not a very large space at all so definitely plan ahead.
Sautéed foie graswith roasted veal sweetbreads, carrots, almonds and Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar - California foie gras lovers, this one doesn't disappoint. If you're going to order foie gras here, order this dish and not the other one (per the recommendation of the wait staff)
Fillet of line caught sea bass with cucumber, samphire, steamed charlotte potatoes, 
oyster and caviar sauce - Solid entree but what actually really impressed me about this dish was the sauce. The sauce was so good I had to refrain from licking the plate. Seriously. 
Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet - Beautiful presentation, solid dessert to finish the meal.
It's always hard to describe the items esp when the menu is changing but everything was fantastic. It's not cheap (even for lunch) so be prepared to burn a hole in your wallet but it's a hole worth definitely burning.",1

5,"Had dinner at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay this past week and it was most definitely the best meal I have ever had in any restaurant!  From our arrival to our departure more than three hours later, everything about our evening was totally perfect.  We were warmly greeted and shown to our table in this beautifully decorated dining room.  Our party chose the 7 course seasonal inspirations tasting menu and everything was so delicious.  We were brought several 'amuse bouche' dishes ahead of our tasting menu and the bread basket was brought round every time there was a new course.  Unsure what wine to choose, I asked the sommelier for advice and he provided excellent suggestions on different wine pairings.  
As each course arrived, there were usually 2 or 3 waiters, serving the food to each of us in unison - so perfectly choreographed!  The Maitre D' was great and came by our table several times for a chat, but was not intrusive at all.  At the end of the meal he invited us to visit the kitchen and we were treated to an amazing sight of the chefs putting together their wonderful creations.  I was surprised at the quiet and calm in the kitchen, with so much concentration - it was not at all noisy as I might have expected. 
During coffee they brought my husband a birthday cake and all of us chocolates - a nice unexpected surprise.  We were also given a copy of the menu signed by the executive chef - this was a lovely memento to bring home with us.
The meal was most definitely the most memorable dining experience of our lives so far and we would return in a heartbeat - they deserve all 3 of their Michelin stars.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.",1
5,"Excellent experience, great food, exceptional service.  One of the employees greeted us as we got out of the taxi and led us to the door of the restaurant where another guy was there ready to check in our coats.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected, and it felt very cozy.  The service was exceptional.  May of the staff are there to attend to your every need.  At one point during the dinner, I was getting up to go to the bathroom.  As soon as I moved my chair back slightly to get up, the waiter already anticipated my action and moved the chair back for me.  He proceeded to direct me to the restroom where another staff member was already there holding the door open for me.  They called the taxi for us at the end of the dinner and gave us a tour of the kitchen while waiting for the taxi.
The food is spectacular..as expected for a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  We ordered the prestige menu offering seven courses.  More if you counted the three small appetizers and amuse bouche.  We started with the Foie Gras...very light and flavorful as you eat it with a few small slivers of duck on the side.  The lobster ravioli was excellent.  I wanted more, but knew I had to save room for more courses.  I ordered pigeon for my entree.  Very tender...not as gamy as a quail.  I really enjoyed it.  I also tried the lamb from my sister's plate..also spectacular.  The desserts were my favorite treat.  presented like a piece of art in front of you.
Overall, an excellent experience.  Not to be missed when you are visiting London.",1
5,"I went here a couple of weeks ago while on vacation with my girlfriend. This restaurant was absolutely amazing. Probably some of the best food I have ever had. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. They always made sure we had what we needed and were constantly refilling our drinks right when we needed them refilled. They knew what to do before I even knew. I was also really nervous as I had never eaten a 3 michelin star restaurant so I didn't want to accidentally do something wrong.
Anyway, I ordered off the lunch menu and got the globe artichoke, rabbit loin, and vanilla parfait. The globe artichoke was probably the best appetizer I have ever had in my life. It was so delicious. Just absolutely amazing. The rabbit loin I had after was also absolutely delicious in every way. One of the best entrees ever.  Cooked perfectly and absolutely amazing in every way.
Then the dessert came and that was OUTSTANDING. Probably the best dessert I have ever had. They poured frozen olive oil on it and I just couldn't believe how good the vanilla parfait was. It was hard for me to believe, even now, that a vanilla parfait could be that good. 
They also had a chicken mousse soup starter and these white chocolate balls with some squares for dessert. All of it was amazing. And for a fancy restaurant the food was actually quite filling. We also were here for a while but it didn't feel like that long as there was always food on my plate or there was about to be food on my plate.
I highly recommend if you can get a reservation to go here. Great restaurant!",1
5,"We had a wonderful lunch; everything about it was superb.  The food was delicious, and the presentation beautiful.  The restaurant is quietly elegant and  beautifully decorated.  I must say that the service was unmatched in my experience -- I don't think 5 stars is enough.  Really memorable.",1
4,"With three Michelin Stars, Gordon Ramsey's restaurant is simple yet elegant.
Unfortunately, Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsey doesn't work the kitchen anymore, but the Michelin three stars still hold, and the menu continues to feature his signature updated French cuisines.
All in all, a fabulous experience, first class service and wonderful food. Will be back again soon, if I can get a table.",1
5,"Had to try the tasting menu - the food is darn near perfection.
The wine list is quite overpriced.  
Service is sometimes almost distracting -- I'm guessing 1:1 Server/Diner ratio.  So they're bustling all around, here comes the guy in charge of the spoons ...
I REALLY wanted hear a bellow from the kitchen:  ""You Donkey!  You could have KILLED someone!""  but alas, it was just an almost-perfect dining experience.",1
4,"My first Michelin 3 star restaurant as well! :)
Amazing amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing decor.
You have to book months in advance to secure a table. I booked it back in May for my July trip and I was only able to book a lunch :(. They take down your credit card number so if you don't show up or don't cancel within 24 hrs, you get fined 100 pounds--about $162.
I ordered the Menu Prestige, which consists of 7 plates. I highly recommend this menu to sample all of Ramsay's food.
1. Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble - This foie gras had a harder texture and was less buttery than the others I've tried, but still very good.
2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a chervil velouté - DELICIOUS dish!! So good. It was a fatty ravioli with a generous amount of lobster. Sauce was amazing--went together very well.
3.Roasted fillet of line caught turbot with English asparagus and morels - Can't decide if this or the ravioli was my favorite. This fish was delicious! Couldn't taste the sea flavor, which is a definite plus.  So good I forgot to take a picture :(
4. Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of summer vegetables - not a fan of lamb, but if all lamb dishes tasted like this, then I'm sold! Super tender and the vegetables were a good addition.
5.Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice - So GOOD. One of the better creme brulee's I've tasted. the Granny Smith apple juice was unbelievable!!!! BEST apple juice I've tasted. I think all apple juices should be made from Granny Smith Apples. Yum! I might even blend some for myself.
6. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Yum!! This ""soup"" was so good! 
7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm Eton mess with vanilla ice cream wafer - Wasn't a fan of this dessert. :( I dont really like sorberts. But I did like the wafer and the plating was absolutely beautiful.
Bonus: Silver Chocolate Truffle Tree - So unique and so pretty. Fun to pick off of and pop in your mouth.
Bonus #2: White Chocolate Covered Strawberry Balls in Smokey Dry Ice - Again, another unique dish. The smoke coming out of the dry ice was such a cool effect. 
Great experience. Never had such attentive waiters. But of course, this amazing-ness comes with a hefty price tag. My meal amounted to about 136 pounds, which is about $220.",1
5,"I think this may have been the best meal / service I've ever had.
Memorable items: 
- metallic balls that looked like a piece of art but were so delicious.
- a fruit smoothie with vanilla foam on top and pop rocks!
- a tasty amuse bouche: thin wafer /cone with avocado and prawn inside
- a silver pot brimming with liquid ice, bearing beautiful white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls
- a refreshing jelly-like, square, ""turkish delight"" with fragrant floral hints to it
Service SO amazing, I can't even begin to say how attentive they are to you. Food was so delicious too. AND so beautifully decorated -- from start to finish. (i.e. from their home-made bread, to pop rock desserts)
My ""nicoise"" salad had 27 ingredients in it -- skillfully prepared, delicious, beautiful, fresh and refreshing. What more could you ask for, really??",1
4,"Gordon Ramsay was my first Michelin star dining experience in London. Since I've been to many others, I keep rethinking my five-star review, and I think that it really doesn't deserve that fifth star. 
Don't get me wrong. I had a great time. The food was exceptional. It just wasn't memorable. Nothing wowed me. (Check my previous review for my experience there.) It was just lacking something that I had experienced at other three-Michelin star restaurants. I thought it was perhaps those were just exceptional, but now that I've gone to other ones in the UK, I've come to realize that Gordon Ramsay just doesn't hold up to these others.
It still gets four stars though. Mostly because my lovely other half bought me a cooking Masterclass here for my birthday. In case you didn't know, they offer one occasionally. I showed up bright and early at around 9 am where they had pastries and coffee waiting. We then went into the kitchen and prepped a three-course lunch for the next three hours. Then you and a plus one get to eat your three course menu with pretty much unlimited wine. It was fantastic. I had an amazing time learning kitchen skills and hanging out with the sous chef and some of the other chefs at the restaurant. Our meal consisted of salmon and lobster tortellini (similar to the ravioli, but smaller), mini beef wellingtons and a salted caramel chocolate fondant. At the end they give you the menu with the wine pairings and recipes for all the food you've cooked.
Granted it's not cheap, but it makes for one hell of an experience if you know someone who loves to cook. It's quiet and intimate just having a lunch with the people in the class and their plus ones. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. In fact, I would recommend it over actually dining at the restaurant. There are far better places to go have a nice meal, but not many where you can actually help cook it!",1
4,"My wife and I came here to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  It was an appropriate restaurant for the occasion and we were treated to excellent and attentive service.  We both had the Seasonal Inspiration menu:
1. Poached Scottish lobster tail with lardo di Colonnata, vegetables à la Grecque and coral vinaigrette
2. 'Carbonara', Iberico ham and four year old parmesan.
3. Assiette of spring vegetables cooked en cocotte with Périgord truffle
4. Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, spiced shoulder sausage, chou farci with crushed potatoes and spring onions
5. Rove des Guarrigues with confit beetroot, toasted amaranth seeds and Manni olive oil
6. Green apple and lime sorbet with shiso, avocado and eucalyptus
7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm 'Eton mess'
All of the dishes were tasty and well-presented.  The highlight for me was the sucking pig dish - you got a sample size of pork done many ways, my favourite part was the crackling.
I also enjoyed the 'carbonara', there were obviously a lot of different cooking techniques which went into this dish, to ensure that the pasta was cooked to the right level and the egg yolk was still runny.  The green apple and lime sorbet was a refreshing dish which came as just the right stage of the dinner: it really hit the spot.
The assiette of spring vegetables just seemed like a plate of nicely cooked vegetables to me, nothing too special about that one.  In the same way, the final course was simply strawberries with meringue.  With application, I'm sure we could find a nice punnet of strawberries ourselves to enjoy at home.
The service was slick and well-practised, however, I sometimes found myself thinking about when the next course was coming, which I hadn't experienced at other 3-star michelin star restaurants.
Overall, an excellent evening, but the minor points noted above contributed to my 4-star rating.",1
5,"It's been several months since my meal at Gordon Ramsay, and while many of the  details of that night have escaped me, I'm as certain now as I was that day - this is one of the top restaurants I've experienced, and likely every will.
Everything about GR was perfect, from start to finish.  The food (of course) was amazing.  But the service is what I'll remember, and is the standard that I'll hold any top restaurant to from this day on.  As a tourist in London, I can honestly say that they made me feel completely welcome and taken care of, and I could not have felt more at home if I were in my own dining room.
I have no doubt that years from now, I'll still look back on that night with warm memories, and I look forward to the time that I might once again experience that magic.  Bravo.",1
5,"I have been there for the first time last November (29th to be specific)- and I remember it with a big smile on my face
It was my partner's birthday and I booked it two weeks in advance (wash chuffed I was able to find a table) 
The fact that you have to enter your credit card details in order to secure the booking was not thrilling and I kept of receiving calls to confirm the booking every day on the week of the booking ( I was not available to answer) 
I expected it to be posh and it was so so posh - it is traditional restaurant when it comes to the setting but everyone around you makes you feel you have to act in a certain way! 
It was the poshest place I have eaten at in my life. 
Having said that I was so relaxed with the service - I have to thank them for making my night- they are friendly, they joke, and they suggest things to do after dinner, they even celebrated my boyfriend's birthday and send a complimentary tiny cake to our table. 
It is a service I can' t forget 
We went for the taster menu and it was divine 
I thought I won't get enough food out of smaller portions but by the fourth course I was full 
Beside the extremely delicious artistically presented dishes, the wine selection is incredible. 
I obviously have nothing to say about Gordon Ramsey Restaurant other than excellent",1
2,"Let me preface this by saying I am very sure we had a fluke experience here.  Something went very, very wrong on our visit that is obviously not the norm. But it was such a dramatic departure from every other Michelin *'d restaurant I've visited that I feel the need to share.  When we travel we choose the restaurants we visit very carefully and after our service fiasco at RGR I really wish we had chosen another place to complement the (exemplary!) Fat Duck on our London trip.  
I also sent the below feedback directly to the restaurant and... received no follow-up.  Not a word.  So this is long, but hey! Now I've got a bone to pick. :)
In the restaurant's online follow-up survey, I chose ""fair"" to describe the service; a more accurate description would have been ""Flawless, followed suddenly by a flip to confusingly terrible.""  After the listed courses on the menu were complete, we were offered coffee (which I accepted and my husband declined) and were told that ""chocolates"" would be forthcoming. The coffee arrived, I drank it, and time passed.  Other tables were continuing to be served.  Eventually my empty cup was taken away and I declined further coffee.  Perplexingly, my husband than received a clean plate in front of him (I did not).  We sat.  More time passed.  We started to think this was a bit awkward but continued to wait and enjoy each other's company.  
Eventually (after about half an hour from when coffee was served) we were offered to see the kitchen, which we accepted.  Upon our return from the kitchen, I saw my place also now also had one of the mysterious plates and we assumed the (alleged) chocolates would arrive shortly.  Adjacent diners finished their meals, left, and the tables had new people seated at them. After another 15 minutes of being ignored entirely by staff we decided it was getting ridiculous.  We actually had to flag down a server and ask what was going on. (!)  
The gentleman who I assume is the front of house came to our table and said that we hadn't pushed our plates away and therefore it was assumed we wanted more coffee?  Which was quite odd, given that we had both explicitly turned down more coffee, and in any case if the plates were coding this no one actually ever came by to offer it to us.  Not to mention the fact that my husband never actually HAD any coffee in the first place.  
We asked about the chocolates he had mentioned earlier, and he said, yes, the white chocolate course.  Pause.  We said we hadn't had it.  He said, ""Yes, with the liquid nitrogen?  The strawberries and white chocolate?""  (As if we would have perhaps forgotten a course with a centerpiece of dry ice?)  We again said that we had not received this course and in fact had been ignored for the last 45 minutes.  He said he would get it and then about five minutes later it finally arrived.  Then we finished, paid, and exited, completely confused by what had just happened.  
At no point did any of the service staff acknowledge that it is completely weird and inappropriate for diners to be left on entirely their own for nearly an hour, without so much as a cursory check-in, certainly at a restaurant with such a reputation for exemplary service.  To be forgotten is one thing; to not have even the slightest acknowledgement of the inconvenience and confusion it created in our evening is quite another thing on top of that.    
We have had the pleasure of dining at many Michelin two- and three-star restaurants, and this was by far the most bizarre service experience we have ever had at an establishment of this calibre.  Unfortunately the experience at the end of our meal soured what would otherwise have been almost a literally perfect evening out.   (On the other hand, it has given us a hilarious story to share with our friends, which we certainly have been.)
 
All in all it was a lovely evening that ended up in bizarro-land, followed by what appeared to be a completely oblivious unawareness from staff that anything was even wrong.  Funny though it is in hindsight it was also really disappointing!",-1
5,"I can't believe that there is anyone who would give this establishment less than 5 stars. In fact, I don't even think 5 stars does it justice. I feel like either Yelp needs to create a 6th star or I'd have to downgrade all of my other 5 stars to be fair!!! The only possible negative I can think of  is the price, but it was worth every penny for a special occasion and I'd feel lucky to have the opportunity to experience it again!
My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and it couldn't have been better. I have been to a number of 3 michellin star restaurants but this was aboslutely THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE of my life, not only because of the food but because of the service. I often feel uncomfortable with the level of service that goes along with these types of restaurants but they did an excellent job of making our 25-year-old selves feel at home. From the moment you enter, they find out what brings you there and a bit about you. For the rest of the night, every person who served us knew we were from NYC and that it was our anniversary. They had the level of great service without the things that I find to personally be over the top or uncomfortable, e.g. they don't have a person working in the bathroom but they still escorted me to it and opened the door for me when I went. 
The food: UNREAL. We did 3 courses from the a la carte menu with unbelievable wine pairings. I rarely like wine pairings because I'd rather choose wines that I prefer but the wines that the excellent sommelier recommended not only transformed our meals but we also left with a new favorite dessert wine. 
Our menu:
Boyfriend's starter: Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a lemongrass and chervil velouté 
My starter (the BEST foie gras of my life...and I try foie gras pretty much every time its offered): Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, new season rhubarb and blood orange
Boyfriend's entree: Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, homemade sausage, chou farci and braised leg with crushed potatoes and spring onions
My entree: Fillet of line caught sea basswith cucumber, rock samphire, oyster and caviar sauce
Boyfriend's dessert: Smoked chocolate cigar with blood orange and cardamom ice cream
My dessert: Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet
We LOVED everything. They were also incredible about my food allergies. They made dairy substitutes where necessary without compromising the integrity of the dish and where they didn't think they could make substitutes (like the oyster & caviar sauce on my fish) they discussed it with me. In the case of the sauce, we decided together to put the sauce on the side so I could put the amount that I thought was good for me. I wasn't planning on not having dairy on a night like this but it definitely improved my experience to have them working out for me. 
So... definitely go! And definitely make a reservation in advance! It is very small and well spread out so there is not much availability.",1
4,"I had such high expectations for this place, I really though it would fall short!
But it was great, definitely exceeded my expectations.
The service was amazing, the staff were so friendly and keen to make our experience there the best possible. The excellence service was only exceeded by the food.
It was amazing and couldn't have imagined a better meal.
So glad we finally made the decision to come here!!!!",1
5,"When in London, UK we splurged. Month in advance is required for reservations but I made it 5 months prior, an opportunity i was not going to miss. The Heart of Gordon Ramsay and I was not going to miss to try his food, in his home town. Loved this place. Small, quaint and elegant. As we walked through the doors and sat down at our table we were well taken care of. Three course meal was more than plenty of food, I couldn't have imagine how much food 7 course would have been. Between each course, they would come clean our table from crumbs (very fancy), and each time we had to get up to go to the washroom they walked us to the restroom door and came back to the table to refold our napkin. (very elegant). 
Lobster Ravoli was to die for, I recommend it! It was mouthwatering.
I haven't had a better meal since Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant.",1
5,"This was our splurge meal during our London stay and I will tell you this, believe the hype.  Most of us know Gordon Ramsay from his various tv shows and people think he's a prick (myself included) but damn, the man has a tremendous restaurant.  
There were only 13 tables at this table and the waitstaff was very accommodating.  All white decor and people were dressed well.  We went for lunch which has an excellent 3 course menu (coming in at 45 poounds).  Their regular 3 course lunch menu is 90 pounds and they have a tasting menu coming in at 120 poounds.  
I had the 45 pound menu which consisted of an octopus salad with salsa verde, followed by a roasted halibut and dessert.  Everything was so well cooked and delicious.  Presentation was beautiful, service was great and meal was outstanding.  Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had.  Don't go to the other Gordon Ramsay restaurants and just visit this flagship one.  You won't be disappointed.",1
4,"While Gordon may not ..the food should exceed your expectations. 
What  one expects from one of those that preaches the ""best"". 
A Michelin 3 star restaurant - that features amazing food and service.
You will have to book months in advance to secure a table.",1
5,"Superb!!
This was the best restaurant experience I have ever had. Now I understand why Gordon Ramsay cannot stop talking about his Michelin three starred restaurant on TV. 
First, the restaurant itself is quite small. They only had twelve tables set up when we went and amazingly, each night, they only serve one party per table. So, you can take your time enjoying your magnificent meal. The decor is simple with lots of neutral and clean color. 
Their excellent service is what truly makes this place stand out. ALL the staff (I mean there are so many people tending to you. There's your main server, then there's the butter guy, water guy, bread guy, wine guy, truffle guy, open-the-restroom-door-for-you guy, etc.) were so polite and friendly. They were not snobby at all. 
They give complimentary amuse-bouche. One of ours was soft boiled quail eggs wrapped in ham, lightly battered and deep fried (scotch quail eggs). It was perfectly cooked and so cute! 
For the starter, I had the seared scallop with apples and walnuts. Scallops were perfectly cooked and the autumney sauce was not over powering at all but very flavorful. 
All of their main dishes sounded so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our server told me his favorite was the lamb dish, so I went for it. This is how they describe it on the menu, 'Best end of Cotswold lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of autumn vegetables and vitelotte potatoes.' So, it's like a tasting menu of 'best of lambs'! Meat was so tender and it was one of the most beautifully plated dishes I've ever had. 
For dessert, we got the chocolate cylinder and apple tart but they also gave us complimentary white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls, dark chocolate truffles, and rose Turkish delights! We were absolutely well taken care of. 
The highlight of the dinner was definitely the tour of the kitchen! Kitchen was small but spotless. It was so exciting to see all the action! 
All in all, it was one darn awesome night!!",1
5,"Absolutely perfect.
I have never had a better meal in my life than at Gordon Ramsay's. Our table chose the 7 course tasting meal, and everyone was blown away by the flavors, plating, and creativity of each and every piece. At the table were a vegetarian and a vegan, and were easily accommodated, no problem whatsoever. Special plates were made for them, and were served at the same time as everyone elses. I can't recommend this place enough. Be prepared to pay the large bill for an excellent meal. It will take about 6 hours if you are enjoying yourself, which is fine for the amount of money you are paying. Again, if you get the chance, go here!",1
3,"All in all, I am so happy with my
experience eating in Gordon Ramsay, and worth the price. Next time I will visit
this place with my whole family and friends. This is the best restaurant
that I ever experience. All of theirmain menuis not only soundedgood but also
good to taste!The meat was so tender and it was one of the most beautifully plating
I've ever saw.",-1
4,"After my mother and I booked our trip to London, we made a reservation at the only Michelin 3-star restaurant in the city.  Two months and various confirmation e-mails and phone calls later, we arrived at this lovely little restaurant on Royal Hospital Road, ready for a treat.
We were the first to arrive and were promptly seated at a little table set in crisp white with a centerpiece of white roses in a silver vase.  The space is small and charming, with good light and an aura that evokes mellow wine in gently clinked glasses.
The service throughout the meal was phenomenal.  The staff:patron ratio was around 1:1, and various polite and friendly gentlemen attended to our table to welcome us, check on us, clear our crumbs, perfume our feet...okay, that last bit didn't happen, but maybe only because we went with the cheapest menu option?  Our primary waiter was wonderful, charismatic and helpful.  He deserved a blue ribbon for unobtrusive small talk.
There were at least five bread options, and we sampled the olive, the baked potato honey, and the rosemary potato.  The best was the rosemary potato, but they were all fresh and yummy with knived dabs from the swirly beehive of yellow butter.  Incidentally, you get a choice of salted and unsalted butter, which I was surprised to note as unusual.
The amuse bouche was a tomato consomme with a cute baby-shrimp-sized curl of langoustine accompanied by peas, fava beans, olive oil, and a teeny black cluster of osetra caviar.  It was mild and refreshing.
We went with the daily lunch menu priced at £45 a head, with three options for appetizers and entrees, and four for dessert including the cheese plate (with a £3 supplement).  Our waiter indicated that should either of us have any dietary restrictions, the kitchen would be more than happy to accommodate us.
I started with the salt cod brandade with Noir de Bigorre ham, poached quail eggs, chargrilled red pepper, olives, and rocket salad.  My mom got the saffron risotto with clams, mussels, langoustines, and tomato, ""paella"" style.  (It was meant to come with chorizo as well, but my mother doesn't eat pork - I know, crazy.)  The brandade was a pleasant blend of pureed cod and potato with a smooth texture enhanced by the meatiness of the fish, great for spreading on the accompanying toasted rosemary crostinis.  The brandade was wrapped in a strip of ham and topped with the quail egg with the veggies and olives nestled on the side.  The olives were excellent on their own and as an accompaniment.  The risotto was beautifully cooked and pretty flavorful, and I imagine it would've been better with chorizo.
For our mains, I opted for the roasted saddle of rabbit with sage, Bayonne ham, trompette de la mort, and stuffed Provencal vegetables, and my mom got the fillet of daurade royale with navet, carrot, radish, baby gem lettuce, and artichokes baurigole.  The rabbit was nice, herb-stuffed and wrapped like my starter in yummy fatty pig.  It came with teeny little rabbit kidneys looking all cute and un-organ-like on the side, along with a wonderful stuffed shallot and a wonderful stuffed cherry tomato.  The sublimely juicy vegetables were the elevating component on this plate.  The daurade royale, a simply cooked sea bream in a light creamy sauce, was elegant if unexciting.
For dessert we went halfsies on the banana parfait with passion fruit and salted caramel ice cream and the lemon meringue and almond tart with fromage frais sorbet.  The parfait was a block of dry icy reconstituted banana coated with dark chocolate, topped with unmemorable ice cream and sitting atop a meager drizzle of passion fruit.  On the whole, it wasn't awful, but I would've preferred a good commercial dessert.  In fact, the texture wasn't too far off from a very frozen Klondike bar.  The tart was much better, a thing of beauty - circular crust topped with gorgeous layers of lemon curd and nestlike meringue stuck with almond slivers, with narrow strands of caramel sauce leading out from the tart base to a perfect ball of sorbet - and quite delicious to boot, a perfect blend of sweet and sour.
After dessert came two splendid extras.  First was a silver tree of spherical silver chocolate truffles.  They were fun to pick off and eat.  The meal ended with strawberry ice cream balls coated with white chocolate, served in a pot smoking with liquid ice.  The ice cream itself was pretty mediocre, but the presentation was so delightful I didn't really care.
Overall, I was happy with my experience at Gordon Ramsay, though I wasn't quite wowed.  Other than the banana parfait, everything was great, but nothing was mind-blowing.  Since the place does have the three stars I suppose I was expecting more, but I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.  The food was solid and the service superb.  I probably won't go back as I live abroad but it's worth a try, especially for £45.",1
5,"I went to Gordon Ramsay's last year and I would have to say that it was fine dining at it's best. Chef Claire is at the top of her game! the food was cooked perfectly and delicious. Make sure to order their soufflé, it's one of the best I've ever had period. The staff put in that extra effort,  such as when the waiter entertained my girlfriend while I was in the men's room. After dinner, we were taken on a tour of the kitchen with a photo op in front of the Gordon Ramsay plaque. Thank you so much to the staff at Gordon Ramsay. Highly recommended!",1
5,"The restaurant was on the out skirts of the busy city.  I felt like I was at a little chateau .  Only a hand full of tables and minimal decor.  White table cloths and orchids as decor.  I Liked the style.  
I was greeted immediately by the host with a huge smile!  Everyone welcomed me in as if I'd come home.  The matradee had a great since of humor.  I love when the wait staff has a personality!
My meal was equally as good.  Presentation, quality, and taste were a 10!  I can't wait to experience Restaurant Gordon Ramsay on my next trip to London!",1
5,"7 Stars!!!!
Food: mind blowing! The texture, flavor, and aroma of the food were immaculate. My husband and I had the five course and was speechless after the meal.
Service: the best! I felt like royalty. 
Price: expensive but the food was priceless
Ambiance: classy and intimate
Other: Must try once in your life. You will not regret the experience (: No other restaurant has even come close to the experience we received dining here.",1
4,"Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road. This is definitely one from the archives but which I still feel compelled to blog about. Most people either have a positive or negative impression of him. A lot of them commented on his swearing in Hell's Kitchen. I actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show. 
Lately, he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills.
 I came here a while back for the tasting menu. 
 
I especially liked the second canapés. Wafer thin and crispy, it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness. 
Pressed foie gras with Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble
 
Pan fried sea scallops from the Isle of Skye with peas, crispy bacon, quail's eggs, baby gem lettuce
 
Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney, vinaigrette
 
Fillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce, leeks and cep sauce
 
Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit shoulder, ratatouille and thyme jus
 
Roasted pigeon from Bresse with grilled polenta, smoked pork belly and date sauce
 
Selection of cheeses or pre dessert
 
Pineapple soup with toasted coconut and rum
 
Bitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granite
 
I was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course. With all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around London, I think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered. 
I hope to see that from Gordon Ramsay.",1
5,"A couple of years ago, I celebrated 5 years with my girlfriend by taking her to restaurant Gordon Ramsay.
The first experience was trying to get a booking: not easy. If you're not a celebrity, you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you'd like to go. You can only book 2 months (or 3, I forget) in advance, and it's so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am. We couldn't get the exact day we wanted, and had to settle for a 10:15pm slot!
Nevertheless, it was a pretty phenomenal experience all around.
The restaurant is just one room, and not more than ten tables or so. It's white, surprisingly (to me) bright, and not that fancy. The focus is on the food.
The menu was full of incredible choices. I don't remember now what each course was, but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite. As with this type of food, portions aren't huge, but there were a few rounds of amouse-bouches (and amusing they were, especially the bacon-and-eggs one) between courses that actually made us full at the end.
While very classy, the serving staff didn't make you feel stupid if you weren't an expert at which utensil to use next. The sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36-page (!) wine list. Some special, recently-obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box, but we declined. Can't say enough about the staff: attentive, upscale, but chatty and helpful.
The price was, obviously, immense. You know what you're getting into when you come here. If you're trying to treat someone, they have two menus, one with prices and one without.
If you can get in, and you've saved your pennies to splurge for (for most of us) a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Gordon Ramsay's delivered for us.
Did my girlfriend enjoy the experience? Well, she's now my wife.",1
5,"I may be reinventing the wheel here, given the uniformity of the positive reviews, but when you experience something this wonderful and challenging, you feel inclined to sing it from the rooftops.
Truly, this was a standard-setting meal.  Impeccable pacing, interesting, but not fussy food.  Exquisite service, no stuffiness or pretension here.  The restaurant decor is the height of simplicity, all clean lines and white linens, which serve only to highlight the extraordinary, almost-architectural quality of the food. 
My companion and I went with the £90 a la Carte menu.  Like alcohol, I can never resist sweetbreads, so the foie gras and sweetbreads was a must, and was highlighted by the sweetness of the almond velouté (foam - hand spooned onto my plate - of course).  I went with the sea bass for the main course, which was perfectly cut and cooked and absolutely irresistible.  To finish I went with the Granny Smith parfait with blackberry foam, honeycomb, and cider sorbet - which was structured almost like a Mondrian painting, all right angles, but fantastic.
If you have the means, please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an amazing dining experience.  Quite simply, the best I've ever had.",1
5,"My first Michelin 3 star outside of the states.
Each establishment I've been to is characterized with an ""experience.""  For example, at Per Se, I felt like I experienced true flavor for the first time in my life.  Gordon Ramsay would be no different.  Recently taking a trip to London, Paris, and Edinburgh for merely a week, my sister and I had our itinerary filled to the rim.  After arriving at 11am and spending the rest of the day seeing the sites London has to offer, our dinner reservations were at 930pm.  Having found a Tube station somewhat nearby (according to the maps), we were on our way.  I must have miscalculated the distance, because the journey from the Tube to the restaurant is no joke (at least 20 minutes), however it might have been exaggerated due to being unfamiliar to the surroundings.  
After a nice stroll through Chelsea, we were warmly welcomed into the small restaurant.  There are only 14 tables, so it's small.  The decor I would label as Earth-toned on white with a contemporary flair.  Customarily there were a couple Amuse Bouche compliments of the chef which were fantastic.  Instantly I was transferred back into my seat at Per Se when I felt like a new born baby whom had just tasted his first morsel of food.  We went for the tastes of the season 7 course menu.  Everything was prepared nicely, with the flavors exploding onto your palate.  Clare Smyth is a marvel hands down.  Our Maitre d' Jean-Claude Breton's charm rivaled only my own.  Of course he noticed my bow tie and his attention to detail was superb.  
The meal is concluded with a plethora of sweets, desserts, and nitrogen concoctions unique to the styling Gordon Ramsay.  You are invited to stay as long as socially permitted at the end of the night, and of course a cab is waiting for you outside.
From the moment you enter to the second you are let off the cab, you are treated with majestic manners fit for a royal for a royal price.  This is fine dining at its most prestige.  I would invite anyone in England to dine here.  Flying out from the states?  Maybe not solely for this reason, but you won't be disappointed.  I'd just take a cab to get there in haste.",1
4,"Interesting to see how many of the existing reviews are from Americans (myself being one of them).  I think it's definitely worth trying once - the service is definitely at a completely different level.  How many waiters do you need to serve a table of 4 (apparently 3!)?  The food was really good but at least in my mind, forgettable.  To get a full 5 stars, the food would need to leave an indelible mark in my memory.",1
4,"My first Michelin 3 starred experience.  I called about 2 weeks in advanced and was only able to score a 1030 pm table on a weekday.  The wife and I were in town celebrating our 1 year anniversary.  What better place than to go to the place where Gordan Ramsey started it all off.  A decade of 3 Michelin stars is what it advertised on its website.  Truffle season was upon us and they offered a truffle inspired menu.  Our expectations were super high.
The food: 
1st course: Assiette de legumes: braised en cocotte with Perigord truffles.  A pretty good start.  Essentially a variety of vegetables cooked and shaved truffles.  The truffles had a mild flavor to them, very subtle.
2nd: Scottish Langoustine steamed in truffle mousse, linguine and aged parmesan emulsion.  One of my favorites of the night, flavorful and delicate.
3rd: Loin of wild Highland venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear and smoked pork belly. A pretty poor transition from the previous dish.  From light and delicate to heavy and gamey.  The flavors were there but slightly overpowering.
4th: Livarot wrapped in crispy potato with smoked duck, endive and caper salad, truffle sauce: Probably should have been the 3rd course, It was enjoyable but the previous dish kind of took over.
5th: Caramelized blood orange panna cotta: The best panna cotta Ive ever had, period.
6th: White chocolate and hazelnut praline mille feuille:  no wow factor but was decent.
The various amuse bouches were very tasty.  The thing that stood out was the service, probably the best service Ive ever had in a restaurant. The food was good, but not great.  And for spending 500+ dollars for 2 we were expecting more.",1
5,"Until now, Gary Danko in SF has been my favorite overall spot...until I came to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in London. My girlfriend and I were the first ones in on a Monday night, so it was a bit quiet - but the restaurant (all of the 15 tables or so there) filled up pretty quickly. The service is much better than most of the upscale restaurants in NY - you get attention from virtually every waiter, and they all are quite knowledgeable about the items on the menu. A note - I am not sure what goes for 'dressy' in the UK, but the website (at least when I visited it), strongly implied that a jacket was a good choice for men to wear. And every other guy there was wearing one when we went...so better to be overdressed than underdressed, right?
We both got the 7-course tasting menu (unless you feel strongly about ordering your own dishes or don't want to shell , do this), which was absolutely delicious. First was a roll with lobster, langoustine, and avocado - absolutely a perfect match of a slightly heavier veggie with small, fresh pieces of tender seafood. Also served on the house were soft-boiled quail eggs that were lightly fried on the outside (they have a richer flavor than the regular eggs from the grocery store) and a cracker with salami inside (tasty!). The amuse bouche was langoustine in a tomato consumme, which was probably one of the more unremarkable dishes of the night (but was still very delicious).
The main course - fantastic. You get started off with pressed foie gras topped with jelly. I've had foie gras pate before that I was not a fan of, but this was out of this world. The combination with the peach had all the flavors working amazingly together...wow. Second course was seafood ravioli (lobster and langoustine). As with all of the dishes, they aren't large, but you savor each bite, and this tasted great, particularly with the sauce that was added by the waiters (note: the waiters added some kind of sauce, for both food presentation and taste, for almost every dish). The turbot, a fish I don't think I've had before (at least by this name) was delicious - a meatier fish that had 'chicken juice' poured on top that really accentuated the texture of the plate. My only mistake of the meal was ordering the pigeon (hopefully not the ones frequenting the city streets) instead of the lamb, which my girlfriend got. The pigeon was good - very smoky flavor - but the meat was a bit tougher than I would have liked. The lamb was outstanding from the bites I had, and I would recommend it if you're going to do the menu. The cheese selection (I don't know much about cheese, so I let the waiter pick a selection of 5) was delicious but a bit big if you're parsimonious on the cracker-to-cheese ratio: the waiters came around and asked me a few times if i was done. The creme brulee (my girlfriend's selection) was very light, but the highlight is the shot of apple juice (or smoothie, perhaps more appropriately) that adds a blast of fruitiness to the dessert. The mango/passion fruit with whip cream is a nice refresher, but is a little small to warrant being an entire course. The last dessert was delicious, but since I was too far in food heaven by this point, I forget right off what it was (aside from having delicious fruit sorbet in it).
Since it was my girlfriend's birthday, we also got 3 more desserts - a box with pieces of pure chocolate ganache (so rich and so freakin' good...blows away the chocolate shops that sell individual pieces), pieces of Turkish Delight (the weakest link of the extra desserts, but still very good), and pieces of strawberry ice cream covered with frozen chocolate (like a bite-sized ice cream bar, except way better) that was frozen with dry ice...freakin' awesome.
This put a hurtin' on the wallet (the US conversion came out to $500), but you have to have a food experience like this at least once in your life. Now I know what 3 Michelin stars tastes like...it tastes delicious and is full of epic win.",1
4,"On our trip we sampled the cuisines of Joel Robuchon, the Ledbury, Maze, Hélèn Darroze, Alain Ducasse, Lucas Carton, Pierre Gagnaire and Gordon Ramsey's Hospital Rd restaurant. The food at his restaurant was truly exceptional and, up until the end of the meal, the service excellent. However, at the end of the meal a young lady of Asian features with red painted nails brought the card reader for us to pay our bill. She stared into my guest's eyes for several moments, shrugged her eyebrows and broke into a seemingly contrived long laugh. This terribly rude behavior made my guest extremely uncomfortable and sadly became her most vivid recollection of our dinner at Gordon Ramsey's flagship restaurant! For that reason I have only given the restaurant four stars and that may be generous.",1
4,"We took the opportunity of being in London to try this highly rated restaurant of Gordon Ramsay. Having tried other 3 michelin star restaurants in New York such as Daniel and George, we had pretty high expectations for our visit. First the 5 star good: service was impeccable, staff were both knowledgable and organized with great attention to detail. Food was amazing though we thought the quality had been better in other 3 michelin restaurants though those had been dinners and tasting menus. The four stars: we thought the ambience was a tad of a disappointment, i.e we had expected some more privacy and exclusivity than being in a dining hall which was a little awkward when food takes time to prepare and you are trying to focus on having a good conversation with your date. Price wise we thought as well that it was a little high for the overall lunch experience vs a tasting menu even dinner at other three michelin star restaurants in New York.",1
5,"Let's be frank.... if there is one restaurant that is consistently on the top it is Gordon Ramsay in London. The food is simply divine and the service is impeccable!!! This restaurant was on my bucket list and I wasn't dissapointed. This is the St.Peter's cathedral for all foodies :)
Be aware - really (really) expensive.... but worth it!",1
5,"""This restaurant is an amazing experience.""
This was the first time that my wife or I had ever been in London or dined in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We sat at a window table and had the ""surprise me"" wine pairing with dinner. My Wife chose the Prestige menu and I the Seasonal Inspiration. 
The food was amazing, the service was flawless, and the atmosphere romantic and comfortable. At the end of the evening, we asked for a list of the wines that were paired with our meals, and by the time we arrived back in the US an email with everyone had arrived. (Thank you Sharon!) I can say with confidence I would recommend this restaurant.",1
5,"I have really wanted to go here for quite some time.  I'll admit it, his celebrity fame brought my attention to the restaurant but let's be honest... that's how most of us found out about this guy.
I booked what I thought was plenty ahead of time, but realized there were very few choices left.  It seems to me that they only book one per table a night, but you get to choose the time.  My friend and I were in the first time slot at 6:30, but many guests were already seated when we arrived.  The entire experience takes a good 2+ hours so plan for that.  There are about ten or twelve tables in a room that was much smaller than I thought.  The decor is really nice.  Not overwhelming and inviting.
The staff is pretty ridiculous.  I think we sifted through at LEAST 12 different people while we were there.  Not a single dedicated waiter, and everyone took turns refilling water.  (you will be lucky if you get past a couple centimeters without a refill.  But the staff is incredibly friendly and not annoying at all.  They do leave you alone during your meal but are very attentive and can smell the slightest bit of concern and are willing to fulfill your needs.  Only one of the staff members bothered me.  He seemed like a French pretentious high class hipster or something, but in a funny way.  Another staff member looked like the muscle straight out of Russia in case anything went awry, he was cool.  Overall, very friendly and courteous staff.
The food... without a doubt the best I've ever had.  Three stars isn't kidding around.  I had a three course meal.  Scallops, lamb, and souffle.  We were given two separate starters, some sort of hors d'oeuvre finger foods that were amazing, followed by some sort of tomato based soup, but not like you think.  The broth was clear and served with some baby vegetables and prawns I believe.  Very small, just a taste.  The scallops were so good, I could eat that as my meal.  Best I've ever had.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing.  I had a bite of my friend's beef, and I thought it was better than the lamb, but now I'm being picky.  Both were delicious.  Before dessert we were given these mango coolies of some kind with glass straws.  Very refreshing.  The souffle I had, the only one I ever had, was of the banana variety and INCREDIBLE.  I'm not a dessert man at all, but it was freaking GOOD!  Then some finger sweets like Turkish delights and chocolates at the end.  So if I'm not forgetting anything, it's basically seven ""courses"" ... the portions may seem small upon appearance, but when you are finished with everything you leave perfectly satisfied.
I'd recommend this to everyone, but the price tag is no joke.  90 quid each for the a la carte.  Yikes.",1
5,"We hadn't eaten here for years, and had forgotten just how good it really is.  There is amazing attention to detail from the staff, between the restaurant and the kitchen it;s virtually a one to one ratio between staff and diners.  It's recently been refurbished, and for thee Michelin stars it's far from stuffy.  We were eating from the three course lunch menu, but even so we were offered a fantastic pre-starter of pea and mint infused ricotta with edible flowers. It was so light and fluffy you would barely know it was cheese.  I then had the warm summer vegetable salad, and my husband the smoked mackerel salad.  We both opted for the roast cod, which was perfectly cooked, slightly translucent still in the middle.  I had the roast pineapple with coconut sorbet, which was superb.  My husband opted for the safety of the cheeseboard.  After the meal we were offered elderflower jellies, flash frozen white chocolate and strawberry, and peanut brittle dark chocolate.  We left very, very happy.  Why on earth had we left it so long?",1
3,"Came here for my birthday for lunch. I was ever so slightly disappointed in the food. The ambience, atmosphere, service, wine, etc are all excellent, but the food, which is what matters, didn't knock me out. The food itself isn't that expensive, you do get stung with drinks (me and my grandad's brandys, especially!). All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back
Please don't swear at me Gordon!",-1
5,"best restaurant in london! quite expensive, but so worth it. the food was amazifn, the service was wonderful. we had a very memorable night and i would defiantly recommend.",1
5,"Came here for dinner. We had the traditional tasting menu. The staff were very welcoming and friendly upon arrival and throughout the meal. Service was flawless. The sommelier helped choose wine pairings in accordance to what the customer likes. Rather than at Alain Ducasse where the by the glass option consists of the sommelier telling you that he's chosen out a wine pairing that goes well with the meal, in which you do not know what the wines are, or how much it costs (a lot).
Everything on the menu, including the little extra dishes they brought out, tasted amazing and the presentation was spectacular.
I definitely plan to go back here",1
5,"Being a paragon of refinement and class, I nearly had to send back my wine glass due to water spots. I mean, where were we...Le Gavroche? (insert posh laugh here)
Seriously though, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is amazing. The food was nearly perfect as my hot date (and generous patron) and I had the scallops, foie gras, sea bass and duck. All rated among the finest I've ever sampled - I doubt you could go wrong anywhere on the menu.
This may sound weird, but the service was really the highlight for me. The pacing of the meal and the knowledge of the staff complemented the food, drink and slick atmosphere. There's nothing worse than going for a posh meal and having it ruined by an uninformed, oversolicitous or inattentive waiter. After a quick tour of the kitchen we did have a bit of awkward interaction with the front of the house in getting them to bring us the bill, but any slight annoyance was forgotten with a sculpture of chocolate truffles.
Certainly you won't decide whether or not to go to RGR based on a Yelp review, but Jesus H. Christmas is this place worth it. Do yourself a favour and grab a table - best 2.5 hour lunch you'll ever have.",1
5,Service is the best I've ever had. Food is unique yet delicious. A singular experience.,1
4,"Now, before we get started. This place is expensive. REALLY expensive. Every time I say something, and mean every time, just tag, ""but don't forget, it's REALLY expensive"" to the end. Anyway...
When I was here, we got the tasting menu, which is basically around seven courses of small portions, chosen by the chef. I managed to annoy everyone by flaunting my vegetarianism, and thus meaning I had a little menu of my own. But hey, why even be vegetarian if it doesn't annoy someone?
The food was AMAZING. Just perfect. The ingredients, the presentation, the taste, everything was just fantastic. The service was exceptional, but that may well be because we'd ordered the tasting menu, and were thus something of a priority. The wine list was fantastic, as was the pre-seating bar, and I must admit that I was GOOD and drunk by the time the later courses rolled around. 
The friendliness of the staff is also note worthy. We were allowed into the kitchen to watch the chefs at work, were given the time to have a quick chat with the head chef, and I was given a French cookbook I'd been reading in the bar simply because I asked where I could buy it from. The head chef also signed the inside of the book. 
A fantastic meal out. But REALLY expensive. Naturally.",1
5,Excellent restaurant with the most interesting meals I've ever had. The prices are quite steep but the experience is definitely worth it. The place is classy and it has the appropriate appeal and cozy atmosphere  just the perfect place to have a fancy dinner with business partners.,1
5,"The last time I was in London I dined here...just to note I had to make my reservation several months in advance just to secure a table. This is what you would call a true ""dining experience""...one that is unmatched in my opinion. Sure it's pricey, but you get to have an experience you won't soon forget. It would only be more awesome if you could hear Chef Ramsay cursing from the kitchen...but I digress. If you're going to London, check it out but make sure to book well in advance...well advance, like months.",1
4,"This local restaurant is great. I was here with a friend for lunch and we had a very nice time. Our waiter was very polite and presented us the menu in a very classy and polite way. We had a few courses, some dessert and we left full and happy. We are definitely coming back again.",1
5,"The splurge of a lifetime for a meal, to be sure...but nonetheless, Gordon Ramsay exceeded my expectations.
It's a beautiful restaurant with only 14 tables, so very intimate. Everyone serves everyone. They not only serve, they chat. They constantly circle the room. It's almost dizzying if it weren't so phenomenal and well orchestrated and personal.
The first thing, a man walked up with what looked like a lidded cigar box. It had a couple of truffles in it, and he showed it to us and let us smell them. This was their ""feature"" item of the night. Then another man came and chatted with us. He asked what made us choose to visit and I said it was the highlight of my trip; and that I booked it because I watch all the Ramsay shows and this was to treat myself. 
I got the 7-course tasting menu. There were more than 7 courses though because they served up all sorts of extra surprises. My daughter decided to have the 3-course menu, which meant she got full-sized servings, but also many of my surprises. Hers actually cost more than mine because she got the pasta special with shaved truffle on top and I misunderstood: It wasn't 40 pounds for the entrée...it was 40 pounds extra just for the truffle shavings on top of the pasta entrée! Oh my! Good news is that she loved it. Bad news is, the whole dinner cost ~$500 US dollars. Still, it exceeded my expectations.
One woman came back throughout the evening with a tray of fresh bread slices of about 5 varieties: Wheat, white, olive, rosemary, etc. They asked if you wanted salted or unsalted butter and then proceeded to put a super soft, perfectly round ball of said butter on a slate slab on our table.
I am not remembering it all, but I wrote down what I could remember as soon as we got back to our hotel. It was something like this:
1. Surprise x3 for both of us: A plate with 3 mini appetizers on it. 
     a. Crab and avocado filling in a mini cone
     b. Mini quail Scottish egg
     c. Cracker with prosciutto or some sort of nice salami in it
2. Amouse bouche (spelling catastrophe): Duck and parmesan fried ball in chestnut soup.
3. Veal sweetbreads and sauteed foie grois (to die for!)
4. Some white bean and Scottish mini mushrooms with Cornish turbot (white fish)
5. Lobster, salmon and langoustine ravioli (this was my daughter's appetizer, so she got an extra large version and it was one of my 7 courses, so I got a slightly smaller version)
6. My main dish: Cotswold lamb and veggies (I forget the details). My daughter's main dish: Pasta with truffle!
7. My dessert: Some special Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice. Yummy! My daughter got an assortment of ice creams and sorbet. They came as small scoops on top of a brick of ice. It was impressive but the photo does it no justice.
8. Extra: We both then got mango smoothies as palette cleansers
9. Surprise for both of us:
     a. Strawberry ice cream bon bons with white chocolate coating on dry ice
     b. Chocolate truffle bites
     c. Lavender gelatin squares (this was the only thing that wasn't too tasty)
So when all that was said and done, one of the waiters came over and asked me if I'd like to see the kitchen since they had filmed back there before and he thought I might enjoy seeing the inner workings of their kitchen! Totally cool. So he escorted me and my daughter back to the kitchen where we met the executive chefs and they showed us all the stations and explained how they operated. It was spectacular. The whole evening exceeded all my expectations! 
One for the memory books for sure...",1
5,"One of the best restaurants I`ve ever been. The food is magnificent, every detail was perfect. If you are a food lover this is your place. The menu is little pricey but totally worth it.",1
5,Fantastic dinning experience.  First 3 star restaurant I have been to and I was not disappointed. The dinning experience is very intimate and spacious with a simple but elegant environment.   Each set meal will run you about 130 quid but it is quite worth it.,1
5,"My second visit and I just have to say it's the best restaurant in London.
Food and service in an intimate setting are amazing.
Wine list is superb and the sommelier so knew his stuff.
It isn't cheap but who cares?
Ask to be taken into the kitchen!!!!",1
5,"When I think of a perfect dinner the first place that comes to my mind is this restaurant. From the very moment we entered this place we were greeted and our coats taken. We were seated promptly, just taking the atmosphere was a treat as well. We both ordered our appetizers and were gobsmacked by the level of perfection. I had the quail and my date had the artichoke to start off  perfectly cooked and at a temperature that made me forget it was just cooked! The main course was decadent I having the pork and my date had the chicken I think (I don't remember hers exactly). I had a Portugese wine accompanying the main course which was superb as well. Finally the dessert came I had a cheese cart and my date had the Belgian chocolates. We were disappointed to even go it felt like a passing dream we wanted more of. The cost was high a whopping 183 pounds but well worth it, to this day I still keep the receipt in my wallet to remind me of how superb service should be! Next time I am in London I will definitely be coming back here for another round!",1
5,"The partner & I love this place -- we go for his birthday, my birthday, our anniversary... and any other occasion we drum up for a treat to ourselves from time to time.
 On a slightly negative note, let me just say that none of the other GR restaurants in London compare. I find Claridges particularly disappointing.
 Everything I have to say about the RHRoad restaurant is highly complimentary. J-C is incredible -- he could sell me a worn shoe for a main course and I would devour it eagerly. The man is charm incarnate. There appears to be some turnover in other staff, but overall the service is irreproachable. The ambience is muted and unimposing.
 The seafood ravioli is to die for. For the mains, we tend to order the beef or ox cheeks whenever available. Note the restaurant is extremely accomodating on the tasting menu -- we were there a few weeks ago, made two substitutions and the waiter did not bat an eye.
 And how can anyone not love a restaurant that serves trees of chocolate balls and strawberry ice cream in dry ice???",1
5,"Phenomenal, outstanding, incredible.
 That could be all of my review, but I will expand :)
 This is the 3 Michelin star Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Therefore, I cannot stress enough how incredibly good the food is.
 A 3 Michelin star experience is something I would recommend to anyone for a special occassion. Most people go to this type of restaurant for an anniversary or a special birthday, etc.
 From beginning to end the experience was unique. The maitre was a French man that made us feel comfortable and was attentive to our every need, like all the waiters and waitresses. If anything, there was one French waiter that had a very strong accent and I could not really understand. That was the only 'negative' thing I could highlight of the night :)
 There are different menus to choose from and we chose the £90 for 3 course menu. To start with, they brought some small appetizers for us to try that were not part of the menu, and then we continued with the 3 courses, all of this accompanied with gorgeous different breads and some wine.
 Then we were taken to the kitchen and were introduced to the head chef and could see how all the chefs were preparing the dishes. That was very special indeed.
 Finally, we were taken to a small and romantic table outside the reception area where we were given some white chocolate truffles to finish the night in style.
 I can positively say that this is the best restaurant experience I have ever had and it was worth every penny.
 I will be back, hopefully!",1
5,"I think this restaurant is amazing!!!!!! I was invited there for my birthday and everything is great, food, service, ambience, thank you so much Gordon.
I highly recommend this place, just one consideration, price is high, so you are aware ...
I would like to add that this was a wonderful experience, and for a birthday this is something amazing i would recomment to everybody!!!!!!!!!!!",1
5,"This place is stunning and a must do.
Bring a credit card with a very healthy limit!  I used the online booking system...and typically, only 1700 or 2130 were available.  Service is impeccable starting from when they greet you at the door by name.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the food, its preparation, and are more than willing to make recommendations that are spot on.
You have a choice between three courses for 90 pounds, Menu Prestige 6-7 courses (depending how you look at it) for 120 pounds, or their Truffle Inspiration seasonal special of five courses for 175 pounds.  I chose the three courses and a special starter for that night...which was duck breast I think in puff pastry...but forget about that and go right for the fois gras--OMG...I know it's not politically correct to like fois gras these days, but this was probably the best slice that I've had.  It melted in your mouth.  The sommelier had recommended a glass of German pinot noir (Ziereisen) which was surprisingly exceptional...who knew?!?!  For the main, I chose the loin of wild Highland Venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear, and smoked pork belly.  Divine!  The third course is dessert...and yet, after dessert, they bring out all these little treats that others have mentioned.  You almost don't really need to order dessert.  All totaled, I spent 170 pounds.  C'est la vie!!!!  
What sets this place apart is the attention to detail.  The sommelier wrote out each of the wines I had had and placed in an evelope for me to take with me.  Since the receipt only said, ""A La Carte"", I asked for someone to write out what I had had for each course so that I could remember it later.  They presented me with a very nice copy of their take away menu that they had the head chef sign.  Impressive and suitable for framing. 
A wonderful experience and I can't think of anything they could have done better.",1
5,"When you go to a 3* Michelin restaurant with Gordon Ramsey's name attached you expect spectacular.
All I will say is.......
Food... WOW
Service... WOW
WIne... WOW
Ambience... WOW
I took my girlfriend and had the Menu Prestige at £120 per head. Yes it is expensive but if you want to treat someone, or eat somewhere special, this place is amazing on every front. Try it once just to say you've been, and book months in advance to avoid disappointment.",1
5,"BEST SERVICE EVER! Me and mum came here right after we got off the plane. As all the comments below have said, it was PERFECT. The food, the drinks, the dessert, the service, everything. You really have to be there to know what I mean. Honestly, after eating here, no service will ever be food enough. There are probably just as many waiters and waitresses as the number of people dining there. 
Though it may seem pricey, it really was worth it. 
Everything was served beautifully, and the waiters were very knowledgeable. They were able to give explanations and descriptions of each dish. 
Just when you thought you were done, the dessert just blows your mind. We got assiette de l'aubergine (every dessert  for two). AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL! I loved loved lovedddd the Soufflet. IT WAS SO GOOD! But I mean, everything was good. 
I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Probably not a huge group (because the bill would scare you) but it was one amazing experience. Too bad I forgot to tour the kitchen.. I forgot to... but this is somewhere you must eat if you're in London.",1
5,"Like many others have commented, the meal my husband and I had here was without a doubt the BEST we have ever had.  Not only was the meal itself to die for, but the staff was exceptional and they oversaw our every culinary need.  My husband and I often suffer when it comes to service when we dine at finer establishments since we are on the younger side (i.e. mid-twenties); but, that was NOT the case here- the staff was so friendly and welcoming.  We can't wait to return for another meal.",1
5,"my friend and i are doing 5 michelin star restaurants in one week because we are spoiled kids. this is restaurant #4/5.
when i tasted the pork belly, i think i just made an incoherent sound like 'hukk!!' which translated means, this is the best pork i've ever had. it was brilliant. definitely five stars on yelp, definitely 10 years of 3 star michelin rating deserved.
service was good of course- especially when i asked for madeleines on a course thing i didn't order (but was willing to pay extra for them) they just said they will bring them out, and they were baked fresh, and were the best madeleines ever. 
the dessert- banana parfait was not really my thing. of course delicious, but not as good as i expected. loved the surprises between and after courses ;) i'll leave that as a surprise.
alain ducasse, i felt more pampered but the main course was better here. it also came out to be more expensive,since no wine, water, or tea included in teh menu so we were surprised to be charged all those things.",1
5,"Service and food is spectacular!!! There is always a waiter walking by every 15 sec to ensure you are well served.  Food is creative, fresh,  and delicious.  Can't go wrong with any dish.",1
5,"We went here on our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience. The service was truly amazing. The entire staff seems to look out for all the tables (rather than just having one server per table) and as a result you are constantly looked after but not interrupted. Because they do a staggered seating (no two tables are being seated at the same time), you are on a different cycle than the other guests dining which makes it feel like you're the most important guest when you arrive, order, and leave. The dining room is intimate and beautiful. I had the scallops to start, and it was my favorite course.  We also thought that for a 3 star Michelin, it was reasonably priced. We look forward to returning.",1
5,"My friend Mark is a Gordon Ramsay fanatic, and as he is a bachelor and his mortgage is only £320 a month (for a 2 bedroom house) he can afford to occasionally splash out on places like this. It was great.
We were surrounded by a swarm of different waiters from the get-go, and it was a bit intimidating at first, since we'd booked for lunch (cheaper and available) and we were the first in. The maitre-d' took very good care of us. We were offered champagne, which we astutely declined, since it would have cost £12 a glass. My friend got the only menu with prices in, so we quickly skimmed to the back where the £45 lunch menu was. I chose the three Rs: Risotto, Rabbit and Rum-Baba. I selected an English white wine at £28 a bottle, but was told it was unavailable. That suited me, since there was a cheaper wine we had been too snobby to select, so we had that instead (£22 a bottle.) This was cheaper than ordering by the glass and compares favourably to pub prices. The wine was stored in a chilled bucket and was absolutely delicious. Difficult to see how a more expensive wine could have tasted better. 
An amuse bouche started, a little rosemary oil soup thing which we had to eat with little teaspoons, which annoyed me, so I didn't finish, which actually produced a comment from the m-d.
The risotto was perfect. No other word for it. Every little bit of seafood was cooked exactly right. It made us sorry to finish it. The rabbit was perfect as well, absolutely delicious. Rabbit pancakes were the first meal I ever ate in France, at Madame's in Le Touquet (5 course meals every night, real hot chocolate every morning) back in 1987, so it seemed appropriate. (Just realised the old girl is probably dead now.) I made my friends jealous with the rum baba, which was big and light with a huge dish of cream and a jug of pure rum. I was told I could ask for more rum (!) 
Because I had told the maitre-d' my friend had been to other Gordon Ramsays in Tokyo and New York (perfectly true, he likes spending his money) we were invited to have a look round the kitchens! Where we met the woman of his dreams, Clare Smyth, and had our photo taken with her. After that, while waiting for our coffees in the little front area, we were given chocolate truffles and ice cream balls wrapped in white chocolate. Lovely. The coffees were perfect. (so they should have been at a fiver each.)
My only minor quibble was the decor, the panelling of the walls struck me as a bit strange- a bit like a hotel somehow. But it was a grand experience. i recommend it if you want to impress a potential mate or their parents.",1
5,"For a 3 michelin star restaurant, I have very high expectations for Gordon Ramsay's flag ship restaurant.  This was quite possibly one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in terms of the food.  I am usually not a big fan of foie gras but whatever they did to it, I loved it.  The gamey aftertaste was gone.  The highlight of the meal was the pork belly though, so tender and so flavorful.  I would fly back to London just to have that again.  Other highlights would be the fruit smoothie with pop rocks.  
As with most of these types of restaurants, the service was exceptional.  They were very attentive and accommodating.  I highly recommend the 7 course tasting menu.  Yes, it's 120 pounds but when else are you going to go to Gordon Ramsay?",1
5,"Excellent service and creative dishes, including the chocolate truffles (displayed at the top center image below), pop rocks in the beverages (top right image below), and dense clouds of dry ice to go with your dessert (bottom right image below).  They have five or seven course meals that start at 100 British pounds.  The food is delicious, though we'd still have to say the Broadmoor in Colorado was much more yummy even though it hadn't been rated by Michelin.",1

Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road. This is definitely one from the archives but which I still feel compelled to blog about. Most people either have a positive or negative impression of him. A lot of them commented on his swearing in Hell's Kitchen. I actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show.
Lately, he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills.
I came here a while back for the tasting menu.
I especially liked the second canapés. Wafer thin and crispy, it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness.
Pressed foie gras with Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble
Pan fried sea scallops from the Isle of Skye with peas, crispy bacon, quail's eggs, baby gem lettuce
Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney, vinaigrette
Fillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce, leeks and cep sauce
Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit shoulder, ratatouille and thyme jus
Roasted pigeon from Bresse with grilled polenta, smoked pork belly and date sauce
Selection of cheeses or pre dessert
Pineapple soup with toasted coconut and rum
Bitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granite
I was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course. With all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around London, I think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered.
I hope to see that from Gordon Ramsay.",1
5,"Unbelievable - Food was amazing - I had the prestige menu, one of the top 5 meals I've ever had.  They are good and they know it - it's expensive",1
5,"Quite possibly the finest restaurant I have ever visited and one that all other like establishments will be compared to. 
The food was stunning, with a subtle depth of flavour to every dish. Service was attentive, and pleasant, and the atmosphere was relaxing. 
The staff were very accommodating, helpful and relaxed, happy to aid in every aspect of your dining experience. 
The only aspect with this restaurant that might cause an issue is its demand. If you wish to have dinner here then I recommend booking at least two months in advance, if you're having lunch then six weeks.",1
5,"Despite what you may think about Gordon Ramsay the man, this restaurant remains #1 on my all time list.  Everywhere we go gets compared to Gordon (if going to a man's restaurant gives you permission to be on a first name basis).
Of course everyone knows Gordon Ramsay. But it hadn't actually entered my mind to want to eat here until a friend went and just wouldn't stop going on and on about it.
So when we got the chance to expense up to £200 on dinner it was the perfect opportunity.
SERVICE......excellent.  As to be expected at a place like this, there were a lot of servers and other people to cater to your needs.  I liked how even with just 2 people they gave us a big table (same as a party of 4) to ourselves and seated us both on the same side facing the room (no one has to fight over who has to sit facing the wall).  I liked how when I got up and looked around they room they discreetly waved in the direction of the toilet.  I liked how when we ordered wine, and we're not that knowledgeable about wine, we just asked them to bring recommendations and they went off and did all the work figuring out what we ordered themselves without having to ask us.  I liked how they didn't bother us during to the meal to ask how it was, or if we were done, or if we needed anything.  I liked how they knew when to clear the plates - when we were both done (and yes, it helps greatly if you know proper table manners).  In short, they were knowledgeable, alert and very discreet.  The best service I've ever received and I probably rave about as much as I do the food.
FOOD.... ah the food!  I could go on and on.  I won't even try to remember what hubby had but I ordered the foie gras and kobe steak.  However, what I remember most are the amuse bouche.  A spoonful of gelatin that was the essence of tomato.  And don't forget dessert.  Not sure if it's still on the menu but be sure to get the special dessert that's a sampler of the menu.  Tiny pots of chocolate, lavendar creme brulee, etc, etc.  We must have gotten at least 8 miniature desserts.  And especially don't forget the coffee.  It comes with 4 different kinds of chocolate including miniature ice cream cones (if you are too full at this point you can ask them to box up the chocolates to take home).  
The reservation was for 6 and we were seated promptly.  We didn't leave until 10:30.  But at no time did we feel like food was coming out too slow.
At the end of the evening we even got a tour of the kitchen and met the chef.
Of course all of this comes at a PRICE... which was worth it.  The total meal came out to around £250ish with 2 prix fixe meals (extra for the kobe steak), 2 glasses of champagne, 2 glasses of white wine with starters, 1 bottle of red with meal and coffee/chocolates.  Service is included in the price so you don't need to worry about that.",1
5,Fabulous lunch - 3 hours of debauchery - no prosecco on the list so we  had to start with champagne and that set the tone! Worth every penny of the experience.,1
3,"I am not really sure what to say about this place 
Shall I say about the food? the place? The price? or the celebrity-eccentric-business man? 
A bit of everything.
 The food: is a classic 2 michelin star restaurant anywhere else in the world. I really don't get why to be the only 3 star (which actually does not worth) in London, for such many years? (For me is obvious that connections work well..). Why French? You are in England, show us something F**g traditional English! You think you can challenge French 3-star? Don't think so..
 The place: I know what minimal is but your place is bloody bad. A small room (that's fine) old decorated, probably modern when it was first launched..
 The price: Overpriced, but someone needs to pay this guy's name! 3 people had 3 courses and glasses of wine for each course (not the dessert) and we payed £600+ ...
 The Celebrity under Gordon Ramsay's name: I was really disappointed overall. I expected something extraordinary from the only 3 star restaurant for so many years in London but that's not the case. I would like to see the chef, talk to people and be friendly like SO many great chef's who worth in throughout the world. He was probably busy opening another branch somewhere I guess..
 Overall: Over rated, friendly staff, average food (for what it is comparing it to other 3 star restaurants).
 How can we compare this guy's restaurant with the amazing chef Arzak in San Sebastian in Spain?... And that is just an example!",-1
3,"3 Michelin Stars (the food seems to be about equal from 2 stars to 3, only difference I can see is the ridic attention to detail (service wise))
Slightly difficult to get into so book ahead of time.
The foie gras dish here is so different and unique from any other variation I've had. It's serious. Most of the seafood courses were okay, but the sauces just made them so much better. I had pigeon for the first time. According to the waiter, they were the kind from the woods and not from Trafalgar Square. Also, just in case you were curious, pigeon meat is very tough and red. It was alright. The smoked pork belly that came on the side wow! Just wow! It's a bacon lovers dream!
Okay now onto the cheese. Wow such a large selection of cheeses and the cranberry bread that came with them was amazing! Pre-desert (hah! love this, that the term pre-desert exists that is) was a creme brulee variation with a side of freshly pressed apple juice. It was like a non alcoholic wine pairing and it worked perfectly together. Next was a strawberry champagne smoothie and we finished off with a chocolate and hazelnut concoction. It had ginger mouse on top and was of course wonderful. Arriving with the check, was what looked like a pot of dry ice (it was underneath). It was white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream! I love how fancy restaurants always give you gifts of food throughout the meal.

5,Great place with good food and interesting choices. Would definitely recommend for any occasion. The service was great!,1
4,"Decent sushi, delicious beef, and beautiful decor. A bit pricy. Overall nice experience. Great for groups. A bit crowded but they have a lots of seats, large and small tables.
Pro:
- nice lively modern interior
-  beautiful plating
- spacious
- good for groups",1
2,"ok, it's ok - but despite its claim, it's not Japanese.  The atmosphere is friendly, modern and inviting.  The cooks constant shouting of ""Hey!"" on the other hand Is completely unnecessary and frankly, annoying.  
Service was friendly, knowledgeable and slow.  An interesting menu with lots of choices, great wine and spirit selections and a central grill area surrounded by bar seating are all pluses.  Unfortunately, if it's terrific food you're after you're going to be a bit disappointed especially at their price point.  I had a seaweed and watercress salad, kimchi (Japanese?), kyoza, grilled eggplant and ribs.  Meh.",-1
5,"So delicious!  My husband and I luckily got some last minute reservations here the last night we were in London.  Pro tip- even if the online reservations says its full, call them!  That's what we did.
As far as the food, my only complaint was that it was hard for us to tell what would be a larger plate and what would be more of a small plate.  We started off ordering a few things, and based on the size of the first 2 dishes, we thought we might need another 2.  The third dish came out, and it was so much more food!  We regretted getting those extra plates (even though they were good, we were just so full!).  So, either ask or just be aware you might get a surprise large serving!
On to the food!
The first thing we got was the sashimi plate for 2.  This came with salmon, a medium fatty tuna, snapper, prawn, and a small bowl of tuna tartare.  Good way to start out the meal- simple, great quality fish.  I really liked that they included the med fatty tuna - a nice surprise.
Hubs got a few extra pieces of sushi which was also very good and clean tasting.
Third dish (the big one!) was the crab hot pot.  This was so good!  The rice is a bit creamy but not porridge-y, lots of crab, and tobiko sprinkled throughout for texture.  However, it was easily 4 servings and we struggled to finish it.  We could have stopped here but we didn't know it was going to be such a large serving!
We next got two of the specials, the cuttlefish and the kobia.  The cuttlefish was ok, hubs liked it more than me.  The kobia, on the other hand, was delicious.  Make sure to stir this dish before serving yourself!  There are pieces of fish, some sort of grain, a sweet corn mousse, and ""micro asparagus"" (not sure what they were but that's what we called it!).  You want to make sure that corn mousse gets distributed around the plate, because it is awesome!  Also fair warning, this was not as large of a serving as the hot pot was, but it was a bit much for our end of the meal.
We also had sake and drinks which were lovely (they feature a lot of floral flavors which we like).
Highly recommended!",1
4,"Even though Nobu London is arguably their best location, (with the possible exception of Nobu Malibu), Roka is actually better. The quality of their sushi Is truly exceptional as is their range of sake.I would strongly recommend their hamachi tuna. 
KRD NY",1
5,"We had a wonderful evening at Roka. The evening began with cocktails including chilled saki.  They have an extensive menu and almost every type of saki is available. The staff was Friendly and knowledgeable.  Standouts were black cod crab dumplings and sweet potato tempura cooked to perfection. We had four maki rolls and all of them were a twist on a traditional sushi concept.  Expertly seasoned is how I'd describe all dishes. Much of the food is grilled out In the open by an exuberant team of chefs.  
The decor is exceptional.  Wood grain and glass gives the sense of tradition with a modern flair.  A great place to impress a date or client for that matter.  You have a wonderful view of the street and you can people watch to your hearts content.  The staff is extremely attentive. Pork belly with a little spicy vinegar sauce and sliced apples on the side was a stand out. The baby back ribs with cashew nuts and lime were fun but the sliced, rare duck was the best of the best.  Desserts all had an original feel. We ordered donuts with Carmel although- we were stuffed and happy as can be at that point.  Dishes are fun for one but easy to share.  Roka truly is one of the best restaurants in London.  Try it.",1
4,"Loved my experience here. I've been here twice, once for drinks at the lounge and the other time for dinner.
The lounge was happening! Music and low lighting. Their cocktails are creative and the staff is super nice. Totally was a great spot for a night cap. 
The upstairs dinner area is always bustling as well. We sat at the bar and ordered a few dishes including their special dish yellow tail sashimi, soft shelled crab and some apps. Everything was delicious! 
Great place for a treat or a nightcap if you are okay with busy and loud.",1
5,"Had a wonderful meal last night.  My friend and I had the Premium Tasting Menu and I would highly recommend it.  Not cheap but well worth it.  I don't remember every course but there were no let downs.  Some of the things that particularly impressed
--  The quantity of food.  Plate after plate, and not small plates. I probably would have preferred slightly slower pacing but overall it was a ton of food.
--  Went with the Wagyu upgrade on the tasting menu, one of the best food decisions of my life.  I don't have Wagyu very often (I prefer a US style steak) but it was incredible.  It was clearly Wagyu, not a hybrid where you can't tell the difference except by looking at the price.  It was fantastic flavor and texture.
--  The sashimi course was great.  Very fresh fish and even the scallops (I normally don't like shell fish sushi) was not too chewy
--  The yuzu truffle dressing that comes with the yellowtail carpaccio was incredible, best sashimi/carpaccio I have ever had
--  The seared beef with black truffle was also incredible, tasted like typical Japanese beef appetizer but the truffle made it very special
--  Dessert was over the top.  I huge plate with great fresh fruit, multiple ice creams and a molten chocolate cake
Service was better than I had been warned about.  Overall, great experience.",1
2,"Very generic, not good as expected, tasting menu is disappointing. Not recommend if you expect a great Japanese dish, the fusion is too western and it feels like it's not respecting the ingredient and its combination of ingredients is confusing (e.g. a very bad use of truffle and Waugh)",-1
4,"The food is delicious and staff was super helpful and friendly in deciding what we should order. However, we were with my husband's parents who thought the place was too hip for them. Also they had problems hearing the conversation over the loud music. I would return with my husband or friends our own age.",1
3,"Roma Charlotte Street is a reasonably sized restaurant with attentive staff.   The kitchen is very strict on serving times, if you don't order your food within the given guidelines, the kitchen may request you came back another time.  I was able to order in time but was highly rushed by my waiter.  
I ordered their signature dish yellow tail sashimi salad with truffle dressing which was really good. I also ordered the lamb cutlets with korean spices.  It came with a small amount of chilli sauce and I ordered a side dish of rice (which was a bit undercooked).  The juice of the day pineapple, spinach and ginger was just ok and came in a tiny cup.  The lamb was just ok but for that price I expected it to be amazing.  Overpriced in my opinion. 
It was nice to see the chef's cook the food in front of you in the open style restaurant. 
My personal waiter didn't particularly come across as friendly and didn't smile despite my efforts to engage him. Most of the other staff are pretty friendly.
There is also wifi available.
Overall I would say most of the staff are great, premises clean with service efficient, but as for the food I can get the same quality of food elsewhere for a much cheaper price.",-1
3,"Overall, a good place. The service is fantastic - really friendly and really attentive.  The food was something of a mixed bag, but let me qualify that:  I'm from California and we get GREAT sushi.  The sushi and rolls here are good but I've certainly had better in California.  The absolute highlight was the yellowtail sashimi with truffle oil - that was amazing!  I'd go back there just for that.  We had the Rotaba beef, which was good, but in my opinion, needed more salt.   The experience was really nice and the neighborhood had a cool vibe.",-1
4,"Came here during a business trip in London in November last year.  The location that we went to was at Aldwych not Charlotte.  The ambiance was very modern and lively.  I had made reservation very last minute so was able to only get a table for 2 that was in the bar section.  Although we were not in the main dining area, it was still very comfortable.  This was a high-end restaurant so the prices were on the expensive side but the portions were good for sharing for two.  I got my favorite rolls, negi-toro (fatty tuna with scallions)...it was so yummy!  My friend got the soft shell crab rolls and she said it was delicious.  We also got a mushroom rice hot pot for sharing which was not your traditional Japanese dish but it was really good.",1
4,"So my wife tells me ""Five, it was an excellent meal.""  And it was.  But it was so rich that, being used to very low fat food, I would have liked to have had a little rice to serve as ballast.  But most people would not have that problem.  I enjoyed the meal a great deal, each of 8 courses surprising and delighting the palate.  And this was only the ordinary tasting menu.  Service was unimpeachable, the decor was terrific, and, of course, my company was unparalleled.  We had to rush.  We did not have a booking ahead of time and even though we arrived early, to finish all of our courses by 8 when they had bookings that were going to be filling all of their tables, we had to keep eating.  This was not a problem, as the wait staff brought courses 2 and 3 at a time, only waiting for us to finish devouring each in a fit of gustatory delight.
Yet I will still fault them for having an insufficient amount of starch and vegetables to go with the fried courses, each resplendent in the glisten of delectable oils.  Sometimes too much of a good thing is unbalanced.  And I'm afraid I would conclude that you should come prepared to have an unbalanced meal.  Unless you request rice.  And, if you can make it stretch over a little longer than 2 hours.",1
5,"A couple of weeks ago we went to ROKA Charlotte St.  a superb Japanese Izakaya western twisted cuisine restaurant in London, just a five minutes walk from Goodge Street Tube station, it was totally sugoi!!!! 
Upon arrival, the staff welcomes you with a nice and lovely smile, since the moment we got in, the service was wonderful, very discreet and attentive from the beginning, everybody is friendly and will do anything they can to improve your experience in a crowded but at the same time relaxed ambience, with nice music and dime romantic lights, loud and clear enough to have a conversation and read the menu without any trouble.   
There are two areas, downstairs where you could find their amazing Shochu lounge, here you may enjoy a nice Japanese or classic cocktails with some Nihon tapas, or one of the 50 different references of Whiskies they have from the rising sun's country, among other interesting things, before you go upstairs to have your meal. 
The main attraction is the Robata bar island, in the middle of the room, which allows you to observe the skills of the chefs and obviously their show cooking with some Japanese shouting orders, and at the same time it guarantee the freshness of every single ingredient and of course that they make everything at the moment, for me is the best place to seat.
What an impressing meal, absolutely everything was prepared and presented more than very well with a perfect timings of serving, our table was always with food on it. We went for omakase style, Daniel one of the managers looked after us, and together with the waiter did the unforgettably order for us, excepting for the salty edamame and sakemaki or salmon hosomaki for my daughter, I ordered for her, she cannot visit a Japanese restaurant without eating it.
We started with the aburi sake tataki with ponzu sesame out of this world dressing and very crispy sweet potato, fantastic balance between acidity and creaminess, very light but flavorful at the same time, we just loved it. One of the best western twist salmon tataki I ever had. The deep fried Nasu (eggplant) salad with sesame miso dressing and bonito flakes, really surprised me, the texture was firm, I couldn't feel any oil at all, the touch of the spring onion, miso and katsobushi gave it the perfect combination for a nice umami, it melted in my mouth. At the same time we had a crispy soft shell crab tempura in ponzu sauce with shichimi togarashi shiso, kizami nori and some arare, it was sublime, but the jewel-like squid tataki with yuzu shallot dressing was even better. The Scallops from the robata served with a wasabi and shiso cream and the tenderstem broccoli with ginger and moromi miso were delicious too.
Regarding the sushi, I must say the sashimi moriawase was one of the best ever in a long time, they offer different sizes depending on amount of persons, you will always have a selection of sashimi chosen by the chef, usually sake and toro are fixed included, there were hotate (scallops), lobster sashimi with different dressings (depends on season) this time was Mandarin Koshu, salmon tatar, hamachi, sea bream and ama ebi with imperial osietra caviar, all of it with nama wasabi, the fish was unquestionably of the highest grade and well execute, more than oishii. Unfortunately the maki selection was not at the same level, the ingredients and fusion were more than ok, but the quality of the rice was not the proper one, was too dry, however the temperature and the flavor was very good, my favorite was the wagyu tempura maki, quite impressive and nice move.   
  
At least but not less important we enjoyed the tai no miso-yaki which is a fantastic sea bream fillet with miso and red pickled onion The fish was cooked perfectly, falling off with ease and silky soft inside, the taste of the miso was amazing, this dish impressed me a lot, it was a clear example that sometimes less is more.
If you were waiting for the sweet part, let me tell you that the dessert platter was 100 times Sugoi!!!!! I do not know how to start, lets see.... It was a simply beautiful plate with assorted of exotic fruits with some real good ice creams, a lovely soft and warm dark chocolate brownie with a surprise viscous green tea pudding fondant inside, had a peanut, vanilla and chocolate sundae with sesame poki sticks and banana tempura, this one was my favorite, but the coconut and passion parfait, pineapple and kiwi fruit simply blowed my daughter's mind away.
Definitely Roka, rocks!",1
4,"This is a sister restaurant to Zuma. I have only been to the bar in basement. And for all you first timers here, it is NOT a sushi restaurant but a izakaya (judging by food options), thought the vibe and atmosphere feels like a lounge. 
I was taken here when I visited London. I was especially fond of the saikyo miso cod and asparagus skewers. Sashimi was great as well. But above all, I was surprised by the shochu options here. There was a large shelve of flavored shochu here!
I shall come back next time in London.",1
5,"We had reservations for 6 people and got seated right away, even thought  we were missing 2 people who were running late.  I thought it was very nice of them to seat us. The hostess was friendly and warm.  Everyone loved their drinks. The service was excellent. The food and presentation of the food was excellent.   People at the table ordered Sushi, Sashimi & Hot-pots.  We all had desserts which everyone enjoyed and thought looked like a work of Art.  We would all go back again the next time we are in London.",1

Beautiful modern decor, excellent service, and extremely tasty and well-prepared dishes make ROKA an excellent choice for those who wish for authentic Japanese cuisine beyond the usual sushi/sashimi restaurant fare! The grilled fish and grilled vegetables were delicious! We especially enjoyed the grilled cobia and kampachi fish and the grilled eggplant and portobello mushroom offerings!
We went after theatre, needing reservations, as the restaurant was packed full on a Thursday evening at 10:30pm!
Highly recommended!",1
4,"Roka is an Asian fusion style restaurant on busy Charlotte street in Soho London.
It's a busy fast moving place that offers a wide and not inexpensive variety of Japanese and vaguely chinese themed items. Expect to order Shared/group Tapas style.  It's loud, and it's fun.
They have an extensive drinks menu, and one that I found particularly tasty was their Bentai-san, basically a Manhattan made with Tequila.  Quite good.
 The Grilled lamb chops (called cutlets) here are an excellent starter.  The duck is fantastic too.  Sushi is high quality, but don't some here just for that.  
They have a tremendous selection of Sake and also Shochu (basically Korean vodka).
If you are looking for a fun meal, get a reservation and someone else's wallet!",1
4,"Roka is a good japanese restaurant when you needed to feel pampered. This is the perfect kind of ""Girls night out"" restaurants I like to go with my girlfriends so we can put on some cute dresses & heels and chat about our boyfriends or husbands over wonderful champagne and sake. It's like an ultimate pedicure for your belly.
Food at Roka is wonderful, we loved the sashimi platter, posu yellow tail sashimi, black cod on hobo leave, and many other dishes. The portions are rather small but very delightful. Expect a rather pricey bill at approx 100 pounds / person, a bit more if you drink a lot... but it's worth it.",1
4,"I was taken here for my birthday. I am a huge fan if Japanese fusion and did a little research before i selected this as my final choice. This particular restaurant specialises in islandic type Japanese cuisine with a modern an playful twist. All the dishes including my sea vegetable salad was made with fresh authentic ingredients. The overall atmosphere and neutral contemporary interior, combined with that stunning natural light made this a perfect early dinner hot spot for a summer evening. Our starting cocktails gave a perfect balance of fruit and alcohol. The impeccable service and selection of dishes and 'made-to-table' concept of the venue made my birthday evening memorable. Worth going for a late lunch also. The terrace had a great seating area outside too.",1
2,"Very disappointing meal at Roka. Quite simply not up to scratch across a range of factors, but mainly the service, quality of food and value for money.
Let's start on service: I cannot stand when waiters continuously try to up sell more dishes and 'recommend' the most expensive items on the menu. Ours did this on at least three occasions, grating on us more and more each time and generally just spoiling our mood.
On quality of food, the sushi was really poor. Nizuni across the street serves better at about 2/3rds of the price. 
On the dishes that did deliver, the price left a sour taste. Their black cod is undoubtedly amazing, but should be about £10 cheaper. Again you can get great alternatives elsewhere in this area for much more reasonable prices. Willing to overlook price if the restaurant delivers on amazing overall experience, but the poor service just compounded my negative feeling towards this place.
I've been told the new Aldwych branch is a much better operation, so given the strong reputation of the chain, I may give them a 2nd chance via a visit to that location.",-1
2,"My love for sushi always blinds me to the fact that London restaurants are not very good at making sushi. I live in California and I am not Japanese, so I am not an expert, but at the same time... I have a mouth and I have taste buds and I have other senses like telepathy and kinship with treefolk and who cares what else I am capable of, I know what good sushi is.
London sushi always disappoints me. Always. It is at the point where I actually don't think it should disappoint me anymore, but somehow it still does.
Roka is highly regarded. I think it even got some Michelin attention, but that could be fabricated and I didn't bother to check on that one. Anyway, people say you should go here and as a guy here for a table of one, it still took a while to find a spot, so people clearly still think they should go here.
It was just nothing special and the price was acting as though it was. The rolls I ordered all had some sort of gluten containing ingredients that weren't listed on the menu, so I had to send them back. Gluten in your food? Not a problem. Secret gluten in your food? Problem.
The nigiri was fine, but it wasn't that great. I had a rum and coke and that was the best part of my meal.
I went to Tesco after and got some food to snack on. I won't be coming back, though I will say that the service was pretty good. If you live in London and you are content with the sushi you have had in your city thus far, you may like it here.
But, be warned... you have poor taste. I'm sorry that I have to be the one to tell you this! Really, I am. I don't even know you. So I'm sure that stings a little. But it's true, and someone should tell you. So, it's me.
Come to California and eat our sushi. Or better yet, go the other direction and go to Japan. Then bring back what you learned and start your own restaurant. Please. I will visit you and pay you money for you to feed me.",-1
3,"90% style, 10% substance.
Quality fish Roka does deliver, albeit just tiny slivers.
It's a place one would take to impress a lady friend. See the onsite sommelier for something cheerful to go with the maguro.
Dropping £200 on sush did nothing to satisfy, and that's just my share. Still ended up at London Bridge Gaucho for dinner round 2.
Don't come hungry. You've been warned.",-1
5,"NB: I was lucky enough to attend a complimentary pre-launch sitting at Roka so cannot comment on value for money, and am unlucky enough to be a vegetarian so cannot comment on the meat and fish!
However, the food we ate here was absolutely delicious, from the glazed tofu (which was cooked to perfection, neither too soggy nor too greasy), to the granola dessert. The atmosphere is fantastic - if there are only two of you, I would highly recommend reserving seats on the bench-style tables, which face directly onto the grill - it's fantastic to see the cooking up close, and to hear the ""OI!"" shouted every few minutes.",1
5,"While they weren't super accurate with our reservation (we were seated about 30 minutes late) they simply crushed it with their food. Highlights included the yellowtail sashimi salad with truffle oil, the tuna tataki, the sashimi platter, and the insanely large dessert platter. The sake recommendation made by their sommelier was dead on as well. Service was smooth, I never had an empty water glass and the food was well paced.",1
5,This place ruins me for all other Japanese restaurants. Incredible. Superb on all levels.,1
4,"This a very nice restaurant, definitely recommend to any Japanese food lover. The atmosphere is great, however, the restaurant gets really busy during weekends which makes it hard to find a table. I am a vegetarian but they have quite a few vegetarian options on the menu. 
It quite pricey but worth it if you love food!",1
4,"All of the Izakaya restaurants I've been to in Japan (which you can read more about here) are very reasonably priced and are the kinds of places you could happily afford to go to every week. Roka is several levels of expense above that.
All the food was beautifully balanced as had all the delicate flavouring you expect from good Japanese food. Gorgeous presentation and a menu you want to order everything from. The Baby back ribs were a particular highlight for me as was the Black cod marinated in yuzu miso and homemade hajikami.",1
1,"Horrible, incredibly rude experience!
I've eaten here many times, and have enjoyed it until recently. Unfortunately, my last two experiences were sub-par, and the most recent so bad I cannot imagine returning. They've lost their edge, and are no longer worth it. 
Actively avoid this place.
We made dinner reservations in advance. Within minutes of sitting, we ordered the tasting menu, at their suggestion.  I've had it in the past; it's a large tasting menu, with many courses (twelve?).  The food was generally good, but it took them a long time (30-45 minutes?) to start serving us, and once they did, it was very, very rushed.  We were eating very quickly--even by American standards, and by European standards it was a flat-out race to finish.
Toward the end, they were bringing us multiple courses simultaneously, and taking away dishes before we could finish them.  Finally, they brought the desert--which looked pretty. I wish I could report on how it tasted.
Unfortunately, as they brought the desert, they also informed us that they had people waiting for our table, and they needed us to leave. They acted as though we had done something wrong. This before we'd even had a chance to eat our dessert! We pointed out to the manager that we had been eating as quickly as they served us, and that we wanted to finish the meal.
Now, here's the crazy part--the manager actually came and took our desert away while we were eating it, informing us that it was time to leave!
So here's my response:
We did not design their tasting menu. We ordered the most expensive item on their menu, and ate it as fast as they delivered it. It is not our fault they took a long time to get started, nor that they are booking tables too closely together given the menu they have designed, and their ability to serve it.
We didn't expect them to take as long to serve the meal as they did (2.5 hours total). And I hate feeling rushed by a restaurant who clearly cannot get their own act together.  But to actually come to the table and remove food, which they've charged us for, and tell us (in front of our guests) that we had to leave because they had booked the table, is simply inexcusable.  
Hey Roka: if you want your tables turned more frequently, don't take so long to start serving, and don't design and recommend a menu that you cannot serve in the time allotted!
The food is okay.  
The price is very high (£120 per person, without alcohol).
The service sucks.  
Avoid.",-1
4,"My friend and I decided to check out Fitzrovia and we happened upon Roka. We were attracted by the fishbowl design of the restaurant and the huge wooden front doors. Good thing about eating lunch at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon is there was no wait. However, that is not to say the restaurant wasn't busy. I reckon you have to make reservations in order to eat here for dinner.
The services are was amazing, especially by London standard. We sat down and immediately we were handed warm towels. After learning that my friend has gluten allergy and is lactose intolerant, our waiter went away and came back with a list of dishes on the menu that are safe for her. And when he served the food, he made sure to put all the sauces in front of me, so she wouldn't accidentally use them! 
However, due to the dietary restriction, I have to say, the flavor of my meal was compromised a bit. We basically ordered simply grilled dishes. The sea bass grilled over banana leaf was delicious, especially the smoky flavored part that was close to the slightly burnt leaf. Roka offers a tasting menu that looks divine, especially the dessert boat I saw on the neighboring table. I had serious food envy that afternoon. I am definitely coming back for the full tasting menu.",1
3,"I'm a bit disappointed as I was given so many recommendations about this place, but felt my dining experience last night failed to live up to expectations. My friend and I ordered glasses of wine and Japanese sangria throughout our meal. We started with the edamame, assorted tempura, and cod dumplings, all of which were delicious (as expected). When our main dishes arrived - duck and sea bass - we poked around at the dishes but were generally uninterested in consuming our meals. 
Did we just order the wrong dishes??
From the minute we arrived, we were excited to devour the food and keep ordering to hearts' content. This didn't happen :( 
I also ordered the sorbet dessert and the waiter was kind of rude. I wanted my dessert while my friend was still eating her main course. The waiter refused to serve my dessert until the entire table was clear and we were both done with our main dishes. What's the big deal?? 
In any case, I do plan to dine here again and I only hope my next time will be better, both in terms of food and service.",-1
5,"Following Yelp in the UK has not stirred me wrong thus far! Roka is amazing! My husband and I tried the premium set course since we wanted great food with not much effort and it did not disappoint. We also added the Japanese Wagu so it averaged to about $97€ a persons which was well worth it. We had no reservations, just walked in to the bar area. The restaurant was booked but we got lucky. The service was great, they even made me a Special Michelada once they caught wind of me trying to make my own! Turns out the head bartender is from South America and knows all about making good Michelada's in London! Afterwards we walked downstairs to the bar, which was equally awesome. Great music, great drinks and great service. Vibe was very hip and trendy but not too pretentious. I think we found a gem!!",1
3,"I don't know.  I love the buzzy vibe, drinks, the room and the staff.  But the food.....it's just ok.  The grilled stuff is excellent.  Same with Gyoza.  Love the broccoli, beef and others.  If you're from North America or Australia (or Japan) you'll be disappointed with the sushi.  It's just not that good for the price.  Go for the vibe and company.  If you want solid sushi look elsewhere.",-1
5,"Best meal ive ever had in my life.
the sake is smooth, the martinis are banging.
we ordered fillet, salmon, sushi, rock shrimp tempura, salads, and dessert. 
service is impeccable.",1
5,"Ordered the premier tasting menu and Sake tasting with a good friend. Service was beyond excellent and food very much up there with the high prices. It's not a ""once a week"" kind of meal but highly recommended for a special night out. Food is obviously made with care in an open kitchen (which I love). 
Would return.",1
4,"Roka London
Awesome! The sushi here is not as good as Zuma but the grill is fabulous. They also have a connoisseur/bartender for their sake... It's a chic restaurant in a populous area and it's really easy to find. The service is very good, I've also talked to one of the managers there who is French who is also very professional. I always go to Roka if I'm in the area but make sure you have a reservation just in case (it's not hard to get one but they do get fully booked sometimes).",1
4,"Great place. Been here couple times. Premium tasting menu was really good. The kobe beef was made really good!
Wish they did better job at matching the wine though - was not ideal. But the food is awesome",1
3,"I've had dinner here twice and the food is wonderful. There is also a bar downstairs with amazing cocktails you won't find anywhere else. 
Why only three stars? When dining there earlier this week with colleagues, we were (politely) asked to leave because they needed the table for another party. We had ordered dessert but were unable to have it. While they reduced the bill to make up for it, being asked to leave left a bad taste in my, and my colleagues mouths.",-1
5,"My FAVOURITE restaurant in London by far!  The whole experience is such a treat - from cocktails in the downstairs Shocu lounge to the experience in the open plan kitchen restaurant.  The sushi is top notch!  Do not leave without trying the gyu no tataki to truffle (seared beef with truffle - one of the nicest dishes I've ever tasted) and the black cod.  For dessert, the almond cake is a must.  
Ideal for a splash out birthday meal!",1
5,"All the staff at bar downstairs including Paolo were attentive, fun and professional which made for a wonderful experience with my date--who used to be a regular. Mixed crowd, great music and of course, the food looked amazing (though didn't sample as we'd come from dinner). Wonderful vibe all around. Thank you Paolo et al.",1
2,"While Roka is a beautifully executed restaurant with a staff second to none, the food is rather obvious and uninspired. Incredibly salty. It's a reliable place to take people who aren't hugely experienced with Japanese food, but want to experience really excellent service.",-1
4,"Four of us had two premium tasting menus (£79 each) and two seasonal tasting menus (£55 each).
The quantity of food seemed to be the same but the premium tasting menu came with ""better"" cuts of meat.  For example the black cod vs. the sea bream.  Or yellowtail sashimi vs tuna ceviche.  Both menus provided tons of food, you will definitely be full afterwards.
My favourites were the yellowtail sashimi and the black cod.  I think the rest of the menu was just ok and the sushi definitely was not the best I've had.
Service was attentive but some servers delivering the food had no idea what it was or which menu it came from which was a bit annoying.
Overall thought it was expensive for what it was but if you want to try something there, just go for the black cod and maybe a couple of other dishes to share.  The cod and overall atmosphere was enough for me to bump it to 4 stars instead of 3.",1
5,"Great quality and nice place for dining with friend. Tempura, sushi (try toro ) and the grill (Tofu, fish & meat) are simply perfect. Strongly recommended. Only minus: a bit noisy!",1
5,"Omg! Most amazing meal ever! My husband and I loved every bit of it. Tokujo Premium tasting menu, we can't move but soooo worth it! We also had the wagyu instead of the duck, amazing. My husband especially loved the fruit dessert!",1
3,"Roka was good, the dishes were interesting and the sushi was very fresh and nice but overall it lacked a bit of flavor. I am not sure what all the hype is about.  The hostesses at the front were very rude and uppity and for as quickly as they wanted our table it took a good 15 minutes for anyone to greet us at our table when we sat down.  We went down to the bar after dinner which was nice and a good atmosphere.  Too many great options in London to go back.",-1
4,The food is beautifully presented. My favorite was the black cod. I enjoyed the gyoza very much. Service was a little off thus the 4 stars.,1
4,"I'm visiting London and my friend was craving roka.  What a fun spot.  I loved the ambiance and they had lots of fun drinks and a decent selection of wines by the glass.  
I would definitely recommend the ebi no tempura shrimp with dipping sauce and the robata black cod which yum yum yum. 
Roka is coming to a number of gateway cities near you.  Our waiter talked about being asked to transfer to open new restaurants (Miami?) so definitely look for this place in other cities.",1
4,"food at roka is excellent, black miso cod is a must try, the only down side is the service, but overall it was ok.",1
4,"Expensive, and the waiting staff have quite a bit of attitude, but the food is just good enough to put up with it.",1
4,"Food was a bit over-hyped; we had a tasting menu and the sashimi first course was truly amazing, the rest was good but not exceptional. Definitely a lot of work went into crafting the dessert. Whoever handled our email reservation messed it up and confirmed our appointment for the following day instead of the date of our request. Waiters' service was great once we were seated while the hostress gave us an attitude after confronted with the appointment mixup.",1
3,"I may be looking at this somewhat controversially, but I only had an OK meal here. 
I typically crave blackened cod weekly, but the offering here was a bit lacklustre - almost like they'd made so much of it in the past that all the love had gone. There was something totally bland about it. Maybe not enough salt. Can't put my finger on it.
Sure I had a nice cocktail, some great sake and a few other wholly forgettable sides - but I can't get that cod out of the way to give it any higher praise.",-1
5,"I love this place.  I came a couple of years ago and when a friend reminded me of it, I decided to head on over for lunch on my last visit to London.  I ordered salmon sashimi, a soft shell crab roll, eggplant robata and a special foie gras appetizer.  The foie gras was served as four sliced disks from a large torchon, wrapped in seaweed, and served with some crackers and pickled vegetable.  Everything was beautifully presented, incredibly fresh, and could not have been better.  The one complaint I had was that the large portion of foie gras was far too rich and far too large for me but I couldn't resist finishing it anyway.",1
4,"Great cocktails and food, particularly the black cod. Normally I don't like lamb at all, but this is the first place I've actually enjoyed it. The spicy beef was better than the wagyu, especially for the price. The dessert platter is more like a giant boat so unless you have a large party you're better off ordering a couple different ones to share.",1
4,"I have been trying to book a table at Roka for over a year now 
The phone booking service is useless and online is hard to book if you are aiming for a dinner within the week - you have to book weeks in advance if you are after dinner 
However, I managed finally to book (online) a table for two on a week night! 
It is nice inside and hostess at the entrance was so friendly 
We opted for the tasting menu - which I was not keen on (as most restaurants from my experience stretch out the serving of courses to over two hours and to me that is too long for such small bites) 
Anyway, Roka's tasting menu service was very quick and yummy 
However, because I did not take long time to read (memorise) the dishes, and because it is extremely loud and busy restaurant , I had to ask the waiter once more to repeat what he has just served (only once I promise) and he answered my question in a sort of shouting tone !! Now I understand that he might not be the happiest in his job (I am not) and he might be doing this till his next casting is a success (he was handsome) but I did not appreciate the attitude! 
Each course was very good and fruit platter was epic 
I would definitely try to book my next visit soon",1
4,"I've been a few times, but recently brought the whole family on our visit to London.
I love the trendy decor, yummy Japanese food, and nice presentation
They serve sushi, other Japanese tapas, and items from a nice robata grill.  
Not much to say on specific sushi or tapas items, besides they are very good and do come with interesting presentation
We tried the special wagyu combo beef robata grill - it was very good, but I am not the biggest fan of wagyu, still too rich and oily for me
The rice hot pots come in these nice pots, worth getting
Kids each had peanut, vanilla and chocolate sundae, seasme poki sticks for dessert.  Looked and tasted great.
If there is any complaints, I would say service is slow.",1
3,"If Roka was less expensive, it would get four stars, but I don't think it's worth the high expense. I came here for a work dinner, so we could order a lot more than my un-rich self would have been able to afford, and sampled all kinds of stuff on the menu. It was fairly hit and miss - some items were delicious, some just good or okay.
If you come for dinner without a reservation, you will probably need to sit at the bar, but I liked that anyway because we could watch the chefs prepare the food. My favorite dishes were the nigiri with quail's egg and the desserts (we ordered a few and shared, and I honestly don't remember which ones - it was a whirlwind of food entering my face!) We also had some tasty wine, but again even the cheapest of glasses and bottles is pricey.
For London standards, I think this is fairly good sushi. But I've been to a few London sushi places now, and I'm realizing that the standards aren't very high. Strange, because most of the sushi I've had so far has been in the midwest US, and it doesn't seem like it's even on that level. I would say I'm going to the wrong places, but Roka is so highly rated for sushi! Oh well, London does plenty of other food well!",-1
4,Excellent food! Obviously quite pricey but you get what you pay for! Sensational beef filet and very good sushi! I only gave four out of five stars as the service unfortunately didn't live up to the standard.,1
3,"All stars for the food. The tasting menu was so good. The restaurant staffs (receptions, waiter, waitress, buser,..) gain zero star. they chatted with each other so loud (while most of customers were trying to whisper) that we could not enjoy this nice restaurant 100%. A nice restaurant should build a zen staff to make itself more valuable.",-1
2,"Even as a New Yorker who is used to rushed service this place takes the prize.  I literally sat down and was asked for my order.   Even in NY a drink order is taken first.  Secondly the food was ok, but not at all in line with the 100 GBP ~($150 US) tab for one.   I was seated at 730 and dismissed by 830. I tried both the robata and maki.  Neither were even remotely as flavorful as a mediocre restaurant n NYC or other parts of London like Spicy Fish",-1
5,"My new favourite Japanese restaurant in London. Really excellent and meticulously presented Sushi. If you want a hip trendy albeit very expensive Japanese experience this needs to be on your short-list.
I tried several dishes and was happy with all of them. Really enjoyed the beef gyoza (gyuniku to goma no gyoza or something like that!) and the tuna tataki salad. I only had sushi and appetizers but next time I will try some of the mains, they looked amazing. The cocktails were great as well, can't remember what I ordered but it had sake, cucumbers and some goodness. Service was attentive though one overly eager waiter seemed annoyed when I tried to pour myself water from the large bottle of Voss.
If you're in a small party, ask to sit by the Sushi bar, so you can see the chefs work their magic. The bar itself is made from several enormous trees which adds to the experience. The crowd is fashionable, so do dress up if you go.",1
5,"Amazingly displayed food, more like art I'd say! The flavour were amazing and I'd definitely return. Fast and helpful service too",1
5,Been waiting ages to come here as heard great things and did exceed my expectations. Great service and our waiter even choose some of our dishes. Being first time visitors they talked us through the menu and told us sizes etc. food was the best japanese I have ever had and the wine was perfect.  This place is on the pricy side but was worth it each dish had amazing flavours and was really tasty. Very accommodating to us having babies and we even fit the buggy in with us!,1
5,"Still the best Japanese in London! 
I've been here a couple of times now, and I can honestly say that Roka is the best Japanese/sushi I have had in London. And I've had quite a lot. But Roka is the full package: Ambience, service, location, design and of course the food. 
I was there for lunch and my friend and I agreed that there was not a singe thing on the entire menu we wouldn't love to have. The bits we selected were awesome, but I can't wait to come back to try more stuff. 
It's expensive, yes. But it's worth it if you want to splash out. You won't regret it. For a super-stylish, super-delicious eat in London, Roka is the safe choice.",1
4,"Have been waiting to sample Roka for a while. Everything was great. Only slight negative was being informed at time of booking that we would have a 2 hour time slot for the table which always irritates me slightly, especially at an expensive place.
Sushi and sashimi were excellent although my order of marinated sea bass sashimi was so small it was perched in tiny shards on top of a lemon half. At first I thought it was an amuse bouche from the chef due to the diminuitive portion . Gyoza very good. Great tempura and grilled sea bass (again) was simple and excellent. 
Attentive and friendly service and well organized. Cocktails were another high point. I like the open grill in the middle of the room. Buzzy vibe and cool understated decor. 
Looks like they have a cool cocktail bar downstairs. Maybe try that out in the future. 
Overall quite a pricey meal but high quality. Not an every day place but for a special occasion.",1
3,Roka used to be my favorite restaurant in the city. Had dinner tonight. Very disappointed. Service was polite but nearly incompetent. In the first five minutes we felt rushed. And then all of a sudden we were left alone for a very long stretch before our orders were taken. It was 6pm and the lounge was nearly empty. Kimchi was so salty it was inedible.  Being korean I have a high tolerance for salty kimchi. The lamb chops which are usually superb were just average and cooked unevenly. Temperature of all the food was a bit too cold. All in all still a decent meal but far from the standard i expect at this price and from this restaurant in particular.  I feel bad giving it just three stars as nearly every meal I've had except the last one has been superb.,-1
4,"Really excellent dinner here. Went with premium tasting menu highlights of which included top notch buttery sashimi, soft shell crab tempura, wagyu beef, and green tea chocolate cake for desert alongside some nice unusual fruits.  Also had some really nice wine served by the single glass owing to their coravin system. A little pricey and crowded but that's only because the quality is top notch. Would repeat. They apparently have 3 other locations in London now.",1
3,"3.5 stars. Not bad, but not amazing either. Quite expensive. For the same price range I recommend Sushi Samba.",-1
5,"We had a fantastic dinner at Roka in Summer 2014.  They made room for our party of 7 ""on the fly"" on their patio and we celebrated a 15th birthday with all sorts of Sushi.  To end it all we had a beautiful platter of dessert options.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
5,"When my wife and I planned a trip to London, we were told by many people that the food was not very good there aside from Indian food and meat pies. Our expectations were pretty low when we arrived at this Japanese restaurant, but I walked away proclaiming that this was the BEST JAPANESE MEAL of MY ENTIRE LIFE.
We ordered everything from the grill (rotabayaki): Baby Back Ribs (AMAZING, flavored like Pork from a Chinese Butcher shop -- trust me, this is a good thing), Filet Mignon, Salmon, and Tofu. All were delicious with a unique flavor that I haven't experienced anywhere else. For dessert, had the black sesame mochi ice cream and a chocolate soufflé/pot dish. Both were PHENOMENAL!!!!
Great ambiance, service, and above all, food, I wish I could eat at this place more often, but for now, will have to wait until the next time I am in London...maybe in 10 years? Would love to try the sushi next time, but don't know if can resist all the things i ordered this visit!",1
3,"Silly me for calling the day of to try to make a reservation- no luck. I was informed though, that we could show up and get a seat at the bar. Fair enough, I had slacked my reservation making duties, so sit at the bar I would. 
Sochu is warm, trendy and lit just enough to see your food/drinks but just dark enough that everything looks amazing! It's the kind of place that's ideal for a date and it seems like everyone there knew it! (We were the exception be prepared for PDA from every angle)!
We ended up staying down there for dinner because someone had just canceled their reservation. Lucky us! We ordered drinks- a glass of red for my friend and the kimono (which was delish). We ordered a number of dishes to share, which was fine, but there was no stand out. All in all, they were all just okay...",-1
5,"My favorite sushi anywhere. And my anywhere in this instance is pretty much all over the US - and London. I go to Roka on every visit - lunch or dinner, each one is fabulous. Not sure you save any money by going for lunch, unless maybe you drink less. The yellow tail sashimi is sliced so thin you can see the plate through it, a must have every time. As is the tuna tataki. Love the miso cod, the eggplant, I could go on. Great atmosphere, trendy without feeling like you have to be uper cool to go there. Very good wine list. Go.",1
1,"I had a horrible experience. We waited 30 min at the bar for a table because the original table was in front of the door. After our dinner we were asked if we can pay the bill right away because they needed the table. They assured us that we can pay, finish our tea and there would not be an issue. The moment we paid, we had 2 waiters and the manager asking us to leave. They were rude, obnoxious and demonstrated the worst customer service I have ever experienced!  The manager was so insistent that he basically stood by our table practically harrassing us.",-1
5,"Excellent place. We came on a Friday evening (c. 8pm) without a reservation. It took about 30 minutes of waiting to get seated (not bad) but we sat at the counter as all tables were booked. (There is a downstairs bar where can grab a drink while you wait, although we just stayed outside.) The counter is a nice option, though, as it allows you to watch the chefs as they work in the 'open kitchen' in the center of the restaurant. 
There are plenty of food options here and a range of alcohols. The beer selection is pathetic; how about some Baird, Ise Kadoya or Hitachino? (These are all Japanese craft beers.) Anyway, we had the glazed pork ribs, roast duck, edamame and beef dumplings. Everything was very, very good. The duck was more succulent than you could ever imagine, and I would recommend it. The prices for some of the dishes aren't actually that bad; a the medium-sized rack of pork ribs ran about 10 quid. All in, the meal was a little over 40, which didn't include any drinks.
The service here is excellent and everyone from the matre d' down to the bus boys is really on their game. Even the head chef bid us farewell as we departed. The ambiance overall is great. I can't really find fault with any aspect of this restaurant - except maybe for the beer, but I'm guessing I'm one of very few people with this qualm. Well worth a visit.",1
5,"Had one of the best meals of my life here.  top 10 for sure.  I am so glad that I made the decision to get the tasting menu.  While I wanted to go all out and get the premium tasting menu, the regular was still phenomenal.  I was scared that a restaurant with such a trendy ambiance would fall flat on the quality of the food, but instead it exceeded my expectations.  Even the kimchi was phenomenal.  All of the sashimi plates were delicious and my favorite dish was the sea bream (cooked).  It was amazing.  The sake selection was diverse and every bottle we tried was very good.  The desserts were also great - there was some sort of chocolate pot of mousse and a couple of other interesting desserts that were subtle and very tasty, not overwhelmingly sweet.",1
3,The food and service here were very good. But the price and the extremely small portion is why I gave the restaurant 3 stars. The main entree I ordered felt more like an appetizer. Maybe I'm just use to bigger portions back in the states?,-1
5,"I have been to Roka twice and both times the food was amazing! The tasting menu which allows you to try all different types of dishes, from Tuna Sushami to Miso Cod (which was my favourite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone without hesitation. The staff were extremely helpful and made sure your glass was constantly full. A great place!",1
4,"Excellent service and food.
The concept of Roka is family style eating but on a very small scale. The dishes are very small (our server recommended ordering 4-5 dishes per person). For example, the chicken and spring onion dish only includes two skewers. Our table of 4 ordered too many dishes to count and we ended up leaving about 3 dishes total at the table. I think a better recommendation would be to order 3 dishes per person and then order more if you are still hungry. The prices of the dishes add up very quickly!
As a side note, the menu on Roka's website is not inclusive of everything they offer. They have a much larger selection than what is noted on the website.
With 12.5% service included in the bill, our table of 4's bill was £225 which included food, one glass of wine, one mixed drink, one bottle of Coke (200ml), and one bottle of sparkling water.
Below are the dishes we ordered and our thoughts:
-Edemame - very large serving, nice sea salt on top
-Spicy tuna maki - the smallest rolls I've ever seen but excellent (nice crusty touch on the rice)
-Chicken and spring onion skewers - our favorite
-Salmon - excellent
-Sea bream - too meaty for our taste
-Sea bass - good but as a warning, it is served with skin on (deboned)
-Beef dumplings - excellent
-Lamb - excellent
-Duck - chewy, would not order it again, left all but two thin slices
-Chili beef - excellent
-BBQ ribs - very little meat, would not order again
-Chicken wings - even less meat than the ribs, tiniest wings I've seen
-Steamed rice - nice serving size, cooked well, needed salt (no salt or pepper on the table)
-Asparagus - grilled to perfection
-Broccoli - cooked perfectly, excellent taste
The only reason why I did not rate Roka with 5 stars is:
1. Serving utinels are not provided with the dishes, so you are forced to use your chopsticks or cutlery to cut off pieces or scrape pieces off skewers (e.g. asparagus). My husband and I met his friend and her husband for dinner and it was a bit strange to have everyone's cutlery touching all the food, especially since this was the first time I had met them.
2. There is not enough room on the table for all the dishes, so staff was constantly moving plates around to make more room for the additional dishes as they were coming out of the kitchen. Perhaps it is just me but they always seemed to move my water glass or another dish near my right forearm, so my arm was either always almost knocking over my water or rubbing in one of the dishes. They need to invest in some sort of tiered structure in the middle of the table that can swivel. The table was too cluttered and it was impossible to pass dishes around as there was nowhere to set them after you have taken your portion off the plate.
Overall, excellent experience. The nicest restaurant we have eaten at in London after having lived here for a year.",1
4,"3 words: BOTTOMLESS BUBBLY SUNDAY
I probably shouldn't be saying this out loud as it's pretty lethal. Basically you add £25 per person on the tap and we definitely made the most out of the £25. I think they might've stationed a staff at our table just to refill our glasses because it was constantly filled. 
Drinks aside, food was good. Standard Azumi restaurants quality. Fish was fresh, I've had more buttery yuzu cod, more flavorful tuna tartare and fattier o-toro from the same chain. But nonetheless really fab food by London jap food standard. I loved their fried eggplant dish. It's so simple and delicious. The green tea molten cake was also surprisingly good and I love how watching green juice gushing out of my dessert makes me feel like an extra-celestial being. 
So yes, overall 4-star because they made my sunday afternoon absolutely fabulous. It won't make a 5-star because I'm an uber-snob when it comes to Jap food. My advice is, go on Sunday, have a blast and take Monday off. oh, and go soon because if my friends and I keep going back there they might cancel their champagne offer very soon.",1
3,"Really nice sushi but the service was grim. Wait for a table. Don't let a pushy host cram you in at the counter. If you prefer a table, wait for one.",-1
3,"I don't know. Maybe I'm spoiled by the amazing Japanese food in San Francisco but I thought Roka was a bit too trendy for it's own good. Our food was good but overpriced for what we received while service was friendly but amateurish.
If you've got a wad of cash burning a hole in your pocket and want to hang out with the pretty people, Roka is your place. If you want great food and reasonable prices I'd suggest you look elsewhere.",-1
5,"I went to Roka for date night and had the premium tasting menu. It was a magical 7 course tasting menu, I still dream of the yuzu truffle oil dressing they used to drench the super high quality sashimi. The meal only got better with Wagyu beef cooked to medium rare perfection. The atmosphere was super cool with an exposed center kitchen/grill. Definitely highly recommended. 
ALSO! How could I forget the humongous dessert boat filled with sorbets, tropical fruits, brownies filled with green tea, and coconut ice cream filled with citrus amazingness.
I'm drooling.",1
5,"Roka does real special food. It's a fantastic restaurant doing modern, exciting and brilliantly tasty Japanese food. The main bit of the gaff on street level is open, casual with a little dash of Swedish minimalism and centred around the big robata grill where most of the fish and meat gets a roasting, if you're not eating it raw obviously. The menu is varied and as with all these sorts of restaurants best eaten shared with a group of people - the whole place has got a social vibe. For a little bit more romance ask to sit downstairs in the shochu lounge where the feel is totally different, red and black, soft sofas, big cocktail bar and pretty much the same awesome food as upstairs. 
Roka has won loads of awards which is cool but in sometimes the place itself can seem overrated or hyped by the media. Not so here, this is a quality dining experience, great for mates packing a good wallet, your parents, your work do and maybe a date you want to impress with a bit of class food and pre 'who knows what' atmosphere.",1
3,"Trendy decor and menu. Very expensive. Noisy. Loud, shitty music. A few of the cocktails were excellent. Wine list is well selected, but incredibly, disgustingly overpriced. Service was decent. Some of the food was very good. 
Good for expense accounts, or any case where you're not paying.
Butterfish sushi - extremely good.
Some beef carpaccio w/ shaved mushrooms - excellent.
7 people 600 pounds, including 4 bottles of wine, averaging 30 pounds per bottle.",-1
5,"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant I've been to in London so far.  We came here for a Thursday night dinner and it was packed.  We called ahead earlier in the day for a reservation but could only get something around 10:00pm.  We walked around Charlotte street for a bit and left our names for a seating by the grill and actually opted for that instead of waiting another 45 minutes.  Roka is a robatayaki restaurant (Japanese grill) so it was pretty cool to be seated by the action (kinda like sitting by a sushi bar) .  We also ended up sitting beside Jared Leto.
I loved the atmosphere of the place.  It was busy, live and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Around the grill was an interesting carved wood table top.  It was a little uneven but added to the feel of the meal.
The food was really good too.  We had a couple orders of maki, some sashimi, meat from the robatayaki and a few small dishes here and there.  It was well made and the fish was fresh.  I like the black miso cod, but it wasn't quite as good as Nobu's.",1
3,"I had really big expectations for Roka, however was quite disappointed. Don't get me wrong- the atmosphere is nice, as is the Shochu Lounge downstairs, but the food is very average.",-1
4,"Roka is a high end Japanese chain with two locations in London - one on the west end and another branch in Canary Wharf.  Overall it is excellent sushi and Japanese cuisine; however, you'll pay for it.  The Canary Wharf location is located on the third floor of an office building overlooking a nice park / square.
The decor is nice - they have a very unusual cut outs in their wood paneling around the restaurant.  It has a very modern and hip feel, which is designed to appeal to the Bankers on expense account.
Service is efficient, especially by London standards.  The waiters and waitresses come by often to replenish drinks and check in on the table.  Food is delivered promptly and with a minimum of fuss.
The food is top notch; although, serving sizes are small.  Their blackened cod is particularly good - it comes served marinated in miso and served on top of a banana leaf.  The sashimi is good - the fish is definitely fresh.  The rolls are not that great - but then I'm spoiled by LA sushi.
Prices are high - aimed at people who wear Rolexes and have expense accounts.  Sushi Rolls are typically around GBP 12, the Blackened Cod was about GBP 30.  
This is one of the better sushi places I've found in the London area and highly recommended if you're on expense account or have a special occasion.",1
5,"Make no mistake, this is as good as it gets. While I'm usually in it for the 'best value', I will be upfront and say this is a special occasion, splurge fancy affair, but the quality of the food, service and ambiance seems worth the dough. Or quid, if you will. 
We were invited out with some new and old friends here (and it happened to be Valentine's Day so we made this our celebration as well) and everything was incredible...not just for London standards but right up there with the best of SF and NYC too. 
We shared a boatload of sushi rolls, sashimi, meat and drinks...more than I can possibly remember, but my favorites included (but are not limited to) the lamb chops dipped in a spicy sauce (tenderoni) the salmon sashimi (like butta), and this insane Wagyu beef roll with truffle shaving (worth a decadent dance). Oh, and my fav dessert--although stuffed, we did not pass up--was this caramel sponge cake thing that I can't describe other than heavenly. 
Come here, drop lots of cash, eat lots of amazing sushi and Japanese meat and be happy (until you step back outside into the freezing rain.)",1
3,a bunch of white people pretentiously serving overpriced Japanese food. huge waste of money on something that is completely lacking in any ounce of culture/flavor. food is okay but you can do a lot better for a lot cheaper. (not to mention our food took an hour),-1
5,"I really don't understand how anyone could have had a bad experience here. We ate here last night, and I was blown away by how good the food was here!! Coming from NY, I've had the opportunity to dine at some excellent restaurants. When people say there is no good food in London, I tell them they just haven't been to the right restaurants. I think without a doubt that Roka is one of the best restaurants in London!!
We originally had a reservation for a table in the lounge downstairs, but one look at it and I asked to be reseated upstairs. While the lounge wasn't terrible, it was just very loud and more of a lounge to have drinks in, not dinner. Luckily, there was a table outside, so that was great, even though we didn't get to sit inside by the robayata grill.
Everything was perfect, from our food selections, the drink suggestions, and dessert (ok, so the only thing we didn't care for was how incredibly slow the service was, but the amazing quality of the food compensated for that). 
Do be warned that the portions are small, and not cheap. Here's what we ordered:
- Edamame: standard fare, nothing exceptional
- Spicy tuna roll - small but really tasty
- Black cod and crab dumplings - amazing!! One of my favorites from dinner
- Tuna tartare with quail egg yolk - amazing!! Must try
- Hamachi tartare with yuzu - very good. Can't beat the texture of a good hamachi
- Lamb chops - probably some of the best lambchops I've ever had in my life. Soft, succulent and extremely flavorful
- Sea bass with yuzu - this was sooo amazing. The skin was perfectly crisped, the fish was buttery, soft yet firm, and the yuzu flavor was incredibly fresh.
- Steamed rice - I know, how can you improve steamed rice, but here they added cracked black sesame on top, which made it very nice
Dessert:
- Chocolate pudding with matcha tea - very nice, rich chocolate taste, however it completely overwhelmed the flavor of the green tea
- Chawanmushi with fruit - incredible, satisfying and so comforting.
I was lucky to have my birthday dinner here last night. You should definitely check it out, too!",1
4,"Elegant and High End robot a grill restaurant. Great modern japanese cuisine excellent sake selection by Natsuki Kikuya the Sake sommelier. Try the Grilled scallops with Yamahai Sake. Below a very charming Shochu bar. Excellent for business or important dates. Pricey, but top level.",1
5,"It's very hard to fault this Zuma sibling in Charlotte St, though the only good thing to say about the noise level on a Friday night is that it's worse in the Sochu bar downstairsBut the ambience around the big robata grill is exciting, and the room is never less than packed with recession-proof diners (Heston Blumenthal was on the next table) who know that the food will be interesting and brilliantly prepared. We had the kani no kama meshi (the rice hotpot with crab and wasabi) which was like a totally novel risotto, delicious crunchy grilled asparagus with sesame, some very good tempura prawns, huge grilled scallop dumplings, a foie gras maki roll and some sushi and sashimi washed down with lots of Dog Point Sauvignon.
 The dessert was less successful; a boat of all the sweets on offer, but one doesn't go to a Japanese restaurant for the puddings!
 About £80 a head, so take your No 1 wallet!",1
4,"Excellent food and atmosphere. You can sit in from of the kitchen and watch them grill and prepare food. We had some sushi, sashimi, black cod, grilled lamb and chicken skewers. They were all delicious and well presented. The only downside is the price. Our bill for two was £145.",1
4,"Came in here off the cuff on a cold Monday evening. They seated us on the bar around the kitchen, without having previously made an appointment. Then before we had barely sat down, they were asking for our order, a bit too efficient, I thought as I had barely had
time to read the drinks menu, let alone decide on which course. 
The sushi when it arrived was amazing, arriving in a bucket of ice, and which mixed with the sauce just melted in your mouth. So I would definitely give them top marks for the freshness of the food, the presentation and the thought which had gone into creating the dishes. But I found the service a little too intrusive as they came by every 5 min to give the table a wipe, or clean away barely used dishes. Also at the end I found the price overly expensive. 
So to sum up, fantastic food, as good as it gets really, but the steep prices and over efficient waiting bring the experience down somewhat. I would say it is not an every day eatery, more of a special occasion place that should definitely be tried once.",1
5,"The soft ambience mixed with the delicate attention given to every dish has made Roka one of the most delightful culinary experiences in London. The tuna carpaccio with truffle oil captured it all - freshest ingredients, delicate preparation, simple but overwhelming flavor.",1
5,"Delicate, delicious japanese fusion in a hip, romantic setting (love the tree wood that makes up the sushi bar). A fantastic meal; we were awestruck by the seabream, the grilled mushrooms and the yellowtail salad. Next time, i'll go even more extensively with the grill. The use of few and incredible ingredients really makes each dish unique. Service is spot on. When in London...",1
3,"I don't know. Maybe I'm spoiled by the amazing Japanese food in San Francisco but I thought Roka was a bit too trendy for it's own good. Our food was good but overpriced for what we received while service was friendly but amateurish.
 If you've got a wad of cash burning a hole in your pocket and want to hang out with the pretty people, Roka is your place. If you want great food and reasonable prices I'd suggest you look elsewhere.",-1
5,"Roka - YUM YUM YUM.  Definitely one of my favorite resto in London.  The Robata grill is super super good.  Baby back ribs - perfectly seasoned and cooked and super juicy.  The duck breast is decadent and not forgetting the soft shell crab roll.  This place is definitely value for money when you compare it to Nobu at the Berkley.  Downside is probably the price but this is London.   
I suggest skipping dessert and head over to the nearby Charlotte Street Hotel for a glass of Pims.",1
3,"This used to be my go-to sushi place in London but it's gone a little downhill.
The food is still good but the service was terrible. I came in and had my water bottle in my hand and was told I couldn't walk in with it and was actually stopped and asked to put it in my bag.
The server also never put my order in and when I asked about my hot dish towards the end of my meal I was told they didn't have it and it would take 20 minutes.
The nigiri selection was good and very fresh and I have had great meals here in the past but it is no longer my spot for sushi in London",-1
4,"It has FOIE GRAS SUSHI.
 Really, that should be enough to put food-lovers into a stunned silence (or set the anti-foie gras brigade into outraged flapping), but my God, if ever there was a time to roll out the ""orgasm on a plate"" metaphor, this is it.
 I didn't try sushi for years - it's raw fish WTF? - but my worldly wise other half led me to Roka's doors in the manner of Dumbledore giving Harry a wand and booting him off to Hogwarts. Utterly delicious food, smashing cocktails (although downstairs' Shochu bar is a bit of a thrill vacumm) and a truly memorable experience. I also love the way the staff refer to you as either 'lady' or 'gentleman' in the manner of primary school Jeeves.",1
5,"Interesting Japanese food in flashy expensive, Charlotte Street. Yes, the atmosphere is very ""cool and hip"" - I don't mind as long as the experience is enjoyable. I've found the food to be utterly delicious each time I've been lucky enough to be taken there (that's 3 times nom nom nom).
 If you do want to blow the bank, I recommend the Black Cod in Miso, the asparagus stack and the unbearably good chocolate pudding with maccha (green tea) centre. Roka is definitely way above my budget for everyday eating but as a special occasion blowout restaurant, it's one of the best in London.",1
4,"I agree with Phil H... the place is trendy... 
Roka is one of those fusion sushi places that serves beautifully presented food to beautiful people. If that's what you're looking for, then it's perfect and sometimes that is what I'm looking for. However, I generally go for the hole-in-the-wall sushi place that  serves me amazing fish; no deep fried rolls, no cream cheese with my sushi, no silly salads: simple fish, done simply and simply delicious. I know those places in LA and I'm hunting for them in London. I'm determined to find them. In the meantime, Roka gets 4 stars for great quality fish and a beautiful atmosphere - even if it is a scene I wouldn't generally choose for myself.",1
4,"I had to eat at the London Roka as a promise to the staff at the Roka Akor in Scottsdale AZ, where I had my first Roka experience on vacation in September (reviews of places from my September vacation on its way!). They were curious to know how the 2 restaurants would compare on separate continents.
Both restaurants are dominated by a robata grill in the middle of the restaurant where you can see the chefs at work.
Drum roll..... well I preferred the Roka in Scottsdale though the London venue is also a good place to try Japanese food without breaking the wallet too badly. My gripes with the London venue are that the restaurant is crowded with tables close together and you do feel quite rushed with dishes flying in even though there's not always space on the table for them.
I had the premium tasting menu and again at the London restaurant, you do feel short-changed. In Scottsdale, the sashimi in the premium tasting menu includes top fish like toro whereas the London restaurant served salmon and tuna. Don't get me wrong, what did arrive from the London kitchen tasted great and I would wholly recommend a meal there but in comparison to the Scottsdale restaurant, it just came up a notch short.
The tasting menu allows a variety of dishes to be tried and is probably a good introduction for those new to Japanese food. Presentation is beautiful with the signature Roka trick of presenting the fresh food on huge chunks of ice carved from a block at the bar.
My personal favourite dishes were the scallop skewers - the scallops were huge and sweet and given a kick from the spices. The lamb cutlets with Korean spices were also tender and yummy. An unusual dish I've had at Roka was the kamameshi rice pot, a sort of Japanese risotto with king crab and a kick from wasabi pearls.
So a nice restaurant but Scottsdale wins.",1
5,Definitely the best asian fusion food in London. In my opinion better than Nobu. The sashimi is really fresh and i highly recommend the mushroom risotto (although it's not called risotto on the menu). If you have a special occasion I also recommend the tasting menu which is incredible.,1
5,"Simply the best meal I have ever eaten, and I've eaten at some pretty cool restaurants in the past. Epic presentation, awesome sashimi. Not cheap but worth it!",1
4,"I liked it a lot here. Very good food but the service was a bit spotty. Ordered a lot of things and sat by the bar, so that made it easier to kill the wait time. Will probably return again soon if I convince myself that the service will be better next time around.",1
5,"Roka is a busy restaurant, sushi and sashimi are delectable, so much so you forget how much you're spending until the bill arrives. Definite recommend to all sushi lovers.",1
5,"No one seems to have a bad word to say about Roka and it largely lives up to the hype. The restaurant sells itself on the dishes from its open robata grill but the sushi and sashimi are also exceptional.
 If you can, go for one of the tasting menus  highlights include wagyu sushi, grilled scallop skewers, grilled quail and their giant dessert platter.
 It's not cheap but I struggle to find much wrong with this buzzy restaurant and I'm usually very suspicious of over-stylised Asian places.
 In short, Roka is one of the best restaurants I've eaten at since I started blogging.",1
5,"I do love coming here when I am in London, especially if I am staying close by.  What I love most is the robata grill and the grilled garlic asparagus, Japanese eggplant and shitake mushrooms.   Gotta love them.  The sushi I've had has been decent.  
I once sat next to a renowned chef who was being wined and dined by the management and he seemed to be having food I had never seen there.  It was both impressive and humorous.
I love the exotic fruit plate; it is absolutely amazing!",1
4,"Very very good.
 Very very expensive.
 I love the room and the staff were bend-over-backwards helpful.
 Sashimi was overpriced for what it was, and the fabled green tea dessert had disappeared from the menu.
 Already planning a Christmas visit to dig into the tasting menu properly.
 Go if someone else is willing to take you and if the idea of Foie Gras sushi doesn't offend.",1
5,"Great place!! They use such lovely fresh ingredients, no sushi dish will disappoint you, in fact the tasting menu is so good that the first couple of times I was there I had that rather than choosing from the complete menu .The atmosphere is buzzing, the place is airy and vibrant. Service is excellent, which is to be expected. Keep in mind that it could be a bit on the pricey side. If you want to eat at the counter rather than at a table you wont have to book in advance on weekdays, but on w/e this place is crazy and gets packed even in the early hours for dinner. There's a bar downstairs where you can also eat and is a bit less noisy, and in my opinion it gives you a bit more privacy. I prefer the top floor. Definitely worth a visit!",1
4,"Let's get one thing out in the open - my name is Alex and I'm a sushi fiend. Ok, now that's cleared up, on with the review.
 I like Roka but I don't love it. Once again, trying too hard. What they do, they do very well but if they toned it all down a bit the experience would be enhanced significantly.
 The decor is fantastic, very modern, chic and enticing. The staff are excellent, attentive and knowledgeable if just a bit cold.
 About the food - when I eat sushi I look for three things; freshness, flavor and simplicity. If you're adding all kinds of ancillary crap to a plate of sashimi then I'm immediately going to be suspicious of the actual fish itself. Roka cannot be faulted on the quality of their food though, it was fresh, flavorful and well presented. If they move away from the haute cuisine just a bit and focus on their great product just a bit more then they'd be able to compete with Zuma and Defune. Yeah, I said it, what of it. I think Defune is better.
 One of the things that garners them an additional star in my book is their wine and drinks list. You'll struggle to find better in quality of quantity.
 I'd go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.",1
1,"Talk about the ugly stepsister! This restaurant is related by ownership to the stellar Zuma restaurant, but this outlet does not even come close to stacking up to the quality & ambience of Zuma. Roka's atmosphere is not as cool or fashionable as Zuma's (which could be a good thing, but the missing ambience is not made up in any way)
 I have eaten here about 10 times, including downstairs in the very cool Shochu bar (I recommend this place for a drink!), and the food is not great. They have dropped the crispy squid from the menu, and the there are no real amazing dishes here. Most recently I ordered the shrimp tempura (it was AWFUL), an assortment of sushi (flavourless and forgettable), miso soup (white which had a nice bit of oyster pieces, but overly salty), black cod (it was OK) and some hamachi tartar (which was awful).
 On the whole, the food was either bland, poorly prepared or overpowered by sauces. Meanwhile, the prices are just as high as Zuma, so you know what?? Just go to Zuma!
 This place is awful and getting worse.",-1
1,"Standards have dropped drastically at Roka! The service was terrible, the food not what it used to be. Most shocking of all was witnessing a chef at the open robata grill kitchen handling raw meat and cooked meat without washing his hands!!!! SHOCKING!!!! We complained ofcourse and the ""manager"" seemed gobsmacked! This used to be our favourite restaurant, needless to say not anymore!",-1
5,"In my memories Roka has the place as one of the best Japanese food experiences I have had, during my most romantic dates ever. But don't worry this praise is not going to be too sweetly flavored..the relation ship is over, now go there just for the divine food.
On my unforgettable dates we had this seafood tasting menu for two, that pretty much covered Japanese cuisine from raw fish to a divine deserts. They just kept bringing us different plates of food like art pieces, that was fun and cute to share. I have no idea what the bill was, but I am sure it was a lot. 
The place is cosy with contemporary interior and with a big open grill on the first floor. The food is amazing, not just sushi and sashimi but also roka and rokata, and other Japanese modern dishes with names I have never heard of. 
Because the word has spread around you need a table reservation during the weekends.",1
4,"The first thing to mention is that the food was lush! So fresh and just damn tasty. I was vocalising all the way throughhonestly think Harry & Sally x 10.
 It could have been better signposted, I walked up and down Charlotte Street twice before I found it (but I am slightly blonde). Even on a Thursday evening the place was heaving but that did not impact the level of attention from the waiting staff. We were constantly attended to and they were more than happy to help work through the menu.
 The sashimi was brilliant but that is a given so I will talk about the things I tried that was new to me and might be for you as well. The Ko Nasu (Eggplant) was magical. Seriously, it melted in the mouth and the flavours of the ginger and other marinade just made my tongue squeal. The asparagus with seasame seeds was also amazing, in fact my heart is skipping a beat as I write this - gosh food can evoke emotions - it was so exciting to eat something so familiar yet served up in such a different way.
 The only thing I wasn't so impressed with was the dark chocolate and maccha pudding (that had ROKA etched all over it!!) - it was YUCK but hey you might love it. It might as well have been marmite on a plate for me. There was some noxious looking green goo leaking out of it as well which I think the waiting staff (that recommended it!) mentioned was green tea somethingIt just looked like slime to me.
 The ladies toilet (I can't help but mention them in my reviews :blush:) was clean, small and dark. The lighting could have been better but I loved the dark wood and chrome. There were individual hand towels which I thought was a nice touch but no hand cream which was a bit blah.
 We stayed upstairs in the dining area so I can't comment on the bar below but it sounded really buzzy. I also know they do great cocktails or at least I have heard so but as I didn't try any last night I can't comment on this. My date and I went through a few bottles of rather lovely dry white wine though.
 All in all, I found it a great dining experience but although the company was much better last night and the food just as good, I would still choose my Umu date over it as my Japanese restaurant of choice in London purely on the understated glamour & exclusive stakes alone (oops does that sound as shallow as it reads?!). The atmosphere is a LOT more lively at ROKA though so it depends on what you are looking for.
 Can't comment on how expensive or not it was because I did not get to see the bill but I do know that I would happiy return regardless of who was picking up the bill!",1
4,"Fantastic sushi, vocalised my apprieciation throughout, it was perfectly presented, and it just melted In the mouth. Also it was so fresh I almost felt it flapping. We had no booking, and as it was just the 2 of us we sat at the central bar that surrounds the kitchen. Only drawbacks to the whole experience; the staff were too intrusive as they came a cleaning every 5 minutes, and the prices even for London were exorbitant.",1
4,This is a great place and the food is amazing. I love it. The Atmosphere is great and nearby you have the Charlotte Street Hotel which is great for cocktails..,1
5,"Definitely my new favourite restaurant in London. Shame my bank manager doesn't agree. And going against the tide, I have to say it's a million times better than Zuma - which is my current least favourite place to go.",1
2,"Wanted to treat myself to a nice lunch. Went with a friend. The food was delicious, but the service was a bit lacking. I a college student and I look young--and so did the friend I was with. I don't know if this contributed to the poor service we received, but it was very disappointing. When the bill came, we refused to pay the 'discretionary' service charge and were harassed by the waiter. Definitely never going back. The only reason they get any stars at all is that the food really was very good.",-1
3,"Since day one Roka has catered to a trendy crowd who want Japanese food but not the formality of a Japanese restaurant. Glass walled on two sides, walls which fold back to allow a terrace on warm summer days and nights, with the main robatayaki grill square in the middle edged by an elm bar and closely packed tables of simple yet elegant design, it's a place to be seen in.
The food is very expenive. Here though it should be pointed out that no Japanese restaurant is cheap. Top quality raw fish is expensive and the penalty of eating non-quality raw fish doesn't need spelling out. I would particularly recommond the aubergine from the grill with mirin, ginger and soy. This made this sometimes unassuming vegetable take on new depths of flavour.
A word of advice-steer away from the £50 taster menu. It gives you a full variety of the dishes on offer; but with some help from the waiting staff you can get some more interesting dishes at better value..",-1
4,"Roka is buzzy, very busy (almost rushed) and ultra cool. Like many Japanese restaurants the portions are fairly small and, before you know where you are the bill mounts up. With drinks you can easily spend £70 to 80 a head (including the 13.5% service charge that's automatically added to the bill). But the food is ingenious, beautifully prepared and quite excellent... leave space for one of their sweet dishes which are absolutely superb.",1
4,"One of the best japanese restaurants in the capital. Glorious sushi, amazing cocktails and excellent service. Be sure to take someone special and either go on an empty stomach or a full wallet as the portions are tiny.",1
5,Fantastic! Go for the Black Cod and the evening will be a success!,1
4,"I love japanese food. Even more than chinese food, and considering I am of chinese descent, it means a lot.
 I've been to Roka a few times, all were 'special occasions'. It's that kind of place, with it's trendy decor (love that bar made from a beautiful piece of tree) and it's even trendier bar downstairs (overrated methinks). The main attention here, is it's robata grill. Sitting in the middle of the restaurant, it's hard to avoid the lovely smells coming from here. And it's also the thing to remember when you are looking at the extensive menu wondering what to order.
 Anyone who has been to Japan knows that the restaurants tend to specialise in a particular type of food. It might be something simple like ramen, or something special like hokkaido hotpot. So, when you go to Roka, look at the grill, look back at the menu and order something that will come off the grill. I have had the tastiest asparagus ever experienced from that grill. Lamb chops, smoky and marinated in a lovely sauce, amazing. And from the grill. Everything else, including the sushi - not bad, not amazing. Desserts - rather disappointing in fact. Service, pleasant. Bill, look away and drop your credit card quickly.
 I'll be back for sure - Roka sits in the list of places for those special occasions where I want to go somewhere nice and have a great meal. I've paid more for much less. Much much less.",1
4,"I loved Roka. The atmosphere was buzzy, the food spot on. Scallops, dim sum, marinaded lamb was all meorable. It isn`t cheap but it far exceeds anything I`ve tried in other up market oriental restaurants. We didn`t book so we sat on the bar in front of the grill. I think I`d rather have a table if I were going with a party of four or more as you all have to sit in a row. The bar downstairs is intimate and dark with lots of stained wood and soft lighting but I wouldn`t go there for the bar alone. £9.60 for a glass of sauvignon was just too steep.",1
5,"my boyfriend took me here when we first started seeing each other and boy did this place impress, and the food was so tasty i still think about taking a trip to London just to go have the tuna tarter. yum.",1
4,"Have been back a couple of times since my last review and while I still find most of their dumplings too thick, service was friendlier and I ordered a prawn dumpling which was perfect! Plus my daughter absolutely adores the food there, so in the interest of fairness...",1
3,"Gave this place a go after reading numerous articles about how Dumplings Legend's dumplings are some of the best in town. We came on Tuesday afternoon and were seated immediately. We ordered xiao long bao, prawn dumplings and half an aromatic duck.
The xiao long bao was mildly disappointing. The soup was thick and slightly bland. The pork was as expected. One order came with 8 dumplings for £8.
The prawn dumplings were mediocre, nothing exceptional yet still very satisfying. One order also came with 8 dumplings for £8.
Surprisingly, the duck was the best part of the meal. It was crunchy and extremely flavorful. I'd compare it to carnitas in texture. Accompanied with thin pancakes, cucumbers, green onions and brown sauce, it was just an amazing amalgamation of flavors.
The service was great, very quick and friendly. Price point was also great, I can't complain about 8 dumplings for £8. But considering we went here to try some of the best dumplings in London, I can't say my expectations were met. For better and cheaper dumplings, I'd recommend going to one of the smaller dim sum shops right down the street.",-1
2,"It was getting late in Chinatown and we were craving dumplings. We saw that this place was full of people so we decided to give it a try.
Food: We ordered the Spicy Pork Siu Loung Bao, steamed prawn dumplings and Shanghai-Style Fried Noodles. The spicy pork Siu Loung Bao was nothing more than chili sauce and it was way too watery. The steamed prawn was the best of the three but the skin was thicker than I would have liked. The shanghai-style fried noodles was over sauced.
Service: Outside the door said ""10% off the bill of you pay with cash Monday-Thursday."" We asked the waitress about it and got an eye roll. We paid for meal in cash and got multiple one pound change. We then went to get dessert at a near by place and tried to use to the change we received. We found out that the change was older currency and they would not accept it. So, we did get the 10% only to be SCAMMED a few pounds. Terrible service is one thing, but you can tell they aren't very trustworthy people by the way they acted. 
Price: Overpriced subpar chinese food that you pay for sitting in a nicer restaurant. 
This place didn't impress us and we don't appreciate them giving us old currency. I don't recommend this place at all. Don't be fooled that this place always looks full. There are plenty of other food options nearby.",-1
2,"The good news: the beer is cold, and the wait wasn't too bad. 
The rest of the story: I came here because I wanted Xiao Long Bao and the place I love (Beijing Dumpling) was actually sold out. I should have just gone without. 
I ordered the shrimp toast, the crispy duck and one order each of their 4 varieties of XLB. The shrimp toast was ok. The duck was so over cooked and dry that I sent it back. But the real sin was the XLB - about 1/3 we're broken when they brought them. The rest were literally touching each other so you couldn't remove one without breaking the one next to it. Out of 32 Bao I found 6 with soup in them. If you don't know XLB the whole stinking point is that there is soup in them!
In a neighborhood with close to 100 Chinese restaurants, you can safely skip this one.",-1
4,"Despite the mediocre reviews, this place was packed for a Wednesday night. Probably helps being in the center of London's Chinatown. 
We ordered several dishes- XLB's, peking duck w/ pancake and bbq pork over rice. They were all fantastic, wish I could say the same about the bill but 40% of the cost is for picking a place in the center of London lol.
(This is a late review from November 2017 btw)",1
3,Had the recommended spicy pork soup dumplings and vegetarian wonton soup. Soup was good. Dumplings were so-so. Kind of dry and not well wrapped. Flavor was good. First time having them in London and thought they would be better. Had better in Boston.,-1
2,"Dumpling were pretty good, dont eat anything else..like foreals, if they dont got anymore legendary stuff!walk out. Im doing you a favor",-1
4,"Let me preface this review by saying that Xiao Long Bao is my LIFE so I have extremely high standards for it. I'm not entirely sure about the standards of XLB in London so I'm definitely surprised to hear that Dumplings' Legend offers some of the best in London after my meal.
I haven't tried other XLB to compare but I'm sure this city must have more amazing XLB to show! Overall - 4 stars because the XLB were great, don't get me wrong, but they weren't out of this world and this city definitely deserves better!
~ Atmosphere:
Incredibly hectic. The place was packed FULL, overall not too pleasant of an atmosphere to eat in.
~ Customer Service:
I've had a different experience to other reviewers - the customer service here is great. Very attentive and quick with their service. The food came out at the speed of light.
~ Food:
We ordered both pork and pork and crab XLB - both of them were really great and juicy, but the broth inside was just OK. I much preferred the pork and crab to the pork-only because the crab added an extra dimension of flavour that took their XLB to the next level. Overall, I liked their Xiao Long Bao but if you're a self-proclaimed XLB connoisseur like me you should keep searching.
Downsides: Ordered their custard buns, it wasn't custard but salted duck yolk (which I like, but definitely not custard so I don't know why they advertised it as such). Also, they don't offer Chinese hot oil at all unfortunately, only soy sauce and vinegar. Not too great if you're into hot oil like I am.
---
I like Dumplings Legend. I would say that they're more of a 3.5 stars, but I'm happy to bump it up to a 4 because I don't think it's quite there to justify a 3. The food was great and I'd definitely come back here again, but the search for the best XLB in London continues on.",1
5,"How can people hate on this place?
All the dumplings you want and more at super reasonable prices.
Always busy but never more than a 10 min wait on the weekends.
Go for lunch as this is when they s the most of their dumplings on the special menu that you tick things off.
Besides dumplings, their veg is always good but will considerably bring up your bill.
Very efficient staff!",1
1,"I have always liked this place and thought the food was great. BUT the last time we were there, we witnessed a cockroach crawling onto our table. At first, we thought maybe it was just a little bug and it happens. When we realized that it was a roach, we got the hell out of there but wanted to barf out our food immediately. 
I take hygiene score seriously and check it rigorously, I won't return to this place anytime soon.",-1
1,"Outrageously expensive and worst dumplings ever. Avoid at all cost. Don't believe the hype. It might have been good in the past, no longer. £14 for 6 disgusting dim sum? No thank you.",-1
2,"This place was not that good, and it kind of grossed me out.
The bathroom is dirty, and while this places stresses soup dumplings, they were some of the lower quality soup dumplings i have had. In fact, most of them were stuck to the paper on the bottom so it was impossible to actually get any of the soup from the soup dumpling. The bottom would rip, the soup would come out, and we'd be left with just some filling and ripped dumpling dough.
On the flipside, the staff was friendly.
The hot and sour soup was okay, a bit too sweet.
If you're in a pinch, don't feel like waiting, and want some Chinese food, this place will do the trick, but I can't really recommend it beyond that.",-1
4,"Definitely pretty tasty dumplings!!! Must get obviously. 
Fried pork chop fried rice - pork chop is def not what you expect. More like a katsu. Fried rice - yum!!! 
Shrimp shu Mai - yum! Nice and big too. Comes with 3. 
Fried salted dumplings - too small and where's the meat in it?! :(
Won ton with noodle soup - not too shabby but nothing that wows you. 
Overall, I would come back as it was good service, spacious and clean for a Chinese joint!",1
3,"We should have been turned off by the less than stellar health score posted at the door but the press about the place being the oldest dumpling house and the photos of Charles and Camilla had us head right in 
The broth in the dumplings was flavorless. The crispy aromatic duck wasn't crisp at all. The meat was dry and the skin was greasy and mushy. The shrimp toast was tasty but for the rest no. I'd venture over to the Golden Phoenix for good crispy duck. Still haven't found a soup dumpling in London as good as I have in Boston but will update if I do.",-1
3,"I mean, the dumplings, their main attraction is really good.
But evverything else is just average.
The spicy noodles I had were too spicy, bit otherwise lacking flavour.
Would not go back",-1
4,Solid soup dumplings. The make them fresh which makes all of the difference. The non dumpling dishs are ok but not the Star of the show. Get a couple of veg dishes as a side but stick with the dumplings.,1
5,"I love this place. I have been many times. 
Food is good, price is exceptional and you could enjoy many types of dumplings",1
2,"Not many vegetarian options and service could use some work in being personable. I felt rushed and not helped. I ordered just the soup and vegetarian dumplings, everything was just so so.",-1
5,Amazing dim sums and cantonese cuisine! Strongly recommend the pork long bao and bbq pork with fried rice!,1
3,"A very solid dimsum place, though nothing too spectacular in my opinion. 
We had the xiao long baos, prawn dumplings, prawn cheng fun and beef hor fun. Everything was good, though nothing wowed me. Interesting take on the prawn dumplings, as they had veggies inside which I had never seen before. On the plus side, the portions were generous for all the dishes.
Service was good and prompt. Note that you get a discount if you pay in cash. 
Ambience was generally clean and spacious. Probably one of the better options if you're taking someone to try out dimsum for the first time.",-1
2,"What a mess! When I sat down, a gentleman at the table next to me (and you know how those tables are inches apart!) kept complaining to his friend about how their dim sum hadn't arrive. They were American (I am American). A French mother and daughter two tables away from us as well as this table of American men repeatedly flagged down the waiters for waiting a long time for food.  I thought they was just unfamiliar in the ways of Chinese service, nope!
Our food began arriving because I ordered all over the menu. However, it became apparent that the complaints of my fellow patrons were true. First off, the runners couldn't even tell us what they were dropping off and argued that a dish on the table was tripe. Tripe is my religion. My boyfriend knows tripe--he's basically a butcher. That wasn't even the same color or texture as tripe. I returned from the bathroom and my boyfriend tells me the two guys next to us left and it was a huge drama because they refused to pay for any of their food or drinks because they waiting over an hour and their dim sum never came. Around this point, the mother and daughter received theirs, they waited more than an hour and unfortunately only ordered one type of dim sum.
2 hours into our experience, 4 dishes hadn't arrived. But! This new server came out of nowhere. He was so lively and friendly compared to the woman who took our drink order and actively avoided everyone in the dining room despite being the only server on our floor. I asked him if the plate in front of me (we tried to eat it but it was so dry and cold), was tripe. He laughed and said no! And very quickly and efficiently took that and our missing food items off the bill. THEY STILL HADN'T EVEN MADE THEM--otherwise we would've boxed them. He saved our entire experience. He even said not to worry about the service charge. No man, you deserve all the service charges. That second star is just for him. And we will probably give this place another shot because he was so great.",-1
3,"We came right before close and they were happy to serve us, but they were definitely rushing us. We tried to tell them we do not specifically like seafood but they still gave us shrimp dumplings. But, the pork and chicken dumplings were incredible. They served us extremely fast (probably due to the fact we came at 19:00). It's reasonably priced and in the heart of Chinatown.",-1
1,"This place charges 12.5% service fee, but they even did not serve guests. The waitresses were rude and ignored us, seemed very unhappy when we tried to order some water. When we asked about the service fee since it is not necessarily required in the UK, they were mad and told us that everyone has to pay the tips in restaurants, it is same in the United States. And did not even listen to us, they were like: pay the service fee otherwise you could not leave. Really disgusting experience in this restaurant. 服务员没素质又冷漠，从进门到最后买单不会说一个你好和谢谢，一脸不高兴嫌麻烦，最后还无理强加小费，说英国美国都一样都要给小费，一副高高在上无所谓的样子",-1
5,Pork and spicy dumplings are fab here  really good for booking out big groups would recommend this place for sure,1
5,Spicy xiao long bao had a nice peppercorn flavor.  Chicken noodle soup was perfect for the cold weather and spicy ground pork with spinach was on point.  Will go there again.,1
5,"Best xiao long bao I've ever had. Highly recommend the stir fried bok choy and the pork belly as well. I unfortunately don't live in London anymore, but I think about this place monthly at the very least; NOTHING in the states beats this place when it comes to soup dumplings. I used to go here and follow up my visit with some Happy Lemon and creme taiyaki from a nearby bakery (custard-filled waffle fish). Will return some day, I'm sure of it!",1
4,"I was a bit skeptical to try this but I'm glad I took the chance. I ordered the vegetable xiao long baos and it was so good! It's rare to find a veggie version because they are usually meat with a burst of juice - I think it's meat fat. But anyways, the order took a while so I assume that means it was fresh? Regardless, it was more than I expected. The price was reasonable for the amount. This is a great snack! I had it for a mid night snack and breakfast. Yum Yum!",1
4,"Pretty good xiao long bao! Not as good as Din Tai Fung, but still good.
I tried the pork one and the pork and crab meat. Both are equally good and recommended.
For the second course, we had roast duck and pak choy vegetables with garlic. Classic Chinese dishes and they were excellent. Duck was a bit oily and vey bony. I think the duck at Four Seasons down the street is better.
All up, was about £30 a person, which isn't cheap, but not bad. Meanwhile, I'll keep searching for the city's best xiao long bao.",1
5,"My favourite restaurant in Chinatown! 
Be sure to get the pork xio long bao- they are made fresh with a juicy and flavourful filling. 
On my recent visit we got an order of the Taiwanese three cup chicken which was also quite tasty. Have previously ordered the quarter crispy duck which was quite dry. I recommend sticking to the dumplings!
They are open super late on Fridays and Saturdays (until 3am!)
I'm looking forward to returning to try the dimsum menu, served until 5pm daily.",1
4,"This is by far my favourite place in Chinatown, because this is where you can get the freshest hand-made dumplings ever.
It is quite a large restaurant and it is probably always busy so you might have to wait a bit. While waiting you can already check out the small dumpling-kitchen where thousands of dumplings must be made daily.
The menu is a bit confusing and not completely consistent with the DIY order list but if you don't know what or how to order just ask the staff. If you want something special and you know the name but you cannot find it on the menu just ask and probable they will just bring it. It would actually help if you know a bit  what you want or otherwise just try to be seated next to some (Chinese) locals and copy ;-)
I was graving for dumplings so only had a nice variety of the fresh dumplings but I will definitely come back soon to try the dumpling soups and the steamed filled buns which looked amazing at our neighbours tables.",1
5,Dang! These soup dumplings are the very best that I have ever had. I thought the fried rice was good too but really I just ate a bunch of the classic and spicy soup dumplings. Went two nights in a row. That's how much I like them here.,1
3,"I confess, in the past I would have given 4-star review to this place, but the last time I've tried to have a decent dinner here on a Sunday night I was surprised by how the quality of the dumplings have decreased, and that the service is even more confusing. 
When we arrived it was a little early, the restaurant was far from being full. We were three people and they sat us in a table for five, which was fine for us. A little after we ordered the food and received our drinks they asked us to move tables, but to a table that could barely fit two people. 
In our previous table they sat a group of six kids, and from their look I can assure they were not happy, it was obviously too small. 
The dumplings were OK, I have had better dumplings there in the past so I was not very impressed. 
Location wise, the place is great, right in the middle of Chinatown and only a few blocks from Leicester Square station.",-1
5,"After a recent visit to a Dim Sum chain I looked up the best dim sum in London and this was list as one of the Top 5 according to Time Out.  So I thought I'd come and test it out.
Renowned for the soup filled dumplings as you walk into the restaurant you can see the staff freshly preparing them behind a glass window; reminds me a lot of being back in China.  We were shown to a table near the window and given a menu and a dim sum check sheet, there were some specials on the table too.
The dumplings were well presented and tasty and the soup dumplings were filled with broth, but there is a definite technique to eat them or you will lose your soup! I recommend scooping them out with a spoon then attacking them with chopsticks, unless you are really good with chopsticks - which I am not.  We also ordered one of the specials prawn toast, this has to be the best prawn toast I've ever had! It had full prawns with tails layerd on top of toast with sesame seeds.  If you see this one on the menu definitely ordering.
Looking forward to completing my Dim Sum list, but this is definitely a place to go.",1
4,"I had the pork dumplings, steamed ribs and chicken feet for dimsum. They were all REALLY good. Filling was flavorful and wrap texture was perfect. The other items were also well done. But the item I LOVED was the spicy beef soup!!! Meat was tender and there was lots of it. Noodles were chewy and cooked perfectly and the broth was so tasty and spicy and full of fresh herbs!  I'd go back just for the soup!",1
4,"For me, Dumplings' Legend has to be one of the better dim sums in Chinatown. As per usual, don't expect incredible service, but the food here is really good, their Xiao Long Baos are probably some of the best in London and if you pay by cash on most days at lunch etc, you get 15% discount (which effectively knocks off the service charge). 
The XLB's are tasty, fresh (you see them rolling them out in the window), packed with flavour and you get a fair few in one order. The crayfish ones are really good, but you can't go wrong with their classic pork. Just remember, all in one bite! Don't try and do it in halves because then you'll get precious bao juice all over yourself you messy pup! 
Service is fast, efficient though not particularly happy or friendly. But really, what did you expect? 
But probably most importantly, is they present you with a genuine receipt. Like, fully itemised, and not just a couple of wiggles on their classic order paper. You'll never get ripped off again! Yay!",1
3,"This restaurant does not necessarily scream Chinese with its decor like a lot of other ones in the area do, but fans of dim sum and dumplings will have a decent variety of fillings to choose from. 
We tried several of them (too hungry to take photos at that point) and they were all quite good. I particularly liked the prawn dumplings. If you, like myself, like to eat a lot, I would suggest getting a couple of the mains to share with your group as well.
The only drawbacks were that they did forget to bring one of the dishes and we eventually canceled it and also that the music was on repeat (there's only so many times I can listen to Let it Go in one sitting). I do not think it is a place I will choose to go again myself but if friends want to go I am not going to mind terribly.",-1
5,"This is my favourite place to eat in China Town!! I have no idea what all these less than stellar reviews are going on about. I have been here several times and have always been super impressed with the food. 
The food is beyond excellent. This place is famous for their dim sum and dumplings, which are very good. I usually get the crystal prawn, and their broth infused dumplings in the spicy pork. Beware though! When eating the broth infused ones you have to gobble it down in one bite otherwise you will get it all over yourself! I also like to get the crispy duck and pancakes, and I'll admit that this dish isn't the best you'll find in Chinatown but its still lovely. The chinese broccoli is also a top dish for me, as well as the pumpkin and prawn dish which is totally different from anything you would find at other places.
The venue is so clean its virtually spotless. Everything is white and clean and the glass partition where the dim sum makers work is wiped down several times a day and is always looking great. This is such a nice change from the other places in Chinatown, which seem a bit moldy with old sticky carpet floors. This place is also huge and I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to be seated.
The service could be better, but its not any worse than the other places in Chinatown which aren't exactly known for their exceptional service. You do have to hail down your waitor, and be very clear when you order otherwise you will get the wrong thing. But all in all this is totally worth it as the dim sum, dumplings, and everything else there is incredible.
Tip: Order the fresh squeezed apple juice, they literally squash an entire apple into the cup and it comes out all foamy and fresh.",1
5,Very nice dumplings and the manager had amazing service! Really on the ball. I would highly recommend this place.,1
4,"When you have a craving for dim sum on a Friday night - on the cusp of Saturday - and you roam around Chinatown trying to find somewhere decent that's still open.... Then you see Dumplings' Lengend. Never actually noticed this place before in the day, its stark white exterior and interior with white table cloth dining is out of the ordinary in colourful chinatown. Midnight dumplings it is! They had a (very well dressed) bouncer at the door, which was kind of funny. Service was good, there were surprising quite a few people there for late night dumplings. The food was great (yes, I was sober) ordered the crispy spicy squid, mixed dumplings and the prawn dumplings. All tasty. Would def come again.",1
3,"Kind of mixed on this place. One of the less externally scary looking places in London's small Chinatown for those of you that may not appreciate hole-in-the-wall ethnic foodie dining experiences. Inside it is clean, modern, bright and even a little hip with some artsy images on the wall and music playing with a vibrant beat. The staff speak passable English (and while this is really not a great sign for an authentic Chinese dining experience, it is, after all, located in the heart of London so it is necessary), the menu has a fair amount of interesting dishes including a list of about 120 dim sum items and noodle soups. I had prawn and chive dumplings and a clay pot rice with minced pork and salted fish. The food is tasty but a bit more expensive than some of the other dim sum places in the area and the real reason I am not as enthusiastic about this place as I should be is that they did not have steamed tripe on their dim sum list. I love that dish and use it as a baseline to measure dim sum joints around the world. It is a very basic, readily available ""famine food"" (offal made delicious so poor people would eat it during tough times) dim sum dish and this is he only dim sum spot I have ever been to where it is not available. If they start offering tripe, this place goes to 4 stars.",-1
2,"We spent three weeks in London last year and ate here with pleasant results three times. So when we arrived in London again, this was our first choice for dim sum. 
Unhappily the results were not good. To begin, the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. Staff helpful. Waited 15 minutes for a table. Each group is seated individually. Not family style. We ordered only dim sum. Started with wanton soup. Broth tasted like dishwater, no flavor. Colored water. Wantons large but not cooked enough.  All the other dishes were under cooked. The barbecue pork buns were over flavored with hoisin sauce and undercooked. The Chang-fen with prawn , again undercooked. The Cantonese shrimp dumplings. Same issue. Fell apart trying to serve. Minced pork and crab soup-Mai tasted like shrimp instead and pork undercooked and grizzly. Perhaps in their haste to get food to many customers, did not bother to finish cooking
Other customers who did not order dim sum looked like they were having a better experience. Would not return for dim sum.",-1
1,"I'd give zero stars if I could, we had just ate dinner else where and wanted to snack on some dim sum. After handing over our order the server said we had to order more food if we wanted to eat there, so we checked off a few more items. Then the mgr came over and said that we didn't order enough. So again I explained to her we just wanted dim sum, hence the sign outside said they served dim sum. Yet there was no sign that said we had to order a certain ""amount"" to dine there. Mgr was very rude about the situation and said we had to order food from the main menu on top of the dim sum menu.. so instead of causing a scene I told her to her face out loud that this was unexceptionable and I've never been anywhere in the world where I was treated this way. Yes I get that she wanted to make more money from us dining there. Shame on you I said as we walked out.",-1
2,"""Look, he's crawling up my wall
Black and hairy, very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread
Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now, I can't see
There he is wrapped in a ball
Doesn't seem to move at all
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor
He's come to a sticky end
Don't think he will ever mend
Never more will he crawl 'round
He's embedded in the ground""
Words from The Who's Boris the Spider. Except, on my visit to Dumplings Legend, it was not a spider, it was a Cockroach. And it was killed by a Louboutin not a book. But I like the song. 
It's a shame because the food was pretty good. The staff were all pretty friendly here, but seemed not to want to accept that there was a cockroach crawling on the wall behind my friend. And the Bouncer (yes a bouncer, it was late) was rude and just wanted to throw us out. Despite there being a squished bug of considerable size on the seat next to us. 
Oh well, at least it is a story to tell the grandkids.",-1
3,"Totally fine.  
By London standards; this is my fave dim sum to date.  
By dim sum Alex S has consumed over her lifetime standards; this is just fine.
Dumplings' Legend is best known for its soup dumplings, of which they have several varieties.  Go for the standard pork which - despite a too-thick skin - is still delicious and, well, ""porky"".  It bugs that we don't get our own containers of vinegar to douse each dumpling ourselves (just a tiny little ginger-and-vinegar dish given to each diner ordering dumplings) but, well...they bore through my requests for more with a smile, so points there.
I know it's unfair to compare and yet, well...I do.  Compared to San Francisco, New York, Toronto: all far superior dumpling cultures, and Dumplings' Legend falls flat in that ranking.  And for the price, these are not cheap dumplings.  And they're not stellar.  So...womp.  Craving for soup dumplings fulfilled, yes, but with a little side of ""ugh"".  
I mean, sure, I'll likely be back, but I'm totally on board with Leighton S who summarized so well: (paraphrasing) dumplings tasty, service friendly, not a bad option, no rush to return.  
Yelp note: really lovely clean and multi-stall bathrooms which, well, deserve a special call-out.  Hey-oh!",-1
5,"My co-worker mentioned this place and I was craving for some good northern dumplings at the moment, so I made a trip down there almost immediately.
However this is not a place for northern dumplings (jiao zi), but a little heaven for soup dumplings (xiao long bao). 
Their xlb is consistently good. Went there alone once,  took a friend who's very picky about xlb there twice, and everyone was happy with it. They have many options for xlb, including a very special one -- spicy xiao long bao. This is the first time I tried something like this and I am a fan!  The stuffing is soupy and flavorful, I could eat 2 orders (16 xlbs that is) all by myself.
5 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus tube station, and not too far away from Covent Garden. They also open till late almost everyday, great for late night cravings after musical/opera/shopping. 
As for other dishes, I didn't even bother to try. I know they have a big menu, but when a place is named ""Dumplings' Legend"" and has a window that shows live dumpling making, you simply stick with the dumplings.",1
1,"The staff was rude. When I got there by myself and saw the line, I asked the male host how long the wait was and he sarcastically said ""can you guess?"" and kept walking away .",-1
3,"We came here for dinner and were seated promptly. We ended up ordering 4 dishes. Xiao long bao (steamed dumplings with soup and meat inside), assorted meat with vegetables, spicy salted prawns, and beef with rice noodles with sauce. Dumpling Legend had an advertisement where if you ordered more than 25£, you can select a small dish for an additional few pounds. Our selected dish was the spicy salted prawns. 
The XLB is no where near what you can get at Joe's Shanghai in New York, but we were not expecting that. They were about average. Not the best nor the worst.  The assorted meat and vegetables had a good variety of chicken, prawns, and scallops. The beef and rice noodles were comparable to the US and the table next to us ordered the same dish based on staring at ours! The spicy salted prawns wee nicely salted and a great deal(about 8-10 prawns) for only 2£ more! 
The price here was a bit high at 35£, but after being exhausted from a long day of sightseeing, it was ok.",-1
3,"What we ate:
- dim sum platter 8 pieces, 12£
- bbq pork buns, 3 pieces 3£
- chicken noodles, around 8£
- tsing tao beer
- green tea bottle, 3.50£
pros:
- dim sum was nice, although primarily prawn based
- the ambience is quite hip, with fish tanks and china, although you get paper napkins
- you can see the chefs hand making the dumplings
- good service with friendly staff
- the owner greets and is very nice
Cons:
- quite overpriced for what you get 
- the green tea bottle was one of those imported teas that taste quite artificial 
- when you walk in the smell is a bit heavy, but fades over time
- the chicken noodles were pretty standard and not really special or worth 8£
Overall I am neutral about this location.",-1
2,"Thye main tourist drag of Gerrard Street is never going to prove the most likely place to find a star restaurant. When you have a steady stream of willing tourist victims, oops I mean customers, the urgency  for top class cuisine and value for money isn't the highest
To be fair, they do live up to their restaurant name. Perhaps to call their dumplings legendary is stretching it a bit but they were definitely the best part of our meal. The xiao loong bao had thin skin encasing the soup, which was flavoursome
Sadly, this was the highlight of our meal. The Peking duck promised much as it was carved tableside in the traditional way. The skin was served with pancakes, cucumber, spring onion and hoisin sauce. The meat was fried up but there was only a tiny amount to share between us
The main dishes were forgettable but the real kick came when the bill arrived. £45 for Peking duck and the extortionate amount we were charged for rice means this tourist trap only scores 2 stars",-1
4,For an American in London this was amazing.  We loved the dumplings.  Can't get these back home in ohio.  Soup dumpling was fun. The bbq meat is very good.  Crispy duck is a little dry.,1
3,"Nice selections, with a large menu. A very busy place. The soup was great. The duck was also done perfectly. Fresh food, served quickly. We had the fixed menu for 2 and it was small portions for the money.",-1
4,"In pretty touristy Gerrard street it's hard to find a place that offers good Chinese food. This is one of them. This restaurant specialises in dim sum and other types of dumplings (I love the cheung fun type) but also offers some decent mains. 
The place is popular with Londoners and tourists alike, and there's loads of Chinese people eating there, which must be a good sign.
The only downside of Dumplings' Legend is the chaotic service. Be prepared to get your order mixed up, reorder, ask where your food is several times. We got the bill before getting what we had ordered: they thought we'd already finished, they thanked us for our visit and asked if we wanted to pay cash or credit card. I said: I want my dim sums first! LOL",1
5,Highly recommend the spicy soup dumplings. Really good sit with fast service. Would come back again.,1
4,"Love love love this place.
It's dumplings, with white table clothes, but it's not too ex-y.  You can watch the chef make the dumplings through a window as you walk in. It's hands down the cleanest bathroom in a chinese restaurant, especially of that price point, that I have ever visited.
The prawn dumplings are great. The soup dumplings (xiao long bao) are ok. Not the best I have ever had but they are still pretty satisfying. All of the pork pastries are perfect hangover cures.  The cheung fun is moreish. Etc etc. The chilli sauce is also good. This is important. 
The only thing I had ordered so far that has been 'challenging' was the duck balls found under 'dumplings'. For the adventurist eater only ( I was a fan).  I really don't think you can go wrong though. 
They have all sorts of lunch special '2-4-1's with dumpling dishes and drinks. They also have an extensive large dish menu but I have only ever dumplinged here.",1
3,"I've been here twice now and both times I really loved the dumplings! The whole concept of the store reminds me about Din Tai Fung with a show-kitchen where you can see people filling your dumplings...this is really cool.
Like I said: soup dumplings have been very good both times. In fact, they're actually quite soupy and the flavour is also very good. As for the rest of the dishes...let's put it this way: they should stick with making dumplings!
What is really off-putting as well is the amount of tourists that come into this place...it just feels like a factory more than a true local place. The whiteness of the clientele is then only exasperated by the awful white interior. In fact, I was here with two Asian architects, who simply could not help but complain about the awful design!
So, let me recap: do go here for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao)...and maybe also have a couple of appetizers, but I cannot really recommend any main dishes...",-1
2,Food is passable.  Staff cleaned and set our table for the next patrons before our change for paying our meal had arrived.  I finally had to ask for our change.  They brought some change but I had to remind them what I had given them.  They tried to act like they didn't know what I was talking.,-1
4,"Wonderful xlb wonderful
Crystal shrimp are humongous here and delicioussss 
Fast hot delicious 
Classics done well 
Can see the chefs making xlb which is super cool!",1
3,"Sometimes you want dim sum at night though it's a bit unconventional. A few places along Chinatown's main strip will do them past 5, and Dumpling's Legend is one of them. They'll do the traditional soup dumplings which were ok, though you'd be best to steer clear of the vegetarian ones... I know, you might be thinking why bother with them, but if you're with a veggie that wants to see what the fuss is about, this won't really demonstrate anything other than a mild disappointment. The spicy pork wontons were good, not Szechuan or Taiwanese hot, but kind of British hot. 
It's alright but I'd be hard-pressed to say it's my favourite around.",-1
3,"A decent spot. Not cheap eats, though. 
The dumplings were tasty. The Peking spare ribs were tasty, but the sauce on them was massively sugary and syrupy.
The service is friendly and efficient. 
Not a bad option, but I'm in no rush to return.",-1
5,"Ok I admit I am completely biased. I started coming here twenty years when it was called Dumpling Inn. I would often come here 2-3 times in a week's visit to London. I could do that now except my wife isn't a fanatic like I am. 
This is my favorite restaurant on earth. Not for the atmosphere, which is fun (being Chinatown) but nothing special. Not for the service, which can be erratic when it gets busy (which it always does around 1 pm). It's for the memories and the absolutely fabulous dumplings. Xiao long bao are the best.",1
4,Awesome dumplings and so close to the ones I love so much at home.  Get the pork xiao long bao (soup dumplings); they will actually blow your mind.,1
4,"I visited back in November and WOW! Having already been to Shanghai for the real soup dumpling, I was excited to try this location even if it was thousands of mile away. The place was busy and I was traveling alone but was seated immediately. I enjoyed the traditional pork soup dumplings, 1/4 Peking duck and some shrimp dumplings and probably a few others since my bill was $50 British Pounds! The service was prompt and helpful. I did not feel rushed especially dining alone. I also enjoyed the ""dumpling room"" where the chefs tirelessly cranked out dumpling after dumpling. A neat little place in London's Chinatown.",1
3,"Had the Xiao Long Bao with Pork and Crab meat, it was ok. Stuff here wasn't that legendary.",-1
3,"I thought the dumplings were small, doughy, and the sauce was too ""soy"". I can get far better in my NYC suburb. These just weren't subtle enough, and the texture just not perfect. That said, the roast meat platter was above average and the Chinese broccoli a nice counterpoint.  Prices a little high compared to NY (even with tax, tip, and a favorable exchange rate thrown in). Service ""ok"".",-1
3,"Someone recommended this to me as the best place to get dumplings in London so I went in with high hopes. 
Unfortunately perhaps I've had too many xiao long baos in Asia, so these did not really satisfy me. No doubt they are not bad by London standards.
Other than that there are a variety of dishes on the menu. The fried rice is nice and fried hot enough so that the rice is dry. The pigs ear in chilli oil looked devilishly red and scary, but turned out quite yummy.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the drunken chicken. What is meant to be a cold, smooth and slippery dish instead was hard and tough.",-1
3,"I think this place is a little bit more western friendly compared to the other restaurants in chinatown.  But you know me, let's talk about the food.
Dumplings - The Xiao Long Bao is good, definitely better than most places.  The steamed pork and veg ones - a little disappointing.  I was actually really surprised on the small selection of dumplings on the menu.  I thought naming a restaurant ""Dumplings Legends"" you'd have more variety.
Other stuff - Spicy pork belly and spicy chicken something.  Both were good but forgettable dishes. Beef tenderloin - I've never had anything like this but I wasn't thrilled at all.  Seafood ho fun - probably one of the better dishes.  Singapore fried noodles - definitely had better elsewhere.  
Service - they were very eager to take out order but didn't care about us afterwards.  Place does get quite busy but a good place to go with larger groups.",-1
1,"I should have read the reviews before I sat down. The service sucks. Come only if you speak Mandarin or Cantonese and perhaps you can tell them to season the food. It's mostly bland and uninteresting. Crispy noodles and seafood tasted like it was a frozen meal from the market. The roasted meats were ok not great. Dumplings are better from my local shops on Clement Street in San Francisco.
In short, go across the street to Golden Dragon. This place isn't worth the trip unless the food is free.",-1
2,"Just no. (That's a short review in itself but read on if you are curious.)
PRO - I really don't know. I think we came in this establishment because we were starving and saw a lot of people sitting by the windows (READ: they purposely seat as much people as possible by the windows to make it seem like they are busy, smart and cunning!). 
CONS - RUDE service! I asked a waitress what the other table was having and she pointed to an item on the menu and I ordered it (it was an entirely different item by the way). When it came, I told another waitress that was not what we ordered, she kinda just shrugged it off and walked away (we were later charged for the wrongful recommendation). We asked another waitress (third different waitress now if you are keeping track) for extra sauce and she gave us attitude (come on woman, it is just sauce!). Prices were average (as compared to the other dim sum joints around Chinatown that we should have went to instead). The Xiao Long Bao (what they were apparently were known for) was also average. They had a spicy Xiao Long Bao version -- BAD. They basically shoved a spoonful of hot Szechuan peppers (including the numbing spice) with their usual filling and it tasted just spicy with no depth of flavor! 
CONCLUSION - The scallop rice rolls and quail egg shu mai were decent (but I'm sure I will find better ones in the other dim sum restaurants) but the snotty service will keep me from coming back. Oh, the bathrooms don't have soap so think of all the employees handling your food - RED FLAG!",-1
1,"I'm a bit torn on my review for this place.  The soup dumplings (xiao long bao, or XLB) were decent.  Just remember that you have to have light fingers and a spoon in hand when handling the XLB without breaking it! And break the dumpling skin just a bit, so you can slurp out the soup - otherwise you will probably sear the skin off the roof of your mouth.  No, I'm serious. 
Anyway, their XLB - sure, decent, delicious, soupy and not dry.  But anything else on the menu?  Just don't bother.  Its way overpriced for what you get, and I don't think there were any dinner dishes that were decent.  The service was quite shoddy as well.  I don't know how many times we had to flag someone down, only to be ignored.. but when we were able to get our orders in, we had to repeatedly remind them that we were still waiting on something.  
This is my first time having Peking Duck in London, and it was £45.  I nearly had a heart attack.  I'm not sure if this is the standard, but seriously... ?????  I couldn't.. i just couldn't wrap my head around that.  It better have been some fantastic duck, but it wasn't. 
There should have been some fresh hand made roti-style pancake to wrap the duck.  Instead, we were given WON TON wrappers.  Again. WTF?????  They are trying to pull one over you if they are giving you wonton wrappers.  I know others didn't see it as being a big deal.  Its like ordering an expensive burger, to be given some meat sandwiched in between 2 slices of white bread.  Or given cheese whiz instead of real cheese.  Yes, its a big deal.
I get that essentially its supposed to be 2 dishes - the second is a lettuce duck wrap.  Which was so small, that there were only enough for 5-6 people.  Complete rip off. 
We also ordered a bucket of rice, should have been the equivelent of around 6'ish packed bowls of rice.  We had to ask 3 times, then it finally came at the END of dinner, in a large sized soup bowl.  We ended up being charged £26 for that. 26 !!!!!!!!  around 2.50 per person, and we had 11 people.  But I know for a fact, there's no way there were 11 bowls of rice in that bowl.  
Total kick in the face.  I'd rather go elsewhere for food, and for XLB for that matter.",-1
2,"As my dining companion put it: ""dumplings: legend, service: myth"". I'd give this place a 4 for food and a 1 for service. The turnip dumplings were definitely the best I ever had, and the beef hofun really hit the spot. Two friends had the set menu, which looked ok but with rather small portions. However, we weren't given the time of day for at least 20 minutes after we were seated. I tried to catch the eyes of various waiters - smiling, glancing, waving - on a number of occasions; what finally did it was all of us standing up and preparing to leave (which brought over the manager right quick but unapologetic). As delicious as the dumplings were, the whole place put a bad taste in my mouth.",-1
3,"Well made dumplings and lots of choices. They were a little bland, which is not unusual for dim sum joints.
Still, they were good. Nothing spectacular.",-1
5,"Um. I'm speechless.
Ha! Not. 
Anyway, how I have made it to my advanced years without ever eating a soup dumpling is a mystery that I don't want to linger on. Apparently my husband has been eating them for years when he goes to San Francisco on business, so he was all smooth and suavé about it, all Mr. Professional XLB Eater Man. Dude has been holding out on me. 
I'm not gonna say these are the most authentic and delicious soup dumplings in London, because I have nothing to compare them to. But I can tell you that I wrestled down 11 of them on my own, no problem. I can tell you that they are full of a fresh ginger/lemongrass/pork flavor that makes them an absolute delight to eat. I can also tell you that I will absolutely be going back, because those little dumplings full of piping-hot soupy goodness are going to haunt my dreams until I have more.",1
4,"Specifically rated for xiaolongbao. Excellent broth, thin dough, delicious pork. Even though the place is in the middle of touristy area, the dumplings were excellent. I cannot attest to the rest of their menu.",1
2,"Vegetarian and vegan options are there, but limited.
HOWEVER, they do have the only vegetarian xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in town that I'm aware of- I've looked! They taste exactly the same as the vegetarian dumplings, but soupier.
It's good to share a few of the tasty, but nondescript veg dumplings with a friend, as it can be expensive just by yourself. I've always left here still feeling a bit hungry.
Clean, decent staff, and all the white table cloths seems a little unnecessary and intimidating. I probably won't be going back unless I need to show off a vegetarian soup dumpling.",-1
2,"Dim sum platter was average. Service was absolutely horrific seeing that they charged us over 10% service charge. The waiter was extremely dis interested and laughed when we tried to order side sauce, I asked for water that never came. Our meat dish came cold that had to be reheated. Extremely disappointed and will not be coming back here again. 
If you're looking for good dim sum, go a few doors down to Beijing dumplings. It's amazing!",-1
1,"Service was hurried and unfriendly.  Our waitress was literally throwing dishes on our table as she ran by.  The dumplings were good.  Other dishes were sub par.  Kung pao chicken had an uninspiring tomato base, a little chicken and way too many red chilies.  Does anyone actually eat those?  Our Shrimp with crispy noodles was covered with an unpalatable mucosy sauce.  Not sure if this is a good representation of London Chinese food.  I hope not.  We are spoiled by the extraordinary Chinese cuisine we have in the SF Bay Area.",-1
1,"Dumplings Legend is a Chinese restaurant in China Town serving a mixture of Cantonese and Shanghainese cuisine, it positioned itself as a specialist in Siu Loung Bao, a steamed dumpling with pork and hot broth. However the quality is extremely questionable, as the dumpling pastry is thick and rubbery which is totally opposite to what a good plate of Siu Loung Bao should be, other dim sums are also very average as far as China Town standard goes. You can get far better value elsewhere nearby.",-1
3,"Dumplings were just OK. On par with frozen ones. The stir fried green beans with minced pork were awesome! We liked the rice in a stone with tofu pillows.
You need to understand in a Chinese restaurant you will need to call for service and your check.",-1
3,Good simple with thin dough. Very fresh and tasty. The service was HORRIBLE and the waiters were rude and impatient.,-1
4,"Great dim sum place in the heart of chinatown. Definitely try the various steam dumplings, the spicy duck was my favourite---not too spicy, but super delicious. The grilled pork dumpling was also great, although I'd have to admit it was more pan fried than grilled. Stick to the dim sum and you'll be happy. My chinese dish of chicken stir-fry with chili and lemongrass was just ok. Price are reasonable most dumplings (they seem to come 3 to a plate) cost between 2 and 3 pounds, and mains are between 7 and 10 pounds. Not bad for lunch!
Service is friendly but a bit slow, however, the overall place was spotless---very clean and bright. A great break from the chinatown crowds.
Ask to be seated upstairs if you want a quieter dining experience!",1
2,"Dim sum on steroids. Prepare for a carb fest.
What they lack in overall dim sum variety they make up in bun and dumpling variations. Their weekly special creations can a bit baffling. Christmas lobster dumplings? No thanks.
Dining experience was fine - seated quickly on one busy Saturday noon. Service was slightly disorganized even for a Chinese establishment.
The soup noodle gave me somewhat of a gag reflex. Tasted fine at first but ended up losing it all over the kitchen sink an hour later.
Would I come back? Not too sure.",-1
3,"Dumplings' Legend was the dinner stop on a recent caravan through the West End, at the recommendation of Nida K. See, being my flatmate, she knows how much I love Xiao Long Bao, and wanted to give me another experience. So, all I had was Xiao Long Bao! Others had various dishes from dumplings, noodles, and full entrees, but me, all I needed was my dumplings.
First, Dumplings' Legend is BYOB, so BYO-what you want and you won't have to dash out mid-meal like we did.
Next, the pork and crab XLB was fantastic! The spicy pork, not so much. It was actually too spicy, but not in a fiery kind of way, but more in a ""there's too much black pepper happening here"" kind of way. I'd definitely go back for the non-spicy ones though.
Other than that, it's a standard dim sum restaurant, much like the ones I love in the States. That being said, it's obviously a bit farther from authentic, despite being in the heart of Chinatown. But, it is right in the heart of everything, which is a bonus.",-1
3,"When getting dragged into a restaurant goes RIGHT!
Friends of mine assured this place was yummy, and indeed it was! Between the three of us, the portions of  Shrimp Won-Ton soup, Spring Rolls, Chicken Dumplings, Three meats/Rice (Pork, Duck, and Chicken), Spicy Duck concoction and dim-Sum were plentiful! 
The menu is a bit over-whelming and the service was pretty slow once we couldn't order fast enough but nevertheless friendly. 
Getting there before 8pm is recommended, it got very noisy and crowded - a couple actually left after waiting too long to be served.
I want to go back and try a combination of items (mainly dumplings), wish the portions would allow - this place is definitely group friendly!",-1
4,"awesome food, lifeless service.

3,"While wandering around China Town on the 4th of July looking for some tasty Chinese food, I chose this place. The place was definitely authentic and i saw them making the dumplings in the restaurant so I thought they would be great, but sadly it was disappointing. I ordered the xiaolongbao, soup dumplings, and they were just so tiny in comparison to what I've usually had. They tasted great, the flavor was there, but it was so small. I also ended up ordering the roast duck and roast pork with some rice. The roast pork was decent, but it wasn't the real roast pork, if you know what I mean, the texture was off and it it just wasn't the same as what I've had. The  duck I had was pretty fatty, but the taste was good, albeit a bit greasy. I had high hopes for this place but they fall flat. I've eaten at so msny great Chinese places that this place just didn't compare. The food itself was decent, but it wasnt spectacular or anything to write home about. There are plenty of other places to visit in China Town and I recommend that you do.",-1
1,"This has been my favourite dumpling restaurant in London and it used to give me my xiao long biao fix which I have missed having moved from Sydney which has amazing asian food!
I went last night and was extremely disappointed. We were seated near the kitchen and could see packets and packets of pre-fab, identically packaged frozen dumplings being brought out from a freezer. The dumpling chefs were not making dumplings as usual but were sitting behind the glass, reheating the frozen dumplings. The dumplings that are usually heavenly were tasteless and were leaking goopy fatty liquid. 
Not happy!",-1
2,"ok,i really really really wanted to love this place, but honestly, it was just ok. For London where Chinese food is lacking, it was great. But honestly, the xiao long bao is just as good (if not better) in Los Angeles, where the cost is 1/2 of that. We ordered 6 orders of XLB, 1 eggplant dish, 1 rice dish, and our total came out to $104!!!! In LA, the same order would cost less than $60.  Each order of XLB averaged 6.60 - 8.5 eur. CRAZY. This place is posh and modern, and you can watch a billion chinese dumpling chefs wrap dumplings while you're eagerly waiting, but it's hard for me to give them a superb review bc LA is so much cheaper. It is what it is.
One thing I didn't like was the staff. We told them that we had a party of 4, thinking that a baby doesn't count. When we finally got called to our table, we asked them for a high chair. 
""Oh, 3 adults and 1 baby?"" 
""No, 4 adults and 1 baby."" 
The skinny bartender got involved (don't ask me why....) and yelled angrily, ""is it 4 or 5? 4 is different from 5 and 5 is different from 4! Which one is it?!""
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! He wanted to pick a fight over numbers?! This is a common mistake. So what if we said 4 and now we have 5? That's just more business for them! If the 5th was a real addition, I'd tell them to go eat at a competitor's.  
The hostess (NOT THE BARTENDER) should have just asked for clarification, not yell at the customer and [figuratively] spit in our faces. People like that bartender give Chinese people a bad name. They should fire him, not only for charging an arm and a leg for cheap alcohol, but for his rudeness and lack of bedside manners. Something tells me he's one of the owners though. Bah.",-1
4,"Ordered stir fried noodles, soup dumplings..yummy and Gailan.  All great!  The restaurant is a great place to have a great meal, fast and friendly service and if you want to enjoy your meal away from the craziness outside.  We're tourist and tried other locations and it was either old and shabby or very rude wait staff. Thx for a great experience!",1
2,An average restaurant for Chinese dim sum. Lower your expectation especially for their service.,-1
2,"I love my Chinese food, but Despite the staff being friendly, they dont speak much English!  I was less than impressed with the food. The sauce on the food, especially on the peking spare ribs was very sugary, and personally found the dumplings tastless! There are many great chinese places in london and unfortuanely this place doesnt live up the rest! The price doesnt warrent the qulity of the food either!",-1
2,"I can't believe I'm ""celebrating"" my 200th Qype review with one of my worst dining experiences in London in my 6 years here.
 Dumpling's Legend is a new restaurant just opened in Chinatown, specialising in a type of Shanghainese dumpling called Xiao Long Bao. The interior is sleek and modern, very neutrally white but feeling a bit soulless.
 We of course ordered a basket of 8 xiao long baos, and were not disappointed - they were good, although nothing extremely special. Having dined at Leong's Legends round the corner, I think the xiao long bao there are better - with a richer filling and thinner dumpling skin.
 We also ordered beef noodles and pork chop noodles to go with the dumplings, and were really disappointed with them. When the noodles came they looked pathetic - a big bowl of tasteless broth, with some noodles and limp stalks of vegetables swimming inside. The pork chops were average (again, Leong's Legend was better). The beef soup came in a separate bowl to be poured over the noodles - the bowl was way too hot to lift to pour, so we had to resort to using the spoon to slowly transfer the soup and beef over.
 Overall, a very disappointing experience, and we shall definitely not be going back again. The noodles gets a 1 star from us - the xiao long bao a 3 star rating - averaging out to two stars.

1,"Been here about 4 years ago not long after they opened. Great dim sum and good quality soup dumplings. Not Ding Tai Fun quality but decent for London.
Went there few nights ago on a rainy, cold London night trying to decide a new place or going back to this place. It's safe to say that my decision turned out to be the wrong one.
Ordered the crab soup dumping. I can tell the dumpling is not freshly made. Given this is 9 pm, I gave they a pass since it still tasted OK. Then the horror begins. Hot and sour soup looked like a bowl of thickened dark vinegar. The string bean with minced pork was way too oily and salty. The only decent dish is the tofu with minced pork.
In addition to the bad food, the service was just horrible. I know what to expect from an Asian restaurant, but this is even below par. Don't let the picture of HRH at the entrance fool you. What does a white person know about good Chinese food??",-1

3,Pretty decent food but service was slow and they mixed up the order.  The spicy pork soup dumplings were good so I'd be happy to eat 100 more.,-1
3,"I read a yelp review on how this was better than the Ding Tai Fung in L.A. and I was ready to put on my shoes and head straight over to try their dumplings (shao lung bao)!...
We ordered the crab and pork dumplings, the salted egg prawns, and egg fried rice.
Crab and pork dumplings: Taste-wise, they were not bad.  But, I'm not sure I would say that they were good though...  The first one I picked up stayed intact and tasted...ok.  The rest of them thereafter burst and the lovely soup leaked out on to the bamboo steamer....what a disappointment.  This did not happen to the Ding Tai Fung dumplings...
Salted Egg Prawns:  Ok, I admit that I do not remember the exact name of this dish but it is basically prawns tossed in salted egg yolk and deep fried with the shell and head of the prawns on.  This was mighty yummy.  The fried this so nice and crispy, you could eat the shell and all.  The salted egg yolk gave it a nice taste.  I just loved it!
Egg fried rice:  Well, it is as it sounds.  Nothing special.  Actually, quite mundane.  I was disappointed in the portion size.  For 4 pounds, I expect more than a small chinese bowl size.  But I'm jaded with my large American portions.  But come on!!  4 pounds for a bowl of rice?",-1
3,Dumplings were really good. Service was not on par with the food and final touch came when they asked us to leave quickly after we paid as they needed our table for the next customers.,-1
5,"I think this is probably the best Chinese Dim sum restaurant in the UK, I love everything especially the Durian pastry.",1
4,"This one was featured in Daily Candy and was on our list for sometime. At first glance, it seemed a few notches above your regular Chinatown restaurant, then you go in and there's nothing unique about it. It's just all white.
It was 5 PM, and we wanted dimsum. You can almost be sure, you're not getting much in terms of quality / freshness in Chinatown. Here was one place that proved it totally wrong. I suppose it can be argued, that's because the dimsum was on the starters menu.
The grilled gyoza was somewhat dry but OK. I'm not a gyoza fan. 
Then came the soupy dumplings. Super fresh, delicious, adequately stuffed, nicely souped. Very well priced at £6 - 8 for 8 pieces. The shrimp/crab/pork and combination dumplings are all super. 
A portion of spare ribs looked like a bad case of sweet and sour pork fried dollops. Tasted exactly like that. Avoid.
The thing to remember is soupy dumplings, especially after hours.
Service, non existent. But then it's Chinatown. You have to yell out to get service, follow up to get your order on time and exercise some aggression to get the check when you realize you've been waiting for over 15 minutes and now you're actually getting late.",1
3,"There didn't used to be many places where you could get good Siu Long Bao in London before.. but in recent months there has been a couple of places opened that specialises in this, one of them being Dumplings Legend (a rip-off of the well established Leong's Legend name methinks!).
Their siu long bao definitely comes up to scratch and is comparable to the one in Leong's Legend - with a flavourful soup inside and a thin wrapping. For those that haven't come across these little delights before, they originate from Shanghai with a minced pork filling. Contained within the wrapping is also some soup, keeping the meat moist. The trick with these is to eat them hot, with a little bit of vinegar and not lose any of the soup whilst picking them up! As the wrapping is quite thin and delicate, this can be quite a task!
We had the pork and crab meat one - definitely recommended. We also had some other items that weren't dumpling related and they're nothing to write home about. Would definitely recommend the dumplings at this place, but if you want a full meal with other foods, not so much.",-1
4,"Good value, swift service, and great xiao long bao. Spicy pork was a-ok, but their signature pork and crab meat dumplings were ridiculous and out of this world. I wish I lived in London just to have this great dim sum joint nearby.",1
4,"Though I had my doubts about this place, we came here for dim sum recently, and were pleasantly surprised! Like my inner-fatty, we ordered too much food, but everything we ordered was delicious. I especially loved the crystal shrimp dumplings. It was pretty clear that everything was made in house... unlike some other ""dim sum"" places in Chinatown.",1
3,"A number of other things on the menu were pretty good, like the San Bei Ji (#34), but the soup dumplings were slightly a dissapointment.
Soup dumplings are in my top 5 for individual food items to eat.  The whole process of putting them on your spoon, putting some vinegar on them, taking that bite, and sucking the soup out is an absolutely blissful eating experience.
The skin on the dumplings at Dumpling's Legend were too thick yet managed to still break when pulling them from the steamers because they were hella stuck to them.  The size of the dumplings were also much smaller than what I am accustomed to.  On top of that, the dumplings lacked a good bit of soup for the ones I managed not to break.
Aside from the lack of soup, I do think the contents of the dumpling did taste good.
A place that doesn't quite live up to its namesake.",-1
4,Four stars for the soup dumplings (as good as the ones i had in Hong Kong) and that's about it. The service isn't good but the dumplings are worth the trip.,1
2,Prices are ok. Food is ok. Service is poor. Would think twice before going back.,-1
4,"Had the grilled pork dumplings, they were served without a day e which I thought was odd. But the shrimp and pork dumpling soup was amazing, fantastic e flavored soup and the thin dumplings were    filled with delicious pork and shrimp. Could have eaten another bowl. Service was unimpressive",1
3,"The Dim Sum in Dumplings' Legend is of high standards for a Chinese restaurant in Europe. The famous pork soup dumplings (£6 for 8 dumplings) were good, but could have been served hotter, like most of the dishes I had. The Pork buns (3 for £2.50) and crystal prawn dumplings (8 for £6) were good. What I think was Fried Vermicelli Noodles & Hofen with mixed seafood and scrambled eggs had a few hard, uncooked bits, and the sauce was over-gooey - that dish did not impress me. Otherwise, Dumplings' Legend is a great place to go for acceptable-quality dim sum with a wide variety of dishes, as it has large tables, a bright and cool interior, and steaming bamboo skyscrapers.",-1
1,"There are definitely better places if you are looking to get full.  The dishes are little expensive and the amount is very small!  We had San Bei Ji(Three Cup Chicken)  for 10GBP and it was only like 5 small pieces of chicken.  We ordered a steam fish for 19GBP and it was only a half of the fish.  They used the other parts of the fish for other dishes.  Settings and atmosphere was pretty good for a Chinese restaurant, modern feel.  But totally not recommended!!  We spent about 50GBP(Two People) and had to get Burger King right after we leave the restaurant.",-1
2,"Needed to grab some quick lunch around Chinatown and decided to try Dumplings Legend. This not really a good decision it turned out.
 Not only were the staff on a Wong Kei level and did their absolute best to avoid us but the food was quite bad. The only redeeming part of the meal turned out to be the Xiao Long Bao, the soup dumplings that were actually really good. I can imagine coming back just to have the dumplings if I'm in the area and feel like spending 15 minutes eating and 30 minutes waiting for the bill afterwards, doing my best windmill impression flailing my arms wildly trying to get the staff's attention.",-1
3,"Went here because the other place I was supposed to go to had unfriendly service. This one was a lot nicer even though we only ordered three mains for four person sharing. We tried the dumplings and roast duck noodle. The noodle was not special but the dumplings were so good as they told. So it seems that dumpling is their specialty (from the restaurant name, doh!).",-1
4,"First order was for the  (Szechuan spicy xiao long pao). 8 were presented in a basket and we hungrily dig in. First test, see if the skin breaks when it is picked up with chopsticks. No holes..yeay!!
No holes means I get a whole mouthful of the soup stock when it burst in my mouth. The skin though thick enough to withstand pressure from chopsticks, yet it is thin enough that you don't just eat a mouthful of pastry skin. The xiao long pao was not spicy at all for me but otherwise is quite delectable.
 just love to try new dishes with intriguing names and this was the least adventurous dish that I was able to convinced my dining friend to try. Not knowing what to expect, I was looking forward to it. 
The dish reminded me of the butterfly prawns dish that I eat in Malaysia which is one of my favourites so I really like it. You can taste a slight hint of dairy but is basically fried chicken that was crunchy and juicy. I really love the fried milk granules bits.",1
3,"Dumplings' Legend should get 4 stars, and its food does, though the ambience lets it down.
Dumplings' Legend is described as Cantonese style restaurant, that said, chilli laden Sichuan dishes, as well as dishes from the Chinese diaspora also feature as do the legendary Northern Chinese Xiao Long Bao (pronounced Siu Loong Bao). Xiao Long Bao are large steamed dumplings - a bit like classic dim-sum  with the robust and earthy flavours of salted pork, turnip and spring onions. There were many Chinese diners there, often young, but also prosperous and (I imagine) either students or workers in Chinese enterprises setting up in London. That's the sort of place Dumplings' Legend is  at once homely, but also aspirational in style  an expression of where China is at now.
We ate there in the evening so used the evening menu, but I gather there is also a good dim-sum menu earlier in the day.
Food & Service
We were pleasantly dealt with and seated after a few minutes (the restaurant was v. busy). Unfortunately we were seated right next to the washing up station for small porcelain bowls and spoons  the noise! That small negative aside, the food more than redeemed our faith on choosing Dumplings' Legend.
We started with cucumber in chilli and Sichuan style WonTon  both delicious beyond belief and a masterclass in blending various types of soy sauce, sugar and oils to create super flavoursome relishes. 
We moved on to Venison in Ginger Wine, Malaysian style Chicken Curry, Salt and Pepper Tofu (stuffed with minced prawn), and Choi Sum with garlic  with one bowl of rice between us. All the dishes were delicious and a world away from the brightly coloured sticky pastes that seem to pass for 'Chinese' food in indifferent places across the land. This food absolutely sang with flavours.
We washed the lot down with Orange Juice and Mineral Water.
We didn't try the Xiao Long Bao, we will next time though :-)
Facilities
I can see what's being reached for here  a kind of modern Chinese aesthetic; clean, modern and confident. And by and large that is what the facilities are, but there is a sense of things starting to look worn (stair carpet) and cluttered (all those notices haphazardly stuck to the walls at the waiters' ordering terminals). What's needed is a Mary Portas style ruthless makeover  keeping the best of what is there and improving what isn't so good. Toilets are upstairs so not disabled friendly, and access to the restaurant is up three steps too (no ramp).
Price
We paid approx £32 each  not expensive, not cheap  but a fair price for what we had. We didn't feel we had been taken advantage of.
Overall
I like this place. I will go back to try the Xiao Long Bao and soups!",-1
3,"There are hits and misses but overall is a good bet when in chinatown.
 
chopstix2steaknives.blog…",-1
2,"I've recently read a good review about this place and since I've walked past it so many times I decided to give it a go. I went with two friends for dinner a couple of days ago and I was left more than slightly disappointed.
 Given that the place was named after dumplings, I was eager to order some to show my friends what traditional Chinese dumplings were like. To my disappointment, they didn't have dumplings on the menu, instead they had Xiao Long Baos, which are stuffed Shanghai buns. Was it that difficult to get the name right? Dumplings are dumplings and buns are buns, they are different things. Dumplings originated from Beijing whilst Xiao Long Baos are from Shanghai, they made in completely different ways. It's like calling a haggis a Cumberland sausage this has already got me started on the wrong note.
 I scanned down the menu and was left confused because most of the dishes were Cantonese, but there were some Malay curries and some Szechuan cold starters. I really didn't know what to order, so I suggested we order something my friends haven't tried before. So we ordered vegetarian Xiao Long Baos, drunken chicken, Malay chicken curry and a vegetable dish.
 To be fair, the vegetarian Xiao Long Baos were nice  they were well made, nicely seasoned and had tasty filling. But rest of the dishes were just bog standard China town. I had hoped with the opening of places like Bar Shu and Empress of Szechuan (though both Szechuan style food) signalled the arrival of more authentic Chinese food but Legend just felt like a step backwards. (sigh.)
 To finish the meal off, when the bill came it was headed Golden Harvest  seriously could you get anymore careless I at least expected the name on the bill to say 'Dumplings Legend' not the old Chinese restaurant that was once here and had shut down two years ago!
 My friends were left unimpressed too and had set me a challenge for a better suggestion next time  sorry!",-1

 Sometimes you just need to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon eating dim sum.
 Last week, I wrote about Leong's Legends, a decent Taiwanese restaurant in Chinatown which recently opened a dim sum offshoot, Dumplings' Legend, just around the corner on Gerrard Street. Reading comments on my post about LL's excellent Siu Loung Bao (or Xiao Long Bao) brought on cravings. It was time to investigate the newbie's offerings.
 On the site of the former Golden Harvest, the downstairs room is large and airy with white walls and minimalistic touches. It's fresher looking than some of its neighbours - quite like an Asian St John's in terms of decor. We were lucky to be seated at the front, where the whole wall is a window and the sunshine flitted in over our lunch as we watched the characters of Chinatown amble by. Upstairs is more poky, but does the job.
 We arrived about 2pm - prime time it seems. The dining room was packed and a small queue was growing rapidly. However, 3 dumpling makers were at work behind a glass panel at the entrance, rolling, folding and stuffing delicate dumpling wrappers. It's mesmerising to watch while you wait - although I do wonder how long it takes before RSI sets in.
 ""Whatever"", you say. To the food, the food...
 Our knobbly cheung-fun arrive first - three generous, slinky, slug-like noodles stuffed with ample slices of sea bass and picked vegetables. A fair price at £3.30. The next table orders the spicy stir fried cheung-fun which looks good and appears to be a popular choice around the room.
 Steamed sticky rice in a bamboo tube is delicious but so thick it borders on congealed - a decent set of biceps is required to scoop it out (£4.50).
 Barbecued pork buns are excellent - fluffy and filled with big, juicy splashes of sweet, red barbecued meat (3 for £2.50).
 Crystal prawn dumplings are small, pretty things, sweet and plump - but nothing which stands out above the norm here (£2.50). Chicken wrapped in banana leaf with Chinese is a highlight - deliciously moist, with satisfying chunks of chicken and Chinese sausage (£2.20).
 Finally, out come the pork Siu Loung Bao, for which Leong's Legends are renowed (£6.00). At Dumplings' Legend, they're also fantastic - the little smurf's hut shaped wrapper is quite delicate and so you have to be careful not to pierce it, spilling broth onto the table. It snuggles a parcel of meat within as well as a warm soupy broth which explodes into your mouth on first bite. These should be an essential part of your dim sum order here. The accompanying soy sauce contains thick slithers of shredded ginger - a lovely touch.
 We finish with a serve of 3 tiny egg tarts (£2.20) - these are TPG's thing more than mine. They're nothing special, but I quite like the fact they don't taste overly eggy,
 Service is efficient and friendlier than you might experience at some Chinatown restaurants. We paid around £15 per head including tea and service, although we could have done with 1 less dish and 1 less pot of tea (at £2.20 each) had we not been feeling so greedy.
 Both Leong's Legends and Dumplings' Legend highlight their ""highly recommended"" dishes with 2 stars on the menu. Interestingly, ""Legends specialties"" are distinguished with 1 star. I'm not sure what the distinction means.
 Dumplings' Legend is good, and it's already popular. I think it may become my cheap and cheerful dim sum restaurant of choice when those Sunday afternoon cravings set in.",1
2,Dumplings were okay but service poor. I returned the cold rice and the waitress use some excuse that heating more will make it yellow. come on you are talking to another Chinese. No one really wanted to deal with it and kinda looked not bothered. The place might look nice but definitely staff need to be better training.,-1
3,"This place opened in Aug, 2010 and is owned by Leong of Leong's Legends, so the food is going to be very similar.  The Xiaolongbao (shanghai dumplings) are good and so is the beef noodle soup.  Don't expect much from the ambiance, but the service is really good.  For better ambiance and better overall experience Leong's Legends around the corner is better.",-1
2,Went here for lunch. Foods alright. Nothing special but be prepared for the worst service.  No one took our order. Then they forgot half out order. No concern was showed.  What should have taken 30 mins took almost 90.,-1
2,"Over priced, small portions (got the dumpling set menu for three. Food was enough for two). Overly inattentive.  On to the next one. 
But their soup dumplings were good.  Gotta give it to them.  Din Tai Fung in LA is my all time favorite place in the states but I must say, I think these might top them.  But still, not coming back. The service alone did the trick to turn my appetite off.",-1
4,Amazing dim sum and noodles! That is all I had but I enjoyed every bite and it was def a good surprise because I normally am not so happy after a meal in Chinatown! Must go if you want to go for Chinese esp dumplings!,1
3,"for a place that has Dumplings in the name, one would expect a menu full of just that: dumplings. 
and yet.
there was far less then i hoped for. 
the food was pretty good, although several of the dishes tasted pretty similar, and there were not nearly enough sauces (in my world, everythign is a vehicle for sauce), the service was lack luster, but all in all it did hit the spot.
a bit more expensive then i would have warrented, but whatever.",-1
5,"Having read through other reviews I'm really surprised at the level of disappointment of people who have eaten here! I have been here several times in the past couple months for lunch and each time the food has been great  having said that we only normally order from the dim sum menu which is served before 5pm.
As it seems that most are disappointed in the evening menu I would suggest instead of giving this restaurant a complete miss to just come here for lunch instead and as a group of 4+ so you can order lots of different dishes to share and get a taste of lots of dim sum. Definitely try the soup dumplings and the turnip cake  it's awesome!",1
5,"Currently writing this review from the restaurnt. We came in here 4 days ago for the first time at about 11pm. Service was slightly absent, especially for a chinese reataurant but the quality of the food more than made up for it. These could be the best xiao long bao i have ever tried (definately better than shanghai) comaparble to hong kong quality. The other food was good too.
 Highly recommended. We drove over 60 miles for this treat.",1
2,"There are so many choices on the main street in Chinatown, that if a restaurant is slightly not up to the rest of the bunch's standards, it is very noticeable. 
Dumpling Legend is one of the restaurants looking pricey/pretentious on the outside, and when you take a closer look at the menu you'd perhaps gulp and think about how your wallet would suffer if you were to have a filling meal. 
With all the other competition around, it is difficult to stand out from the crowd. Dumpling Legend has achieved this by a modern, high class looking exterior and eye-popping prices of food. 
Chinese food is not cheap when it's in a serviced restaurant. Especially Chinese food in Chinatown which is most authentic compared to your local Chinese takeaway. Yet I do not see the reason of visiting Dumpling Legend when you can walk opposite and go in any other Chinese restaurants (which to be fair, look much more authentic). 
I feel that Dumpling Legend would like to market itself as top end Chinese (fusion) restaurant. But any person who eats out in Chinatown often can tell you that the more 'ghetto' places are perhaps more tasty with reasonable prices. If it is a special occasion that you are celebrating, DL could be a good choice, with a sophisticated decor and everything, and perhaps a less authentic menu (more like fusion). But otherwise I would urge to try out some other Chinese restaurants in that area.",-1
4,"Love this place - so many kinds of Xiao Lao Bao! It's definitely on the fairly pricey side for this kind of food. I haven't had anything here other than dumplings, but I have been to Leong's Legend (which has the same owners) and the food is good there. The place can be quite busy on weekends - so be prepared to wait.",1
3,"For photos and more:http://hungryinlondon.com/2011/02/dumpling-legend-chinatown/  In celebration of the Chinese New Year I met Mr. Noodles and some other friends at Dumpling Legend in Chinatown. This evening turned out to be not only a feast of some delicious and some not so great food, but was also hugely educational as I learned a lot from Mr. Noodles about Chinese culture, food and restaurants. Dumpling Legend which is located in the heart of Chinatown has opened some time last year and specialises, as the name promises, in dumplings. To experience the extensive dim sum menu, you have to come before 5 pm (dim sum are traditionally eaten for breakfast and lunch). I refer you to this mouth-watering review by Greedy Diva for more information about eating dim sum at Dumpling Legend. The restaurant is extremely brightly lit. This is good for taking pictures but not that flattering for teint and wrinkles (not that I have any of course!), so I would not necessarily recommend it for the first or second date to be honest. The menu depicts a happy Chinese dumpling with a little crown. Without wanting to be mean, if I had a restaurant I would not entrust my marketing campaign to the people who created this cheerful ball reminiscent of an onion As Mr. Noodles and I are both working hard in our non-blogging related day jobs to be able to afford eating out all the time, we only managed to meet up in the evening and therefore had to choose from the evening menu with a limited dim sum selection. Mr. Noodles pointed out that Dumpling Legend does not appear to specialise in a speficic Chinese cuisine, as the dishes on the menu stemmed from Canton, Sichuan, Malaysia and Taiwan. Mr. Noodles chose the dishes. He ordered a very interesting mix of starters and mains, however, we got them served all at the same time. I didn't like this at all. Firstly, you expect dishes to be served one after the other when they are stated as 'starter' and 'main' in the menu (otherwise why bother doing this?) and secondly, we really had to rush to eat everything while it was still hot/warm. The meal therefore started with a huge minus for Dumpling Legend In summary, the dishes were a rather mixed bag of delicious, OK and not very good. The supposed starters: I rather enjoyed the Cucumber in Chilli Oil (£4) which is a typical Sichuan dish. The fresh and cold cucumber and the hotness of the sauce provided an interesting contrast. The Sweet Potato Fried with Salted Egg Yolk (£4.50) did not taste very Chinese in my opinion and was strangely addictive. Somehow reminded me of the zucca fritta at Zucca. Very successful were the Sichuan-style Spicy Won-ton (£4.50). The delicious savoury filling was wrapped into light won ton skin and came with plenty of mouth-tingling chili sauce. We did fight a little over those A real Chinese specialty are the Pork Crab Meat Siu Loung Bao (£6.50). When I ate Siu Long Baos for the first time at Leong's Legend I burnt my mouth terribly as this type of dim sum contains not only solid fillings but also hot soup. The version at Dumpling Legends did not look very pretty but tasted heavenly. Mr. Noodles taught me how to eat them and I want to share this knowledge with you to save you from injury. You grab one of the dumplings with your chopsticks and bite into it holding it over one of the big Chinese spoons. Then you can enjoy the dumpling and afterward savour the soup collected in the spoon. A real disappointment were the Steamed Prawn Dumplings (£6). Again they did not look very appealing but in this case this also applied to the taste. The skin was too thick and the filling tasteless. Stay away from these! The dishes we had wanted as mains:I have never eaten Taiwanese Three-cup Chicken (with soy sauce, sesame oil & rice wine) (£9.50) so I did not have much comparison but for Mr Noodles this was the most disappointing part of the meal. According to him, this dish, if done well, is extraordinarily delicious. This one clearly wasn't. The chicken was kind of slimy, the sauce tasted only of soy sauce and I could not pick up any sesame oil. Overall this dish lacked any redeeming qualities. You wouldn't think that something as delicious as the Seabass Fillet Steamed with Soy Sauce (£17.50) can come from the same kitchen as the unsuccessful 3 Cup Chicken: Wonderfully tender sea bass with Chinese spring onions and ginger in a light and tasty soy broth was my favourite dish of the evening. I had a similarly delectable Chinese sea bass at Goldfish City close to Bank. The other two mains clearly did not rock my boat. The Stir-fried Choi-sum with Garlic (£7.80) was not too bad but did not leave any lasting impression. Celebrating the Chinese New Year you have to eat noodles as noodles represent longevity. Also when you go out with Mr Noodles you have to eat noodles, but I think you would have guessed that much :) . The Fried Wide Rice Noodles with Beef (£7.50) were boring and insipid. I mixed them with the chili sauce coming with",-1
1,"Shrimp wonton soup-ok. Dumplings are kind of like Din Tai Fung, but saltier and not as good. The rest of the dim sum- terrible and salty.  I swell up and get a bad headache if I consume too much msg.  I swelled up and had a bad headache right after eating here. Just coincidence?  I think this place should only be visited by people who are not sensitive to msg, salt, and taste...",-1
5,"Every time I'm in London, I try and visit Tayyabs. It's usually packed with people which is always a good sign. Their food is authentic and explodes with flavor.
This time we ordered the lamp chops, chicken Karahi and their Tayyabs special dry lamb dish. Their mango lassi was amazing and their dessert was good. 
Overall, I would recommend trying this place out.",1
4,"Can any trip to London be considered complete if you haven't been to Tayyabs??  The answer is simple ...NO!
We drove all the way from Trafalgar Square to get here by cab!
My old college mate Asif (from Dallas Tx) and his family were meeting us for dinner here which was the icing on the cake .... we both having flown across the Pond to dine here was ironic!
The restaurant was packed and the ambiance was nice.
Service was very good.
We started with the Mixed Grill followed by Chicken Kheema, Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Chops, Biryani and fresh naan!
The evening passed way to quickly and we had to get back as were departing for Paris early the next morning!
WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!!",1
5,"How can I describe this place? Perfection! A friend recommended that I try Tayyabs on my visit to London. Hands down the best Indian food in the city in my opinion. 
I ordered the karahi gosthe and my brother ordered the kababs. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned. The samosas were a good size and equally flavorful. Also ordered the mango lassi because it has such a unique flavor! 
The service: Beyond excellent. My phone ran out of batteries and I needed an outlet to plug it in. Not only did the staff found me an outlet, they guarded the phone, trouble shot issues when it wasn't charging and made sure I got my Uber. The best type of people. 
We loved this place so much we went to dinner twice in five days. 
The only tip I would give new visitors is to take an Uber rather then the train. The location of the restaurant is a bit out of the way.",1
5,"Absolutely must visit if you enjoy Indian food.  Recommended by an Indian friend that this was the best Indian food outside of Mumbai.  About 30 min ride from Central London but this is the real deal.  A few blocks from Brick Lane this place is packed with locals, visitors, and local workers and hospital staff.  This place probably seats 250 ppl and was packed 30 minutes immediately after opening on a weekday.
Started with a pitcher of mango lassi that was nice and refreshing not too thick or watery.  Lamb chop appetizer might as well been an entree with 4 huge chops.  Had to try the British national dish of chicken Tikka masala which did not disappoint as it was both richly sauced and tender.  But the star of the meal was the stir fried ""dry meat"" which was like an explosion of spices, savory and spicy.  
Can't wait to visit again next time.",1
3,"The place was packed when we came and had to wait around 20 minutes to get seated. I was stoked for this place. The food looked super good. We ordered the garlic naan, meat biriyani, and the lamb saag. The garlic naan with the lamb was good but I was expecting something better. The meat biriyani was sooo weird it tasted like flowers and perfume. Maybe we just ordered the wrong items but I wasn't the biggest fan of the food.",-1
5,"I take people visiting London to Tayyabs for multiple reasons:
- It's a bit off the beaten path, so not many tourists would think to go here. 
- They have delicious Indian food, with a ton of meat and vegetarian options.
- The prices are SO GOOD.
- It's BYOB, so you can bring whatever drinks you want! 
- It's incredibly popular, which could be a negative for some as there's usually a line, but it's fast and efficient, and always loud and fun. 
- They take reservations, so you actually can't complain about the line! 
- Meat eaters are always ordering the ribs, and they look fun because they come out on this crazy sizzling platter! So, you should probs try them if you're into that. 
I love this place, and I will continue to come here with friends. They're mixed veggie curries, Dahl curries, garlic naan, and samosas do not disappoint.",1
5,Great food if you like Indian cousin. The rumors tell that this restaurant is top 3 in London if you are in to curry.,1
4,It's a little tight in here but I think these guys easily have the best lamb chops going,1
4,"Hell to the yeah! We ate here our last night in London and we were impressed. Excellent customer service. Clean restaurant and delicious food. The lamb chops and sheekh kebabs were my fave! The biryani meat to rice ratio was annoying. There was too much meat and not enough rice and the portion was tiny. Then they also brought out biryani sauce with additional meat. That was great but had there been more rice we could have added the sauce, which essentially was like another curry. Rice is so cheap so I'm not sure why they were stingy with it. Mango lassi was delicious, kheema samosa perfect. Chicken karahi was more one a chicken tikka masala but still okay. Overall we really enjoyed our dinner here! If you're in London.....go!",1
5,"Tayyabs serves some of the best Punjabi food I've ever eaten - all at a very affordable price. Prepare to salivate upon entering the restaurant, as you are greeted with whiffs of aromatic spices and sizzling meats. My friends and I arrived at 17:30 for an early Sunday dinner, and got seated immediately. Throughout the meal, none of us could stop raving about how much we were enjoying the copious amount of meats and carbs on the table. Discovering that each of us only had to pay £10.55 by the end of it only bolstered our newfound love for this restaurant.

4,"After hearing that the wait for Dishoom was almost 2 hours, I decided to place an order for Tayyabs instead. Although it's not Indian food, it really hit the spot. I got the dry meat and the famous lamb chops. The dry meat might not sound appealing, but it was better than I expected. The meat was juicy and tender, and the flavor was amazing. I could really see why the lamb chops were famous. They were good even though I got takeaway. The prices were pretty reasonable as there was enough for me to eat two meals. They were extremely busy, and took a while to prepare my order, but that's okay. Great spot for lamb!",1
1,"Chaotic. Overrated. Overpriced.
I came here alone and a waitress in a pink dress pressured me into ordering way too much food - amounting to nearly £30. She then proceeded to have an argument with a waiter in front the whole section I was sitting in. Very unprofessional.
The food wasn't even that good. I actually feel a little sick.",-1
1,"Honestly not totally sure what the other 632 people ate or saw in this place. We were originally heading to bricklane, but this one caught our eye on yelp, it looked and sounded different from your standard Indian restaurant in east London. We were rushed to our table in the basement, packed in like sardines, everything about this place was built for a fast in and out experience, we were shocked at how busy this place was, we honestly thought we were about to experience something special. 
The food was pretty standard, lacked spice and major key flavours, the naan was greasy, and again lacked any flavour at all. We also hadn't realised that it was a BYOB restaurant, so getting up to go to a corner store within the first 5mins of the meal was a great thrill.
Thankfully the end of the meal came, but not before we had to down the beers we had purchased because they rushed the food from table our so quickly. 
We then had to queue to pay along with all the other people waiting for a table (not totally sure why). 
Not a terribly great experience, my advice would be to find a smaller more hospitable traditional atmosphere.",-1
2,We went here a week.after visiting another curry house Lahore Original Kebab (round the corner ) . Frankly disappointing. A huge place on 3 floors. Noisy and packed on a Friday night. The lamb chops were delicious but the curries were average. The prawns tiny and chewy. The chicken bland and the spinach likewise. The worst is we still cannit get the smell out of our coats.,-1
5,"Well priced 
Slightly small portions 
Tasty
Clean environment
Quick service once you are seated
Best to avoid peak times
Fri Sat nights are very busy.",1
4,A friend recommended this place to me and I had to try Indian food in London. Wait isn't bad but they charge you for the dosa and chutney. They just give it to you and I had no idea it wasn't free. The lamb chops were delicious. I came here by myself so I didn't order that much food. I wanted to try other things as well.,1
3,"During my short stay in London, I heavily relied on Yelp to hit up all the best spots.  We came here on my last night in London and I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe because it was a Sunday late night and the quality plummeted but I couldn't shake off the bad experience. 
After reading that it was best to make a reservation, my friend booked the night before.  We arrived approximately 45minutes before our reservation time and the lobby was PACKED.  It was hectic and chaotic.  I know this place gets busy so we already leveled our expectations prior to coming here.  However, there was no clear line in the lobby - we couldn't figure out which queue was for walk-ins or which area was for reservations.  We tried to ask a host multiple times where and how we check in if we already made a reservation.  He pointed us to stand in line with everyone else. I understand this is a busy restaurant but customer service was extremely lacking.  The lines were not efficient. All this waiting gave me time to people-watch...
Cleanliness was a huge thumbs-down.  The tables weren't properly wiped down - there were still food crumbs on the tables before the waiters would hide it under the paper place mats. I saw a waiter use the same hand he was cleaning the table to deliver a stack of naans - placing his thumb on top of the naans to hold them down during transfer.  That was gross!! 
Now the food:  Complimentary salad and appetizers were appreciated.  The food was good but not outstanding. We had a chicken and dried meat dish with rice, roti, and naan to share between two people and it was plenty! Their meat dishes were on the slightly salty side but that's just for me.  My friend thoroughly enjoyed the flavors.  I dream about their garlic naan to this day.  They charge for the bottled water FYI.  
Overall, this place was not for me because of the terrible customer service.  Maybe if I had went when it wasn't so busy, the experience would've been different.  But for now, I don't think I'd recommend this spot.",-1
5,"This is hands down the best Pakistani food I've had outside of my moms cooking. We got an order of mixed grill appetizer, karahi chicken and karahi gosht. Everything was simply delicious. The naans were fresh and fluffy. Next time I'm in London I will be stopping by. The only pitfall is service is a little slow but that seemed to be the case everywhere I went abroad.",1
3,"After the many good reviews the Mrs booked a table here for her birthday. 
It was really easy to book a table and they had no problem accommodating a large group as it's what the place is set up for. 
The BYOB aspect was very good as we had a mix of drinkers and non-drinkers and it makes splitting the bill much fairer. 
With a table that big the staff were helpful in suggesting how many rice and bread we should get and were patient while everyone made their choices but otherwise just let us get on with the evening. 
I think this restaurant is better for meat eaters. There wasn't a great selection for veggies but the food I had was nice enough and reasonably priced. 
Pretty easy to get to but a little tucked away. I'd say its great for groups although be prepared to be sharing the entire restaurant with other big groups and lots of noise.",-1
5,"This place was recommended to us from a friend. We managed to get seated right away. However, We had to flag down someone to take our order. He picked a few popular dishes, one chicken and one lamb. Both were spectacular especially the chicken dish. The service was subpar but the food was on point.",1
2,"Went once and never got a table - because I never got acknowledged by staff. But a friend had recommended, so I tried again. Service was disorganized. Dry meat was yummy, but I was disappointed that there weren't any vegetables at all in it. Went to the loo before leaving and it had one of those dyson hand dryers that you dip your hands into. Don't look down- it was covered in black mildewy ick. Shudder.",-1
5,"Cheap and cheerful old school Pakistani boot hole in the East End drawing foodies and families for excellent grilled meats (the lamb chops are a must try). Be aware, the menu is alcohol free but BYOB is accepted with no extra charge. Great value for money and a step above the rest.",1
5,"Making reservations at Tayyabs happens quickly after buying my air ticket to London. A must stop when I'm in town. The only desi restaurant that I get excited to eat at. Every thing amazing, especially the lamp chops.",1
5,"The best Pakistani food you will have outside of Pakistan, you will not get anything close to this type of food in America. 
In the States, normal folks don't come out to Pakistani/Indian food but it was definitely a nice surprise to see how much the English love desi food. I first came here on a Tuesday afternoon which was quiet dead so we got our food quick and were in and out. We had ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Karahi, Lamb Chops, and Naan...holy crap was it good!
We tried coming back about 10 days later on a Saturday night and the line was out the door, about 30 people deep so we went to Lahore Kebab House instead. The next day we came and got the tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, lamb chops, goat karahi, biryani, and kulfi. I would low key pass on the biryani cause they got some weird raisins in it and it seemed just not traditional in both Pakistani and Indian dishes. The service is really great, throw some Urdu in and they will love you. We need this quality of food in the U.S ASAP!",1
5,"Let me start this review by saying I am no Indian food expert. I grew up in the Midwest bible belt of the United States and our idea of ethnic food was a sweet and sour chinese buffet. 
When I moved to Chicago, I got my first taste of authentic Indian spices and fell in love. I was shocked to hear when I booked our honeymoon to London that some of the best Indian food was here. I was prepared for that whole fish and chips vibe, not Punjabi.
We stayed near the Aldgate station area so this place was conveniently located to our hotel, plus it had some of the best reviews in the entire city. Also, when we arrived it had almost no tourists (aside from us) which is always a huge selling point for me. 
First piece of advice, grab a reservation. I was lucky and found something but just barely. Even with reservations we still waited for 15 minutes. 
We had the Karahi and Spinach Paneer with a billion orders of Naan. It's difficult to mess up Naan, but this was some of the best I've had. Also, whatever yogurt dip they brought, please bottle this and ship it to the U.S. so I can eat it on everything. I had my eyes on the dry meat but the portions were huge and we couldn't handle more. 
The table next to us ordered some kind of meat dish that practically covered their table and I feel like I could have gotten down with that if I hadn't filled my mouth with endless Naan. These were like, body building men three times the size of me though.",1
5,"Second time coming here.  It's so well seasoned.
Made reservations for 6pm a week before arrival. Place wasn't as busy, quieter and able to have conversation.  
Ordered rice, chicken tikka, chicken tandoori and 
Karahi chicken.  Wasn't able to finish everything, leftovers!",1
3,"Wow this place is crowded! Fortunately, it was only the 2 of us so we were seated immediately. Overall the food was great and price was awesome. I'm just disappointed in the service because it took us at least an hour to get our food! After about 30 minutes of waiting, we tried to flag down a couple of waiters to see where our food was at but they would just glance and walk past us. Finally one guy was nice enough to stop (although disgruntled that he had to); we advised him we were still waiting on the lamb and he responded very confused saying ""there are no orders for this table."" WHAT?! By the time we finally got our last dish it was like 10 pm and we've been starving since 8. 
Also some warning, the restaurant doesn't have a good vent system and everyone's ordering the grilled lamb, so expect to walk out smelling like a BBQ.",-1
3,"What an adventure!
Okay, here's the deal. This is the place to hit for amazing kebabs and grilled meat. Interestingly, these are all items you will find in their appetizer section. The actual entrees are your typical Bengladeshi/Pakistani/India fare, but not particularly memorable. Stick to the grilled stuff and you will be very pleased and the naan are fresh. The seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, and lamb chops were all great!
So, the food really hits the spot and there's no argument there. The prices are also very reasonable for London. 
As for the service/seating experience, that's where it hurts. You can make reservations online through their website. However, if you arrive on a weekend night like we did, you will be greeted by an unhappy mob of people overflowing out the entry room of the restaurant into the street. There is one guy from the restaurant running around trying to get people to form into a serpentine line and manage the flow. When you inform him about your reservation, he will simply say, ""Online reservation, no reservation. Only phone reservation."" When you show him your confirmation of the reservation, he basically will tell you a bunch of rude stuff that doesn't make any sense and tell you to get in line with all the people who don't have a reservation. As you may have noted from other reviews, they basically don't honor reservations. I got the idea that there was a mild chance they might honor a phone reservation, though even that was somewhat doubtful. From all appearances, the wait even at off times on a weekend evening could run into the 1-2 hour range. When we arrived, it was definitely around two hours wait. 
We saw many other people arrive and have the exact same issue. This restaurant basically lures people in with seemingly available reservations and then blindsides them with a huge 2 hour wait on arrival. They had no apologies and seemed to imply that everyone who made a reservation had done something wrong.
Part of the popularity is that they don't serve alcohol, but they allow you to bring your own. Given the cost savings, it is a hugely popular destination among the drinking crowd. This is what we gathered while we waited. 
We had little children in our party, it was already 9:30pm when we arrived, everyone was starving, we had cabbed all the way across from the other side of London only because of this reservation and not wanting to wait at something closer, and this bait and switch with the reservation was not something we were going to let slide. After intermittently hassling the front man for about 45 minutes, he somehow squeezed us into a small table downstairs and allowed us to skip out on what appeared to be at least another 60-90 minute wait otherwise. 
End note: Grilled food is solid if you can get in there somehow. Just be prepared for 3rd world shenanigans! Again, for a 30 minute wait or if they actually honor your reservation, probably worth it. Otherwise, you may be disappointed.",-1
5,Best mixed grill on the planet. Lamb chops are awesome. Flavors are extraordinary. Get the fish tikka and wash down the spice with a mango lasse. Caution - clothes will carry the aroma home with you.  Love it!,1
5,"What a random find! We were walking by and had to come in because the food smelled so intensely good!
We were not wrong!
We got an order of lamb chops, chicken tikka, and a shish kabab along with rice pilaf and traditional naan. It was delicious!
The meat came on a sizzling pan, the naan was freshly made and so warm when it came out.
The very best thing was actually was the mango lassi! We got a whole pitcher for £5 and it was sooo good!
Go check it out!",1
4,"Loved this place !
Loved the lamb shanks. 
Its a huge place with plenty of seating. We got the lamb shanks and keema. Everything was good. 
Will certainly recommend this place !",1
4,"If I were forced to name only one (a terrifyingly difficult challenge for a food lover like me) favorite food establishment in the whole wide world, it would have to be Tayyabs. It took me a while to believe all the fabulous comments regarding Tayyabs having been loyal for so long to Lahore Kabab House, perhaps a mile away. But finally I did and from the first time I ate here I knew I would want this to be my last meal on earth. I do not exaggerate my friends. I can be quite demanding and merciless in my comments. So please take me seriously.
My problem with Tayyabs is that everything on the menu is so good and I have only one stomach and so many dishes to choose from. So I always over order. The beef kababs are to die for. Then the karahi daal (most of the dishes come in karahis) the chana masala, the saag or palak aloo, I could go on to mention everything on the menu. When accompanied by my wife, we also order aloo gobi, chicken boti, karahi lamb and lamb chops and sometimes I order the huge tandoori prawns, (I may be using my own names for some of the dishes) -- all scooped with with delicious naans and washed down with a jug (yes I mean a jug for all that much food) of mango lassi. 
Go for the kheer but save some room (or more appropriately create some) for the blissful mishti doi at Ambala, nearby on Whitechapel Road.
I spend so much of my precious London (another of my favorite cities) time trekking back and forth from the West End to Whitechapel but believe me it is worth it. For me a journey all the way from the US to London to partake in the devine food at Tayyabs is also well worth the cost and the time.
---------------------------------------------
As an update, my wife and I went to Tayyabs on Christmas Day in 2017 (yes it was open, even though with the public transportation system in London closed that day and we had to find a cab there and back on a day when, understandably few cab drivers were working). The kababs did not taste like on previous visits although the daal, chana and saag were just as good. My wife only ate some of her kadai chicken and complained that it was not as good as in the past. So I am lowering the rating to 4 stars though would still like the daal here as my last meal.
I have heard mention (and not having been there yet cannot confirm) that the previous chef from Tayyabs now has his own restaurant, Needos around the corner.",1
1,"The food is good but DON'T GO HERE- they sat us at a table and provided us water and dips without telling us they were going to charge £12 for these. When we got the bill and I questioned it they tried to say they sat us in a ""VIP room"". Everyone else not in this room got tap water and dips for free, but in the ""special"" room they charge you for bottled mineral water and dips without your knowledge. Basically they take advantage of young people, tourists, and non-ethnic groups by charging them more and proceeding to treat them like shit.",-1
3,"**CASH ONLY!**
A friend had mentioned that there's often a long queue and that we were very lucky to get in so quickly. Perhaps I had built up the hype too much, because I truthfully wasn't super impressed. 
The Garlic Naan cooled quickly, and was served prior to our meal so I had nothing to soak up my food (perhaps poor planning on my part.) It had a good number of vegetarian dishes for a reasonable price, but nothing that really stood out for me. 
All in all would say ... yummy stop if no queue, but not worth the wait.",-1
4,"The first time I came here I was pretty blown away. I went with my London-ite friend who seemed to order everything, so I'm sure he knew what he was doing. 
The second time was quite recent, and while still awesome, not as great as the first. 
The highlight of this meal for me are the sauces they bring out to eat with the flatbreads. The spicy one is SO good. My husband and I have a problem with heat-addiction, so we finished that one. It's pretty hot, actually. Looking around at all the other tables, most had hardly touched the spicy one. 
The bbq lamb appetizer was incredible. It came out steaming hot and we ate that up in one minute.
The lentils and chicken dish I had were also great. My husband ordered a shrimp dish which neither of us could eat. That is saying a lot, as shrimp is both of our faves. Do not order seafood here. I guess we should have known.
The service was super short and unfriendly. But the prices are very reasonable.",1
5,"As someone who has lived in east London their whole life and grown up with Indian grandparents, it's safe to say I've experienced a good curry/Indian food.
I visited Tayyabs with two other people yesterday for the first time and let me say, this is the best Indian/Pakistani place I've ever eaten at, in fact nothing comes close to the food here!
We ordered a meat platter for starters which was fantastic and full of flavour although next time we'll just order two lots of the lamb chops, insanely good!
We then ordered two curries and two rices with a naan. The naan was freshly made and has the perfect amount of pull to it, the rice was hot and the curry was delicious. The lamb in the curry was as soft as you're going to find and the chicken in the other was moist, although I did enjoy the lamb and potato one more haha
The service was friendly, we got our food fairly quickly and it's BYOB so the alcohol prices aren't a problem
Overall, if you get the chance, visit Tayyabs, you won't be disappointed!!",1
4,"Tasty Punjabi food in a perpetually packed (and loud) restaurant. I've loved every single thing I've tried off their menu, but there is very minimal service and can be a little slow sometimes.",1
2,"Terrible service and mediocre food. Chicken dish was dry, lamb chops were OK - pretty average fare to be honest. 
They'll also try to pull the ""we don't accept card"" trick on you, but they definitely do, so just tell them you don't have cash.",-1
3,"Two things to know if you're coming to this place. 
It's BYOB and get the grilled lamb chop!
Keema nan is better than their garlic nan, it has some minced lamb meat in it. Mango lassi is also pretty decent if you want a non-alcoholic drink. Everything else I tried was just ok... Chicken tikka, masala fish, tandoori chicken, karahi chicken all came out really dry. Karahi lamb is better. The portion's quite big so try not to order too much or bring more friends to share.",-1
3,Quite a spacious restaurant with Indian menu and a variety of sweet drinks and desserts you can choose. The food tasted pretty good but the portions ended up at an A-OK. We ordered the curry-like menus but would like to try the other meat/rib-like menus (not sure what they're called).,-1
5,Food was delicious customer service was fantastic! They were so friendly and welcoming! Felt like we were family! :),1
3,"After the long wait at Dishoom (2hrs), my friend and I decided to stop at Tayyabs the first night we were in London. At first, the waiter/front desk person told us the card machine was broken and would only accept cash. We didn't have cash but didn't want to step out in the freezing cold weather either so we stayed inside yelping other places near by. About 5 mins later the guy comes back to us and tells us we can go ahead and take a table and he'll ""figure out payment after dinner."" It was a weird thing to say but we were starving so we didn't reject the offer. Food was fresh and made to order but it was just OK, bland for my liking and personally had better Indian/Pakistani food. We got Chicken Karahi was 2/5, it was not a normal Karahi, the Garlic naan was 4/5 (best thing we got) and the grilled chicken was 3/5 (was bland and not much flavor although it looked mouth watering). Overall, the place was just ""O-K,"" I wouldn't recommend it or go back but wasn't terrible either. Oh, and if you're wondering about what happened with our payment situation, well, they accepted our card after all (so I guess the either the machine wasn't broken to begin with and they prefer cash or a miracle happened while we were eating and it worked later).",-1
5,Amazing lamb. Didn't try to many things her didn't have meat. But the menu seems wonderful. Always crowded for a huge places. Solid. Next time I would like to have tried more dishes. Don't forget byob.,1
4,"Good Indian restaurant with tasty food at reasonable prices. Good for (large) groups.
A good thing is to order a few starters and large mains and share everything with some naan and rice. Service is Ok,",1
5,"Well, if you're coming here for a spicy curry you'll be disappointed, since the place focuses on Punjabi food which although aromatic and full of spices, but tends to be on the milder end of things.
We've tried the lamb chops + Seekh Kebab starter. Those were simply heavenly. I can't even start to describe how good they were.
I also ordered the Karahi Ghosht, which turned out a milder than I expected, but had a fantastic blend of spices and aroma.
My experience overall was fantastic, and much better than the sought-after curry houses of Brick Lane.",1
3,"The line was ridiculously long. Instead of taking names, you have to stand on line. After 45 minutes to an hour of waiting, we were seated. Food was tasty. Lamb chops were full of spice. With all the awards on the walls, I thought this would be mind-blowingly good, but we've had better Indian food from smaller joints. 
As mentioned in other reviews, downstairs they tell you the credit card machine doesn't work. When we were first sat, the host told us ""all you have to do is come upstairs."" Once the check came, our waiter got very angry when we said we only had credit, and the guy upstairs said it was ok. Finally he allowed us to go upstairs and use their credit card machine which worked perfectly. This really ruined the end of the night.",-1
4,"Awesome Indian/Pakistani food in the heart of London. I am glad i made a reservation a week in advance or else it will be at least an hour wait. Food was finger licking good, spicy and full of flavors. We got the mixed grill meat platter (highly recommend it if you want to try everything), chicken tiki marsala, lamb curry, garlic naan, Peshwari naan, lamb chops, mango lassi popsicles, etc. 
Tip: 
Forget about your expensive cashmere or trench coat at home. Expect to smell like meat when you come out of the restaurant as the grill meat comes in a sizzling hot pan. Its so worth it tho. 
The waiter told us its cash only but they totally accepted our credit card. Not exactly sure why he told us that. Perhaps to avoid credit card transaction fees =P Just something to keep in mind.",1
4,"We arrived 30 min before our reservation (Saturday evening 1900) expecting to see a long line as described by many reviews. To our surprise, there wasn't one. We walked right in and got a table. By the time our meal was over, the place had filled, but still no horrendous wait. The food was really good - not great. A+ garlic naan. The service was subpar - but not awful. Bill was reasonable.",1
5,"Tayyabs is gold. The line is always long for a reason, the curry is out of this world and same goes for anything else on the short but sweet menu. Tayyabs is a place I will always return to when I'm in London and a place a will always dream about when I sleep! Literally the best food I've ever had hands down. Make the stop take the time you won't regret it",1
4,One of the bets kababs I had!! Food was amazing!  Spicy but Good,1
3,"I have to start by saying that the restaurant experience is not only the food that is being served, and I understand that this place is no fine dining but the noise level & stress wasn't something I could handle! 
We had a booking on Friday night & we walked in only to see that not only they have a full house ( the place is huge) but about another 50 ppl waiting in unbearable heat & noise & everyone was running after the guy trying to show him their reservation & get a table & he would tell everyone wait there 5 min! But it actually amazed me how he remembered everyone not having any kind of system!!
Anyway we got a table after less than half an hour running after different waiters, all very friendly & attentive by the way even if they have sooo much to do!
The meal came in a blink of an eye but it was not very pleasant to eat in that stressful environment & heat & smell from the open kitchen ( everything we had on, stinks now!) 
The funniest thing of all was the ppl that walked in with so much alcohol in their hands & then we understood that since they are not serving any alcohol everyone buys their own from Tesco just a min away. 
Prices was incredibly cheap but the food didn't impress me that much!",-1
4,"After a failed attempt the previous night, we finally got seated at 6:30 pm on a Thursday for our 6:00 pm reservation. Just too much hard work! So, was the food worth it? 
Well, yes and no. Yes, because you have to experience it at least once. The lamb chops kind of live upto the expectations and hype. 2/4 of our pieces weren't that well cooked and were borderline raw and chewy. Having said this, the marinate itself has good flavor. We also got the chicken tikka which goes very well with the grilled onions. Again decently flavorful. 
For entree, we got the Lamb Kheema and gosht masala. Both were good. Flavorful! 
Now, it's not worth it, because the food is just so damn greasy, that eat here once a week, and you are guaranteed to get a heart disease. It's just not healthy! Perfect for a post drinking night session!",1
2,"Why this place has such good reviews, I'm not sure. I've been to India many times, I've eaten amazing Indian food in London. Rasa, Dishoom, Woodlands, even our local Bangalore express in the city beat Tayyabs hands down. This is fusion food at best. 
I came here with my partner on a recommendation. We had a reservation but there was a huge line outside, which we took as a good sign. That said, it was quite annoying eating beside a huge line. If people don't reserve in advance, I think it would be reasonable to ask them to wait outside so as not to ruin other diners' experience.
Popadoms and dips came to our table quickly, but everything else was quite slow. They were the best part of the meal.
We ordered the paneer tikka, naan, rice, chana masala, pumpkin curry and paneer masala. All tasted overwhelmingly of pepper and every dish was extremely oily. The paneer tikka tasted bland, unseasoned and arrived burnt. Our naan was cold and chewy--not fresh. No complex spice combinations, no warmth, just a sharp peppery flavour. 
I wonder whether this place paid Lonely Planet or another guide book to promote the restaurant, because it certainly isn't even on a parr with the moderately good Indian offerings in the capital.",-1
5,"For those in the know about the London food scene, it's not all about fish & chips and bangers & mash. Nay, it was actually chicken tikka masala that was declared Britain's national dish. Indian cuisine is oft enjoyed in London town and the Whitehall area is the place to go.
After reaching out to a few local foodies and review sites, Tayyabs was highly recommended and we were not disappointed. The BYOB was bopping with the young crowd, dimly lit, bustling, yet somehow intimate. I appreciated that they brought out their branded water gratis. Perhaps they knew we'd need it for the curries to come.
Chutneys
A troika of chutneys were brought out including a spicy red chile with lasting heat, a white cucumber with slight chili heat on the finish, and a sweet, cooling mango chutney to save the day.
Papadum
Some papadum and a puffy rice cracker were on offer, featuring crisp, light textures. 
Salad
A salad of yellow and red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, and lemon was also brought out.
Vegetable Samosa [0.80 Pounds = $1.31] 
 
We had to try a samosa, which was filled with savory potatoes and chickpeas, housed in a crisp shell.
Lamb Chops [6.50 Pounds = $10.64]
The lamb chops were definitely a showstopper and well-recommended. It's served smoky to your table thanks to the cast iron grill. In addition to the nicely developed char, the lamb was tender, moist, and delicious. Not at all gamey. The grilled onions added some sweet savoriness to each bite.  
Naan [1 Pound = $1.64]
In preparation for the curry, we ordered some naan, which was the perfect vessel to sop up all the impending goodness.  
Chana Meat Curry [7.25 Pounds = $11.87]
The chana meat curry was wonderfully fragrant and had great depth, with coriander and garlic permeating the roast lamb. The chana dal and the whole chickpeas made each bite even heartier and somewhat (only slightly) tempered the heat of this beast of a dish.
Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala Special [7.25 Pounds = $11.87]
Marinated chicken tikka, karahi masala, coriander, chopped tomato, sliced onions, chili 
The chicken tikka was moist and contained huge pieces of boneless chicken. The onions and potatoes mixed within were plentiful and the base of tomatoes helped to create a sweeter depth than that of the fiery chana meat curry.
And as an attempt to soothe the lingering heat, our meal ended with some creamy milk chocolates.
So, if you're ever in London, do pop on over to Whitehall and enjoy a proper curry. Tayyabs has got you covered on all fronts. It's also one of the better bargains you'll find.",1
4,"Excellent Indian food with so much flavor!!!
We ordered a variety of their dishes and enjoyed most of them. Started our meal with the Lamb Chops and they were truly magnificent! I never tasted lamb chops with so much Indian flavor, and I just couldn't have enough of them. We also had Samosas and Spicy Popadoms for appetizers and both were pretty good. 
For entrée I had the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala. Although it was very good, I'm more used to the chicken tikka masala being cooked with a lot of yogurt sauce, so it wasn't what I expected. It tasted more like a chicken korma to me. We also ordered a side of Keema Nan, but didn't care for it much.
We also ordered a jug of their Mango Lassi, and as sweet as it was, we ended up finishing the whole jug.
Overall, I liked our meal because it had so much flavor. If I lived in the area, I would definitely go back and try another dish. 
The décor was nice, and the service was ok.",1
5,One of my most favourite restaurants in town. Not just for Indian food but in general. Top experience every time. Highly recommended,1
3,"Went for a lunch with my team from work. Had heard a lot about the place so all of us had a lot of expectation.
The place is a short walk from Aldgate East station, and you can see the Neon signboards and unmistaken Tayyan's  facade from far even during the day.
We got in as the lunch service was started and we were seated immediately. However, it was an horrendous 25mins wait before our orders were taken. We ordered  the classic Sheek and chicken tikka (gave the chops a miss) , paneer tikka for starters. And a Kadai Chicken, Dal Tadka and a veg dish with Garlic Naan for main. The food arrives reasonably quickly after that.
The verdict - location was Ok, the decor nice, staff okeyish but isn't it all about the food? To be absolutely honest, I found the food quite ordinary with no dish meeting my heightened expectations. Sheek was nice but as my starter was the Chicken I had to eat that even though the meat was extremely dry/hard. Didn't enjoy it at all. The Paneer Tikka was soft and perfectly cooked. I hoped that he mains might change the experience but it didn't. The Dal was pretty ordinary and the Kadai Chicken was only so-so. The best main dish was the Vegetarian one, a Potato and Carrot curry with fenugreek leaves. The Nan breads met the standard then it is an South Asian restaurant. The desert in form of the classic Ras Malai would have been tastier only if it were served chilled. 
The bill came to around £55 quid so it was a value for money but it missed hitting my mark big time.
You wouldn't be greatly disappointed here, probably stick to the Lamp chops because many people swear by it but don't go in with a huge expectation else you might be pretty disappointed, just like me.",-1
4,"A Punjabi restaurant still running since it opened in 1972.
The decor was modern and comfortable with it's leather chairs. Tables were of solid oak filled with a jug of water.
Make sure you make a reservation. Even with two floors the place was quickly filled and a long queue formed. Noise levels got a bit high but service didn't let us down. There are so many waiting staff employed in a restaurant but they needed it here to keep things organised and in control.
Salad
Service was quick. As we sat down, a free salad was delivered to us. It was simple. Not much umami from the tomatoes but at least it was all freshly cut.  
Poppadoms
Another lady was very cheeky and placed a plate of plain and spicy poppadom in front of us and asked if we wanted it. We assumed it was free as well so took it until we found out in the bill that we were in fact charged 80p for one.
Both were thin, crispy and light enough to enjoy before the meal. The spicy one definitely had a nice edge to it but not exactly 'spicy'. It came with three different dips to enjoy them which we didn't really use so can't comment.
Vegetable samosa
The pastry itself was a bit more crunchy than I'm used to but it worked really well against the soft juicy filling. More flavours and spices seeping through each bite and becoming more and more apparent in its hear. There was some complex spicy savoury flavours and textures from the range of vegetables in there.
Lamb chops
Not the most tender and some quite tough but I think it's all about appreciating the flavours here. It's obvious that these had been marinating for quite a while, releasing a rich in depth spicy kick as you gnaw on them with nice undertones of sweetness from the lamb itself. Great stuff for those who are willing to use their hands and teeth.
Seekh kebab
Another item I saw on everyone's plate. These were incredible, packed full of spices and herbs. You can imagine the exploding sensation of all those different spices on your tongue as you slowly chew on it. It was incredibly juicy and tender and grilled perfectly
Peshwari naan
Delicious stretchy light buttery bread filled with a delicious mix of minced up nuts, desiccated coconut and sugar. It was a great side dish to counteract the spiciness of the food with its nice mix of sweetness and nuttiness which is accentuated further by the roasted sesame seeds on top
Kahari chicken. 
Lovely caramelised onions offsetting a nice sweetness against the rich spicy umami tomato sauce. It felt like it had been simmering for ages from the complex savouries and spices I was getting. The chicken although a bit dry, took on a lot of the flavour in the process and there was enough sauce to aid it with moisture. Didn't waste a single bit of sauce and enjoyed it greatly with rice.
Methi Aloo Gajar. 
Described as fenugreek, potatoes and carrots we were only given one piece of carrot. Nevertheless it was amazing stuff. Delicious chargrilled aromas throughout the whole dish being cooked in the karahi (small wok). The potatoes were incredibly fluffy, taking in the lovely array of spices and the fenugreek flavour which gave it a lovely rounded sweetness with a slight bitterness undertone.
Saag meat. 
Sadly the lamb fails to remain juicy and bouncy inside. It became dry and rough on the tongue but it was still soft and tooth tender. It was more about the simmering process of all the spices, lamb and spinach coming together. The lovely creaminess created as a result of the overly wilted spinach, wrapping round each piece of meat, aiding it in moisture. They achieve something that usually requires cream but this was obviously lighter. Not overly spicy but enough herbs in there to keep your tongue buzzing in its complexity
Pilau rice 
This was lovely and cooked al dente. Subtle aromas of spices and not too buttery either.
Rasgula
A rolled up ball of an Indian soft cottage cheese, almost like a sponge soaking a vast about of sweet syrup inside, releasing it as you bite into it. It was incredibly sweet, texture slightly crumbly.
Rasmalai
Again like a sponge but this time saturated with the milk its bathed in. Made of a soft cheese it was incredibly light and crumbly and gave it the ability to soak and release the sweet spice milk once devoured. The milk itself was delicious, beautiful aromas of cardamom, rose water and a sweet nuttiness from the pistachios.
Great meal although things could have been better. Firstly they were quite sly in selling us the poppadoms by just placing it on our table. It's also a very loud place to make conservation. To keep things cheap they don't use the highest quality of meats which means some can be tough or dry. However there was nothing that couldn't be chewed through, just requires a bit of bite and patience. The quality of this restaurant lies in the rich marinates and flavours produced. It is all very budget friendly for the portion given. Might be a long wait to be seated but once in service is quick.",1
5,"This has to be, by far, the best indian I have had in London up to now. It was recently voted within the top 10 restaurants in London and you can totally see why. We were lucky enough to have a table reserved for a large group, if we hadn't we would have been queuing for hours as with the other 100 or so people waiting. 
The waiters are attentive and very quick with their service, even if slightly rude at times but it is understandable when you're dealing with a bunch of large rowdy groups!
Now to the food! We ordered their special - dry meat with sides of saag paneer, dahl and peshwari nan. 
The meat was lamb and it was truly fantastic. Cooked to be perfectly tender and juicy, it went down a treat and I couldn't get enough. 
The sides too were delicious, the only downside however was that there wasn't enough paneer in the saag which was a slight let down but in honesty I just cannot fault this place for the taste, quality and authenticity of the indian food. 
I will most definitely be back to try some more dishes :)",1
5,"Adding my voice to the choir to say that this was one of my most favorite meals ever. After leaving England at the age of 6, one of my most distinct memories was the unparalleled quality of kababs at the Pakistani restaurants there, comparable only perhaps to kababs in Pakistan and BK Jani in Brooklyn. When I came back to London as a 24 year old, I knew I wanted to taste the lamb again -- locally raised, which probably explains the immediate difference in taste.
Tayyab's did not disappoint. We went with a large group and I just remember them bringing out one dish after another of sizzling meats, each better than the last and each leaving me wanting more. I especially remember the lamb chops and seekh kababs.
When the meat itself is high quality, that taste shines through. Tayyab seasons it's meat expertly, prioritizing authenticity but maintaining an even hand, and the outcome is that the taste of the food pleases virtually every palate. Whenever I make it back across the pond, this is on my must try list of places and it should be on yours too.",1
2,"Anyone else feel that the quality has gone down and that they are rushing you in and out when dining there?
A bunch of friends booked a Sunday lunch time here and to be honest it was not as busy as it is during weekdays... It's carnage during weekdays!
The starters or shall I say the mixed grill starter was the only saving grace as the meat was cooked, tasted great and got us excited for more. Well it got pretty no-frills after that (as advertised) where the meat was chewy and spices were a hit and miss. The pumpkin curry was not bad but still room for improvement. 
Now what irritates me the most is when they advertise mango lassi as a lassi when actually has no lassi like ingredients and is just a mango milkshake.
I remember coming here many years ago and coming out satisfied by experience and taste and that's all gone down the drain. 
Rant over!",-1
3,"Fun atmosphere, ok food, ok service
Pros:
Food arrived quickly 
Restaurant was clean
Unique atmosphere
Cons:
Very crowded
Seating is a challenge
Getting the attention of the service staff is near impossible
Naan was interesting - was sweet in the middle which was unexpected 
Only accepted cash on this day...even though store sign says it accepts a variety of credit cards",-1
5,"This is, to me, as good as it gets. 
I was in London for a project and we made the mistake of only staying in Shoreditch for one night. The eating had been pretty bad, and we were all excited to be in a fun part of town. 
Someone did some Googling and found Tayyabs. Our group was made up of one passionate eater (me), one vegan, one person who had never tried Indian food before, and one person who was ok with whatever. 
Everything we ordered was stellar and delicious. Samosas, lamb curry, all veg dishes, the mango lassi, the naan...the tastes took my weary mind off of the difficult project I was in the midst of and transported me to India. Even the person who had never had Indian food before loved what he ordered. Damn good sign, right?
I complimented the owner after we paid, and he said that he wished I would have told him that it was our first night eating at Tayyabs before we'd ordered. A few moments later, I ordered kheer (rice pudding) for the table, and when I went to pay for it, they wouldn't take my money. On the house. What a class act. 
After posting a photo, all of my Londoner friends, and friends who find themselves in London a lot, proclaimed their love for Tayyabs. So yeah, next time I'm in London, I'll surely be back.",1
5,"This place never disappoints - the currys are great, would particularly recommend the dry lamb, lamb chops, spinach and paneer curry as well as the pashwari naan. It's byob which is an added bonus!",1
4,"Tayyabs might not be the first place that would come to mind for Indian food. Yet, it magically shows up on a lot of great lists and it was the first place that a local thought of when we asked for Indian food. It was pretty damn good....mind you I'm no expert on Indian food, but I am definitely a big fan. 
Its menu is impressive. Yet, we opted to stick to the staples and started with their chicken tikka and their famous lamb chops. The chicken tikka was not too dry and offered a nice balance of flavor between the spice of the paprika and the bite of the garlic. The lamb chops were simply put, a signature dish of theirs so don't miss out.
The kebabs are pretty balanced and well done, while the curries very good and the daal beautifully done. The pilau rice was refreshing, but the naan was clearly the winner. Get the tandori choice is traditional, but the garlic is pretty awesome as well.
Service is a little lacking, but you won't be left in need. Plus, it is BYOB and it is incredibly helpful as you enjoy a great meal with friends. Definitely go with a group since it might not necessarily be a good first date spot.",1
4,"Tayybs is an experience on its own. You maybe just coming for the food (well, definitely you are coming for the food!) but it is the whole vibe in the place that makes you enjoy yourself there.
The booking system is somewhat confusing. They do accept both reservations as well as walk-in guests. There is a separate line for the two waiting lists. Yep, even if you have made a reservation there is a good chance you'll still wait 0,5h for the table. So come early!
That said, there is an important hint if you are planning to dine there. But probably you already know it. The place doesn't sell alcohol, but it does not mean you cannot drink booze there. Simply arrive prepared with your selection of drinks for the night. You don't need to pay for opening the bottle. And it makes waiting for the table so much better :)
And now to the meat. It is delicious. Even if you're not a big fan of far east cuisine (then what are you doing here?!) you'll find the right meal for you. The selection is quite decent. Everything seems to be prepared fresh, in front of your eyes, as the main dining room is right next to an open kitchen.
Also for vegetarians there are plenty of good options there. I need meat to survive, so I wasn't paying any particular attention, but it seems you should be fine as well.
They can also stuff you for the next few days as you can order any of the meals for takeaway.",1
4,"Tayyabs is delicious but rather intense. I brought my mother and aunt here because they love Indian food and many people recommended Tayyabs as the best in the city. I dutifully made a reservation for 8 PM on a Tuesday night and we showed up to a complete madhouse. There was a huge line (INSIDE the restaurant) of people trying to get tables, including those who made reservations. Waiters were dodging around all the people with plates of sizzling lamb chops and steaming curry and I witnessed multiple near collisions that could have been disastrous. It was incredibly loud, hot, and rowdy- a bit overwhelming for my family who had just flown in from the States that morning. 
We were finally able to sit in a very noisy room, where we had to yell to hear each other. We ordered the lamb chops, chicken keema, dahl with eggplant, and garlic naan, and we thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes (especially the lamb chops!) and it is nice that they allow you to bring your own alcohol. The food is great and the price is right, but in the future I will consider the decibel requirements of the guests I am bringing here.",1
5,"Without a doubt, I had the best Indian food of my life at Tayyabs.
When we got to Tayyabs, about 20 minutes late for our 7:30pm reservation, we saw a large crowd of people spilled onto the street, with complete chaos and pandemonium inside. The maitre d' was surrounded by several people angrily demanding why they hadn't been seated yet. I figured that we'd never be seated, but surprisingly, the maitre d calmly confirmed our reservation and sat us within 3 minutes of our arrival, while being chased around and accosted by other impatient would-be diners.
We ordered the tandoori chicken, Karahi king prawns, Karahi mixed vegetables, along with 2 naans and rice. The tandoori chicken was the best I've ever had - juicy, flavorful, and spicy. The Karahi king prawns were amazing, in a deliciously spicy ginger and garlic sauce, perfect for mopping up with the naans. 
Tayyabs is BYOB, so we came prepared with a bottle of wine. 
We had a fantastic experience, and would definitely revisit Tayyabs the next time we are in London.",1
3,We got here a bit late after our reservation and they almost gave the table away. Very busy. Probably because of being too busy we waited more than an hour for the food. When they served the food we had to wait 15 minutes for the rice. By the time the rice got served the food was cold and not enjoyable at all. I can say the food is VEEY good but as first experience I wasn't that excited,-1
4,"Heard a lot of things about this place prior to our trip to London so having dinner here was high on our list. Neighborhood is not as bad as other reviews make it sound. Use the Whitechapel tube stop. About a two min walk from there. We had a reservation at 7 pm and came in with an extra person but we were seated right away. Staff is not unfriendly but to the point. Food comes out very quick. They have daily specials so check them or before you pick the day you visit. Lamb chops are very good but were over hyped in my opinion. Mango lassi was excellent
Their credit card machine was not working on our night so make sure you bring cash.
The place is recommended by everyone for Indian food. Was definitely a highlight of our trip. Will likely visit again. But would be a good to temper you expectations before you visit.",1
3,"Good restaurant if you're in the area but not worth a special trip. The lamb chops are amazing, but not a fan of the chicken tikka masala (I recognize that's not the most adventurous dish, but it's a good barometer). Service is good.",-1
4,"Coming from California, my bar for Indian food is set pretty high. I had heard about the food in White Chapel, and friends recommended Tayyabs. It was less than 5 min from the White Chapel station and was pretty easy to find. 
You can actually make a reservation online. Definitely do so since there will be a line.
Food is substantially cheaper than what I'm used to..
- Chicken tikka: 5 large pieces of chicken breast on a sizzling plate for £3.40
- Seekh kabab: ground lamb, good seasoning, very tender, only £1.10 each 
- Garlic naan: super buttery. The edges were bubbly and had a good bite - like a Neapolitan  pizza 
- Kahari mixed vegetables: probably the most disappointing - no distinct flavor and too oily 
- Lentils and lamb: the lamb was tender and without gaminess, and the lentil sauce was perfect for dipping naan 
Everything came with 3 house chutneys, raw vegetables (lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers), and house made papadams. 
Bonus: BYOB!  Bring your own bottle (they have openers) with no corkage fee.
For the two of us, the grand total was about £25 in the end, which is super reasonable since it would have definitely cost in California (plus tax and tip...).  The food itself was solid, but to me, it wasn't significantly more outstanding than elsewhere.  
Warning: you will likely smell like sizzling plates / food when you walk out.",1
2,Went in for dinner yesterday. I don't eat red meat so got the chicken tikka which was dry and lacked flavor. My husband is vegetarian and got the paneer tikka which was a disaster. The naan was A-okay. The only thing we ordered that was good was the parantha. After waiting in line and hearing so much about this place I was very disappointed. The lamb everyone was ordering looked good I have to admit as an ex red meat eater. If you are going to eat the lamb give it a shot but otherwise no. The positive- it's cheap and byob!,-1
4,"Came here at 730pm on a Saturday night and there was a crowd both inside the waiting area and outside on the street. Luckily my friend had made a reservation for three so they seated us immediately. Ordered chicken tandoori, lamb chops, fish masala, lentil and eggplant, aloo keema, and two rices. Portion sizes are generous and food is packed with flavor. The chicken tandoori was a little dry in some spots but otherwise everything else was delicious. The restaurant gets very loud - was hard to hear one another towards the end of the night.",1
5,"Most impressive Pakistani restaurant I've ever been to. With Pakistani restaurants, you're usually sacrificing food quality and authenticity for dining experience and overall restaurant environment and attention to detail.
This is the first Pakistani joint I have seen that breaks that trend successfully all while also keeping competitive prices on its menu. For any Pakistanis traveling to London from out of town, definitely stop in if you have time. It's an impressive establishment.",1
5,"Absolutely wonderful, authentic Indian cuisine.
Prices are reasonable and portion sizes are well worth the money.
Would definitely recommend the dry meat, and the tandoori chicken.
Complimentary papadums, and a good selection of sauces at the table.
The place was completely full when we went, so I'd definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time.",1
5,"I was warned that Tayyabs would be quite the experience. I was also warned that all my clothes would smell like Indian/Pakistani food for a good while after.
We made reservations, but that didn't seem to matter as people just mobbed the front desk and they served whoever they saw, rather than who was there first. A sure sign of a popular restaurant! Note that this was on a Tuesday night as well!
There were four of us, and for starters, we ordered the lamb chops, tandoori chicken, and chicken tikka. Everything was good, but the lamb chops were pretty amazing.
For our mains, we ordered methi aloo gajar, karahi dhal gosht (lamb), karahi chicken keema, and the saag meat (spinach + lamb). The plates are a bit small, so plan accordingly. We asked for the karahi chicken keema to be extra spicy (since they said everything was basically mild), but they seemed to have forgotten. It was still good. My favorite was probably the karahi dhal gosht, which had lentils and lamb.
In a word, their naan is AMAZING. Huge, fluffy and so tasty. We ordered three different types (regular, keema and garlic). All were amazing, but I liked the keema since it had meat.
It's BYOB so stop by a deli somewhere beforehand to pick up some beers or wine.",1
2,"I'd heard a lot before my visit here. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to the hype.
Tayyabs is a cheap indian restaurant in Whitechapel. They have a great BYOB policy, so you can pick up some drinks from the nearby Tesco to go with your meal.
There are some nice touches. When ordering the staff member will attempt to remember your order in their head. Given how busy they are, it's not a fool-proof tactic and the attempt to look smart often backfires as they'll often forget something from your order. The guys who are good at it however can indeed remember 16 diner's orders without getting anything wrong.
Starters are brought to you table which you might assume are complimentary, but you're charged for the poppadums and dip. That's a big disappointing, but in fairness they do ask you if you'd like it first instead of just plopping it on your table.
Order is quick and food brought to you table as soon as it's ready. Given the small table space fitting everything can be like solving a puzzle. 
The food is average. They're supposedly famous for the lamb shanks, but I wasn't impressed. The meat is tough and often burnt. The currys are small in portion given the prices. The starters are actually more filling. Definitely focus more on the naan breads than the rice, as again the portions are small.
There's a lot of potentially like about Tayyabs. However when it comes down to execution. It falls flat. Prices are definitely reasonable, but it strangely still doesn't feel like good value for money after the meal. There are plenty of better places.",-1
3,"Aaaaah I so wanted to love this place, after reading all the great reviews, but damnnn I don't know, it just didn't live up to the hype. We arrived and got a table quite easily on a Thursday lunchtime and were quickly brought some salad to nibble on. Following from that, we waited for around 30 mins for someone to take our order and only after asking a few times, did we finally manage to order. I might add, it took a lot of staff members asking each other to take our order, which was a little strange.
The food arrived and was fairly ok. The fish dish I got, had plenty of bones, which wasn't great. The saag aloo was amazing, super spicy and a great addition to the meal. My friend got chickpeas which were nice and a great side dish. The chicken tikka for me didn't live up to expectations.
All in all, the meal was just average and I felt like the service could definitely be improved next time. However for £25 for two, it really wasn't a bad price and I'll be giving it another go one evening to see if I fair better.",-1
4,Okay how can a trip to London be complete without visiting the king of the so called curry mile? It's an experience you have to share just for the sheer feeling you get from walking into a massive restaurant with such fine consistency of tastiness of its curries and meats.,1
5,"Well what can you say?  Many people have reviewed this place and love it and I am no different.  The lamb chops are awesome and everything is way above par, despite costing very little.  Of course, the price you pay is a long wait but since you will likely be drinking the beer you brought, why worry?",1
2,"I had been here about a year ago and remember really enjoying it, but the most recent experience was really disappointing. 
My chicken tikka masala tasted nothing like it. In fact, my chicken tastes so dry that I stopped eating after one piece. 
Service was rather bad too. They had one of our orders wrong at first, and for another one of my friends, they didn't even remember her request to leave out the potatoes in her dish. 
Quite loud as well, given the crowd. Honestly, I'm not sure how this place could attract so many people. 
Rather disappointing experience overall.",-1
4,"Tayyabs is practically an institution to East London's food scene, and is one of the best Pakistani restaurants around.
The restaurant spans four floors and can seat hundred, yet there is always a queue (which luckily goes by quite quickly).
The dry meat and lamb chops seem to be staple items, but the menu is rather light on chicken, fish, or essentially non-lamb options unless you want to go vegetarian. The veggie options are rather good though...
The restaurant is BYOB, and there's a Tesco a few blocks away whose alcohol sales may be formed exclusively on patrons of Tayyabs. The mango lassi is also great, and does well to cut through spicy food!
The servers made me feel rather unwelcome, but at least they were efficient.",1
4,"4 stars for the food. Just fantastic and so tasty! But the atmosphere and chaos is insanely exhausting. I remember coming here over 7 years ago and it was a lovely, airy place and now it feels too trendy for what it is, and the crowds are huge! I made a reservation and that doesn't even really matter it seems because everyone just queued up anyway.
What saves this place is the food, excellent curries, the mango lassi jug was so good, and the desserts are to die for. Loved the rasmalai!
Always worth a try, especially if it's your first time.",1
5,"Hands down some of the best food I've ever had. We stopped in because our air b&b host recommended it and we were not disappointed. 
When we arrived, I was absolutely starving but we hadn't made a reservation so were forced to wait I line. Lucky for me, there is a small to go counter at the front of the restaurant. While my husband held our place in line, I went and bought us samosas which were amazing. The place was packed so it took us a little while to get seated but that was our fault for not calling ahead a reservation. When we did get seated though, our waiter was quick and attentive.
We both got the chicken tiki masala and were not disappointed in the slightest. The taste was phenomenal and the presentation was great too. We got some nan and popadom which I also recommend getting. If you're looking for good Indian  food, I highly recommend it!",1
4,"Tayyabs is amazing if you come in with the right expectations. It's a terrific place for the following reasons:
- Cheap (average cost per person is under 20)
- BYOB - keeps costs low and allows you to have tons of booze with your food
- great for groups - Tayyabs is huge and has plenty of room for groups 10+
- Good food - Usually when I eat in groups I'm disappointed with the quality of the food. However Tayyabs bucked the trend by having quality, tasty food in large portions.
Therefore if you want to have a good time out with a large group of friends, this place is perfect. Please note it's very loud so be prepared to shout across the table. (not the best place for romantic nights out or quiet dinners with the parents!)",1
4,"My sister recommended this fantastic place that did lamb chops some time ago, and I'd utterly forgotten about it. But then when it came to introducing a former school friend of my wife to his first Indian cuisine experience, having looked around the Brick Lane area we came across Tayyabs - and lo and behold, it was the restaurant my sister had recommended some time ago.
Booking online was easy, and we got a decent table in the restaurant. The menu isn't extensive, which personally I take as a good thing because it means the restaurant doesn't just have a fridge full of pre-made sauces that they add to things. Having been on holiday in India, I can usually tell the Indian from the Anglo-Indian and this was much more towards the former than the latter. The restaurant is bring your own, which my friend did and it was no issue - they do sell soft drinks though.
So for the food. We ordered a lot, and it was surprisingly cheap. All in all it came to just under £50 for three of us, and that was with three starters, two mains, two portions of rice, two bread, a vegetable side and soft drinks. Oh, plus poppadoms - but you literally couldn't have fit another plate on our table. The paneer tikka was delightful, I'd made the cheese from scratch before and I can tell that either Tayyabs did, or their supplier makes it very fresh. It was just spot on, and there is no way it was from one of those relatively hard paneer blocks you get from the supermarkets.
I didn't try the lamb chops, but for a starter it was a huge portion and my friend said they were good. The samosas were a star - probably the best I've had, and obviously home made rather than the traditional tightly bound triangles you get in most restaurants. The garlic naan breads were covered in a generous volume of butter, and the sauces on the tikka masala and the lamb dish were delicious. 
This isn't your standard Indian as it is more authentic than the normal Indian restaurants - but not so authentic as to feel like it is utterly alien. I would recommend that you book as it gets very busy (and loud!) but it is well worth it.",1
3,"This restaurant is good but not great. 
I ordered the following items: 
Mutton Grill (3.5/5)
Lamb Chops (3/5)
Chicken Tiki Marsala (4.5/5)
Garlic Nan (3/5)
Mango Lassi (4.5/5)
The lamb chops are ok, but tough and hard to get off the bone. I ended up having to use my hands which was not great. Mutton was also very tough and overdone. 
The chicken tiki Marsala was great but came 35 mins after the first dishes. The food seems to come out at a completely random order. People who ordered after me were done before I got my second course. 
This place is also a very obvious tourist hotspot. In the 1.5 hours I was there, 90% of the people visiting were American tourist. I happened to be sitting right next to the door and being American myself, I noticed the distinctive accents. 
Overall this place is ok but the staff needs more training and the food needs some work. I would come back but skip the grill and try more curry.",-1
5,"Some of the best Punjabi food I've ever had the chance to injest. I stopped by for lunch and had no problem getting a table. I opted for some traditional curries, but the grilled meats seem to be the reason most frequent Tayyabs. 
There are a plethora of curry houses around Brick Lane, but, Tayyabs ranks among the best.",1
4,"Went here last weekend and I was so impressed with the waiter we had I had to write this.  First the food was very good we had two different types of Lamb (both very good) and Chicken Tikka Masala also good, lentils and assorted breads and we picked up some kingfisher at the local convenience store around the corner.  But the highlight was this guy who seated patrons assisted with cleanup and made sure we had everything we needed.  He was great.  
So I will return here, and find out his name, and thank him again",1
4,"To many Tayyabs is the best curry in the East, and it turns out these many are pretty much on point. 
A lingering Sunday hangover and need for some comforting full stomachs sent us in search of a curry and what a choice we made. First thing to note is this place is known for being busy, and I mean lines out the door for several feet busy! Friday and Saturday night be sure to wait for a while but Sunday evening was perfect, table of 5 was snapped right up for us, joy. 
Secondly, and even better, is that this curry house of fully BYOB with no charge for corkage. Such a good idea and with a little Tesco 2 minutes walk up the road you can supplement any feast with a cheeky tipple or two. 
So on to the food. The menu is vast but it's vast with good options, incredible platters and starters with a good array of sides and little delights to grace the table top. Like any good curry things were kicked off with some poppadoms and personally I judge a curry house on the mango chutney. Tayyabs was on point (again), slightly chunky but a good flavour and a decent portion that 5 people could easily tuck into. 
After some discussion (sometime heated, due to the hangover) we decided to let our server do the hard work and decide for us. The service is fantastic and they really treat you well once in the door, so we had no issue with the waiter bring us his best picks. 
A few round of poppadoms later and here it was, a feast of epic standards and proportions. The curries and accompanying naan bread were all amazing, the smells took all of us to food heaven and conversation ceased as the next 20 minutes or so were spent eating ourselves into a solid food coma. 
Some top picks were easily the pork chops. I've heard this place was known for them and I would more than recommend getting them on the table. Huge chunks of tender pork in a beautiful spice mixed. Pork tends to dry in other locations but no sign of this. 
Other picks were 100& the garlic naan (no explanation needed) and the chick pea side. The BEST chick peas i've had, each one was as soft as the other and they almost melted in the mouth. The sauce was like a Bhoona but a little less spicy, and the after taste almost creamy Korma like. 
A little tip that we found, the curry and sides are so good that we didn't even touch the rice, just went straight for the hard stuff. Yes, this could be the hangover again but I'd seriously think about letting the dishes doing the talking and drop the rice. Get full on meat not carbs (little life lesson for you there).
In all we left happy, well fed and well served. This place is a must and I write this in the cab on the way there. I'll see you in the line. 
Job Done.",1
4,"A wild, crowded scene of locals, traditionally clothed Pakistani women, investment bankers, euro - hippies, etc. all there for one reason:  absolutely delicious authentic cuisine, mostly grilled dishes and tandoori, at incredibly bargain prices. There is seating on two levels -- try to get a seat on the main level, not downstairs for the full experience. Be prepared to wait, and sit in tight quarters next to a full table of Indian men, business people, East enders or any of the above. Once your food arrives, none of the seating or crowding will matter anymore...just the smell of the sizzling, smoking dishes is enough to delight and satisfy!  And no, the total on the bill is not a mistake.",1
5,"This place is amazing. Simple as that.
If your looking for an Indian grill then this is the place for you. 
Arrive early evening to avoid the queues. The wait for a table can be up to an hour and without a bar, or anywhere to rest, this can be tedious. It is worth the wait. Don't be put off if, you will only regretting not eating here.
As I have previously mentioned there is no bar here and this in turn means no booze. BUT, this only means one thing. BYOB.
Bring some beers and a bottle of red and you're in for a smashing evening of the finest grilled meats East London has to offer.  I'd go for everything and anything grilled. The last time I was here we literally had one of every grilled starter to share amongst three and it was plenty.
Great value for money with the bill, for three, coming to £40. Fabulous place.",1
3,"I think my view still stands after eating here, lamb chops were good, but not out of this world good. Well marinated, but not as juicy and tender as it could be, in fact close on the dry side. The service definitely needs improving, took ages for the somasa to turn up, and he still got it wrong. As we tried to tell the waiter what exactly we ordered, he walked further and further away. The funny side he still got the order wrong and had to go back. It was very busy again, and the noise level just kept going up and up, It definite a vibrant atmosphere.",-1
3,"Attended the restaurant last night. 
Atmosphere was great but a bloody great shame the food did not match said atmosphere.
Tayyabs suffers from the age old problem that all south asian restaurants suffer: the curries are all cooked in the same base sauce! There's no authenticity or uniqueness to an aloo saag when compared to a chicken karahi! 
The food is made to cater to an audience that is either not asian or are so drunk they can't tell the difference between authentic indian food and a restaurants budget-cutting variation!
If you're a brit asian like me, you can get better food at home!
The mango lassi and sizzling mixed grill starter are banging though! Must try both if you come here. The expenditure is also easy on the wallet!",-1
3,"I wanted to go to Tayyabs as I'd heard sooooo much about it from various sources. However I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. 
We got there and we were sat down fairly quickly which was good, in the middle of a line of tables for two people. The tables were very close together and I could literally rub elbows with the person next to me, so I felt a little boxed in. 
We opted for paneer tikka, chicken tikka, lamb chops,masala fish, baby chicken masala and a garlic naan and a Coke. Let's just say, we were hungry. The person who took our order didn't write any of it down. 
When the drinks arrived it was a Diet Coke, not a normal Coke, despite having specified normal Coke. After asking three different people, they changed the Coke over so that was slightly annoying. 
The paneer came first and I was excited about it as paneer is one of my favourite foods. However I was really disappointed. The paneer was rubbery and hard and bland. Paneer is not supposed to be like that, it's supposed to have a slight rubbery texture but this was hard - I found it difficult to cut through with my knife and fork! 
The chicken tikka and the lamb chops slightly redeemed Tayyabs. They were both delicately spiced and cooked really well. The meat was really succulent and tender. Really tasty. 
The masala fish was really not my thing. I didn't like it at all however my dinner companion did so it wasn't all bad. 
When the naan came, we looked at it but didn't realise until we tasted it and realised that it wasn't garlic naan. However the two of us just couldn't be bothered to send it back as the last time we tried to send the Coke back, they took forever. 
The baby chicken masala was very tender and cooked really well but I wasn't overly keen on the sauce - it was a bit bland. Maybe it just wasn't to my taste. 
Overall my opinion of Tayyabs wasn't great. I thought that the service was poor, the food was okay, not the best Indian I've had and I felt that the seating was quite intrusive. But I do understand why people like it, it's affordable, tasty(ish) Indian food where you can BYOB!",-1
3,"I do understand why other people may be gaga for Tayyabs, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.
I had an old school friend visiting from the States who'd never had Indian food. As we eat Indian a fair bit, and recently did a cooking class in Goa for a week, I decided this must be rectified immediately. I wanted to be able to show him Brick Lane and the environs, but I knew the restaurants on Brick Lane can be a bit hit-and-miss. I'd heard great things about Tayyabs though, and they had online booking, so it was an easy choice.
We arrived at 7pm on a Friday for our booking, just 3 of us. We kept trying to say we had a booking but they weren't interested as it wasn't crazily busy (Ramadan fasting time). They took us up to the top floor and we got a table right away. It is definitely close quarters but okay.
The menu is quite short, and as our guest didn't know what any of it was, really, I just went ahead and ordered - a lamb dish, a chicken tikka masala, sag aloo, rice and garlic naan, along with some paneer tikka, lamb chops, and samosas to start. Our guest had brought a beer, so I asked for a bottle opener, and we ordered Coke.
The food came out pretty much all at once, except for the paneer which was first. My favourite foods of the night were the samosas and the paneer. I didn't try the lamb chops, and our guest only had one, so I think he wasn't blown away.
I just didn't care much for the curry, to be honest. Not a huge amount of flavour and a bit oily.The garlic naan was more like a garlic bread from Prezzo, swimming in butter. The service wasn't rude but wasn't attentive. 
After we'd been there about an hour, it started getting really, really loud. This was easily because of the amount of BYOB that the tables around us had - they were well on their way to being wasted. We made a pretty swift exit around this point.
The upsides were that we all left full, nothing was *bad*, and we spent under £50 for a silly amount of food. A good spot for a tourist to feel authentic, but not so much for someone who has more time and choices.",-1
4,"So I've lived in the Eastend for 10 years and have never been to Tayyabs. Yes I know, but whenever we've thought about going, we've not had a booking and thanks to reputation and the guide books there's always a massive queue!
One rainy Friday evening a group of us decided to give it a chance we could get in. The queue was short considering. There was only 4 of us so a little easier to seat. The place was rammed! 
After about 20 minutes of waiting we got a table. The vibe in the restaurant is similar to crowded pub, very loud and hectic. Service was ok, we felt more like a hinderance than paying customers. I think the restaurant has become a victim of it's own success. The food was good, but definitely not worth queueing around the block for.",1
3,"So, Tayyabs has a larger number of reviews comprehensively covering the whole experience.  But, well...I'm going to add my voice to the chorus:
It's totally fine.
Wait, wait, hear me out.
We went at an off-time (late afternoon on a weekday) which is totally recommended.  For food that wasn't earth-shattering (more on that in a moment) I would have left with a lil' taste of bitter to compliment that curry post-meal if I had been queuing for ages.
There were a lot of North Americans there (so the London guidebooks have been doing their job) and there was a lot of staff on the floor and yet...the service was bizarre.  We sat down and it took a long time for anyone to come.  When they did it was extremely brusque and aggressive.
Us: ""and we'll split one naan""
Server: ""one or two naan?""
Us: ""one, thanks""
Server: ""so two?  One is not enough""
We ate lots, though.  
Pappadums: weird.  one about twice the size as the second and - as someone else mentioned - not crisp.  Should'ha skipped on this one
Pakora: yep.  Delish.  Wedge of lemon and some raita over these chick pea flour-dusted 
Naan: fine?  I mean, nothing spectacular but they were fluffy and warm and good for soaking up extras from the meal.
Mango lassi available *by the pitcher*.
We went for a lentil and baby aubergine curry and a chicken curry; both recommended by the server.  They were good not great; size wasn't particularly large (this was fine), but the real issue was that flavours weren't punchy.  That said, the chicken was really tender and the highlight of both dishes.
Yelp note: WISH WE HAD GONE FOR THE LAMB CHOPS.",-1
4,Great restaurant with a menu to suit all spice ranges in the heart of central London. There's no alcohol menu so take your own wine. Soft drinks served there. The staff are helpful and will guide you through the menu.,1
5,"My family has been eating here since 1972.... My grandparents had their warehouse on new road for decades and the food has been on point since I was a kid. 
Kebabs are a staple. That's all I dream about when I'm in LA (live there now)
Dry meat, lamb karahi, and lamb chops can't go wrong with either. 
Anyway I'm heading there now my mouth is watering !! Lol",1
2,"Yeah, sorry (I'm not sorry really) but given the number of people who rave about Tayyabs, I was quite excited about my first time here.
As it turns out, the majority of the dishes are swimming in oil and believe me, that isn't necessary though the flavours overall are good. I did like the sundries we had (naan bread etc) but it's hard for me to get over the fact that my plate looked like it had come straight from the Deepwater Horizon accident.
Most of my friends rave about the lamb chops, which were tasty but not sufficiently so that I'd forget about everything else.
In the UK, Indian food has this reputation of being unhealthy, rich and you'd think after the decades that Bengalis and Brick Lane had been here, they would have at least tried to change this image. 
Apparently not.",-1
5,"Yes, it hit the spot!  Their lamb chops, kababs and curry are all great.  Plus BYOB.
Highlights:  Food was delicious, cooked great and ample quantity, Location was easy to find, Staff was friendly and a huge dinning area.
Can improve: Lamb chops were a little over spiced and over cooked.  Also, the experience feels very rushed, they will have ALL your food out in 5 and you feel like they want to turn the table as soon as possible.  
Benchmark: For me the best Indian restaurants are Delhi Spice, Namaste Lounge & Everest Lounge.
Last dined in June 2015.  I have dined here multiple times and have had several different items from their menu.",1
4,"If you want a relaxed slow paced romantic meal then avoid this place at all costs.
If you want good quality Pakistani food served quickly in a place where you can bring your own booze then join the queue and enjoy the lamb chops.
Been coming here for over 10 years, and although can be rushed through at times the food is worth it.",1
4,"A very popular restaurant. Despite of having a massive three story place, people kept queueing. Booking is a must. Great options of Pakistani menu. Grill meats were full of flavour, lamb was my favourite one. Regarding to curries, the lamb rosh was also tasty. Get ready to have your tongue a little bit spiced! It will burn for a little bit. Order your mango lassy to cool down things. Eat the Asian way, grab your naan bread and stuck it in that curry, get messy is fun! The place doesn't sale alcoholic beverages but you can BYO, great! Oh... The Indian ice-creams were yummy and creamy, don't miss one of those.",1
5,"This was number one on our list on our trip to London! Everything we ate here was great. Their lamb chops were amazing! Definitely would recommend coming here.
Don't leave without drinking their mango lassi - the best I've ever had.",1
4,"thefoodseeker.com
When venturing out to London, it is only customary to have a good curry during your visit. A patient of mine had recommended this place, which was recommended to him by the celebrity food critic Simon Majumdar (a UK native). Known for their lamb chops, the restaurant was started by Mohammed Tayyab and has been within the family for over 30 years. Their use of spices is generally tasted in every dish. 
When seeking Tayyabs, the closest tube stops are either Aldgate East or Whitechapel. It is definitely a bit hidden in an alleyway, but as soon as you see the bright blue lights and the crowd of people standing in the queue, you know you found the right place. 
An array of desserts is displayed upon entering the door. People huddle around waiting for their names to be called as the smell of succulent lamb is within their grasp. Tayyabs is a BYOB eatery, so walk over to the nearest off-license or Tesco as soon as you get off the tube stop. And....don't forget to make a reservation for this place! Trust me on this one. It can be done online in less than 2 minutes.
Pappadums as well as a salad were provided, along with three different sauces complimentary to the start of the meal. The sauces range from spicy, to a sweet chutney and a cooling creamy sauce. All delicious!
LAMB CHOPS ( £6.50 FOR 4 PIECES): My favorite dish. The chops are delivered in 4 pieces, topped with a tomato and served on a bed of grilled onions. This dish could easily be ordered for each individual. The chops were succulent, rubbed with their own spices and provided with enough heat as to not overwhelm the palate. Is it the best chops I've ever had in my life? I wouldn't say so, but it definitely is ranked high up there and worth a try! 
KEEMA NAAN (£2.75): A definite must order. The naan was so fresh and stuffed with minced meat, onions, green chili, and garlic. The bread glistened under the light, waiting to be engulfed by the hungry individuals. 
CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA (£7.75): The dish is definitely not your normal chicken tikka masala you would find in the States. It contains karahi masala, coriander aka cilantro, onions and chilis. It definitely has a kick so utilize the sauces and the naan. The dish definitely goes well over basmati rice and you can bet your buttons that the chicken was not overcooked or dry! 
KARAHI GOSHT LAMB (£7.00 SMALL): This is my favorite of the two curries. Why? The lamb just melts in your mouth and provides enough heat from the chilis and spices for the dish. Again, naan and basmati rice are a must with this dish. 
GARLIC NAAN (£2.00): Order this if you feel like having bread without the stuffing. It is pillowy, soft, and oh so delicious with just the right amount of garlic!
PISTA KULFI AND MANGO KULFI (£2.75 EACH): And just when you thought you were done, you're not. This is a must to finish off the meal. It's ice cream with the creamiest texture in popsicle form. Don't mind the wrapping or the shape of the popsicle. You won't care once you want to cool off your tongue and sink your teeth into these. There are other varieties, but we chose these flavors. No disappointment whatsoever. 
Overall, it was a lovely meal shared amongst friends (family style) without breaking the wallet. We each paid £20 with tip and the meal left us thinking about the lamb once more.",1
4,"I stayed an airbnb nearby and this place came recommended. So after flying 5 time zones and making it from the airport I was ready for a good meal. Am a veg, so ordered palak paneer and raita garlic naan. Was super yummy but I could not finish it all so took it to go and gave to a homeless man.
I would go back in a minute.
Only con, I was a woman travelling alone, and I felt a little awkward the place was filled with men...",1
4,Some of the best Indian food I've had in the world - although I haven't directly been to India. Everything was delightfully flavorful. The chicken was moist. The lamb was not gamey. The beef isn't Alberta beef but still good. Loved the mango lassi! Defintely recommended for anyone visiting Easy London.,1
4,"I had dinner at Tayyabs tonight at the recommendation of a local friend, and I have to say I was not disappointed.  I was seated within 5 minutes of walking in even though it was at the height of dinner (6:30pm).  Looking at recommendations from my fellow yelpers, I ordered the lamb chops for an appetizer, which came out quickly on a sizzling cast iron plate and were absolutely delicious.  The seasoning and charring on the meat worked beautifully together.  Next I had the Dry Meat curry, which was anything but dry. (Dry meat garlic, chilli, turmeric and beef), this was also amazing, spicy but not too hot.  Along with that I had saag paneer, which was a partial let down of the evening.  While well spiced and flavorful, it came absolutely swimming in oil, again it was good but for a vegetarian dish I was hoping it would be a bit lighter and the oil just seemed excessive.  Lastly I rounded out my meal with garlic naan, which was also slightly disappointing only because it was under cooked.  I think another minute or two in the oven and it probably would have been perfect.  And finally a banana lassi to wash it all down.  The banana had been raved about by a couple yelpers, it was good but I think I'll stick with mango in the future.  Still a delicious meal!",1
4,"An essential part of planning a trip in a foreign city or country is relying on Yelp reviewers to point you in the right direction.  Tayyabs is the most reviewed restaurant in London, and for good reason.  Approaching the nondescript restaurant, i was unsure.  However once we opened the door and saw the hundreds of people dining, we knew we were on to something.  
We started with a mango lassi, we were preparing ourselves, just incase the food was uber spicy.   We had the dry beef, which comes in two sizes and is by far dry.  It was so spicy and the meat was so flavourful.  We over ordered, tip: if sharing a few dishes, order the small version.  The next was grilled shrimp.  Most people have been to a mexican restaurant where your fajitas come steaming hot to your table.  This was a more refined version of that.  A screaming hot skillet comes to your table and you can see the onions and lettuce actually burning the longer it sits.  The shrimp were massive and tender and so spiced, simply delicious.  
Overall, I found the service lacked simply because the restaurant just accommodates so many people. However the food and electric atmosphere  would bring me back into Tayyabs",1
2,"Appetizers were pretty good but entrees disappointing and OILY.  Like, really oily.  We had to spoon the oil out of our dishes.  The service is SLOW.  I have been waiting 30 minutes for the check and have asked three times.  I'd understand if it were busy but it's not, the staff are just totally indifferent.  
Also, bathroom are not clean, hand dryers are both broken, one sink is clogged, the other doesn't work and there are no paper towels.  Needless to say, it's been a pretty poor experience.",-1
3,"I was told to try Indian food in London as it was one of the best outside of India.  So my friend brought me here and the amount of people waiting to put their name in was insane.  Luckily someone in my party had the right idea to go online to make a reservation through Tayyabs' website.  So we didn't bother with the line and just booked for half an hour later at 10:15p and the restaurant closes at 11p.  
We order a lot of stuff, can't remember what.  None of the dishes were disappointing, and a few stood out.  I'd like to return to London one day to check out more restaurants to do a proper comparison.  The service was okay during the meal, weird towards the end.  They cleared our drinks before we were done, some of the workers wore their jackets and stared at the remaining few tables to pressure us to leave.  Then they shut off the lights.  It was pretty hilarious.  I think if you want to close promptly, or close to 11 as possible, you shouldn't seat people at 10:15.  
A nice tip is that they don't serve alcohol here so BYOB.  It's nice there's no corkage fee here.",-1
4,"Very busy even when n a Monday night! That's an indication of how good the food is. We had two dishes between the two of us, an amazing sag paneer and a melt in your mouth dry meat which was lamb. The only think I didn't like was the mango lassi. The portion got that was just huge though; one would easily serve two. Be aware that when you fit down they'll put some papadums on your table big they're not free. They do tell you this but just be prepared.",1
5,"I love this place! I have been searching for a place in London that makes good Pakistani food and this is it! The biryani specialty is good, the nihari specialty is decent too, and I want to try them all! The naans are amazing when they come to the table fresh and piping hot. One time I took a friend, the naan was not so good as usual, but otherwise I have found it to be excellent. I think the plain naans are better than the others I tried as well. My husband loves the seekh kabab here too. The palak gosht is decent too and the prices are very good.The kulfi here is amazing and they have the equally good pistachio flavour as well. 
The place is always packed so I assume everyone else knows how good it is too:) I'd advise getting a reservation if you can, the line gets long. It's not a fancy place but if you want to go somewhere casually, it's great!! Takeaway is fine too, but if you eat in it's always better.",1
2,"Controversy klaxon! Tayyabs has well and truly jumped the shark. 
The first times I've visited I did the classic queuing that everyone does but this time I had booked a table. My father is visiting and is really into authentic Indian food so I decided to bring him here. I booked because I didn't want us to have to wait although this now seems pointless, because there was no queue. It was actually the quietest I've seen it. And yet, they still wouldn't seat us until the fourth person in our party arrived. So even if you book a table, you still wait. This is a ridiculous policy and is clearly because they want you to eat, take your money and get you out ASAP. 
This was the case the whole evening and, let's face it, Tayyabs popularity is not what it was so they don't need to turn tables so quickly. They came over and hustled us into ordering and were so unclear about everything. It's so loud, you can barely hear what they are saying. I went to the bathroom after we ordered and when I returned, both our starters and mains were on the table. FFS. 
Starters are meant to come BEFORE the mains, not altogether so they can make you leave faster. It was very unpleasant and the same thing was happening to all the other tables. 
The food itself was fine, but nothing special. I actually preferred an Indian meal we went to in my hometown of Cork two weeks ago! The BYOB thing is great and it's cheap enough,but I'm over their crappy service. 
Tayyabs, I won't be back. Your food just isn't that good to warrant shoveling it down in two minutes.",-1
4,"Very nice busy place. Do not forget to make phone or online reservation - eases the queuing process! 
Food is tasty, meat is gorgeous. Reconciled me with mutton, actually. Garlic naan is average, but chicken tikka soft and tasty. Rice is simply superb. The sugar tooth would be disappointed by the kheer, but I relished its subtler notes, even after medium hot curries. 
I would not bring in most of my French friends though, as virtues were to my taste: they would burn their mouth, kill their taste, mar their pleasure.
I dined there alone, conversation would have been difficult as the place is crowded and rather noisy. But I enjoyed my meal nonetheless and had no problem metabolizing it - as sometimes happened when I Indian-dine in Paris.",1
4,"Great halal food, quite authentic and cool vibe as well - highly recommended!  Can't really go wrong with anything on menu - meat super tender, chicken biryani is amazing, curries and daal are also amazing",1
4,"Awesome and affordable Indian food -- if I could give 4.5 stars I would. Came with two friends right before 7 and we were seated after a 5 min wait (the line and wait became much longer after 730). To start each table is given a plate of delicious papadum and three chutneys. We ordered the chicken tikka masala (delicious), karage chicken (a bit of a cinnamon kick, very unique), garlic naan , rice, daal (my favorite dish of the night), eggplant (really good), and a jug of mango lasse (they ran out of banana). Had we been bigger lamb fans we would have ordered their dry meat. Overall it was a great meal, really lively ambiance, and an affordable 43GBP total! Highly recommend coming and bringing a few bottles of wine or beer -- it's BYOB -- better value than Dishoom.",1
3,"Tayyabs is an extremely popular ""Indian"" restaurant in London. It serves more Sindhi / Pakistani kind of food. Friends who have been here before, recommend the kebabs over the curries.
Their lamb chops were quite good as were the seekh kebabs. Husband and friends said that the prawns were good too. The chicken tikka though was dry and the paneer tikka rubbery. Kheema was a nice spicy gravy that went great with the rotis. The biryani was tasty, but I was quite put off with the addition of peas and other veggies in a mutton biryani.
Tayyabs is great VFM, but not a ""return to"" on my list.",-1
4,"I had friends in town recently and we ventured to Tayyabs. I highly recommend booking a reservation as when you arrive you are greeted with masses of people in a very long queue. The restaurant is huge, so I don't imagine it took too long, but air on the side of caution. 
We started with popodoms and 3 sauces, which were all equally amazing, the yogurt sauce had a kick that was fantastic! 
We ordered the lamb, a chicken tikka masala, sag aloo, chick peas and loads of naan. Everything was better than the dish before. Tender meat, so much flavor, comes out very quickly and very hot. 
Its also BYOB so we brought loads of wine and fizz. This also helped cut down on price. It was just over a tenner per person to be stuffed full of food and walking out a bit tipsy.. you cannot beat it!  
All in all, I will be back again and again because it was so good! 
NOTE: There is a tesco right around the corner so dont worry about clinking bottles together on a tube ride.",1
5,"I came here on the recommendation of my friend...and yum!  I really wanted to try Indian food in London, and this place was great. I had trouble identifying a good place for curry, as Indian food here is very different from the states. In the states, I could get a great Indian meal for less than $10. In London, Indian food looks fancy and goes for £15 or more. Dang...
The food itself was yummy, but not that much more amazing than my favorite local place in SF. What makes this place a 5 star for me are two things: Naan and Mango Lassi.
The Naan was SO FLUFFY. It had a bit of crisp on the outside, but was mostly soft, pillowy, and just yummy. 
The Mango Lassi was just super yummy. They must have found the ripest mangos in all of London. So glad we ordered a jug of that, because it was just amazing.",1
3,"This place was highly recommended. I thought it was ok. We had several items:
- mixed grill: good variety. i liked the chicken the best. the seekh kabob was really spicy and tasted a little gamey.
- dal ghosht: very good, which was surprising because i don't like to mix the 2 together
- keema naan: was ok
- chicken karahi: really good
- mango lassi: loved it
- chicken biryani: nothing to write home about
The pappadums were good and came with a variety of chutneys, which were nice. However if you want mind-blowing Pakistani food, I'm sure there is something amazing elsewhere. I just don't know where. I did like the look of the restaurant.",-1
4,"I won't pile on, there have been a lot of reviews of this place. The food is good, go here for that exact reason. It's spicy, well done - just excellent. More Pakistani than Indian from what I've heard, but either way - it's good.
The lines are miserable, reservations may or may not be honored, and the service is indifferent at best. But the food makes up for it.
It's BYOB, which is also another advantage, and adds some value to the experience! Great for groups - just know you'll have to wait!",1
5,"very good food, price is reasonable, casual place and very fast service. I tecommend this place for casual dining.",1
4,"This is pretty much reached the point of beating a dead horse but I'm highly opinionated so I'm going to contribute to the endless reviews that has told you that this place is great. 
Tayyabs is... mental. I use the term endearingly, much in the same way Ron Weasley continuously refers to Hermione's antics as ""mental."" My coursemates and I, about 13 of us, decided to have dinner here for a final summer dinner before we all parted ways and when we arrived I was staggered by the amount of people on a WEDNESDAY EVENING. It was at dinner rush, our reservations were for 7:30 pm but thank god my classmates had gone here before or else I would not have known to reserve. So if there's anything that you should take away from this... if you want a guaranteed seat make a reservation. 
The decor was interesting, a bit chic and mod with neon lights. It has no kitschy Indian decor to dress up the atmosphere, it's almost like a night club. Overall, my first impression was chaos... but like an organized chaos. It seemed like all the servers, despite the massive amount of people crowding the doors, knew exactly what to do and where to go. 
Since it was such a busy night, we were left to peruse the menu with some poppadums and a trio of sauces for a generous amount of time. Eventually it took some serious flagging skills and a complete disregard for British propriety and subtlety to finally grab the waiters attention to let him know we were ready to order. 
But the most impressive part of the night was when the waiter came around to take our order. Among the 13 or 14 of our group, we all ordered a variety of starters, mains, and rice/naans. It was a hodge podge of a few starters, a myriad of mains, and different varieties of naans. The waiter remembered it all, no pad, no pencil. To our astonishment, he repeated the whole order verbatim without any missed dishes. My coursemates (who the majority of us have worked at least once in the service industry) gave him a well deserved and very awestruck round of applause. I know it may have been premature because the food hadn't arrived but damn... that takes some skill. 
I'm not going to speak much on the food. It was good and as it has been said repeatedly and several different ways the lamb chops were delicious; the dry meat was a bit more lack luster. But from what I gather Tayyabs is an institution in London, it's a place that everyone must try. The food is good and the atmosphere is thoroughly enjoyable. I don't know what it is but it could be the fact that very few restaurants are able to nurture a fun atmosphere without having their customers having to shell out more money for it; a part of it understands that dining in good company with good food is enough to make a night fantastic.",1
5,"I can't recommend this place enough. 
To start, the food is exceptional. Really really good. You won't get the usual fare though, so if you want a chicken korma you may find yourself left wanting. Just order whatever tickles your fancy and you'll probably end up happy. And they don't mention spiciness so if you particularly do / don't want spice, let them know. 
The service is also great, our waiter got a standing ovation for remembering all 16 meals without a pen and paper. He also pulled the ""I don't work here"" joke to dramatic effect. Well played sir.  Well played. 
The atmosphere can be anything from withheld to...  Boisterous. I think they'll try and sit you in an area that reflects your group. 10 tweenagers will end up in the silly room etc. 
Book ahead. They get incredibly busy. 
That's pretty much all I have on this one. Good food. Good service. Oh and BYOB. Which is always wonderful.",1
4,"What a great place for a dinner. I'm not a fan of going to Indian restaurants, but this is the consequence of the lack of great restaurant where I live.
I went there with a reservation, it was great idea because it so busy.
The menu is large and offer a huge choice and daily specials. I was surprised about the low prices, quantity served is large. Great value for the money.
I tried the Biryani which was really good and a bit too spicy for me. This place is swarming after 6pm!! 
A lot of waiters are going in and out, so I would recommended not to be seated next to the kitchen. The kitchen is open, you can smell the food from the adjacent tables, another reason not to go approach the kitchen.
Naan was delicious too, go for the garlic naan.
Service is nice but sometimes hard to catch. Bill remain low!",1
4,"Yelp! thinks I should add my review to the long list Tayyabs has already generated ...  so here goes.  
I actually can't believe how many years it has taken me to ""discover"" this institution for myself.  Just a short walk from the more obvious Brick Lane eateries, Tayyabs has been pleasing the crowds for many years now.  I particularly like the fact it is still unlicensed and you can bring your own booze (if you must - they have a good choice of lassi and other soft drinks) while on Brick Lane these days you are lured in with offers of free drinks.
Everything I've eaten here has been delicious, and the prices are very competitive.  And for people like me who can never make up their mind if faced with an extensive menu, there's daily specials.  A good deal alround while probably not the right setting for a romantic dinner date.",1
5,"*You can bring your own liquor, no charge! 
London is supposed to have the best Indian food, next to India. Being Indian, I was ready to test out this theory, so on our last night in London Town, I was on a search for a good place. After Yelping, we decided on Tayyabs. It's in a sketchy part of town, but believe me, it's well worth it! Hold on to your bag, honey, and scurry yourself over to this place. 
Walking in, you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of people. When I say that, believe me, there are A LOT of people waiting for a table!  They have guys standing around wearing ""Tayyabs Crowd Control"" vests - not kidding! 
Really GOOD food without the hole in the wall atmosphere. The restaurant was actually really cute. They move people through surprisingly quick. The place is super loud, you can barely hear the person sitting across from you. 
Please do not forget to order a jug, yes a jug, of their Mango Lassi. It will shoot you straight up the heaven and back, it's that good! Everything we ordered was scrumptious. The Keema Naan was the best - so buttery and flavorful; I'm on the brink of drooling just thinking about it. Their Chutneys, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Kabobs, Lamb Chops, Raita - all GOOD! The only thing that I don't recommend is the Samosas, they were definitely not authentic.",1
5,"I am not a fan of Indian food but I absolutely love this place. The food is delicious.
I usually go there in a lunch time when I can as there is no queues...otherwise make sure to book the table for a dinner as the queues are always massive.",1
3,"Everything we ordered was delicious, yet maybe I was surprised by some of unusual flavors (as I had never tried Punjabi cuisine before). The waiters were not great at explaining what the different dishes are, probably catering to a more knowledgeable audience 
The atmosphere was very busy and crowded, and as we were sitted next to the entrance, 70% of what I heard during my visit (the remaining being my brother talk) was big groups complaining on why they cannot be seated before everyone in their party arrives at the restaurant. I had heard that since Tayyabs has become very popular they have expanded their space maybe ""too much,"" and that was indeed the feeling I got. 
Big kudos for being BYO!",-1
4,"++ Lamb chops were exceptional
~ Chicken Tikka was fine
+ Lentils Aubergine were fairly tasty too
+ Great price - 17 for two people",1
3,"Good food, arrogant service.",-1
4,"Not much to say! One of the best in London. The lamb chops, and the chicken curry really stand out. Love the byob factor. Tescos is near by. 
Wish they didn't rush you quite so much. And the pappadoms can be skipped
Always a good place to bring guests to in London.",1
5,"Tayyabs. To me it's an institution not only of East London but London itself. I've had 3 different groups of foreign friends come over in the last year and the first place I take them to introduce them to a bit of London cultural food is here at Tayyabs. It's not just that you can bring your own booze (offies nearby), it's not just that the queues EVERY day show that repeated business is showing it to be success, it's not just the place is huge. I swear I've been about 30 times and there seems to be more and more rooms that I never knew existed. 
It's cheap but most of all the food is exceptional. I love the curry's I really do. They are all tasty and if you look online you will see daily specials that are worth getting. Also 'dry' curry is not dry at all. It's probably one of the best. But it's the starters that I come back for again and again and again and again. It's these that I ALWAYS order. I love the chops. Ah those lamb chops sizzling toward the table. And the Sheekh kebabs....the Panneer Tikka...the Chicken Tikka. These FOUR you pretty much should get. I've been a few times when this is all I ordered for myself. It's that good. If you're really hungry of course go forth and get a curry and naans. Share those if need be. But always get those starters. The Lamb Chops if you've done your research needs no selling. It's the best in London. 
And though you can bring your own bottle of wine or beer...I would recommend (speaking as an Asian person myself) get a Mango Lassi. It's strange that my non Asian friends have rarely had this. I grew up having this mango pulp and yogurt drink that is fruity, creamy and smooth. it's ace. I'd actually prefer to have this than the booze with my curry to be honest. Yogurt is traditional to help cool you when eating hot food. So...what are you waiting for....GO! It's defo in my Top 5 places to eat in London. Enjoy!",1
5,"Whenever someone asks me where to eat in London, this is the one place I always recommend. I have been here over a dozen times over 4 or 5 years. Two dozen? Quite likely. Three dozen? Certainly possible. And this place has been around for decades. 
You do not want to go to Brick Lane. You want to come here. And BYOB.
You can read the other reviews that talk about the ambiance and whatnot.
I'll cut straight to the point. Here is what you want to order:
1. Chili lamb chops. They come out in a massive cloud of smoke spice. Eat all the grilled onions that accompany them.
2. Dry meat. It is not dry at all. It is delicious. Where were you all my life, dry meat?
3. Chana
4. Urid dal
5. Something else from the veggie list -- okra, baby pumpkin, change it up to spice up your life.
Gluten free notes: I eat here all the time with no problems, though I have not attempted to verify what is or is not gluten free. Papadums are fine (rice & lentil). No naan for you!",1
5,"Just delicious. The dry meat (not a good name!) is extraordinary and the chicken tikka is gorgeous. Very sweet service, and the waiter was charming to our toddler.",1
3,"A very popular Indian/Pakistani restaurant out in grittier Whitechapel, but worth the trek out there. Lamb chops are the popular dish here but I liked the kahari chicken keema (ground chicken curry) and the dry meat (lamb cooked in curry sauce till the sauce is concentrated). The meats were juice and flavorful. Highly recommend those dishes. Also had the daal, mixed vegetables, and garlic naan, which were average but good. The only thing I didn't like was the burnt onion chips that topped most of the dishes. 
It's a loud crowded restaurant but we only had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated on an early Friday evening.",-1
4,"I heard from many people that this place was fantastic and after looking at all the positive reviews on yelp I knew I had to give it a try.
I took my fellow yelpers advice and made a reservation a few days ahead and brought a bottle of wine to this BYOB spot. When we arrived for our 6:30 reservation there was still a few open tables, but by the time we left around 8:30 the place was packed with a wait. And it was only a Monday! If you have a group, be sure to call ahead.
The food was full of flavour and the selection was pretty good. We weren't too overwhelmed with the massive menu that many other places have. They even have the menu online so you can check it out ahead of time. We asked a few questions from our server and he didn't seem to have a problem answering them which we found helpful. Don't ask anyone else helping the room anything, they won't help you, well at least that was our experience. Their was a main man on the bottom floor and he was the only one we could ask questions to, order, or pay.
I give it only 4 stars rather than 5 because they brought a starter after all our food came out and it was clearly sitting up in the kitchen because it was dried out and not hot anymore. Our breads also came out a little later than our mains so we had to wait for them to begin. So, nothing awful, just not the perfect set-up. The price is very fair and all together we are very interested in returning with a few more people so we can try a bigger variety of dishes.",1
3,"The food at tayyabs is great. Obviously the stuff off the grill and the fresh breads are the big draws. But the curries, the saag, the channa, the prawns are fantastic too. If I was just reviewing the food there would be five stars here. But I choose not to go there any more in the evening, because it's a crappy experience. You queue for ages, often an hour. Then you get squeezed into a seat. If you're unlucky that seat has the queue winding around you so your seat occasionally gets kicked while you're eating. The waiter is trying to be helpful but he's struggling, serving too many tables, squeezing through too tight a space. Then you're rushed out because hey there are 200 people waiting for your space. Go to tayyabs for lunch, but not at night. There are equally good places in the side streets, where you can have a lovely dinner time experience. Try Lahore one for example.",-1
4,"Busy even on a Tuesday. Flavorful and authentic dishes for a great price. 
Great for groups! Don't forget to order the garlic naan and BYOB!",1
4,"Great food. Rice at £3 is a bit expensive.
This place has changed A LOT since the last time I was there about 5 years ago. Better? Well, a bit unsure as it's now more modern and a lot cleaner. 
I had some sort of chicken dish. It was delicious and very filling :-) 
I would suggest Tayyabs for groups of friends and not for business or for a date.",1
4,"Tayyab's came highly rated from our friend who lives in London. We walked there from Brick Lane so we really worked up an appetite. He made reservations prior to our arrival and I can see how busy they get, even at the time we went which was not really lunch or dinner time. The food here is not the Indian type of food I am familiar with eating. We got some grilled meats Seekh Kabob, Lamb Chops and Chicken Tikka. We also got a mixed vegetable dish and garlic naan. They gave us papadam with some tasty dips. The garlic naan was exceptional. The meats, we asked if they were spicy and they told us no, but my hubby was sweating bullets! Overall, the spices used on the meats were very similar and I did not notice much variation in taste of the different meats. The veggie dish was very oily and I almost forced myself to eat it. I know giving back your food is not acceptable and I did not want to waste any money! So I ate it. 
Their website says Punjabi food and you can reserve online before coming in. I am sure this will save you some time. 
I would say overall the food was good, but nothing I would go out of my way for again. It's pretty expensive in my opinion. Compared to food in London its comparable, but for me it was a lot for what it was. 
I would be more curious to try the curry houses that are just down half a mile from here.",1
3,"Fantastic food, poor service. We made reservations online, and only 9:45PM and later were open -- that's how busy this place gets. And yet when we showed up and said we had reservations, we were first ignored, then told to leave the line we were standing in to sit down, and finally told to rejoin the line again, where we waited behind other walk-in customers for another 20 minutes. 
I'm perplexed -- why have a reservation system at all if you don't honor it?
That being said, the Karahi Chicken was phenomenal, the Naan chewy and hot, and the Seekh kebab spicy and tender.",-1
1,"I don't understand all the good reviews about this place.
We made the trek out here and were really excited to try this place. Coming from the US, the idea of amazing halal Indian food was everything we wanted. However, upon actually trying this place, we were incredibly disappointed.
First of all, our lamb chops were not cooked all the way. We didn't ask for raw meat, thank you very much.
Second, I found hair in my rice. At that point, my appetite was gone.
Third of all, the samosas were not so great. Even the samosas I have tried in the US were far more flavorful.
Don't waste your time going here. Dishoom was a million times better. And the service here was a joke.",-1
5,"£8 takeaway that is both filling, hearty, savory, and satisfying? This should be a go to stop for every underpaid and broke college student. I loved it! Eating-in isn't too bad either. I'm a fan of their chicken wrap. It's unbelievable how they jam pack so much flavor into one bite!",1
5,"Love love love! Great food and really busy.
It's good curry that isn't full of cream so you don't go away feeling horrible. 
Do not wear any nice clothes, and you will smell of curry as they are all way bring round smoking tandoori chicken.
Oh and did I mention.. Bring your own booze and No corkage",1
4,"London has a ton of amazing Indian food, but Tayyabs is by far my favourite - and in my opinion the best. I've been lucky enough to sample nearly every dish, and you can't really go wrong with any of them - although the lamb and chicken tikka are standouts. 
There can be a queue if you come during peak hours, but since it's a restaurant with three levels, it usually goes rather fast. 
Did I mention the food is good value for the quality and the price, and that it's BYO too?!",1
4,"We checked this place out to have indian\pakistani food in London.
It was definitely flavorful, the right amount of spice.
We ordered naan, chicken tikki marsala and fish kabobs.  The fish was nicely bbq-ed.  
I'd definitely come back and try out more dishes.",1
1,"Came here for my birthday last year as i had heard this was the best curry in town.  We had booked ahead and were seated in a very busy area upstairs (think Wagamma's esk sharing tables with the people next to you).
Our waiter arrived shortly after with the menu's but these had little to no information about the dishes found within it and the waiter seemed in no mood to assist us.  
We ended up with a selection of random food, nobody really knew what they were eating but the food was good (although nothing exceptional).
At this stage as we were coming to the end of our meal we were unceremoniously kicked out of the restaurant without even giving us the time to finish our drinks or consider dessert!!!
I assume we had a slot available to us which we had overrun but to shoo us out of the door was a complete disgrace.",-1
2,"Oh dear, I feel like I'm going to write an obit for the Tayyab's I once knew and loved.  I've been coming here for at least 7 years.  Granted, it had been a while since my last visit but wow, what a miserable experience!
To be fair, the food is still amazing.  The lamb chops are still finger lickin' good.  The table still falls silent once the food arrives - you can't get it in your mouth fast enough.
But there were two major downfalls this time.  We were there on a Monday night.  It was not full.  There was no queue out the door.  There were empty tables.  The service was its usual surly self but it seemed worse than usual.  They couldn't be bothered to help us make space for the food that was coming out and instead was telling us, quite rudely, to move stuff around.  Really?  What's the freaking rush?
But the worst was the bottle of water that they leave on the tables.  You think it's free but it's actually £2.50.  They won't bring you tap water.  It's the bottled water or nothing.  How cheap can you get that you won't even offer tap water?  
A completely disappointing experience and I'm not sure I'll be going back, despite the delicious food.  They've become a victim of their own success!!",-1
4,The grills are nice the currys are ok. You can get better quality in brick lane from other places. There also a queue at night. espc friday and saturday night so reservations are always good to do.,1
4,Tayyabs reputation speaks for itself so be sure to book! On arrival don't be alarmed at the chaos of trying to get in the door and let the host know as soon as you have arrived. Its BYOB so make sure you get drinks first! Once seated the service is quick and the food is delicious. Would be five stars if getting seated wasn't such a drama!,1
3,"Food was not bad. Portions are pretty generous and full of flavour. Extremely crowded and busy, and cutlery can be pretty dirty as a result. Don't wear anything nice there because you'll come out smelling of curry.",-1
5,"This place is amazing! I don't see any reviews stating otherwise but I'm going to go ahead and praise Tayyabs anyway.
Definitely a place to book in advance - queues out the door at 6 in the evening. It's a BYOB with a noisy very busy atmosphere making this restaurant a great choice for a celebration or pre-party meal. Staff are all very polite and efficient especially considering that the fast paced nature of the place I imagine makes it pretty stressful to work in! Our waiter took orders from all 15 members of our party then recited it back perfectly and didn't mess up when it came to actually delivering it too! Everyone's food was delicious (get the paneer) and came quickly. 
Tayyabs is a great choice for vegetarians, at least half if not the majority of the menu is veggie. So yeah, definitely go! But book in advance!",1
5,Amazing food if your looking for great Indian food in London this place so good! I recommend the veggie samosa's and and the chicken kharri (not sure is this is the correct spelling).,1
2,"NO! Tayyabs does not do a fantastic curry or fantastic grill or fantastic anything anymore..... :(
Once upon a time Tayyabs was the goto place, 5*s all around. Not anymore. 
A victim of its own success. Quality is shocking, prices high, queues long, service non - existent. My last curry was just a few pieces of lamb swimming in oil.
There are now way better places all within a few minutes walk... I would suggest trying those out, but by all means try out Tayyabs for the sake of it",-1
4,"Fantastic Punjabi food. Their lamb chops are amazing (just hope you don't mind burnt parts in your food). Their curries as also good but I end up going for the lamb chops as a main meal (you can have it as a starter).
If you want to drink alcohol bring it with you as this place does not sell it.  
Don't expect a fancy service or a quiet / romantic dinner though. And come prepared to wait for a long time, even if you booked in advance. Still totally worth it!",1
4,"Tayyabs is a legend among London curry houses, partly for its food (lamb chops being their signature dish) and partly for their queues because of their no reservation policy
As I don't frequent east London that often, I had never been to Tayyabs but when my Yelp Elite friend visited from LA, she had Tayyabs on her frighteningly comprehensive 2.5 day timetable, it was the ideal reason to make the trek. A bonus was when I discovered that they had started taking reservations
So, it was great to swan past the queue of people waiting to be shown to our table. Fellow London Elite Tirthankar D also joined us and he was able to help to navigate the menu
Their signature masala lamb chops were of course obligatory and we added some tandoori chicken from the grill. The curry section wasn't their strong point and we had a selection
The lamb chops were very good - moist, juicy and succulent given some good charring from the grill and heavy with spice. However, the curries were meh with no strong defining flavours to tell them apart
It was a nice evening with fellow Yelpers.The lamb chops are great but there are better curry houses in London town",1
4,"I think this place is GREAT! After a lot of hype and previous attempts at standing in line and then giving up, my friend had made a reservation for Sunday night and all went well. Between the 4 of us, we got 5 dishes and 2 naans and it was more than plenty -- we couldn't eat the last bites. And for all that? £12 a person. One of my favorite dishes as the dry meat of lamb... the name is underwhelming, but it's really delicious. Great that it's BYOB too, so I'm hoping it wasn't the 3 bottles between us that's influencing this review... Minor incident of finding a small rock in one of my bites, but I didn't break any teeth and they were super apologetic about it. I didn't make a big fuss of it because these things happen (at least it wasn't hair), but I'm sure they would have done more had I been upset. So: I recommend making a reservation if possible!",1
5,"I love Indian food, and this place serves up really unique but still familiar Indian flavors. We came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed - I think we ended up waiting 30 to 45 minutes for a table, so be sure to make a reservation. 
Free papadums start off the meal. We ordered two entrees and some naan. The entrees were absolutely delicious and made the wait for a table totally worth it. The ambiance suffers a little bit because this place is so busy - it's a huge restaurant (three levels), yet the tables are crammed in and every seat is taken. I wouldn't necessarily go here for a romantic evening, but if you're looking for some good Indian food and are ready to speak loudly so your dining partner can hear you, I'd definitely recommend this place!
Don't forget that it's BYOB - there's a Tesco a few minutes away if you need to pick something up last minute.",1
5,"When I was first planning my trip to London, I remember people making comments about food in London. How it wasn't too good, or how they were not impressed. However, one of the most overwhelming things that I received advice about was to definitely get Indian food in London.
Lucky for me, my tour guide Yee Gan O. knew all about this and created a mini little Yelp meet at Tayyabs!
This is in a location that's a little bit further than I expected in London, and was a little hard to get to via the Tube, but nevertheless I am super happy that I got to try this place because everything was AMAZINGLY delicious! Definitely have not had Indian food like this in the U.S.
I loved their Naans especially because they had so many different varieties. I also loved the lamb, definitely a must and their curry was just mindblowingly good! I definitely feel like there's a lack of flavor now when I eat Indian food here in the US because it is not the same!",1
2,Very disappointed. I came here 6 years ago and was raving about it then. I ordered a variety of things and honestly they were all tasteless. The flavor is gone out the door along with their humble decor before remodeling. The service was quick and friendly.,-1
5,"First meal in London, excluding the airport food. So much better than food in Italy... 
Perfectly spicy, perfectly cooked, quality ingredients, very fast service! 
It was packed but we were seated in a minute since we were a party of two. Loved everything! Just a tad bit oily. I recommend the naan and chicken appetizer!",1
5,The ultimate in Brick Lane area curries. Expect to wait but know the food is well worth it. Especially amazing lamb chops and tandoor chicken. Atmosphere is loud and bustling and the air is filled with spices from hot stone dishes whizzing past. Seriously great stuff.,1
2,"Food was good. Service was quick, although average. Toilet/restrooms were nasty with insects/bugs flying around urinal. Insects flying around our food table as well. If bathroom is not clean, chances are cooks are not following all proper cleanliness rules either. Nasty ewww. 
But truth be told, food still tasted good, specially the lamb chop! So your call. I would most likely avoid this restaurant in future.",-1
4,"I made a lunch stop at this highly recommended restaurant. I felt a little uncomfortable as it appeared that I was the only woman not dressed in the traditional muslim hijab on the street.  This  Whitechapel neighborhood where the restaurant is located has a large Arab population I had arrived as they all headed to the mosque for prayers during Ramadan. 
The restaurant itself was welcoming and the staff efficient. A table for one was not a problem.
I had the Tandori naan and the Tinda Masala, tender chunks of pumpkin cooked in oil and spiced with  garlic and garam masala.  The food was delicious with the right amount of spice. My only regret was that I didn't order the lamb chops as they looked incredible when placed on the table next to mine.",1
3,I think the lines here are mostly to do with the BYOB  Food is good but not that extraordinary. I would skip the lines and the crammed seating arrangement and head on over to Lahore Kebabs.,-1
4,"I probably don't have much to add here as most permutations of the Tayyabs experience will probably have been covered here already.  Tayyabs is one of those institution-type places that will likely remain popular 20 years down the line even if it degenerates (or rebrands as a fine dining place or something).  A few notes:
- decor-wise, it's not quite as, uh, stylish as Majliss in Oxford, but that lighting...
- lamb chops: they'll stick in your teeth, but that seasoning is goooood.
- the onions at the bottom of the cast-iron grilled meat pans are possibly the best thing in this place.
- last time I went I had to piss in a bucket.
- a busy curryhouse is somewhat close to my idea of a nightmare.  People always get packed in, large groups, the underlying assumption that it's ok to get pretty hammered and raucous in an effnic place (maybe I'm being harsh there, but...).  I rarely go to Tayyabs at night.
- chaotic service, you'll probably never get the same person twice.
- soggy poppadoms.  Soggadoms.
- I can't ever see pakora without immediately thinking of this: 
youtube.com/watch?v=wxKt…
- I absolutely love the tinda masala (pumpkin curry) - the tanginess of the pumpkin really makes this dish stands out.  Plus, although crispy fried shallots make everything better, they totally supercharge this one.  Nom nom nom.
-  Dry meat and chana meat.  Thank me later.  The chana meat is particularly excellent.
- Mango kulfi! (filed under 'Deserts' [sic])
Considering that it's the same price as most bog-standard curry houses, Tayyabs is great.  Every single dish I've had here has been packed with flavour and despite all the detracting qualities of the place, I'm still always really excited to come back here - I'd be hard-pressed to name a better Punjabi restaurant in London.  I find that most 'institution' places are really not particularly worth the time or effort, but Tayyabs really is.  Except you've probably already been, so, well, whatevs.",1
4,"You must order the lamb chops. They are amazing! This place is always busy, buts it's for a reason. It has great food. It's BYOB so don't forget your favorite alcoholic beverage. The service can be a little slow to come to your table, but I think it's worth the wait.",1
4,"I am a big fan of Tayyabs!
My favourite curries are chicken tikka masala and prawn curry. They are very hot and it is great! They are not just hot but have taste - some curry houses offer very hot curry but sometimes it is just hot and I really do not feel the taste of meat, spices.... Tayyabs wouldn't disappoint you, I am sure.
Don't forget to order lam chops. They are great. 
Although I love this place but there are things I have to say....
- Air conditioning system. The air conditioning system keeps sending very cold air - it is very nice as you would feel very hot while eating curry, but it's a shame that the cold air cools the dishes as well...
- Smell. I am sure you would smell very bad after staying this place for 30 minutes.
- Too crowded. You may have to wait for 10 minutes if you seek for a table for 2, 20 minutes for 4 people....
- Some people find the curry is too hot
You need to bring bottles if you want to have alcohol. Don't worry if you forget to get one as there are many local off licence, and Tayabbs",1
4,"Delicious! After looking for a curry house online this seemed to be the place to go. We walked in around 7.15 and immediately got a seat for 2. It was pretty cramped, but at least we didn't have to queue.
The servers brought salad and poppadoms. The mango chutney was really nice, not too sweet and the red sauce had a nice kick to it. We ordered quite a bit of food (as usual for an Indian) but the best was the house speciality lamb cops and the saag meat. The curries were full of flavour and there was a lot of meat in each dish. The naan was super light and fluffy and was perfect to mop up all the sauce. We polished off all the food and although I was super stuffed afterwards, it was worth it.
The only niggling point I have is that the service was quite rushed and I definitely felt like they were trying to turn tables over. There was a queue on our way out, but I would have enjoyed a bit of a slower meal. For the quality of the food and the price I will defo be up for making an East end trek for their curries again.",1
3,"This place always gets rave reviews and is in my area so I tried it a few months back.  I'm not the biggest fan but that's partly down to the business model - which is to get people in and out fast and not really do reservations.   There is often a big queue and the place is packed to the rafters.   A lot of people love that,  the brassy shouty mayhem feels buzzy and authentic,  but it's not my cup of chai!  
They do a great mango lassi and the desserts were yummy, but the main courses seem to be that brash ghee- soaked variety, rather than the complex spicy concoctions you can get at some other places in the area.",-1
3,"Such a let-down. The only thing that this place has going for it is the food. Normally, that would suffice. But Tayyeb proves to be the exception to the rule.
The wife and I booked a reservation here and after a long trip on the tube and a bit of self-induced (for Tayyeb) confusion about how to seat a bunch of parties that were queued up and raring to go, we sat down and had dishes, cutlery, and sauces plopped unceremoniously on our table. Having grown up with Cantonese waiters doing the same thing (but with much more insouciance), we weren't perturbed. Nor were we perturbed when we were told that they no longer did BYOB (great, another bottle of vino to pack for our trip back!). Nor were we perturbed when I asked for a fork and was given a knife (I ended up eating everything with a serving spoon). 
What did perturb me was the food. After such inept service and organization, I hoped fervently that every bite of the Karahi lamb chop masala, karahi gosht, garlic naan, and sikkh kebabs would be manna from heaven. Not so. They were all good- the garlic naan was soft, the kebabs were spicy and aromatic, and the main dishes were delightfully fragrant with a hint of heat. But they weren't that good. It certainly didn't warrant the long trip, the slack service, and the utterly self-induced chaos that marked the entire experience.
Oh yes, that BYOB policy? Totally arbitrary. The table next to us pulled a bottle of vino out of their bag and was handed a corkscrew. Unfortunately for us, we had already finished eating. Psssht!",-1
4,"It's amazing how many people this restaurant can accommodate. Right when you walk in, you're corralled into I guess what some people would call a queue. Yup, it's packed and every seat in the restaurant is filled. If you don't like crowds, you may be uncomfortable... Get ready to rub elbows with the strangers next to you. Luckily, the two times I've been, I haven't had to wait more than five minutes for a table.
I've tried a few things and all were actually quite tasty. Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Karahi Chicken, Lamb Chops, and Garlic Naan. You really can't go wrong with anything you get and if you're starving when you get seated, you are in luck. The food comes within minutes of ordering, it's amazing! Be careful because everything is piping hot and sizzling when it gets to the table. Dipping the naan in the curry is my fave and I always leave stuffed to the brim. It's a fast-paced restaurant, there are plenty of servers but they're typically running around and in a hurry so don't expect all-star service. I like this restaurant... it might be a bad thing that I live walking distance to this place.",1
4,"Unique Indian experience. I discovered it from the book writen by Alain Ducasse, the famous French chef and this place lives up to its reputation. It is packed and lots of people are forming a line the all time you are having diner. We had a reservation. Menu is clear with several dishes to choose from but not too too many which simplifies the process. We got tika masala, eggplants, dry meat plate, naan, lamb chop to start, a samousa and some rice. Everything was great, especially the fact that plates are spicy but just the right way. Sauces with naan, check, eating lamb chops with fingers check, mixing everything in your plate Check. We did it all. Plus it is BYOB, yes, and they have a Tesco down the road to refill if you run out. Perfect set up, honestly this place is a must and it is the first really true food monument of London I have tried, and it was a success. Go for it all the way.",1
3,"I have to say I like Tayyabs, but I don't get the hype. Great Pakistani food, with notably great flavours jn parts, but worth its status as one of London's must eat spots? 
Firstly some Tips: book in advance, and aim for just before dinner service (5.45/6pm). Yes that queue is for reservations; you'll be swept upstairs into a lovely large series of dining rooms. The pompadums you are offered as not free, at 80P each. Also do not be afraid to wave to get attention, this place is extremely busy and fast.
+ Food was delivered at a lightning fast rate, you literally wouldn't believe it. We ordered paneer tikka, 3 seekh kebabs, prawn Karahi, muttom tikka Karahi, 3 tandoori roti, 1 peshwari Naan, jug of sweetlassi.
+ Seekh kebabs were delicious, best I've had in a long time. Everything else I have to say was fairly tasty but not hugely exciting.
We left full and satisfied and had a good night, but I'm not in a huge rush to come back. That said, it's Lindon history so go try it!",-1
4,"We wre here for a company party the other day and it was a good dining experience. it's one of the better pakistani cuisine restaurants in town. Their selction of roast meats like tandoori chicken and lamb chops are pretty impressive, must be the marinade. The lamb was tender, not easy to do as a lot of places get it chewy. Nice decor and probably a decent place to bring clients as it looks rather formal",1
4,"Yes, I am joining the masses of people that make the trek to White Chapel for Indian food. The rave reviews for the mango lassis and pork chops at this place really don't lie. And BYOB is a marvelous way to enjoy your perfect beverage while dining here.
Stand out to me was the na'an, of which I would recommend you order at least one per person. The texture was something like a lightweight, delicious pizza crust.
Our dining party also found the vegetarian options very pleasing. 
I also discovered a few things I might not have otherwise. Like Indian candy dessert! I recommend the one that looks like a mess of orange Twizzler. Delicious.
Seating situation is weird at this restaurant. Almost all tables are somewhat communal and if you're not comfortable sharing a table with strangers, the crowds they permit to snake around your table pac-man style while waiting will probably feel somewhat overwhelming.
Worth noting, however -- I'm not ordinarily a huge fan of Indian food and I really liked this place.",1
4,"I am in London a lot for business. This was my first time to come to Tayyabs. Excellent food, excellent price. Very nice people. Good hospitality that they allow people to bring in their own beer and wine as they do not serve alcohol in the restaurant. There were many people from all walks of life around me, very pleasent atmosphere. I had the Karahi chiken, a samosa, saag aloo, rice and regular naan. Also a masala tea to end it. All the food was so fresh and flavorful. So this next week I will come here again. I like to hop on the tube, walk a mile or so to tayyabs for exercise then after dinner, head back to the hotel via a walk alomg the Thames to the Tower hill station. Wonderful journey.",1
4,"Great place. Always full! Get ready to get in line... a long one. The signature dish, the dry meat, however, will definitely make it worth your while. Plus, you can bring your own booze. One more reason to try this fabulous Indian place.",1
3,"There's usually a wait for this place, which signaled to us that it might be a place worth checking out. (That, and our host whom we were renting a flat from had recommended it.)
We walk in and were lucky enough to wait only about 5-10 minutes before we were seated in the downstairs seating area. Note: the downstairs is DARK. I could barely even see what I was eating. We decided to order the chicken tikka masala, chicken keema, garlic naan, and a jug of mango lassi. It seems like only another five minutes pass before everything is brought to us. Super fast service always raises a red flag for me -- either the kitchen is extremely well-coordinated or everything is pre-made and reheated.
Either way, the flavors of the food were decent enough, although it wasn't quite what we were expecting. Whenever we've had chicken tikka masala before, it was served in a creamy, thick, and rich sauce. However, this chicken tikka masala was soaked in a very oily and thin sauce and didn't taste as good as others that we have had (mainly because you would get a mouthful of oil with your chicken). The chicken keema, naan, and mango lassi were pretty tasty, though. For a party of two, we probably shouldn't have ordered a jug of mango lassi, but it seemed to be the better deal as opposed to ordering two individual glasses.
All in all, I've had better. Maybe the Bay Area has spoiled me too much, but Tayyab isn't the absolute worst. The flavors are strong and definitely have potential. The service, though, is a bit rushed at points (re: food arriving five minutes after we ordered). I understand that there's a waiting list of customers, but that doesn't mean that the customers who are seated should be given a quick meal and shooed out the door.",-1
4,"Great food in a super popular spot. Easily top Indian food I've ever had. Remember to BYOB, they don't have a liquor license.",1
2,I didn't like it here at all. It was rushed and we were squeezed into the smallest table. It felt like a bit of a conveyor belt. The 2 stars given because the pork chop starter was really delicious but the rest of the food was just ok.,-1
5,"I was very excited to check out this restaurant after having seen all the reviews and it certainly lived up to everything people say about it.
Yes the queue (and the whole experience) is crazy, and so are people who go here without a reservation. Although actually, I'm not too sure that advanced us greatly seeing as we eventually got a table just because a waiter yelled TWO PEOPLE and someone I chatted to in the queue shoved us forward. We got to sit near the queue which was awesome because you're all like HAHA I'M EATING AND ALSO LINGERING.
Following yelp reviews I ordered lamb chops and seekh kebabs, both of which were delicious although weirdly we both found that the lamb chop found underneath other food was much more tender and juicy than those on the top of the plate - sitting under lights too long? Tandoori chicken was also pretty good although no tandoori will never live up to my mum's tandoori ribs (which I recently tried to replicate with terrible results).
If you're looking for a non meat dish I'd really recommend the methi. I love the fenugreek flavour and am always looking for this dish on menus since I was introduced to it a couple of years ago (by a Pakistani friend at a restaurant called Spices and Herbs in Juba, South Sudan, which is - implausibly - one of the best Indian restaurants ever, trust me. Go there if you happen to be in town).
I also was really into the spicy popadom and the tandoori roti (chapati) was perfect. Which continuing on the random East Africa tangent this review has taken, reminds me of a dish called Rolex which involves an omelette wrapped in a chapati. Srsly: 
raebear.net/recipes/role…
My sister said she'd come back here, so that's her seal of approval as well as mine. Excellent value for money and fun, frantic, sizzling food.",1
1,The food was very lacking and the service was horrible. There was absolutely no spice and the tables were way to close to each other. I just felt like I was rushed out of there. The glass stairs had grease that almost made two people in front of me fall.,-1
2,Food is delish! And it's BYOB so can't go wrong. However on my last visit did discover chewing gum stuck on the bottom of a plate - disgusting!,-1
4,"First off, I know very little about Indian/Pakistani/Punjabi cuisine, but despite that, it was almost earth shattering to me...food in the US is *okay*, had chicken tikka, naan, and lassi in Brighton (was actually *very* good).
I had the Karahi Chicken main, veg samosas, garlic naan, and a mango lassi - the main was a bit piquant but very tasty of its curry sauce (I think) and the chicken was very tender. Vegetable samosas were nicely cooked and vegetables nicely done too. I think this place is the very best on garlic naan, not too powerful on the garlic but still plenty, and the naan was nicely cooked/baked. The lassi, oddly enough, I had last - and it could of been a dessert - not too sweet but yet the perfect balance of sweet, the mango flavors, and just almost velvet-like.
My friend had the starter of chicken tikka, main of keema (I think), some roti, and also some lassi. Chicken tikka and keema was awesome, as was the mango lassi, but the roti was eh...I guess she didn't like it. I wasn't in the mood for the roti, so I didn't bother.
Its BYOB, but they do server a few non-alcoholic drinks (and lassi) and, of course, water.
Tayyebs is a bit crazy as people are eating, talking, going to their tables, getting out from their tables, looks if the place needs a renovation 10 years ago, and a bit crowded - but its all worth it for the taste of great food.
The only con: because its busy and fast paced there, if you want attention (like order your food, get a table, etc), then get one of the wait staff folks - otherwise you may wait a bit more than you would like, though you'll eventually get seated or attention.
Will definitely come back when in London next.",1
3,"This one is hard to review, I loved and hated it in equal measures. 
I'd give it three stars for the food, and one or two stars for the terrible service. My friends both really liked it, so I'm trying not to be too moody, and give it 3 stars.
Making a reservation doesn't seem to help too much with the crazily organised queueing system! We booked a table for three, and arrived a few minutes early, but didn't get to sit down for around 25 minutes. We had to wait in a squashed hallway (completely rammed with other people trying to queue) with waiters pushing past us with sizzling dishes!!
One of the waiters stood on my foot, which left me in a bit of a bad mood as he was heavy and it bl***y hurt! He didn't bother to say sorry...but did knock me over as he wanted to go in the other direction. 
The food was good, cheap and came quite quickly once we found seats! Meh...the bad service spoilt the whole experience for me. I enjoyed the flavours, but won't bother to go back.",-1
4,"Wow! By 12:15pm on a Sunday this place was packed. Once we were seated and ordered, the food came out fast. We were in and out of this place within an hour.
We tried a variety of dishes and everything was really flavorful and tender. The only complaint we had was one of the samosas we ordered was a bit cold. The chicken tikka was oozing with smokey flavor and the sauce for it was very different than what we have tried at other restaurants in London.

5,"If my calculations are correct, this will be the 400th review for Tayyabs.  Surely it doesn't need more people reviewing it, but that's not how we roll here, because I'm going to tell you a secret... stay tuned.
A year or so ago Tayyabs changed their policy and started allowing reservations.  Before you'd show up, wait an hour, and finally get to sit down, after spending all of that time staring at huge plates of grilled meat and luscious plates of curries delivered to other tables.  Well, here's how to go to Tayyabs without needing a reservation, and you'll be able to just walk in and sit down.  Sounds too good to be true right?  Well, here's a tip: go for lunch on Sunday.  I know, so simple why didn't anyone else think of it (to be fair people probably did).  While all your other London friends are at the pub having a Sunday roast, you can go to Tayyabs and not have to wait!  Do it.  You know you want to.  Maybe I'll see you there, on Sunday a little after noon.",1
4,"Tayyabs is definitely off the beaten path, but worth searching out. The food is fresh and I would highly recommend the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan! This was also probably my cheapest meal in London!",1
3,"When my parents came to visit, they wanted to get curry in the UK - heard it was better than the British food!  We asked a friend and she recommended Tayyabs, so we headed there on a Wednesday evening.  We phoned ahead and tried to reserve, but they said not to bother.  Boy, was I annoyed when we arrived and saw a massive queue, and a crowded restaurant!  I American-ly complained about this to the host, who then got us seated immediately, so perhaps it pays to be a bit of a whiny Yank sometimes.  This place was PACKED with people - big groups, having a great time.  It was quite hard to have conversation, we were shouting the whole time, but my mom said she didn't even mind - she just liked being around so many happy people!
We brought our own wine and beer, since they are BYOB which is great.  We perused the menu which doesn't do much explanation, so consulted our phones a lot.  We munched on poppadoms and chutney while we tried to figure out what to order.  Then we waited for maybe 20 minutes before somebody took our order.  We had asked a few servers to be attended to, and they said they'd get someone, then disappeared.  Finally, someone who looked a bit managerial (different shirt) came and put his arms on the back of my parents chairs and was basically like ""what do you want?""  So we gave him our order, which he didn't write down, then he walked off.  Fortunately he got it all right, but he was pretty rude - was it because we'd asked a few times to be served?  He seemed pretty nice to everyone else.  We didn't really appreciate his attitude that made it seem like we were bothering him.
Eventually, the food came out, and we forgot our annoyances about the service.  We started with the lamb chops (which EVERYONE here orders) which were wonderful, great smoky grilled flavor.  You get 4 in an order and we'd happily have eaten more.  Then we shared a chicken with spinach, a prawn dish, and dahl gosht (lamb with lentils).  Can't remember the names!  Also pilau rice, tandoori roti and garlic naan.  Everything was wonderful!  I loved the garlic naan, and my boyfriend was raving about the roti.  The prawn dish was the favorite, and know when they say it's spicy - it is!  The lamb was very juicy, and the dishes weren't too greasy, which is always appreciated when eating this type of food.
Took about a million years to get the check.  I don't know - I'd give them four stars for the food, but the service is so, so crap.  They just rush you, don't walk you through the menu at all, and we were treated a bit rudely initially.  And I can't believe they told us not to bother booking when they knew they'd have a queue out the door!  That plus hardly being able to hear each other....I think next time I'll try another restaurant.  BUT, the food is very good, and if you know about the service and the crowds going in, you can probably enjoy it a lot more!",-1
4,"I went back to Tayyabs, ate-in, ordered more items, and did have a good experience. 
The service was surprisingly decent for a desi place.  
The lamb chops and paratha were on point. The karhai and okra dishes we got were also quite tasty (but the lamb chops were definitely the stars of the show).
I still expect more from a desi 'straunt in London, but I guess you just have to go out to tooting and south hall for more legit desi cuisine.  
For desi food in central, I do recommend a trip to Tayyabs.",1
5,"Best Indian in London. Been there many times and always a happy experience. Booking system online now works well, food tasty and waiting staff more personable than hitherto. Take your own booze from Tesco in same street and do have the naan bread. Prices are amazing  for quality of food",1
5,"Just go!! For the uniqueness alone, definitely an experience in London that isn't really on offer anywhere else in the city.
Go on a busy evening and you'll be queuing without a res but even that was fun, we just drank some of our beers while waiting. 
The food is great, look it's not fine dining so anyone saying they were told this was the best Pakistani/Indian in London and then bitch about the place needs to reconsider the opinion of whoever told them. They're clueless.
It's tasty ass food, cooked well and full of flavour, with a very good selection of dishes on offer.
Oh and the BYOD, seriously, why wouldn't you go.",1
4,"One of the best and well priced Pakistani/Indian food close to London central. There naans are to die for. Tried their Karhai, chicken tikka and lamb chops which were all outstanding. Debating which one is our favorite between Tayyabs and Lahore Kebab House; both are comparable though.",1
5,"I'd eat here every night if I had the chance...
The mixed grill is, quite simply, a meat-lover's heaven. We no longer need to look at the menu, it's that good.
Book ahead (unless you love queueing) as this place is busy every night, but even if you have to wait it's definitely worth it!",1
4,"On my loner trip to London, I wanted to hit up the BESTEST Indian restaurant in the city. Just as Yelpers have warned, the wait and crowd in the lobby was
 a cluster-f*. Good thing New York has trained me well! I told them I have a reservation (as did 100 others trying to get a table), smiled and waved a gazillion times at the host to remind him that I'm still here ...still waiting....by myself. =D Not sure if he felt sorry for me or just wanted me out of his hair, I got seated within 5mins. SCORE. 
I ordered the SHRIMP CURRY, LAMB CHOP, NAAN, RICE and MANGO LASSI. Attempted to get the lamb curry too, but my server advised me against it. Too much food, he said, and he was right. Overall, my meal was good, but it didn't blow my mind. Maybe because it was too hyped? The lamb chop was excellently seasoned, but overcooked on the sizzling platter. 
I finished 85% of my meal; impressed myself and my servers. When my bill came, I noticed he didn't charge me for the shrimp dish. When I inquired, he said it was on the house. SWEET. 
Good food, lively atmosphere, friendly (albeit hectic) service. Totally one of the highlights of my British experience.",1
4,"Very popular place to eat authentic Pakistani food, so plenty of meat options and good price. They have also vegetarian dishes, so it fits everybody. Food can be a bit spicy and sometimes when they pass with a sizzling dish next to you for another table, you will feel the spicy in it! You can bring your own wine or enjoy a lassi!",1
5,"Great Indian restaurant in the heart of London's East End. Took my family there when they were visiting and everyone enjoyed it massively. Tried a selection of dishes and everything was flavoursome and tasted lovely. Luckily, we also arrived just before it got super-busy and managed to get a table for all six of us as well. Got very noisy but that didn't really bother us at all. Great place!",1
5,"This place is always full, which just shows how popular it is, but you may have to wait..... There are always long queues especially in the weekends. The food is great and the fresh naan wonderful. They have the most amazing kulfi ice cream in mango and pistachio flavours served on a stick, so it's easy to take extra home! The prices are incredibly good so it's great value. 
The only downside about this place is your clothes come out smelling of Indian food for days!",1
5,"Lamb chops. And BYOB. And loud. And the long wait even with a reservation. But it will all be worth it. 
This is soulful Indian/Punjabi food that reverberates. That sings. it will serve as touchstone to your future tastings. 
We dined at Tayyabs at the recommendation of our local airbnb host  on the start of our 3-weeks European sojourn (London-Istanbul-Paris-Venice-Prague-Budapest-London). It was near both apartments. It bookended and capped the trip with nearly identical meals before heading back home to the states. 
That speaks volumes.",1
3,"We expected a lot after reading the reviews on Yelp but were underwhelmed. Also saw a mouse in the street as we were waiting outside in the queue. Ok, so that's a lot better than seeing a mouse in the restaurant ... but didn't really help with our confidence and the food was average, very cramped. There are so many Indian restaurants in this part of London.",-1
4,"I do love a bit of Tayyabs. For London it's super affordable but you do have to make the following compromises:
1. Most things taste the same (tasty nonetheless)
2. Portions are on the small side
3. You get rushed because of the high turn over
4. The sizzling plates will send everyone (no exceptions) into a coughing fit
Hate to dwell on the bad points because I still heartily recommend it for a cheap and cheerful curry. Those lamb chops are delectable...",1
4,"Recommended to me by a colleague after I lamented that the hipsters have taken over Brick Lane. 
 (veg) samosa starter, karahi masala lamb chops for me, saag aloo for the wife and a garlic naan to share. 
All were great and, while crowded, the place is huge and they seat people quickly (at least small parties). 
Solid curry house but BYOB",1
5,"We had a wonderful experience here. We came to Tayyabs at dinner time on a Saturday evening and there was quite a bit of a line. We expected we might have to wait a bit, but we were seated within five minutes of arriving. Our waitstaff was kind and courteous. Our good came quickly and was delicious! Would recommend, absolutely! The bill came and was very cheap, especially for all we ordered. We would definitely return if ever in this area again.",1
4,Authentic and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Those are two attributes you always want to hear. I can't compare this to Dishoom because they're world's apart - though I suggest both of these places for anyone looking to try amazing Indian food in London. Do yourself a favour and get acquainted with the flavour!,1
4,"I've been hanging out for great sub-continental food since arriving in London 5 months ago. Disappointed a couple of times by ventures on Brick Lane, but this was the best by far. 
They specialise in grilled meats from a tandoor oven so don't pass up on the lamb cutlets, chicken, seekh kebab or the different kinds of naan. 
The curried okra and dhal were so delicious and with a decent kick of spice. You can always cool down your taste buds with the mango lassi which was also a delight. 
Atmosphere is too hectic for my liking though. Crazy busy, noisy and crowded. But worth it",1
4,"We had to try some Indian food while in London - it's better here than in India, right? That's what everyone says.
After sifting through dozens of Indian places on the internet, we were stressed: they were all either too expensive (like ), too arrogant, or just too busy. Luckily, one of my friends stumbled upon this place ticked away in sketchy Whitechapel. It was a godsend. Somehow we got seated right away, but it was during the Olympics, so no one was in the city. Make reservations.
It was fucking bloody delicious. I have no idea what we got, I let my Punjabi friend Dave do all of the ordering, and even he was impressed with the food. I think we tried 32 different types of Naan that evening. Kilos of lamb. I don't know, it was a blur. The best part (for an American in London) - the prices were very reasonable. Oh yea, BYOB. 3 points.",1
3,"Very very busy Indian restaurant with BYOB and a good party atmosphere. 
The place is huge and have a large amount of staff. 
Come here for cheap food and no corkage on you drink.
The only downside was the confusion with orders and the  general disorganised staff- this could somewhat be excused by the volume of people in the restaurant. 
Food was standard Indian .
Good location for a birthday or group night out but don't expect amazing food and service.",-1
5,"Excellent for grilled meats and curries. The garlic naan is delicious as well.
Unfortunately, there is always a line for a table. But the restaurant is huge so I've never waited for more than 30 minutes",1
4,"I came to Tayyabs on a Friday, and it was very busy. Quite a few people were waiting to be seated. I recommend a reservation if you are going during prime dining hours. The tables were very close together; so much so, that a waiter needed to pull the table out of it slot so that the patron could be seated.
At the start, I was asked if I wanted Popadoms. I said yes and later found out that you are charged for Popadoms. It's an insignificant charge compared to the rest of the meal, but I'm not a fan of venues which are miserly.
For dinner, I ordered Karahi Mutton Tikka Masala (for those unfamilar with Indian and Pakistani food, it is basically lamb chunks served in a skillet bowl with spices and a few veggies) with a Tandoori Naan. The Mutton and the Naan were delicious. Tayyabs also offered three sauces: white yogurt based, spice based, and sweet based; each was tasteful in its own way and added an element of versatility to the meal.",1
4,"Tayyabs is an institution, that's for sure. The food - especially the lamb chops - is still incredibly delicious, and there are still long lines out the door, but I've taken away a star as I think the service has gone downhill. Yes, no one ever went to Tayyabs for service and ambience (let's face it, it's the Indian restaurant equivalent of the sadly lamented Wong Kei), but, still, there are certain standards, such as offering tap water - not charging for it - and trying not to injure your customers. 
On the latter, try your very best to gauge the direction from which the food will be served, and sit away from there. On a recent visit, I had sizzling bowls of food thrust right past my ear onto the table, causing me to jump in the process. There wasn't even a ""careful, hot!"" warning which came with it. I finally managed to save myself by piling up bowls and cutlery on my side of the table so that there was no more available space. That's right - I threw another friend at the table under the bus in order to save myself. So what? 
I will say one thing about the waitstaff though. They have incredible memories. Our waiter took our order (a table of six) without writing anything down and headed off to the next table (a table of ten) and took their orders before going to the kitchen. Nothing went awry with our orders, and, I believe, the other table got all of their food as well. It was a pretty amazing feat.",1
2,"Are the people offering reviews not locals? Who on earth would give Tayyab more than the 3 star ""ok"" rating?
The restaurant is beautiful and clean, and the prices are decent. You could be going to a shadier looking place and pay the same (depending on the dishes). Waiters were nice, but service was slow and inattentive even though we were RIGHT NEXT TO the kitchen. 
The servers bring out parathas and dips/chutneys once you're seated. Fantastic!
Mixed grill - not on the menu, but they'll offer a variety of the tikkas-- lamb, chicken,  shish kebob, etc. All of the grills were very delicious, and it all comes in a giant pile of greasy, oily meat. The shish kebob and the chicken were my favorite, but they really overcooked the lamb. Good flavoring... bad presentation and method. 
Chicken tikka masala - this is my favorite dish in any south asian restaurant (yeah yeah it's not ""authentic"" but that doesn't mean it's not crazy delicious!). There wasn't much curry. Flavoring was good but it left much to be desired. I'm stuffed but still want a curry...  (from somewhere else)
Daal - Lentils and aubergine. Eh. Didn't care for it to be honest. It was rather dry.
Naan - Best part of the meal honestly. Soft, fluffy naan. I tried the plain, garlic, and paretha (?). The garlic one tasted like nothing. It just plain naan with some coriander sprinkled over it. The peshwari naan must've had crack. It was DELICIOUS. Tasted more like dessert (fruit and coconut-y in the inside). Nothing crazy fancy but the naan was fantastic. My biggest issue was how greasy it all was. The naan was dripping with (and had piles of) butter and oil. Yikes. I get that you're supposed to brush the naan with the butter but I don't want my bread with pools of grease, thanks.
Mango lasso - YUM! Smooth, creamy, delicious. I wish it had more mango (and less yogurt) but it was fantastic and I had three glasses. Whoops. Order a pitcher if more than a handful of your table wants mango lassi.
I really liked the place overall, but I'll probably head elsewhere for my curry cravings next time.",-1
2,"*Wouldn't serve us tap water (which is the law), tricky with billing and were annoyed with the waitstaff.  
We walked in without reservations and we're seatedimmediate.    ly downstairs. We waited for over 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order. Sauces and poppadoms were placed on our table without us ordering it. We ordered lamb gosht (spicy and decent), daal (bland), chicken biryani (flavorful and delicious), bhindi 'okra' (delicious) and plain naan (oily but tasty). We were underwhelmed by the serving size of the dishes and the quality. They were really busy at 4 pm on Sunday so maybe they were having an off day. Bottles of still water were placed on the table for £2.50 each. We asked for tap water but our waiter said it's only served upstairs; it's strange that it's only served in a part of the restaurant even though it's the law. On the bill, they charged us for the poppadoms, which we didn't order or weren't asked if we wanted them. We addressed our concerns with the waiter and he wouldn't budge until the manager stepped in. The waiter said we ordered it so we asked him to show us what he wrote down and he refused to show it. Eventually, they removed the poppadoms.",-1
4,"When in France, eat French food. 
When in Italy, eat Italian food. 
When in Britain, eat Punjabi food.
And so it goes.
Place smelled amazing. Came here with a giganto group during infamous study abroad and were served delicious food. I had the Mango Lassi and some lamb dish, but tried bits of others' dishes and everything tasted very good. Super loud inside and some people can get pushy, but worth it for the atmosphere and food.",1
4,"Great atmosphere.  Great food.  And it's BYOB!
Head there on Wednesday for Shami Kebab Day!
The curried lentils are outstanding and the lambchops are amazing as well.  Don't neglect the Chicken Tikki and the Lassi popicles for Dessert!",1
4,"Yum yum yum. Affordable, delish, and a BYOB. 
We arrived at 7PM on a Sunday evening - so happy we did, there was a massive queue just after we arrived. They also take reservations online - definitely recommend you make one.
Service was a little slow (according to our friend who took us there), and they mixed up one of our orders by giving our starters to the wrong table. Aside from the mixups and having to wait, the food was really good and a decent price. The lamb chops are fabulous, as are the king prawns. Ended the massive meal by splitting a mango lassi and then walked home in a food coma.",1
3,"- Decent, spicy food.
- Poor service, but this isn't the kind of place you go to get pampered.
- Dishes aren't made to order; they couldn't make dishes 'extra mild', although 'extra hot' did mean they at least cut up a few extra chillis.
- Oily curry but not complaining too much. Mediocre vegetarian choice. Only paneer dish was starter, not sizzling but fairly nice.
- Amazing sauces though. Minty sauce was kind of spicy, unusual but delicious.
- Finally, don't go in your best clothes - will just come out smelling of onion and meaty sizzlers!",-1
4,"This is Lahore's upscale cousin: equally well known, but dressed with nice decor and a place you would actually take your parents to (but maybe only early- there were a lot of big parties near us where it looked like things could get messy). You can make a reservation online, which is fairly simple, and it's BYOB as well, so you are not missing out on that aspect either. I am not an Indian food expert but everything we had was delicious. Will definitely return again soon.",1
4,"Now, this is just one of the most famous place where to eat in London.
tl;dr: just go.
First of all, this is not an indian place. It's a pakistani place: that means north western indian cuisine with less fresh vegetables and less fresh herbs used and more dry spices.
The place is quite strange, blue neon, strange decors, it's kitcsch and fake stylish, you know the kind of places trying really hard to be cool and ending up in being ridiculous? Yes, That kind of place!
Then, the queue: I always come here in two, and I never waited more than 20 minutes. Last time I met another couple in queue who actually reserved a spot for two people and they ended up in waiting in line as much as us! So... well if you are a lot of people then book a table, otherwise just come here and put yourself in queue, and you won't wait too much.... well you'll wait standing and looking at other people eating, and that's going to make you hungry, but that's funny!
It's a BYOB, and a strict one, as they do not serve any kind of alcohol.
I don't think I need to add anything else, just come even without reservation and take as many dishes as you can, but beware: basically everything is a bit spicy, not deadly spicy but a bit, better not to bring anybody who can stand a bit of hotness!",1
4,"service is cool, mains are a mixed-bag...
but it's all about their lamb chops.
it's all you need in life.",1
5,"Tayyabs does fantastic authentic curry. Their lamb chops and naan are second to none. 
It is incredibly popular so you will probably have to queue even if you have a booking but it is worth a wait.",1
4,"The best indian food I had in London, it was part of a class field trip and we had a full five course meal. Everything was delicious, form the chicken to the pita bread everything was so yummy. I recommend it for anyone looking for great indian food.",1
3,"Tayyabs gets a lot of rep for east london asian food.
It's certainly better than your average brick lane eatery, and the fact that it is constantly busy is an excellent indicator of its popularity.
BYOB policy is always welcome as well.
But in my opinion? Overated.
The food is good, but the service isn't (if its always rammed, why should the waiters care?). Yes, its better than brick lane: but in my eyes that isn't saying a lot. 
Want real Indian/Pak/Bangla food?
Go to west london.",-1
4,"I came here with a friend based on the various rave reviews including its number one spot on a London curry house chart.
Quite easy to get to via the 'ammersmif n city line, the restaurant manages to be enormous and claustrophobic at the same time: it is on three sprawling levels yet the tables are crammed in à la Ryan Air. But don't let the large space fool you into thinking that seating will be a quick affair. We had a reservation and it is a good thing that we did because there was a line of people out of the door and inside, weaving around some of the tables. Fortunately we were not seated at any of those tables because that would have been rather annoying. Instead, we went downstairs into the bowels of Tayyabs where we were wedged in between two couples or maybe we were all at the same table - it was all that tight.
We had the lamb chops to start with. This was a big mistake because the couple next to us had some kind of mixed grill thing, which had lamb chops AND other stuff. Fortunately, the lamb chops were delicious but I really wanted the other stuff too... I had the dried meat, which was awesome if unappetizing sounding and my friend had the lamb karahi. We also split a karahi bhindi, which was great. The rice was just OK but the naan bread was excellent. All in all, it was a good thing that we didn't get the couple next door's appetizer because despite arriving ravenous, we left stuffed and our desire for spice fully sated.",1
2,"First time there yesterday for diner with my in-laws. 
Lucky we had a table booked as the queue there was out of this world! I could not understand why all these people were waiting as I didn't thing that many people could fit into one singe restaurant. This was of course before the staff took us to the upstairs floor. That is when I realised this was not a restaurant but a manufacture. This place is soooo big! And who say big, says loud. Really loud! 
No matter how good the food can be, I do not understand what can be attracting in eating food without being able to have a conversation with your friends. Everyone is shouting over everyone else.
What a disaster!",-1
4,"I'd love Tayyabs even more, if I could just handle hot food (as in spicy-chilly hot). They have some mild dishes, but still..if you can't handle spices at all, not sure you'll be happy there.
It's usually very busy, but I'd say it's worth the way. You'd probably wait longer if you're a big party though.",1
3,"Tayyabs is great, if you can get in. It is so popular that it is often hard to get a seat. The food there is fantastic, the atmosphere is somewhat chaotic and the seats are slightly packed in, but this is just because it is so popular. 
I wouldnt say it was somewhere to go for a quiet romantic meal, but if you are looking for a lively place to eat some fantastic meat and curry then this is the place to go!
I believe there are 2 tayyabs, one is vegetarian and one isnt, the one that I have visited was the non vegetarian one.
I would by far recommend the lamb chops they are absolutely amazing and so so juicy. I think we paid around £25 per head and had SO much food we couldnt finish it. We took our own drinks too as it was BYOB.",-1
5,"Best. Indian food.
Of my life.",1
4,"Great food and decent prices make this my favourite Asian restaurant. It can get a bit crowded and noisy, but the quality of food certainly makes up for it.",1
5,"The process of waiting in line is an absolute cluster-capital-F, but the food is well worth it. There's a reason the line is so long, and that's because the food here is better than anything you'll find on Brick Lane.
Also BYOB which is a big plus.",1
4,"There isn't much more to add, that hasn't been said already in the previous 396+ reviews.
Accept the ruckus, fast paced, fun nature of this extremely busy and popular restaurant. The service is prompt and the food is fast and full of flavour. Despite the hussle and bussle, which can feel a bit much at time,  just embrace it. They do extremely well to cater for the large number of customers. 
All in all, great fast, good food at affordable an affordable price.",1
5,"Tayyabs is my sure-to-hit-that-spot Asian restaurant. I've been eating there since they were that little restaurant in the backstreets of Whitechapel. And since then it has  NEVER failed me. Unfortunately, the queues are sometimes unbearable  but once that plate of sizzling lamb chops and plain paratha arrives, you'll forget all about it. sadly, I don't have pictures but BELIEVE ME when I say JUST GO THERE.",1
1,"We came from Los Angeles with a to-do list. Visiting Brick Lane to pay homage to our heritage was in top 3. And where to go  for that better than Tayyabs? And there we went The Boxing Day for dinner. We found a seat downstairs in a  relatively more empty setting than we anticipated.
Our food was just as  I wanted it to be. 
Service was simply terrible.
The guests next to our table came after us, but they were already served first dish even before the server took our order. But we said nothing.
By close to our meal we realized we were not given a Garlic Naan. which was fine as we were full already. so we told the server not to bother about the Naan and asked for the bill.
Our bill had an entry for Garlic Naan. No big deal, we asked our server to correct it as we already had told him about it before asking for the bill.
Then the conversation went something like this:
Server: But i did not charge for water.
Us: The water was same one you serve to every table. The menu says nothing that water is not served without request (coming from  LA we know)
Server: The water was mineral water. It costs 2.5 pounds on the menu
Us: The bottle clearly says still water. It taste like tap water too.
Server: And I did not charge for papadams either. For those of us not of South Asian heritage, you never charge for it unless it is asked as a menu item. Sure enough menu had no entry for it.
At this point we asked to see somebody senior.
in comes another man who parrots the lie that water was mineral even he admits we did not order it. i then ask him to ask any other guest drink water from identical bottles.
He refuses, changes to a native tongue that i fully understand and asks haughtily ""what are you going to do, eh?"" I will give him benefit of the doubt and say he did not mutter an expletive in the next breath.
Disgusted, and in presence of my son and wife, I walk out..
here is what i am going to do
1. write this review 
2. Canceled another dinner with LA based friends over New Year
3. Do everything i can to spread the news that food is not worth the rudeness and simply bad business practices.",-1
4,"Recommended solid and buzzing curry house
However we were staying in the Central London had a local wax over this place so much that we took the trip and on reflection I didn't see it as 'so much' better than anything in walking distance to warrant the trip across London.
I thought the food was excellent and extremely authentic as a Pakistani style curry joint.  It was very busy, the waiters were rushing us through the meal to spin the tables but bang for the buck was on the very favorable.
If you are in the city or east end and in the mood for a great curry where they don't hold back then I would highly recommend the place but get there early ! .. I would definitely return",1
5,Don't go there for the hospitality go there for the amazing dining experience.. Stop at Tesco on the way and grab a sixpack of beer or a bottle wine. Don't be intimidated by the long queue it moves rapidly and you'll be seated in less than 15 minutes on a crowded night. If I could give it six stars for the food I would.,1
4,"I went by Tayyab's on a Thursday evening (about 7pm) without a reservation. Everything everybody says about the wait is true. At 7pm, you'll wait about 20 minutes. Far more after 7.30pm. As you wait, you'll smell the smoky, burned-ish, foods going by you.
The neighborhood is sketchy, by American standards, but quite safe. Once you're seated, the waiter comes quickly to your table to get your order (remember: you pay 2 quid for the bottled water on your table, another 1.50 or so for pappadam - rather tacky, but given that the rest of the food is really cheap, ok to overlook).
I had the lamb chops, the masala fish, butter naan, and chicken karahi. The lamb chops are delicious, although a touch greasy (almost worth patting them down with a paper towel); the masala fish, honestly, was overcooked and a little too firm to eat, with not a lot of flavor; the naan was excellent, soft and buttery; the chicken karahi was also delicately spiced, but not too spicy.
Don't go here if you're looking for fiery Indian style food. It's more nuanced than that. You won't walk out of here with a perspiring forehead and a burning tongue, unless you ask for extra chilis or sauce (why!?). Just enjoy it for what it is - a Pakistani/Afghani restaurant.
My whole meal cost me 25 pounds. I think it was well worth it and would go back.",1
3,"Went twice. Was a little pricey, and had a long wait. The lamb was great, though.",-1
1,"Food is ok, not really surprising. But the reservation system is a mess up. We had a reservation at 8 o'clock, they didn't seat us until 8.30, and we also had to wait more than 30 mins for our mains. Don't think we'll come back again.",-1
5,"We ordered our food. I leave to use the restroom for around 2 minutes. When I return to the table my chicken tikka masala & mango lassi arrive at the table. What the flip? I seriously had never experienced that quick of preparation which made me 1/2 skeptical (uhh pre-made much?) and 1/2 happy (i couldn't deny that i was super hungry). Did they get the wrong table? 
well...the verdict came in when I bit into that tasty chicken with a spicy kick to it and later took a cool sip of the sweet mango lassi. I never thought I was a fan of Indian food in the USA, but Tayyab has me sold. I LOVED IT & I LOVE TAYYAB!  
love, 
from an American yelper!",1
5,"Best 'muglai' restaurant in the area.. visiting from the US, this is a must stop for me every time. Can't beat their lamb chops, tarka daal, naan and curries. Their mango lassi is also excellent not too sweet and not too tangy.",1
3,"This felt like the equivalent of a busy dim sum house on a weekend.
Everybody waiting was given a number. 
The restaurant is loud and bustling.
We were eventually seated. Ordered some drinks (yes they charge for water) and our order was taken.
The food was ok. 
We had chicken tikka masala, butter lamb and aloo ghobi.
None of it really stood out as AMAZING.
It came some highly rated on Yelp that I thought I should give it a try.
I have no idea if this place is really any better than the millions of curry houses on Brick Lane.
I still prefer Hot Stuff in Vauxhall to this place.
P.S. Charging me for tap water? Big turn off.",-1
5,After seeing this restaurant on many cheap eat lists as well as the excellent reviews on yelp-we decided to check this place out. We arrived around 10:30 pm and the place was very busy. We only waited about 10 minutes at this hour. This restaurant is huge and I believe it is four stories. The food is incredible.  We started off with tandori paneer appetizer which was really good. Papadum and chutney in the evening were included. They were delicious -favorite chutney was mango.  We ordered the Daal and also the spinach entrée both very tasty. Don't forget to go by the dessert  area on the way out wow it's amazing.  I wish I lived in London so I could eat here all the time!,1
5,"Amazing restaurant. Talk about BUSY!! We made reservations online and were seated in seconds. Great staff, and even better food. Very loud restaurant and crazy busy, but the staff is still attentive. Loved this place.",1
5,"Come here knowing with the expectation of waiting.... and waiting.... to be seated. But it's so worth the wait because their lamb chops are as good as people say they are. 
Bring your own booze, hang with friends, and your wait will seem a LOT shorter",1
2,"Quite disappointed by the other reviews. For me, this place is not a restaurant but a canteen, the food is OK but not more... The service is poor, way too quick, and the table is too small to hold all the dishes which are served all at the same time (starters and main dishes). So if you like to be stuck in a corner without any room to eat properly in constant noise, go there! But honestly, there are much better places in London.
Not really value for money.",-1
4,"This is our go to place for cheap food, but you MUST make a reservation in advance. 
Cheap eats. BYOB. Delicious food. What more could you ask for? 
Be prepared for really slow service. It's all part of the experience.",1
5,"Great simple food, wonderful flavours and great staff. Love this place for a cheap and cheerful lunch.",1
4,"If heard great things about Tayyabs, from lots of different groups of friends, which is always a good sign. This Easter weekend I finally got to go. For a friend's birthday a table had been booked at the sprawling Tayyabs which is on a rather gentrified looking street in Whitechapel. You're certain you're going away from civilisation when you suddenly come across it! The seven of us sat and perished the unusually concise menu for an Indian restaurant. We'd all heard of apparently legendary lamb chops so three plates of these were ordered along with a wide variety of mains. The food arrived quickly and at boiling point and was very quickly devoured! It was delicious, flavourful, dynamic and most of all very satisfying without the inordinate fullness you can get from other Indian eateries. Another good point is that the restaurant is Bring Your Own Booze and there is no uncorking fee so feel free to bring all you need/want! For seven of us it was £111 which is pretty reasonable! Id definitely go back!",1
3,Decent enough Indian food although it's always crowded and you'd generally be expected to wait in queues to get a table.  The lamb chops are a specialty and the lassi by the jugs a treat. Decently priced. Doesn't have an alcohol licence so they are generally  okay with you bringing your own alcohol.  Probably one of the more popular Indian restaurants in London.,-1
2,"The food was very good as many have said.  Now, onto why its a 2.   If you can't hear your companion, can't get up without moving the entire table, can't have a beer unless you bring it, or breathe due to the smoke....can you really rate it that high?
How about this, it's a 4 if you get it to go and a 1 if you have to suffer in the restaurant.  By the way, the service was fairly lame too.",-1
2,"2.5 stars, rounded down for the overall poor experience. (A few friends later told me that this place was a tourist trap).
Unless you somehow find yourself in this far eastern part of Zone 1, I would not recommend making a special trip to eat here. This place was recommended by a friend's friend. We had made a booking for an early Saturday dinner, and after reading plenty of reviews, I was definitely expecting poor service, but thought that the delicious food at a reasonable price would outweigh the service. I was also fairly excited that you could BYO here. 
So Hubs and I decided to take the long Tube ride over to Aldgate East. When we arrived at the restaurant, there was a very long queue inside. We went to the employee who was standing at the front station to check in, but he told us that we had to talk to the man in the blue shirt, who was running all over the place seating people. After a few minutes of observation, we realized that we couldn't stand around and wait until he was free but rather had to chase this guy down. Hubs finally did, and he did seat us very quickly even though we were early for our booking.
I wasn't expecting stellar service, but our server was curt and unwelcoming. He hardly acknowledged our existence. We ordered our food, and we made a mistake by asking if we could BYO. The server just said ""no"" and walked off. We didn't think that much of it, thinking that the restaurant probably recently stopped allowing BYO since they were so busy. So we just left our bottle of wine in the bag. Near the end of our meal, we spotted another couple seated next to us with a bottle of white wine on their table. At first I thought that maybe they had ordered it, but when we saw that our server dropped off 2 more water glasses and the wine opener for the customers to open the bottle themselves, we were peeved! Our server had the nerve to tell us no and then let this other couple BYO?! I know we didn't come here for the service, but at least treat your customers equally poorly? And apparently acting like a civilized human being in this place gets you NOWHERE.
The food was good, but didn't knock my socks off or anything. I've had much better Indian food in San Diego. We shared 3 kebabs, the lamb chops, and a small karahi gosht (lamb). We only ordered 1 order of the garlic naan. We could have eaten another piece of naan, but since the complimentary chips were a good vehicle for dipping the sauces, we didn't. Our bill came out to around 20 euros, and we were full but not stuffed. 
I think we have a pretty high tolerance for poor service in exchange for delicious food that doesn't break the bank...that's how most authentic Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley in California are... but the extremely poor service really ruins a nice evening out.",-1
5,"Tayyabs is (to this culinarily uneducated person), perfect. A modest menu with a large number of options allows you to spend time chatting to the people you came with over that bottle of wine or beer you picked up en route (yes, it's exclusively bring your own).
I've lost count of the number of times I've been here over the last 3 years, and never been disappointed by the portion sizes, quality and price. Fine dining it may not be, but Tayyabs is well worthy of your custom.",1
5,"This is one of the best Indian/Pakistani places I've ever been.  I had a couple bits of chicken tikka and they were tender and juicy with great flavors.  I also had a chicken tikka saag dish that was appropriately spicy and really delicious.  I'm currently on a restrictive diet, so I didn't get to sample the pappadum and naan, but there were plenty on the table, and they looked fantastic.  
The place was pretty busy for a weekday lunch, and I was told that by 4:30, it's packed with a line.  I can believe it.",1
2,"Extremely impersonal, slow service, non apologetic staff... Made me feel like they were paying me to eat there... Food is nothing extraordinary, nothing special to wait for in a queue for 1 and half hour",-1
4,"Food - I really enjoyed Tayyab's when I was in London last march. The dishes are not too heavy, and are very flavorful. My favorite dishes were the tikka marsala and the karami lamb. The naan and paratha were very good too. The sauces/jams add a lot of flavor. 
Service - great service with lots of helpful recommendations. 
Final thoughts - definitely worth a visit if you're in the area",1
3,"A Punjabi friend of mine recommended this restaurant.  When I walked in and saw all the white folks dining and loads standing in a queue for a table I admit I was worried.  Could it be it got lots of write ups about how wonderful the cuisine was and that's why there were so many non-Indians?  Or was it going to be a huge let down?  We took the risk and waited patiently for our table.  
Hmmm, I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.
The server plopped down pappadums and three different chutneys on our table and asked if we wanted it. We said yes, of course!!!!  Little did I know that on the bill there was a charge for that.  That's pretty lame.  You don't set down something like crackers or bread on a table like that if it isn't free.  If I wanted to order it off the menu I would have!
Besides that cheap tactic to make extra money I thought the saag aloo was good, chole (chickpeas) were too mushy, and the goat was pretty good.  Naan was also average.
Service also left a lot to be desired....................................I don't think I would go out of my way to eat here again.",-1
5,"I live on Brick Lane and have had my fair share of Curry, but Tayyabs is my favourite. For a start, it's not Indian, its Pakistani. The first give away of how good it was was the q that went on for miles. Since we had nothing else to do, we queued up. 90 Minutes later we were still standing, but at this point very curious. 
We were not disappointed. Though the place was jam packed, the staff never forgot about us and the food was delicious. The fact that its not full of white people flocking to try the famous east end curry houses was music to my ears. 
I would book in advance, but is definitely worth a go.",1
4,"I liked this spot.  It's not really for curries, so don't go there getting that and feel like it'll be amazing.  The bhindi (okra) was really delicious, the naan, yum, the lamb chops, I felt were a bit overrated here.  The flavor was great, but the meat wasn't as juicy as other places I've been to.  The sausages that come in the mixed sizzling plate of meat were delicious!!  That was actually the highlight of my meal there and that didn't show up in any of reviews whether yelp or otherwise.  
Definitely make a reservation and expect to wait even so.  It's crowded, so don't expect a soothing dinner experience.  It's very popular and trendy (at least right now), and I'm not sure the food merits it THAT much, but I'm definitely glad that I went.  Their dishes were quite good and different from the usual curry and naan types of places (in the US or otherwise).  If you show up, be ready to wait in a loooong, crowded, and noisy line.  Some of the tables are right next to that line, and quite smushed together!  But, it was a fun experience nonetheless.  
We got some sweets to go, too.  They are excellent!",1
5,"The Short: The food here is spectacular. The price is even better. Only one thing left to say: get the lamb.
The location of this place is a little tricky - it is situated off of the main road in a somewhat difficult to find location. While the surroundings are not exactly the most bustling part of the city, the restaurant itself is quite busy most of the time. In fact the place is often very crowded - be prepared to be up close and personal with the people dining around you.
However if you don't mind the coziness, then the rest of the experience will blow you away. While the service is nothing extraordinary, the prices are extremely cheap, which is a welcome sight for London diners on a budget like myself. The food was exceptional - everything we had was very good, although the lamb was far and above the best.
A couple of caveats though: First, they don't serve alcohol so it's BYOB (which, frankly, I see as a plus). In case you forget this, when you get to Tayyab go out the door and turn right. Walk a fair distance and you will find yourself at a store that sells alcohol, on your right. Second, the line can be quite long so be ready to wait or plan ahead and send one of your more amicable friends to hold your place.",1
4,"Nice diverse atmosphere. Excellent Paki / North Indian food. Great prices. Nice music (and not too loud) which reminded me of Mumbai. It's a no brainer. Don't go ... Run to this place. 
Always packed so you will probably have to wait ( but not too long maybe 15-20 min) if you have no reservations. 
Note: they don' t serve alcohol, it's a BYO so plan ahead.",1
2,"Not sure how this place got all this good reviews...
We have been there for lunch. The waiter seated us on a table we had to share with another couple even though there were plenty of free tables. When we asked if we could move to one of the free tables he just said that they are reserved for larger groups. 
It took another 10 min before we got the menu to order. Even though there are almost as many waiters as customers, the service is very slow. We then ordered some kebab and a curry. I don't understand anyone can rave about the food there. The kebab was dry and overcooked. The curry was ok, but really nothing special. It was a bit bland and the sauces have clearly been watered down. The only good thing was the mango lassi. 
The prices are also higher then you would expect for restaurant in this area and especially for this quality of food. Our overall bill came to 40 for a lunch for 2 with nothing fancy on the table. I wouldn't go there again and certainly cannot recommend it. Not sure who is giving all these 4 and 5 stars here. To sum it up food is average at best, service is rubbish, prices are too high for the area and the restaurant itself is nothing special neither.",-1
2,"THIS is supposed to be the best indian in London? how do you say ""overrated"" in British-English?
the sausage meat in the mixed grill (not on the menu) was the highlight... very tasty with great grill flavors coming through.
the lamb chops were dry, although the flavor was good. one of the worse lamb chops i've had as far as dryness goes.
bhindi (okra) - flavor was good, but not exceptional. 
naan - the naan was good
curries - curries here are definitely nothing special. 
overall, if this place weren't so overhyped, it might be worth eating at with no wait. i wouldn't wait longer than 5 minutes to get seated here for a meal. luckily we had reservations and avoided the long queue, but even the 10 minute wait we were subjected to with reservations was too long for this level of food. 
food was below quality of my typical fare from silicon valley indian restaurants... definitely did not live up to the reputed London Indian food reputation.",-1
5,"Yum yum yummm. This place is seriously the bomb diggidy. If you love your lamb chops, tayyabs is the place for it. Meat that falls off the bone, packed with abundance of flavours and spices. Just so good. I'd happily wait in the queue just for that. Writing this review is making my mouth salivate....",1
3,"Food seems overrated. My curry dish was pretty good, but nothing to go out of your way for. My waiter was bordering rude and could care less if they got your business or not, since so many people want to eat here. Seems the lamb chop appetiser was the best bet as almost everyone ordered them.",-1
5,"A really nice place, much higher class than the average Brick Lane area curry. I am a vegetarian and really enjoyed a red lentil dish, the naan is amazing, and the service is great!",1
5,"I love this place. The food is never greasy, and with a group of 10 of us eating all we could eat, we still managed to spend only 12 GBP per person. Definitely make a reservation if you want to be seated, and make sure you try their various tandoori related platter. Mouthwateringly, delicious, and I've found myself returning here, despite its rather out of the way location, more than once.",1
5,I'm studying abroad in London and our professor took our class here! It was amazing and I'll definitely be going back (if I ever recover from the food coma). Our menu was fixed which was perfect and the servers were so kind and helpful. I loved the chickpea and lentil dishes and rice! The amount of food was a lot but all so delicious.,1
4,"It's quite possible I'm, like, the last of my Yelp friends to review Tayyabs, but I did only go at the end of April, so it's more just because I'm really slow to go to good restaurants!... okay that's not true, but let me tell the story a bit more.
Tayyabs came at multiple recommendations, and I actually tried to go back in December with a friend. The line, which we had not been expecting on a Wednesday night, put us off, but not before I realized how close I lived to Tayyabs and made myself a deal that I had to come back, even if I had to make up a reason (as if ""I'm hungry"" isn't a valid reason...).
In April, I was in need of a great place for a group of friends to have dinner, and someone suggested Brick Lane. I mean, Brick Lane is cool, but come on: 195 reviews and a 4-star average? We're not going to Brick Lane; we're going to Tayaabs.
For six people, we demolished four dishes with naan for about £10 per person. We brought our own beer and wine, and only left because the table turnover is so frequent that a big party needed our table next. I hope they had as good of a meal as we did. I'd definitely say this is one of the top Indian restaurants in London, but if you don't believe me, you've got 195 other people telling you the same. TRUST THE MASSES.",1
5,"This is an excellent restaurant providing good quality food at a very affordable price. I went with two vegetarians and they had more than enough to choose from.
The restaurant is itself vast (on 4 floors) but the service is attentive but not pushy. The only one thing to note is that this is a BYO but if that doesn't bother you then I would strongly recommend the Lassi's they are excellent!",1
4,"Our first dinner in London was a good one! Pakistani food was something I had never had, and to be honest with you, if you put it beside Indian food, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
The queues were long, thankfully we had a reservation and were seated quickly.  Service was a little spotty as waiters looked understaffed that night.  But the food, especially the lamb, and grilled plates were fantastic.  Just the right amount of spice on everything.
And it is BYOB! BYOB! is this typical? I have no idea.  But it is awesome.",1
4,"I still smell like Indian food... but other than that, Tayyabs is amazing! 
I had a friend visiting London from the US and we wanted to experience Brick Lane. However, the last food I had on the lane was awful, so we did a little searching for a nearby alternative -- we saw the atmosphere and then walked 10 minutes for great food.
There will be a line, so if you know what time you want to go, book online! We waited for about 20 minutes and then had the fastest service I've ever experienced. Our food came out nearly instantaneously and the waiters checked multiple times to see if we had everything we needed. 
Definitely try the fried paneer for a starter! And if you're a veggie, you're in luck. Lots of delish choices.",1
5,"1st time there on my 1 week long London sojourn from Cleveland. We showed up at 945 pm on Friday evening. There was 20 min wait. This place does not serve alcohol , we got some beer from a Store nearby. The turnover was quick and it was packed with patrons at 10 pm. 
For appetizers we ordered 'Lamb Chops' & seekh kebabs. Lamb Chops are simply out of this world. Excellently marinated perfectly grilled, just the right taste. We added another order of same. For the main course we got aloo meat, chicken curry, urad dal and ginger naan. They main course dishes were finger licking good as well. Ended the night by getting authentic pista kulfi. 
Definitely a gem and must visit if you are in London.",1
5,I've been waiting to go here since 2008 when I first moved to London and I've only just made it reality!!!! OMFGGGGGGG. Worth the wait. I was gobsmacked by the whole experience...as you even go through the door you feel like you are in dorsia...the restaurant in american psycho...purely coz its so sought after and hard to get a res. The tables have glasses as its BYOB...and water...free popadoms...amazing food...omg the flavours and tastes....the nan bread...the chicken sag.....aaaaaaa. The service.....THE PRICE....the little chocolates with your bill. Indian heaven. Straight up.,1
4,"This place came highly recommended and deservedly so.  Quick service (although not overly polite) and excellent food, if you're looking for Indian/Pakistani food in London, this is the place to get it.
Fair warning though: bring your own beer.",1
4,"I've been a long-time Tayyab's fan from back in the day when it wasn't so upmarket. 
The food is always great, I've yet to had a bad meal. I always go for the lamb chops - they come out sizzling hot and are a real treat. You can't go wrong with any of the main dishes either and a mango lassi is a perfect companion. Do be warned that it can fill you up deceptively quickly.
It loses a star in my opinion as the service has gone downhill in my estimation. No sooner have you had your last bit of food the waiters seem overly-eager to get you out of the door to make way for other customers (which are usually are queuing out the door). I understand businesses want to make money, but I've not really been anywhere else where they seem so eager to take your money and get you out of the door.",1
5,Excellent all around. The dry meat was fantastic. Nice to get away from the touristy part of London as well.,1
4,"Pretty good, but I'm not sure it's worth a tube ride across town to eat here. You'll get really solid lamb dishes here, which I enjoyed quite a lot, but other dishes here didn't impress all that much. Plus, everything was quite oily, as in there were pools of oil in everything, which is OK, but makes you feel like it could be healthier. 
Place gets packed but they keep things moving along. 
The mango lassi is good an enormous.",1
3,"Tayyab is nothing special. The wait staff were a bit slow to serve me, had to wait about 10 minutes just to get a menu, even though the restaurant was almost empty. The food was average at best. I tried the Meat Samosa and one of the lamb curries with palao on the side. It's not bad, but expected something far better for London considering the hype around London indian food.  
The price is one of the redeeming qualities of Tayyan, for about 20 pounds you can have a filling meal for 2, but if you're looking for a top indian place I'd recommend trying somewhere else.",-1
5,"This was the highlight of London food for me. Some of the best Indian food I've ever had, and my hometown boasts some pretty spectacular Indian cuisine. It's real Indian food, not that the bland knockoff crap you find all over London. The pumpkin curry is so amazing, I don't even know what all to say about it...the complexity of flavors and textures is probably what's most impressive. The service is pretty awful and the wait is absurd, but both of those would have to be a whole lot worse to keep me from going back here every chance I get. We were in London for just one week and ate here for 3 of our 5 dinners, and that still really wasn't enough times in my opinion.",1
1,"was told this is the best Indian restaurant in London ... so obviously had to try it out
the food in general wasnt bad 7/10
the service.. worst ive ever experienced... 1/10
we asked for wine glasses and they gave us cups to drink out of.
they left the dipping sauces that the previous owners of the table had... thats not very hygienic.
one of my friends saw a waiter carrying one of the hot plates and sweat dripping off his face into the dishes.. terrible.
 
unlikely ill ever go there again
Mango Lassi was good",-1
3,The best way to enjoy this place is to acknowledge that it is barely full service. It is full service in that they assign you a table and they bring the food to the table. You will never get the knife you request and your neighboring table will never get the serving spoon they request. Just roll with it. You will be awarded with very good Punjabi food at reasonable price. Be warned that this place is a LOUD and crowded volume operation. Try the chicken keema and sweet lassi.,-1
4,"Once again Taayabs delivers on taste, price and atmosphere. 
As usual people are queuing in every square inch of the lobby and pavement outside. I always wonder what these people are doing - if you're coming to Taayabs rule number 1 is to book a table. Rule number 2 is bring a bag of cold beers (it's BYO), and rule number 3 is to have the Karahi lamb chops for starter.
I had the lamb gohst for main with a beautiful, buttery peshwari naan. As on all previous visits, the bill was greeted like a favourite uncle at Christmas. £12 per person for an enormous amount of great food.",1
4,"The food is quite good especially kebabs, lamb chops and biryani .. I would avoid the curry items.
The place is quite popular and given the seating space is limited I would recommend makkhan a reservation.",1
4,"I'm just going to be straight up with you: I cannot tell you what my husband and I ate at Tayyabs. Wait... I stand corrected. Lamb chops was one of the dishes on the table. That's all I know. 
You know what else I know? This place is LEGIT. Located in a not-so-glitzy part of London, it's a true gem that only locals know about. We dined with my pal Lizzie G and her lovely boyfriend Al -- man, I'm so glad she made reservations for us here. I was a little uneasy at first (Indian isn't a cuisine I gravitate to normally) but knew I was in good hands and to just trust Lizzie.
Like Kathleen M says, it's hot as ever in here -- even on a relatively cool evening. Body odor wafted through the air, but (thankfully) the smell of curry mostly covered it up. Lizzie wasn't kidding; we left reeking of curry (in a good way) and sweating like whores in church.
We were lucky enough to walk in with reservations just after 7pm, but by the time we were done the line was wrapping around the block. It's a rushed service too... they obviously don't want you lingering.
So here are a few things I learned:
1. Bring your own libations, and don't bother with anything but screwtop bottles
2. Ask what's in the dishes and don't be afraid to order them
3. Be prepared to take home food. Lots of it.
4. Drink the fruit smoothie they give you to help with the spice.
5. Leave your quiet voice at home. Yelling isn't optional to hold a conversation.
Lizzie, thank you for a wonderful Tuesday night dinner. We loved it!",1
5,"1. First time I've ever ""loved"" or even ""really liked"" Indian food.
2. Go in expecting soup nazi, and you will be fine, it's their world they don't care about a 1 star review. I love speed orders and bills shoved in my face.
3. Bring your own beer!!!! Or wine, they've no corkscrews or fees. Make sure you bring it cold as this is Europe and the nearby TescoExpress and Off Licenses don't understand the concept of proper refrigeration.
4. Menu inside left is ""medium"" heat/spice dishes with ZERO description of contents, menu back is ""mild"" heat dishes, their medium=hottish and mild=medium the spice/flavour enhancing sauces at every table are great
5. Only been once but I think parties of 4 are the magic number as there was an INSANE no-res line (40+ at least, no I'm not including take-away order waiters), but we were seated before our entire party could even get to the end of it and the 4some seated to our right had the same experience.
6. American Yelpers EVERYWHERE, I think Brits/Euros are more TripAdvisor peeps, disappointing, I know.
Totally worth the walk into the hood. I recommend The Commercial Tavern on Commercial Street (.7 miles NW) afterwards.",1
5,Lively ambiance and very fast service. Food presented in a visually pleasing manner. Highly recommended when in London.,1
3,"After all the reviews, I was expecting some great food and it turned out just ok.  I was here on a Sunday and ordered the Chef's special Chicken Biriyani.  For a dish that is the Chef's special, the presentation was poor and it looked like a heap of rice on a plate.  Digging into it, the flavors of the spices typical of a biriyani was almost non-existent, and the chicken pieces were some of the most bone-filled ones I have ever had.  That's simply poor for a chef's special.
We also ordered the garlic naan as well as the keema naan and there are no complaints.  Very good naan.  The mango lassi was also great.  
Overall, not terribly impressed, but will come back when my Indian food cravings return.",-1
1,"I'd say we must be missing something here, but given that we tried everything on the menu and nothing was very good, I really think I can state this is the worst food I've had in a long time.
The sauces on the table were the best part! The rest of the dishes were oily and lacking depth of flavor, and the lamb chops that everyone raves about were tough and burnt around the edges.
Terrible service and bad food is enough to make this a 1 star experience for me.",-1
4,"What a pleasant surprise! My friend organised her birthday dinner there on a Saturday night - we were around 12 and it worked out very well. We were sitted not too long after we arrived in a long table upstairs. 
Looking around a lot of people were in the same situation as us - big tables, lots of joy and celebration. The place is noisy, there are tons of people but it is a fun atmosphere. The menu is big with plenty of naan, lassi, meat, rice, veggie options
. 
When the waiter took our food and drinks order (for 12 people) and did not take any notes I started ohh no I see it coming it is going to be a disaster. But he surprisingly remembered it all. Impressive
The salty lassi was perfect - not too cold. And the chicken and veggies were tasty as well, not too spicy and on the big portion side. Maybe a bit too oily for my taste.
The food is very good value for the prices. It is a busy place (book in advance) so it was hard sometimes to get the waiter's attention
FYI it is BYOB
In a nutshell: I don't often go to that part of London so I am not sure I will get the chance to go back but if anyone asks me for Indian/Pakistani recommendation I will make sure to mention Tayyabs!",1
4,"I wanted to have really good Indian food while I was in England recently so trusty Yelp (and my Time Out guidebook) led me to New Tayyabs!  This place did not disappoint. I ordered the Karahi Chicken, Naan and a Mango Lassi.  I also had a bite of my niece's dish - Rice with Lamb bits and everything was delicious!  But the stand out for me was the Mango Lassi.  It comes in a metal glass and was so flavorful and refreshing.  I'm still thinking about it.  
The service here is also good.  The waitstaff were polite, answered all my questions and were efficient.  I will definitely come back to New Tayyabs when I visit England again.",1
4,Great value for money. The quality of the food is excellent. Make sure to bring your own alcohol.,1
5,"Food was excellent and enjoyed being able to bring my own drinks (save some money), even though we paid for quite a few bottles of water. Service was quick but this place is noisy! If coming with a large group don't expect to be able to hear anyone that isn't right next/across from you.
It's been said over and over... but MAKE A RESERVATION! Lines were long and we were thankful to have our table ready and waiting for us instead of waiting forever. One of the best meals during our visit to London!",1
2,The food is nice but the staff are rude and arrogant. Also don't be surprised if after you ask for any food left over to be packed for takeaway someone dumps some food containers and a bag on your table and walks away. Their idea of customer service is seriously lacking.,-1
5,"I love Tayyabs - a deep love affair dating back over 10 years and over 50 visits. For me it was love at first smell - but reading through some of the other reviews I can understand why others may not have fallen under the Tayyabs spell. You need to be clear about what you are getting here and what you are not.....
the food
this is Punjabi food and the grill is where all the action is. Mixed grill on sizzling hot plates - the aroma cutting through the air - I love that smell - if they bottled it I would buy it. The lamb chops are the highlight (they really are the best of all the punjabi restaurants I have sampled) and the seekh kebabs suitably spicy. Mutton tikka, chicken tikka, chicken tandoori all are good. I have worked through most of the menu over the years and to be honest I only really order from the starters and breads these days. The curries are ok here but I have other favourite places if curry is what I am after. I seldom am. Seduced by the punjabi grill......a carnivores heaven.
the atmosphere
Its heaving with queues snaking through the restaurant and outside. Every night of the week. Its packed - tables are close, spread over three floors. Its loud, its hectic, its great fun...perfect for groups if you book ahead. Not somewhere for an intimate first date or romantic night.  We like the ground floor best and the round table next to the kitchen is our favourite if out with the kids. This is our go to family birthday restaurant - the kids are big fans of the chops
the reality
you will wait to get in even if you have booked - bring some cans for the queue and just accept it...it helps if you know the managers (and we do now). You will be rushed through your meal if you let them - the food will be out quick - order your food in two batches if you want to linger a bit...once you have finished eating then they need that table and the hot towels will reach you before you have cleared the last bite from your plate. Its not somewhere to spend the night. IT is BYOB - no corkage charge - bring in whatever alcohol you want - there is no charge - makes this place a seriously cheap places for a night out.
New Tesco Metro has opened at the end of the road - perfect for picking up alcohol.
My favourites: lamb chops, seekh kebabs, masala fish, some tikka and a vegetable karahi (sometimes) plus lots of the delicious roti. Really good breads. 
How I love the great Tayyabs!",1
4,"This restaurant is located 5-10 min. walk from west of Whitechapel underground station. Its easy to reach there anywhere from 4 zones via underground.
Tayyabs serves almost authentic North Indian food (1 star removed for not being 100% authentic). I have visited Karim's in Old Delhi by Jama Masjid, which by far serves the most authentic North Indian food; Tayyabs is not quite there. I believe that the cooking method is similar but the spices are on the mild side.
I had ordered Peshawari Naan (sweet stuffing inside and quite loaded with butter), Bhindi Gosht (Okra, mutton in spicy curry), Chicken Tikka and Sheesh Kabab. Peshawari Naan was interesting but too heavy (oily) for me. I would have just ordered regular Naan, which could have been more enjoyable with curry. Bhindi Gosht was really good but a bit on the mild side. Gosht was tender and cooked perfectly to absorb spices. I highly recommend this dish, which I believe is not offered at many other Indian restaurants. Chicken Tikka and Kabab were tender but again on the mild side. 
I would definitely go back to this place but ask to make everything spicier.",1
4,"Ok, so you have to queue quite a bit and you do get hurried along throughout your whole meal BUT once you tuck into your food you seem to forget about all that: it's amazing Pakistani food for very little money We had 3 different starters, mains and a variety of naans and riceall beautiful.
The queue is never-ending so get there early.",1
5,Oh man. If I ever come back to London first thing on my list is to devour an order the lamb chops from this place alone. And this is coming from a person who does not like lamb. Food here is so good and worth a trip if you're looking for some good desi food. I was told make a reservations but I called ahead and they said I would be good as a walk in. Prices isn't bad either. Still thinking about those lamb chops. Yum.,1
5,"Even though there was a 20 minute wait (expected on a Saturday night at 7pm) the staff were amazing and kept order and managed to fairly get everyone seated. 
The most amazing part of our service was that when we ordered our Chicken Tikka started (which is frickin' amazing my I add), it was on the table within 90 seconds. That is no exaggeration. The speed and friendliness of service was impecable and quite amazing for such a busy night.
The bill at the end of the night was incredibly low, despite my wife and I being absolutely stuffed. 
We ordered:
Chicken Tikka starter
Karahi Chicken main
Rice
Garlic Naan
Baring in mind that isn't a lot of meals, we were both stuffed. 
Living in the US, it's so hard to find a good Indian, but when you come back home to this... it's all worth it. 
Mega Yum times.",1
4,"Very nice spicy food, nearly as good as mum's cooking. Excellent mango lassi. Very cosy inside, can get quite busy during peak hours so you might have to que.",1
4,"Four stars is surely the most appropriate rating here. The place is good in general but lacks some basic things in terms of atmosphere and service. Hands down, the food is great: it can be a little too greasy but it's manageable and I like it.
However, in some hours the hassle is so big that you can't hear your companion properly over the table. The tables are uncomfortably close and overhearing a stranger's conversation is not what I've signed up for. I guess they just wanted to make use of the space but stuffing that much people so close to each other is not appropriate. If you don't mind that, you'll have some delicious Indian food.",1
5,"Two words: lamb chops. 
One acronym: BYOB (so be sure to buy your beer, wine or whiskey before you turn up.)
Know this: If you choose to dine at New Tayyabs near closing, the staff will have no issue with swiftly removing your water, food and anything else on the table to hasten your departure. Make sure your remaining lamb chops are packed up to go well before this fate befalls you!",1
3,"Like other comments, I must say I wasn't really impressed with this restaurant, despite its reputation.
Despite being good food and relatively low prices, the quality and quantity are not that amazing.
Having to wait sometimes 1 hour like while moving like Tetris blocks between tables could be fun for a moment, but definitely not my definition of a cool night out.
The service is not fantastic either, with sometimes rude waiters asking evry quickly for orders. I wouldn't mind that much were I in Lahore, but in London, paying London prices, you'd like a bit more consideration.
Finally, one of the waiters once dropped some sauce from a plate onto my wife's coat. We played it cool, and tried to calm him down as he looked stressed. But despite insisting on giving us a discount, when we finally arrived at the cashier, who had heard of the story, no discount whatsoever. Being in a group, and desiring to get out asap we didn't make a fuss. And yet....
I've been told to go off peak as it's a different atmosphere. I hope it makes me change my mind...",-1
2,"I think the most complementary thing that I can say about this place is that, yes, it does serve curry.
I was there tonight, and it was the most stressful dining experience I've had in a long time. The waiters were shouting at us to take our seats, and shouting at us to take our orders, and left me feeling like we were eating against the clock. 
As for the food, the Karahi Chicken was pleasant, generous with meat, and very inexpensive, but nothing to write home about, and the peshwari naan just tasted artificial. I'm really not sure where the hype has come from...",-1
2,"This is my second review after my third visit to Tayyabs and unfortunately, still, I cannot understand why the hype continues.
This time, the food was actually quite good. Nothing special, but fresh and tasty. My friend had the karahi fish tikka masala which was by far the best. The naan was also  good. For this, I'd come again.
But the service.... we were served poppadoms and once the waiter had taken our mains order, it was served within LESS THAN 5 MINUTES! We hadn't even finished our poppadoms! Any plate we finished with was instantly removed from our table and hot towels were brought over the second I finished my food. Never mind that my friend was still eating!
I couldn't help it and timed how long it would take for the couple, who sat down next to us, to be served their food after their order was taken. By that time the place was busier than when we ordered and still it only took 6:22 min for the mains to arrive and once again, they hadn't yet finished their poppadoms either.
The service was so fast but really not so friendly that it impacted the experience as a whole. A shame.
PS: For truly amazing Bangladeshi food, please try Chilliz on Brick Lane. Divine!",-1
5,I was in London visiting a friend and wanted to try some Indian food. This place is amazing. I ate to my heart's content. Indian food in the US just doesn't compare. Lamb chops are a must and the mango lassi is yum.,1
5,Fantastic restaurant. We went to a wedding celebration there a few years back. Great food. One of the best place for currys in London!,1
3,"I had high expectations going in, but unfortunately was not wowed.  My main gripe with Tayyabs is that they really pack in their patrons - the tables are very small and very close together.  We were literally sitting with another couple (and the girl was extremely annoying).  And - probably a product of how busy it was - the service was just ok, for example it was hard to get the server's attention if we needed something, and it was hard to hear because it was so loud.
That said, the food was good, though I wasn't a fan of the rice being a separate menu item (rather than being part of the entree).  Husband got the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala, while I got the Lamb Gosht.  My husband liked it, though he said he prefers Indian-style Tikka Masala.  My lamb was flavorful, lots of spices, and I also liked the way the rice was prepared (different than I've had before).  To compliment the meal, we ordered some Peshwari Nan, which had an interesting, sweet, buttery spread inside.
All in all, an average experience.",-1
4,"Cracking place, great food, BYOB. Only bad thing is that they keep the run rate of people so high that your reservation is rarely on time.... But it's worth it for the food. And so inexpensive for the amount of food too!",1
4,"My husband and I tried the food in Tayyab by take away. We ordered the famous lamb chops, saag aloo, seekh kebab, murgh chana and of course the favorite nan bread. Having had Indian food before, I knew it is going to be spicier than many can tolerate. I enjoyed the taste of the food but the husband did not as it was too spicy for his palate. Therefore I get to enjoy most of tayyabs cooking (yay!) all to myself. Though it was definitely flavourful the only fault I could point out is that the dishes were greasy and oily.Otherwise, I will continue to visit Tayyab to satisfy my Indian food craving but perhaps only once a year to prevent the plaque formation in my arteries.",1
2,"Tayyabs, Tayyabs. You have pissed me off, royally.
We organised a joint going away dinner as my friend and I are leaving our jobs for the bigger and better in the great beyond that is the corporate world...but I digress! Tayyabs was our choice of a restaurant and from the beginning of our visit, it was an unsettling experience!
Tayyabs is PACKED. You need a reservation. What they don't tell you? All of your party NEEDS to be present in order for you to be seated. The attitude they give you immense - how DARE you show up to dinner with 99% of your party due to a friend being late? You have to wait in the limited seating area - with sticky floors beneath you - or outside, with heaps of trash (alluring aroma in the heat, let me tell you). Those are your choices. All this was fine - we kept quiet and waited for all our party to arrive and were seated. 
Everything about this experience was sub-part. I am not someone who believes you should accept shit service for good food. To be honest - Tayyabs didn't blow my mind in terms of cuisine. I have eaten in some of the best Indian restaurants in the country - hell, the world, and this didn't stack up enough that I would ignore rude comments, menus being shoved into my hand, having to beg for drinks or even any attention. Dinner was rushed - the menu is limited for vegetarians and the options are standard for Indian restaurants. The hygiene (or lack thereof) in the downstairs area of the restaurant kind of put you off eating there, but you keep quiet and eat - and the food isn't bad. I ate dinner with people who work in fine dining and they weren't pleased by anything and it's not because they are picky. It was almost as if I was asking for the world when I asked where our missing items were - everything was a bother. 
It reeked, the servers were rude and condescending, the food was so-so and the ambiance was non-existent. I'll skip Tayyabs - and the hassle - in the future.",-1
3,"I really enjoyed the food but our service definitely left an odd taste in our mouth.
We arrived early, as suggested to us by Londoners to ""avoid a queue""  We sat and were promptly greeted by a man who asked us for our order.  I chuckled at his style because as I was speaking dish after dish, he was not paying attention whatsoever, staring out the window and saying ""yes, yes"".  When I finished, however, he rattled off everything I had said and went to put it in.  Ok, that's was kind of funny, no problem there.
My buddy ordered a coke, which finally arrived 35 minutes later.  We weren't exactly timing each minute but after half an hour of nothing, it became noticeable.
The samosas were quite good, one meat and one veggie.  I preferred the yoghurt cilantro sauce to the other two.
Our mains were the kahani chicken, saag meat and the urid dahl.  All three of these items were absolutely delicious.  They had lots of flavor, well balanced heat and were just great, great dishes.  The garlic naan was also absolutely awesome.
Perhaps it's my perception of restaurant service coming from the US but typically, I'm not used to a place that acts like its customers don't exist.  Either way, the place was packed by the time we left and I think that is the most telling.",-1
5,The best Pakistani food in the world is in London and this is the best of the best. The flavors are subtle and yet linger on the tongue. The smells of the restaurant you will want to bottle and take home. The lamb is spicy and yet flavorful. The tandoori lamb chops are not to be missed. Naan with lamb is better than any pizza.,1
2,"My brother insisted we came here as a break from our usual Brick Lane fare and for its reputation as one of the best curry houses in London. The punters seem to agree with that opinion as the place was packed out and we were lucky to get a table at 6PM on a Monday.
The food was ok but not as good as the reputation suggested. My problem was that the place seemed like a production line, trying to move people out as quickly as possible. Our starters arrived and almost instantly the main course arrived leaving us with a crowded table. As a curry fan I just didn't get a great vibe from this place.",-1
4,"I'm a bit shocked I haven't reviewed this place yet. It ranks as one of the best Indian joints in London beating out Lahore Kebab House, Mirch Masala, and my newly discovered Simply Indian. 
As most people have said, the lamb chops are definitely a must have with tender meat, laden with spices, and grilled to provide that nice almost charred crust. You can't really go wrong with the usual slew of curries (I typically aim for a good lamb jalfrezi or vindaloo for my heat fix) and the garlic naan is buttery and crispy as it should be.
Ordering is an exercise in efficiency but if you ask nicely they will provide some suggestions. Just make up your mind quickly as the waiters tend to get a bit impatient. I've never had a problem with being seated with the longest wait (for a group of 10) being 15 minutes but we've also never been later than 6.30pm.
Added bonus is the BYO status which allows you to pop into the off license next door (that place must do killer business) and grab a couple bottles of wine or a crate of beer and plonk it down on the table without worrying about a corkage fee.
Overall, its good tasty Indian food at a pretty cheap price and beats anything Brick Lane has to offer hands down. It also works wonders as a pre-night out dinner stop but make sure to grab some gum from the off license too as garlic and curry breath is rarely a winner with the ladies!",1
2,"I had heard so many good things about this place so I was really excited to try it out! The wait staff was not very attentive. We ordered a lot of different options and once we were finally able to order the food actually came out pretty fast. The chana was ok, I asked for it spicy thank goodness because it helped add some flavor. The naan was also pretty good but everything else was horrible! The chicken tikka masala has absolutely no flavor and was super oily which was gross! Would not recommend this place to anyone And would never return.",-1
5,Great food - has an authentic feel.  good selection.  great prices and value.  A little out of the way.  I've been there twice - great both times.  less busy at lunch.  Not about fancy but about real - real good indian/pakistani food,1
3,"Food was excellent, the place was crazy busy though and the service was pretty bad. Maybe it was just because we were americans, or maybe they largely ignore most everyone (the table full of indians to our left arrived 10 minutes after us and was served and given food first however).
The tables are a bit close together so be prepared to listen to random conversations from strangers.",-1
4,"This vernerable institution truly deserves its reputation.  The mixed grill is always amazing.  My only gripe is the length of the queue each time I venture there but then of course it would have a queue with quality food like this.
My advice is not to wear your best jackets there because you'll be airing it out for a week afterwards.  But it's worth it ;-)",1
5,"Visiting London from NY, and omg, the best Indian food I ever had. The queue was a but long, a bit chaotic, but added to atmosphere of the place. Order the appetizer of lamb chops, chicken tikka, oh so good. For entrees, between the two of us, order the lamb massala and the best chicken keema I have ever had. Oh and the naan was delish!",1
3,"Yeah... I dunno. Lot of hype. Don't really think it lived up to it on all fronts.
We'll start with the good.
1) Mango lassi. Really good mango lassi. I used to think it was difficult to mess up mango lassi, but then I found restaurants that managed to do it. Get a jug. It's cheaper than water!
2) Pompapdum. The spicy pompadum is my favourite style that my local Indian place in Boston had, and now I know where to find it in London...at twice the price.
3) The waiter's memory. We had a group of 6, he didn't write anything down, and he recapped it all near-perfectly when we were all done ordering.
The meh.
1) Loud.
2) The food just wasn't that great.
3) The naan was particularly disappointing. oily and chewy.
The bad.
1) The card machines weren't working the day we came, so we  paid cash... and change (£14) never came. We had to ask for it.
2) When the change came, it was £5 short. So we included that in the total tip.
3) They don't serve tap water, only bottled. Some bottles are smaller than others, all are the same price.",-1
3,"Eat here too much and you can never ever expect Thai Abs like Tony Jaa, or I dunno, maybe you could.",-1
4,Bang on solid simple fab food. Get something grilled with charcoal: Probably the lamb.,1
4,Yummy Indian food. Big servings and you can bring your own alcohol... definitely a place you must try if you visit or live in London!,1
2,"DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT EAT ANY FOOD.
However, I felt I should review the restaurant based on the experience that made me leave it before having a chance to order. Due to the nature of the food cooked there (in large metal pans, as seen in the pictures on yelp) it is a very smokey atmosphere. Add to that the fact that a lot of the spices associated with the cuisine are quite hot, and you have a recipe for disaster for anyone with asthma or breathing problems. While my friend and I tried to last it out, we both ended up having to ask to be relocated away from the cooking area. Our waiter told us we would have to talk to the manager, who came about ten minutes later. He said of course, and moved us around the corner. Unfortunately, it was still exceptionally smokey and we were both actively coughing. We told him this, and he tried to tell us we were wrong. So we pointed to the inches of smoke clinging to the ceiling. At this point, he offered us a table on the other side (one that we had originally asked for) but we felt put off by the whole experience, and the coughing, so we went back to a standby favorite on brick lane proper. 
As a second note, the table beside us also had to leave before they had eaten any food because the woman was allergic to onions. We heard their conversation with the manager (as the restaurant does put you in quite close quarters) and apparently, though the waiter had been informed, they were brought numerous dishes with onions, which they kept having to send back. At that point, no longer trusting that things would be cooked in an allergen-free way for customers with health issues, they chose to leave. 
All this being said, loads of people were there and seemed to be enjoying themselves and the food. Also, the dessert bar looks fantastic. BUT if you have asthma or food allergies, maybe you should reconsider.",-1
4,"One of the better value dining experiences we've had in London.  Great Punjabi food.  Heavy emphasis on the spiced grilled meats.  Curries were great too.  The mango lhasi was to die for.  Be warned, no alcohol is sold on the premises.  The restaurant, however, allows you to bring your own alcohol and will charge no corkage fee. Very well priced (15 pounds per person, ate till we dropped).  While it is a bit out of the way, it is WELL worth the trek.  Do not forget to book a table. We went on a Wednesday and there was not a SINGLE seat available so make sure to book well in advance or be prepared to wait.  Also, be patient, as the place is so full that you will wait a bit for some of your dishes.
Last wort of advice, do not miss the lamb chops. Wow. Simply wow.",1
4,"This is always kind of a crazy experience but it's always a fun time. The wait tends to be pretty long from my experience (I've only been on Saturday nights but the queue gets long!), but I think it's worth it. It's definitely a no fuss place. You better know what you want when the waiter comes by...and no special orders! :) It's a bring-your-own-alcohol place which makes for a very cheap night out. Everything I've ordered here has been good. I keep coming back.",1
5,"Came here for Saturday lunch. Was busy but got a table within minutes. Food came out lightning fast. Curries were good but the show stopper were the lamb chops. Unfortunately they were not tender on this visit but very tasty. I would have been happy with just lamb chops, naan, and the spicy sauce.",1
1,"Honestly I don't know why I came back! I thought maybe they where having an off night and I should give it one more chance. Big mistake! The curry swimming in oil. The chutneys are not even nice ! When an indian restaurant has watered down chutneys and poppadoms out of a package you know you are in trouble. To be fair this is Pakistani owned so it's not true indian food to start with. Honestly I am baffled by the reviews raving about this place. I will never come here again. I brought my Indian Husband and his cousin and his girlfriend here and they said it was bad too! Honestly Do not waste your time here, there are plenty of better indian restaurants in London. This is one of those places where the reviews are misleading and disappointing.  I also had the lamb chops and they where just ok nothing amazing. My husband won't let me live it down that I dragged him and our guest all the way to this horrible restaurant. I am truly embarrassed with myself, there are hundreds of amazing other places we should have gone. I have now finally learned my lesson! never again Tayyabs.",-1
4,"If your dining partner is worried you might not get a seat at 4:30PM on a Monday afternoon, you know the place you are going is more than just a little popular.
After bronzing myself in the afternoon, I was hankering for a snack and a chilled mango lassi.  My buddy was feeling a little more than peckish, so we walked done whitechapel to have a bite.
We got in without any issue, but the place was far from empty.  First off, this place is so clean.  Despite being a busy place, trying to fit as many bodies in as possible, the bathrooms were sparkling and we weren't forced to sit on the laps of our dining neighbours.
We ordered the paneer tika, okra, and lamb chops.  We split a jug of mango lassi.  All for £21!  The paneer was, well, lovely.  Fresh soft, but with form.  The stewed okra was spicy and was not over cooked. It was reminiscent of a Nigeria dish, but the hot spicy was nicely balanced with the fresh tomatoes and lemon.  But lets not forget the reason we all go to Tayyabs, the lamb chops.  So good, I picked them up like a cavewoman and nom nom nomed.
Why not a 5? Lamb chops should be serve medium rare or rare, these were well-done.  I think I read it in a religous text once...",1
4,"The victim of its own success now, it's just too busy. But if you can get in, get seated and get served the food is absolutely delicious. Can't recommend enough the ribs, the dry meat and the peshwari naan yum yum yum",1
5,"We had Pre-Booked a large table on a Friday night and greatly welcomed. This place was one of the first restaurants I went to in London before I actually moved down and since I have been here I just keep coming back. The food is next level. So flavoursome and even better ridiculously cheap for what you get. The menu is quite small but I believe that's were the trick is. Because of the small menu everything is cooked to perfection. All the curries are medium spiced, so if you need something mild it might not be great but anyone that likes a bit of a kick you'll love it. It is also BYOB which is great if you are trying to save pennies. The total bill for 8 of us, including lots of starters, breads, rice and curries came to just over £100, insane! Normally they are extremely busy but on this occasion we were not rushed out by the staff. To avoid disappointment or a huge queue always make sure you book. (Visit - 13/02/2015 Dinner)",1
2,"A visit to Tayyabs is a rare occasion despite it being a stone throw from my apartment in East London. This is largely due to the consistent and everlasting que that instantly prompts me to venture further along. While this definite sign of popularity is a bonus to the reputation of the business I do not enjoy waiting in a long que through a crowed and smokey environment only to be let down by bad service and sheer irritation of having to shout at my guests over the cramped and chaotic atmosphere.
While I am sure Tayyabs reputation was warranted at some point in its thirty years of trading I feel that these days it is merely riding the wave of its past splendour. While the food is mediocre, I tried the Tikka chicken, Saag aloo and Briyani, it is the immensely poor service that really lets it down.
The venue does not have a licence you are welcome to bring along your own tipple.",-1
4,"Hands down the best Pakistani food I've ever had.  Yes, it's loud and crowded and in the out-of-most-people's-way neighborhood of Whitechapel. Yes, you will likely have to wait for a table in a long line, yes you will rub shoulders with your neighbours, and yes you will almost certainly smell like curry for days afterwards. No, you wont have intimate privacy at your table and no, they won't encourage you to linger for hours over your dinner, staring adoringly into your date's eyes and nursing a bottle of BYOB vino. 
But damn, the food is really, really tasty. If you go early to beat the crowds and are prepared to deal with the noise and the hustling waiters, you will reap the rewards of hot, spicy, perfectly seasoned Pakistani dishes that leave you wanting more even though you're too full to contemplate another mouthful.  
The biggest downsides: 1)  it's a trek to get to Whitechapel, and 2) Tayyabs has ruined me for a lot of lesser Indian and Pakistani places throughout London which I would have otherwise naively enjoyed.",1
3,"No clue why this place is as well reviewed as it is. It's not bad, but it's not excellent either.
Lamb chops were mediocre. Chicken curry was oily and not really good. Naan was pretty good, and tarka daal was quite good. Mango lassi was way too sweet and kind of  gross.
If this is one of London's best Indian places, I'm really clueless as to how the city gets a reputation for good Indian food.",-1
5,"Hey Kids! Tayyabs now delivers!!
helengraves.co.uk/2011/0…
While they did sort of yell at me for being late when my friend was holding the table for us... the rest was great! 
Definitely get a mango lassi to cut the heat.",1
5,"m.u.s.t. g.o. a.g.a.i.n!
Phew. I finally made it into Tayyabs. Every other time, I've come so famished, that the wait really just put me off. Every other time, I've just decided to go to Lahore instead. This one time... no. I WAS DETERMINED to get into Tayyabs. Without a doubt, go early. We congregated outside the restaurant around 5, and it still was a 15 minute wait (granted there were 8 of us). The papadums were fresh and crispy and tasted like home... The dipping sauces were not too sweet nor sour nor spicy. Yum! 
I have to say, the place doesn't disappoint. Everything from the Chicken Tandoori (which is the most moist I've ever tasted Tandoori to be - even compared to some of the places in Singapore) to the famous Lamb Chops... The only thing that was a bit off the mark was the Chana Masala... But otherwise, everything I mean everything was good. Also - CHEAP. We stuffed with naan, rice and lots of curry and grilled meats all for a measly £12 a person. Unbelievable. 
Will I go back? YES! I mean, I gotta come here as many times as I've been to Lahore Kebab House just to atone for my sins (or abstinence really). Definitely good. Definitely worth the wait.",1
4,Good value for money. Speed service. We had our food within 5 minutes after ordering. It gets very busy so it's advisable to make a reservation. You do sit a little close to your neighbors. But the food is good.,1
4,"Tips.
Come in old clothes. They will smell of the lamb chops for days.
Go at irregular times. The queues are too long at lunch and dinner.
Order the lamb chops and the urid dal. Garlic madness. And the naan.
Take Cobra with you.
Forget Brick lane.
Don't expect comfort or charming service. 
Do expect tons of tasty food and a tiny bill.
That's alllllll you need to know.
Enjoy",1
4,"I'd heard of Tayyabs from some friends in the States. This place gets packed and has a very no-frills attitude toward seating and service. Don't expect too many niceties from the staff, but they make up for it with their great food. The lamb chops are not to be missed, and I had naan both times with vegetarian curries.",1
3,Veg is better then anywhere I have had including India. Lamb chops are decent. Chicken tikka is a miss.,-1
3,"YESSS! 
Tayyabs!!!
wait, did you MAKE A RESERVATION?!
good for groups. 
BYOBooze.
no fuss satisfying indian food.
dinner out w the gang, sorted!",-1
5,"Visiting London, getting the Indian craving, everyone said to go to Tayyab's.  And, for once, everyone was not wrong.
Goodly number of people in for lunch, tables fairly crowded, but everyone in joyous feasting mode.  Pretty spicy, pretty authentic, pretty noisy -- a really nice experience in every sense of the senses!",1
5,"Best Indian in London. Hands Down. There will always be a line and it will always be worth waiting.  It's BYOB and prices are ridiculously cheap.  Go with a big group or on a date - it's perfect for all! Don't be lured into Brick Lane Indian, wander a bit further, Tayyabs is the best!",1
5,"Best N. Indian/Pakistani food in London - Hands down. Carnivores delight, but plenty of delicious veggie options too. Food is better than the posh London Indian places (Chutney Mary, Amaya, Veeraswamy's, Benares).",1
3,"Well, perhaps this place was built up too much for me. I was told I absolutely HAD to go. But when I did, I stood, waiting, in line, for NINETY MINUTES. It was mad! 
Once I was seated, I was so hungry that I could have eaten the hind leg of a horse and not tasted it. So keeping that in mind, I have to tell you: the food wasn't that impressive. Certainly not worthy of a ninety minute wait. The basement eating area was kind of garish with mid-1980s decor, and while the service was good and speedy and the prices extremely reasonable, I don't think I'll be going back because the wait is just too much of a hassle.",-1
5,"East Bay Yelper representin' in London! In true foodie fashion, I didn't give a crap about tourist spots or monuments when I went to Europe for my first time. I wanted to eat! NOMNOMNOM.
I went here during Spring Break to experience the awesomeness that is New Tayyabs. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.
Check out the photos I added. Self-explanatory food-gasm.
New Tayyabs has set a standard for me in Indian cuisine. ANYTHING HERE IS GOOD. YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG.
Lamb. Anything lamb related. GET IT! They have sizzling lamb chop plates that are to-die-for. Since I wanted to try everything, we just told the waiter to give us a little of everything. Yessssssss.
Everything here is made to a precision in the flavor department. It's not too spicy, earthy, peppery, etc. It's justttt right! The mango lassi had the most amazing ratio of yogurt and mango. Too good for words.
We had okra, chicken, and lamb curry. Out of the three, I'd actually rank the okra one the best tasting because of the complex mish-mash of flavors. The lamb was lamb-tastic. Pure lamb flavor within the curry sauce. The chicken curry was probably the least impressive, but beats out any other chicken curry I've eaten by far.
Like I said, I have a new appreciation/standard for Indian cuisine because of this place. The only thing that sucks is that Indian food at home is going suck...",1
2,"Disappointing dining experience at this Indian restaurant which was recommended by a Londoner. The food is OK but not so great, the service is very poor and the place is too busy and too big. It seems like you are in an ""eating factory"" and it's not really aloe for money. I had to ask 4 times for the check. There are many better Indian restaurants in London.",-1
5,"Tayyabs is located near the Whitechapel Bell foundry. So Americans might want to consider a trip to Whitechapel to combine the two places. Yes, the area looks very dodgy but it's still safer than many US cities. Just use your commonsense and caution. The strange looking people live at the Sally Army Booth House hence their presence.    
For those not in the know, the foundry was where the US Liberty bell (currently in a museum in Philadelphia, US) was cast. But let skip to what Tayyabs is all about. It serves fantastic and fresh Pakistani food! 
However everyone knows how good it is. So I went a weekday to avoid the crowds and it was still very busy. So be warned first. However back to the food. Certain days have their specialities. I enjoyed two sticks of spicy minced lamb with a large side salad followed on by mondays special of slow cooked Nihari lamb. Two rotis mopped up the juices. It came to just 10 squid ahead!    
While in the area take a look at the entrance to the Mosque on the whitechapel road. Its a beautiful example of Islamic architecture in a road that is otherwise very drab and dreary. Have the American forgiven us yet for the shoddy workmanship on their Liberty bell?",1
5,"They only allow reservations 24 hours before going, the queue take an age before getting sat, the staff are rude and irritable but my god the food is good. A small dinner turned into a party and instead of two of us 5 ended up spending the night drinking there all the way to closing time. 
My American friend was blown away by the food and eventually sleeping on shoulder.  Always go for the lamb chops and a shed load of other stuff. The Lassi is great but not the way mama made it for me so it wasn't up my street but as everyone says Tayyabbs is an East London institution. :)
This really is as good as it gets in terms of food, destroys many of the restaurants that cost three times as much. Theres a reason they have two floors and have queues going outside midweek!
Remember its BYO so get wine or beer and drink away!",1
5,Excellent and highly authentic Indian food. Very reasonably priced. Bring your own booze exclusively - lots of places nearby you can pick up something. Highly recommend.,1
5,"The food here was amazing. Having heard about this place from my brother, we made a long trek out to whitechapel and were not disappointed.
The kebabs, meats and daals were fantasting... a taste of home that you would never expect to find anywhere but home. And the price, you can't beat the price. Amazingly good value for money in London. There were 5 of us and we are our fill AND it still only cost of around 60 pounds.
It can be very busy so be warned. Service isn't bad just very hectic so be prepared and don't be shy to order or grab the attention of the waiter. On a side note, they don't have license to sell alcohol, which works in their favour. Food is cheaper and people simply bring their own booze from the off license.
We will definitely be returning.",1
3,"Oh Tayyabs, what has happened to you, eh? Another restaurant that has been hyped so much that it's gone to their heads. They don't have to give you great service. They can and will make you wait or seat you by the door. They really don't have produce great food. Because night after night, this place will be full and turning customers away.
Your experience here will depend on the following;
1. What time you arrive. Get here earlier to avoid queues and get something resembling decent service
2. Where you're sat. If it's anywhere near the door then you'll be absorbed into the scrum of people trying to get in. If it's in one of the back rooms then you'll be out the way in relative peace.
3. How much you drink (directly related to 1. above). The queue itself is a destination. People will be drinking their BYO alcohol whilst waiting to get a table. The longer you wait, the more you drink before your food. After 5 beers in the queue the food is going to taste just like a Sainsbury microwave curry, isn't it?
4. How stressed the staff are. This also related to No 1 above. Get here early, or late, and you'll find your staff are happy to serve you. Between 7.30 and 10.30 they're robots screaming into walkie-talkies and throwing a plate of naan breads at you.
I used to love Tayyabs. I've had a few great nights here. My most recent was a let down.",-1
4,"Can't believe how popular this place is. 
My S'porean friend who happened to be in London the same time i was, managed to pick the same restaurant on the same day at the same time as me! Thousands of restaurants in London and she & her friends were there the same time me & my friends were!
They're known for their lamb chops, which was good, but a little overdone for my taste. I prefer mine medium-rare and these were more like medium-well
However, the tandoori chicken ROCKED. And i seroiusly mean that.  Very juicy, flavorful, slightly spicy and just amazing. I could have eaten that dish forever. I'm always cautious with tandoori dishes coz they're more often than not...overcooked. Not these ones!
I had the Shrimp curry dish which was a tad too salty. 
My friend had the Bindhi (lamb) Okra curry and that was very flavorful  
We ordered 2 Tandoori Pratha...my fave. Naans are too thick and bready for me. Prathas are definitely the way to go!
Mango lassi was good too. 
Reservations HIGHLY recommended. We came on a Monday night and there was a line out the door AND inside the restaurant (it was like club nite there)
It's a tad more exp than other Indian/Pakistani places, but i thought it was OK. 
Also....for tourists/visitors/ Londoners who don't venture in ethnic neighborhoods....well, this place is in Whitechapel...it's a tad sketchy..which freaked out my friend who now lives in London but was from Hawaii. 
But really...if you've ever ventured into the Tenderloin in SF for amazing, cheap food...then this is just another Friday night for ya.  
Definitely recommend (recommendation came from Londoner friend/ Yelper Jeremy H)",1
5,My fav joint when I lived in London. Not too far from Canary Wharf and it's always busy! Enjoyed the garlic naan and chicken karahi the most. chicken tikka and popadoms as starters are great. Love the chicken biryani and always ordered a mango lassi to go along with my spicy meals. It's hands down East London's best Pakistani restaurant,1
5,"Astounding food and as authentic as it gets. Recommended by my Pakistani friends. Curies are multi layered and full of flavor. To get: Tarka Dahl, Paratha, and Naan. All of the specials are also fantastic. This restaurant blew me away with the quality of food.",1
3,"Went again recently. This place never dissapoints on the electric atmosphere, always buzzing esp the Sunday night i went.
The chicken curry was appalling, im sorry but it tasted like it was straight outta tin-can! 
However they did not dissapoint on the lamb curry and esp the lamp chops! delicious and huge should be called Dinosaur chops!!",-1
4,"The advice I got from a friend was: go with a big group, wear clothes you can throw in the washer and order the lamb chops, lots of them. And bring beers for your wait and dinner. 
I got her text a bit too late and we didn't get the lamb but everything we ordered was awesome, all the grilled items fantastic. Full review on my blog.",1
4,"I've been here a few times and really enjoy the place.   The food is very good and really priced well.  The staff is reasonably friendly and efficient.  The food came out very quickly both times I visited.
Two things to note if you're headed there for the first time;
-it's going to be really busy, so be prepared to wait.  I recommend making reservations (if there are 4 or more of you) or going VERY early.  The queue is a little crazy.  Also note that making reservations doesn't mean you will avoid the wait entirely during peak times, it'll just speed things up a bit.
-no license, so come prepared if you want a drink.  there's a convenient tesco on the walk from the tube station.",1
1,"Disgusting! They recycle leftover food here! Also they don't devein their shrimps. Ugh, after a meal there, I felt sooo sick! 
Also, the tables are sooo close to one another it's like you are having a meal with strangers. Ghetto service.",-1
4,"Tayyab has the longest queues I've seen since arriving back in london. I agree with another reviewer that this place looks more like a nightclub when you first arrive with blue neon lighting outside and crowds of people waiting around.   I wasn't really expecting to see this after a 10 minute walk though the backstreets of whitechapel.
We squeezed inside and were invited to join the end of a long queue, however we were seated after 10 minutes when a small table for 2 opened up.   I realized the place is BYOB after sitting down and immediately noticed groups of people in the queue drinking wine/beers/cider straight from the bottle.  This is definitely not your standard Indian restaurant and seems like a large party was about to break out at any moment.   If you after a quiet night i would avoid this place... that is unless you don't mind lots of lots of noise, waiter squeezing past the queue carrying various plates of food over your head and people knocking your jacket from the back of your chair multiple times.  
The wife got the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala, however, i blindly asked the waiter to recommend something that was very spicy like a Vindaloo.  This turned out to be a huge mistake and i quickly had food envy whilst seeing the waiter deliver plates of sizzling lamb chops to satisfied looking customers all around the restaurant.  This appears to be their specialty!  Damn i should spent more time reading the yelp reviews beforehand.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was very good whilst my Vindaloo inspired dish was just OK but this is not what they specialise in.
We were surprised, upon receiving our bill, however,  when the total came to just over £20 for the 2 of us including mains, rice, naan and sparkling water.  Combined with the bottle of wine from Tesco, this was the cheapest dinner i can remember having in London.
On another note, the service was a little sketchy and it was obvious this place was focused in turning around tables, more than providing a fanatic dining experience.  It was hard to communicate with our waiter to get recommendations on what to order, we asked for 1 bottle of sparkling water and he seemed annoyed when we asked to send the 2nd bottle back, my main arrived and we had to remind him after 10 minutes that he forgot to deliver my wife's dish (appeared he forgot to tell kitchen), at this point i sent back my spicy dish as there was no spice.  Finally when the check came our waiter told us we had to pay cash, then after we didn't have enough to cover the bill, he said that we only need to pay the tip in cash.  however, in the confusion he put a £5 tip on the card terminal and when we asked him how much our bill was he seemed to get our bill confused with another table.  So we left another cash tip in the confusion.... Anyhow, at these prices you have to left allot of this drama slide.",1
3,"So another first for me on this move to London! Tayyabs was quite an experience. I've learned to leave my preconceived notions back at home, so I went with no expectations other than be prepared to wait. 
This place is a family owned restaurant since 1972 and its reputation follows. Whether it is a good or bad reputation, it has it a reputation because of all the years in business.
As a first timer I thought the food was decent, but not great! The king prawn shrimp and masala fish were both overcooked, but the spices were good. 
We also had the Kema naan which was excellent. And the chick peas dish was also very good!
The Mango Lasi was also delish and very helpful to ward off the spice. 
As I said before, if you go with the understanding of the following list, you'll enjoy the experience. 
-there's a long wait
-the restaurant is a production line so get ready to get in and out once you've sat  down
-bring your own alcoholic drinks and openers so you don't have hunt down the servers
-servers are not too attentive because they're running around taking orders",-1
4,Pretty delish Indian dish. They are pretty busy so be patient with the service. I noticed two separate occasions where they had to be reminded of that extra order of nan or soda pop. Seating can get crowded. It seems like they like to pack in the customers even though there are available seats.,1
4,"So, this is a long-overdue review. Really good place to eat w/ a group. Its BYOB and has tasty traditional Indian food.  I came to London last summer for only 48 hours for a party and Tayyabs was one of the places we ate before the night of the big to-do.  Very much looking forward to returning.",1
5,"This is my favourite curry house in London, traditional Pakistani fayre cooked to perfection! The grills are the thing to go for, spicy, succulent and sizzling  lamb chops, tandori chicken, mutton tikka and massala fish are a must.... accompany  with flat bread and vegetable curry. Bliss.  The service is brisk but friendly, and gets extremely busy so be prepared to queue.  Tayyabs is a BYO so you can take your favourite bottle of wine or rum! what more could you ask for. We take all our friends and family here and once you have tried it I'm sure you will too.",1
2,"I ate in this restaurant this past Saturday night after it being hyped to death by friends of the lady I was taking out.  Everyone raves about this place like it's the greatest restaurant in the World...I must be missing something?  We arrived 30 minutes before the time of our booking, seeing a huge mass of people standing outside just right of the restaurant door I said to my date ""lets have a couple of drinks in this bar before we head in"".  It wasn't a bar...it was a que of people for the restaurant.  We walked inside and busy is not the word...if a fire marshall witnessed this the restaurant would have been closed down for the night.  Walking inside I felt I had gone back in time to 14/4/89 to the Hillsborough football stadium.  We were pinned up against a wall for an hour...30 minutes past our booking time. 
When we did finally get seated it was at a table in the walk way, so for the duration of the meal I had to lean forward slightly as there was a crowed of people standing in line behind me, having to make way for the serving staff.
Service was fast and to the point, I have no complaint with this.  Food came quickly, but was piping hot and fresh.  Again, no complaint here.  Taste was good, but no better than any other Indian I've been to, it simply was nothing special.  Price is on par with any other Indian restaurant, about £35 for 2 people.
I thought it strange all night that everyone in the que was drinking cans of beer.  It was only when I sat down I noticed there is no drinks license so it is bring your own alcohol.  I do not want to bring my own alcohol anywhere.  A night out for me is relax, order a few at the bar, not stop off at an off license before the venue.  On reflection now, EVERYONE in the restaurant was drunk.
IMO the restaurant gets this busy and has this much hype because a. it is cheap and b. you can bring your own alcohol.  So it's just being used by people on a night out as a feeding and drinking ground.  Definitely not suitable as a quiet, romantic evening.
Nothing special, far too chaotic, would not visit again.  DOES NOT DESERVE THE 5 STAR RATINGS IT IS GETTING.",-1
5,"Walk straight past Brick Lane, do not be tempted by the mediocre and overestimated offerings there, and head straight to Tayyab for hands down the best Pakistani food in London.
Make a reservation because some nights the line stretches down the street but even if you have to queue the wait is worth every second. You can either think of the restaurant as crowded and noisy or convivial and full of life as I did but, whatever, the food is worth it.
We had a busy table jammed with so many dishes it was hard to work out exactly what I ate but nothing disappointed and I do vividly remember some outstanding spiced lamb chops that I woke up thinking about the next morning.
The prices won't break the bank, especially  as it is BYOB, you will have a delicious meal and a lot of fun.",1
2,"I think I must be missing something here. Tayyabs seems to be about the most hyped curry place but, as far as I can see, it deserves nothing of the sort.
Firstly we had to wait for half an hour to  be seated. You are made to wait in the restaurant in a long line. This would be fine if there was actually any space but you have to put up with waiters constantly barging into you as they try to serve those already seated. I'm not averse to waiting but it better be for something special. When it was finally our turn we were shown to seats that hadn't been properly reset.
Poppadoms and chutneys came straight away after we sat. These were a trio of a spicy chutney, a yoghurt dip and mango chutney. The poppadoms were good but the chutneys were questionable. The mango chutney was very watery, and lacked a bit of flavour. The yoghurt dip had a very slight taste of gone off yoghurt, a little bit sourer than is pleasant.
The menu at Tayyabs is small. Generally this is a good thing in my opinion. I would much rather a place does a few great dishes rather than loads of average ones. Unfortunately they couldn't even manage that. The caramelised onion in at least one of the dishes we ordered would probably be more aptly described as carbonised. The mutton curry was tough - it just plainly hadn't been cooking long enough.
Worse than the errors in the food were the wait staff. They would walk past and seemingly shout at us ""Service good?"" without making eye contact or waiting for a response. They were also desperate for us to hurry up and finish eating, having to be sent away 3 times as they tried to clear our plates before we had finished. I understand that they're busy and need to turn the tables over but we weren't being particularly slow and had in fact arrived after our neighbours.
I really don't get what Tayyabs offers above any other curry place. I can't really think of any redeeming feature, other than the price of about £15 a head.",-1
5,"The food is absolutely delicious. Well, some dishes, like the lamb chop, tandoori chicken, keema naan or mango lassi are out of the world. Others are okay. They are always very crowded, and queues can be over an hour, so I recommend doing an online booking. We did just a few hours before our dinner and was still able to cut the long lines.",1
4,"Delicious! Meat grilled to perfection, currys are tasteful and well seasoned. Very good value, speedy service. Will definitely go back.",1
5,"I had one of the saddest moments of my life here, but followed by a very happy moment when I returned only a week after...
The first time I came here, I did so in response to my handy dandy Frommer's Free and Dirt Cheap London guidebook (which I try to read in secrecy as not to draw attention to the fact that I am new to the city). Unfortunately, I had just gotten sick and my nose was so stuffed up that I could only breathe threw my mouth. I know smell has a lot to do with taste, but I have never experienced a complete lack of taste due to a stuffy nose until that day. Needless to say, as a foodie, this may have been the most depressing day of my life. I sat there, watching my friend gobbling up the lamb chops and curry, as I slowly chewed on what I could only know and feel to be meat - but could not even taste AT ALL. I think I almost cried. 
BUT *light shines* I had the pleasure of returning just a week later when my nose was all cleared of mucus...when I practically devoured my food! Making up for lost times, gnawing off any spec of meat on the bone. If you enjoy lamb, I would say the lamb chops are a must. It comes out on a sizzling hot iron plate and makes your eyes bulge as they follow the plate to another table...you think, ""Whatever that is, i'm gettin' it."" The curries are also yum and the 3 sauces on the table are DELISH.
Anyways, Thanks Tayyabs for showing me just how truly important the taste of food is!",1
5,"If you want seriously tasty meat, cheap and tonnes of it then this is the place for you.
Forget the mains and max out the starters: lamb chops, kebab, Tandoor chicken mmm all fantastic and so cheap.
As mentioned in other reviews be prepared to wait 45 mins - 1.5 hours after 8pm pretty much any night, especially bad on weekends.  My friends and I just get a beer for the queue and wait it out, totally worth it!
My favourite Indian/Pakistani place in London, it's just OTT flavour but all the best for it.",1
1,"I had Tayyabs the other day with some colleagues from work. I've had my fair share of Pakistani food in Brooklyn, New York -- which is pretty good. With all the reviews I heard I was expecting to be impressed. 
The food wasn't that great, way too overrated. Tandoori lacked much flavor and the lamb I had was just ok - nothing special. 
The biggest contribution to the low score was the service. The waitstaff are rude. They put popadoms on our table, along with a salad. Little did they tell us they charged us for the popadoms. When we told them that we didn't order it, they said they asked us if we wanted popadoms, and they put it on our table. Here's the thing: the never asked us if we wanted popadoms. Even if we said yes, we would have assumed it was complimentary, as bread usually is at most restaurants. Instead they got rude with us, got into a fight with us over 3 pounds and left us with a bad taste in our mouth about the restaurant. We ultimately paid, but I would not recommend this place to anyone, ever.",-1
4,"It is amazing food, just mouth watering and amazing. The naans are great with karahi chicken and some pulao rice.
Chana chicken (chickpeas and chicken) are amazing... Only problem is it's always busy and crowded. Tables are too closely placed... And you can't really sit and enjoy your meal as they just want you to finish so the next customer from the queue could be seated... And that's bad.",1
4,"Great environment, big place--definitely recommended! My friends and I were a group of 15 for dinner one evening, and the staff were friendly and got our entire order correct and delivered quickly. The paneer tikka was amazing, as was the fact that Tayyabs is BYOB! Excellent prices as well.
My only complaint--while the spices and flavours of the lamb chops were amazing, 3 of the 4 chops that I received were incredibly fatty, to the point where I got only 2-3 good-sized, non-chewy/fatty bites off of each piece. But again, I guess the fact that you're paying such low prices means that the quality has to take a hit somewhere!",1
4,Very good food...  Service ok...   We dined with kids but did not think to ask to make food mild...   Had to reorder some dishes twice,1
4,"Overhyped. Lines through the restaurant, loud and busy.
......BUT. BYOB makes time go faster and it's SO DELICIOUS and SO CHEAP. 
Décor: It's dark and it's busy. That line through the restaurant is quite annoying- both for it's length and for it's presence.
Service: They're fast, I admit it and they got everything right!
Food: Okay, where do I begin???
- The free pompadams were good too. Spicy with a kick and it was great fun putting on all the dips! Especially the Mango Chutney: We asked for 3 refills. Yes, THREE. It was so good on literally everything!!!
- Peshwari Naan- big, fluffy. Don't underestimate how full this makes you. I wanted to try this one as it was different from what I usually get. It was sweet and stuff, but with all the curries and stuff that we had, I actually prefer plain or garlic naan just to match it up.
- Chicken Curry- Man, I really wish I remembered which one I ordered. But I can guarantee you it doesn't matter which one you order. It will be good.
- Lamb chops- we got this to share and in my opinion, they're a bit smaller than I expected. It's still good, but maybe it's the American in me that I want/expect everything to be bigger?
- Mango Lassi- GET IT WHEN YOU GO. BEST LASSI I HAVE EVER EVER HAD!!! Oh, my mouth is drooling as I think about it. Creamy, not too thick and PERFECT with your meal. Get a jug and share--for the four of us, we didn't think it would be enough but it was a perfect amount especially since we were so full from our actual food anyway.
Bottom Line: The wait is obnoxious and it is overhyped. But man, I cannot deny how CHEAP and how DELICIOUS and FUN this place was. BYOB is a brilliant idea and it just about makes up for it. Though make reservations when you can!!!!!",1
3,"Good food! I can see why this place is highly rated in the London curry guides. Although it probably didn't quite live up to the hype. Maybe that's my fault for having very high expectations.
The service was pretty poor - rushed and rude. They clearly wanted our table asap and it showed.
In terms of value for money, I'd say it's decent but not amazing. The main reason it seems cheap is because it's BYOB. The food itself is actually a bit pricey in some cases.",-1
4,"Very crowded, ended up waiting an hour and a half on a Friday night! Very busy place but the staff are very courteous and service is prompt. Food comes quickly too, although not sure if that is a good or a bad thing!
 In terms of dishes, there are limited choices, and no beef or pork, so its between chicken, prawns, lamb, and veggies.
 I can recommend the lamb chop, which turned out to be like spare ribs instead, but still very tasty! The curries are oily as most indian/pakistani places are, but the meat is very tender and its all very tasty.
 Oh and btw, the restaurant is BYO for free, so you can save alot on drinks by bringing your own! Also they don't serve alcohol, something to note if you like having a drink with your meal.

5,"I cannot rave about New Tayyabs enough.  
I have been there 4 times now, and never once I have I been disappointed.  
The place is crazy packed (you must reserve a table 24 hours in advance) all the time, for a very good reason.
The last time I went. Our group was 8 people, and we ordered: 4 Lamb Chop and 4 Kebab appetizers for the table, 2 pitchers of Mango Lassi, 6 Large entrees from Karahi Gosht (lamb - one of the best things on the menu!) to Dry Lamb to Chicken Tikka Masala, 3 plates of Pilau rice, and lots of Nan for a grand total of £145.  Go ahead and do that math.
Things you must eat there:
-Lamb Chops
-Dry Lamb
-Karahi Gosht or Karahi Dhal Gosht (Curried Lamb)
-Allo Gosht - (a mixed curried meat and potatoes thing)
-Karahi Bindi (Curried Pumpkin - don't laugh, its amazing)
-Mango Lassi
-Nan
The last thing to note is that Tayyabs is BYOB, so if you want to drink (which you should, beer is great with curried food), bring it with you.  There are several grocery stores and off-licenses conveniently located nearby.
As Lizzie said, New Tayyabs might be chaos, but it is delicious - and inexpensive! - chaos.",1
4,"Admittedly, a large part of the reason that I made a stop in London while on my European vacay was for some good Indian food. Sure, seeing Lizzie G and Miriam W would be highlights, but in my eye it was all about the Indian eats. 
The line at New Tayyabs wraps around the already cramped restaurant, ramping up the temperature indoors. Seriously, it was hot as Hades in here. And that's spoken by an Atlantan who's used to heat. It's hot. Wear as little clothing as possible during the summer, especially if you want to try their spicier dishes.
It didn't help that they were overwhelmed by the crowd and therefore slow on the water refills: it was seriously disgustingly hot in there, to the point I couldn't appreciate my food to the level I knew I should.
While the chicken tikka masala looked unlike any other version of the dish I had ever had, it was definitely delicious, as were the other foods I took advantage of that night. I didn't have anything that steered me the wrong way, and I left New Tayyabs fully aware of what London had to offer, and wanting more.",1
4,"Excellent place. The food is delicious, interesting and somehow weird. However, the recipes are from a completely different culture and the dishes tend to contain a lot of meat and steamed vegetables. Which is great, as I am always open to new experiences.",1
4,"I've been here several times now, and the best thing to get is still the lamb chop. Other grill dishes are hit n miss - sometimes they can be about dry. The other dishes, including veggie sides, are overall quite good, but don't amaze. Lines are always long everyday, including Monday, and you could be looking at a 30+ minute wait even at 9 pm if you have more than two people. Overall, recommended, but I'm sure you can get equally great food elsewhere without the queue!",1
3,I don't eat the lamb barbeque but the dish smelled excellent when I was there in December 2013.,-1
5,"So I met this lovely couple from Seattle the night before at Barrafina.  We were seated next to each other and ended up striking up a conversation (and shared a few shots and bites of our tapas).  They recommended I pay a visit to Tayyab's.  And well...all I can say is...THANK YOU! and GOD BLESS YOU!
Wow! I just had one of the most satisfying meals of my life here.  I tried the lamb chops, dry meat (which despite the awful name is not dry at all), succulent shish kebabs, and a pumpkin side dish.  Everything was truly outstanding!  Soooo delicious!
Yes, there will be a wait.  Yes, its chaotic and frustrating.  But none of that will matter once you take your first bite.  It will all be worth it and then some.
I highly recommend this religious House of Grilled Meat Goodness and will definitely be back!",1
5,"I give this place an A+ for phenomenal North Indian/Pakistani food. I've not had better anywhere else and wish NYC had something like this. Highlights include the perfectly done Naan, the Mango Lassi, the lamb chops and the Chicken Tikka Masala. To boot, it is cheap. And really nothing is cheap in London. Just be prepared for the long waits.  But well worth it.  I try to come here every time I am in London.",1
5,Go early or go for lunch. The pumpkin tinda masala is going to be dreamt about until my next visit to London..,1
4,"Amazing, culinary experience just a little bit of the beaten truck of brick.lane. Great meet cuts from grill  (OMG - lamb chops - what a blast) and amazing thick sauces :-) very regional so ask waiter for advice and BYOB (no extra charge)",1
4,"DID I HEAR BRING YOUR OWN BOOZE?
So a friend and I buy a bottle of wine at tesco and bring it to tayabbs. I'm a big huge fan of curry and so i was super excited to try it here. I'm from the states so to me London = Indian curry. OH yeah BABY!
We ordered lamb chops (mmm deliciious)
Mango Lassi (very creamy maybe a bit too creamy? but yummy)
Naan ( greasy??) But ok
curry- (no sauce but sauteed potatoes?) but nonetheless good good good.
Best part was that we drank the whole bottle and was happy with the price of all this food, super cheap which came out to about 15 bucks each (in dollars) in Cali, indian curry can go up to 20 pounds. This was def a plus for me.
Will be back soon but earlier, the line was wayyyy toooo lonnnng.",1
4,"as everyone else says...this place is very very good. the bad reviews i've read must've just been unlucky. it doesn't have a massive selection but what it does, it does well, the lamp chops, pakora, shwarma, okra.
the standard veges were a bit of a let down and if you are a big 'curry' person i'd head elsewhere. the tandoori is excellent however. 
BYO alcohol is a win. the queues a little less so, but the turnover is high and the atmosphere buzzing. 
a good indian away from brick lane etc.",1
5,"Tayyab is an Pakistani/Indian restaurant in East London near the Whitechapel tube station. Having previously lived in London, I always make a special point to come back to Tayyab when I am in town. Tayyab is by far the best Pakistani/Indian food I have had and comes with a very only-locals-know-about-this-place vibe. Tayyab is BYOB (there are numerous Off-License stores along the walk from the Whitechapel station) and unless you call and make reservations the day before or early the day of, you will likely have to cue for a table (reservations are highly recommended). Poppadums with the three classic mango, mint, and chutney sauces begin the meal. The chicken tikka for an appetizer is wonderful and served on the hot plate with peppers and onions. The main dishes are all great (thought not diet friendly given the amount of oil used to prepare them), though I would recommend anything with lamb in it. Make sure to get a homemade naan to accompany the sauces of the main dishes. While I typically do not get dessert, there is a counter on the way out that has the classic desserts of the region.
The prices are one of the key sellers of this place. Appetizers like chicken tikka are around £3.50, mains are around £7-12, and sides like rice and naan around £2.50-3. Even at my most hungry times, an appetizer, main, and one order of naan are overfilling. A full meal can easily be under £15 each. Just remember to pick up wine and beer on the way to the restaurant. 
The atmosphere has changed considerably from when I first came to Tayyab years ago. In the past, small rooms to the left and right of the entrance on the ground floor were the only spaces available for dinner. Now, a full upstairs is also available. The decor has also become significantly nicer. Unfortunately, this means a large number of diners are eating simultaneously, meaning that service is slower and sometimes inaccurate. While the staff always try to correct the errors, it is challenging to gain their attention most of the time (we had to get up a few times to grab a bottle opener or waiter for more water). The atmosphere of years ago had better service, but the quality of the food still outweighs the poorer service to keep me coming back.
The dining atmosphere is quite packed and it can become difficult to hear your companions if not sitting close to one another (this is a side-effect of the upstairs expansion as well). If you are looking for a quiet or romantic location, this is probably not the place to meet. However, if you are looking for an informal, reasonable, and authentic Pakistani/Indian restaurant, Tayyab is a perfect choice.",1
5,"Tayyabs was the best Indian food we had in London hands down. The lamb chops are the absolute best and the king prawn curry is out of this world! We ordered:
King Prawn Curry: The most upscale and sophisticated curry I've ever eaten. The king prawn made the dish so delicate yet so tasty!
Lamb chops: A must try!
Chicken tikka: Perfect blend of spices for a rich complex flavor.
Oh yeah don't forget to BYOB!!! Definitely worth the visit. Don't fret the long lines, it goes by really quick!",1
4,"This was amazing food and reasonably priced for a nice meal.  We were a group of five and were seated immediately.  Our food was great, especially the dry meat and the pumpkin curry.  I still salivate thinking about those dishes...  Only reason it wasn't a five star experience was the waitstaff.  We had to ask for water and silverware and the water was never refilled (which is rough when you're eating curry), and they left the door open even though there was a strong breeze blowing in.  Wouldn't have been a problem if we hadn't been sitting in front of the door but as it was it was definitely a distraction to an otherwise exceptional meal.",1
2,"The food here is excellent. I got the lamb chop masala, which was perfectly cooked, and the veggie samosa was arguably the best I have ever had.
However,I came alone in the evening when it was quite crowded, and was made to feel very uncomfortable by the staff. One waiter in particularly purposely blocked my path as he directed me to my table, and when i tried to go around him he would block the other side, until i just squeezed past and he very blatantly grazed my chest with both hands. I am disgusted and never thought I would be sexually harrassed by a restaurant staff member when there were so many people around.",-1
4,"This is a great place for a quick bite to enjoy. Food is very tasty and can be tailored to match your needs (not so spicy to spicy). Mix grill is a favourite along with any main curry dishes. Will need to book for Friday and Saturdays as it is really busy, but you can walk in(there will be a que).",1
5,"I still dream about this place, honestly. Perfectly charred, tender, spicy meat, fluffy house made naan, amazing lassi, BYOB policy...it might honestly be one of my favorite places to eat in the entire world. Yes, you read that correctly. Worth the hype, worth the wait, quite possibly worth a flight back to London.",1
4,"Tayyab's always satisfies... tucked behind the east london mosque& near royal london hospital, you'll find perfectly grilled food, nice sized portions, & good prices. 
My current favourite dish is the lentils & baby aubergine, my husband's is the sag meat (beef).
 Nice mix of clientele, from local Asians, to OAPs and tourists...everyone seems welcome. 
If you are going for dinner I reccommend booking in advance, as the queues can be quite long.",1
5,Absolutely fabulous! We had one night in London and were so glad to find this gem (thanks to yelp!). Lamb chop is a must as is a mango lassi.,1
3,"This place is WAY too loud to enjoy a meal. We found ourselves surrounded by groups of 6+ all competing for conversation and the volume was incredible. We ordered the lamb chops (very tasty, not much meat), saag paneer and chicken tikka masala. It was all a bit greasy and spicy for our taste. This was the only Pakistani/Indian restaurant that we tried in London. I would recommend trying somewhere else if you want any attempt at having a conversation.",-1
4,"Finally made it in tonight after trying with no success a few weeks ago.  Lines can be crazy so make a reservation.  Was it worth the wait? YES!  Standouts are the Lamb Chops, and the Karahi Gosht (Lamb).  The Karahi Gosht (Lamb) was incredible and made me smile as soon as I took my first bite.  Tandoori Chicken appetizer was also moist and really well seasoned.  Garlic naan was normal, Samosas a let down. Tayyab is BYOB so stop at the Tesco a block east of the restaurant for whatever you like.  Service - eh, not up to the caliber of the food but polite.  Enjoy!  I'll be back for sure.  This is the best I've had in London so far.",1
3,"I've been here a few times and the food has unfortunately been a bit inconsistent. When it's good, it's amazing. The stand outs have been the lamb chops, dry meat and sweet naan. They have turned out a bit dry and over cooked on occasion hence only a 3 star rating. Overall, it's good food at a reasonable price but inconsistent.",-1
4,"This is how Indian food is done. I went with a local who knew the menu inside and out, so I am not too sure of what he ordered, but we ate every last piece of rice. I know we had chicken kabob, lamb, naan, chick pea something (by far my favorite dish), and lots of sauces to dip our bread in. Absolutely worth going out of your way to visit.",1
4,"Lines are long and food is great, it's all been said before really!
The staff aren't super friendly, but then they are rushed off their feet! The food more than makes up for it though.",1
5,"HOW have i only just cottoned onto London's worst kept secret? 
We were taken by friends after getting sloshed on the sparkly stuff at Town Hall Hotel, stopping off at a local newsagent for a bottle of Jacob's Creek's finest (hmmmm). 
I have never seen a restaurant so busy at midnight?! The queue was mahoosive, but thankfully our chums were regulars so we only had a ten minute wait before we were led downstairs. 
I don't think I have ever eaten so much. It's super super cheap, so we basically ordered everything and ate ourselves into a food coma! I can honestly say it was the best Indian I have had in London. 
Brilliant atmosphere, seriously good food and open late: simply brilliant!",1
4,"I used to eat here a lot, and I would say it's probably one of the best asian restaurants in London. I don't say Indian because it's actually Pakistani, serving fantastic Punjabi food.
 The mango lassi is to die for. It is truly divine and I will be sorely disappointed if it is not available when I get to heaven. The restaurant is Halal meaning they do not serve alcohol, but why would you want alcohol when they have mango lassi?
 Service leaves a lot to be desired, as does the immense waiting time to get a seat (there is regularly a queue stretching outside the building). The food is worth the wait if you've never been there before and the prices are excellent, but it's not the sort of place you can go to if you're hungry and want to eat something quickly. Lately the quality has dropped a bit too, and I find myself going to Mirch Masala around the corner far more often, which is why I rate Tayyab's at 4 stars rather than 5.",1
5,"Tayyabs is famous amongst East London locals and is ALWAYS full to the brim on weekends - get there early or book ahead of schedule to avoid lengthy queues. If you are looking for a quiet, romantic place then Tayyabs probably isn't for you - expect a chaotic bustling atmosphere, a great place for a boozy meal with friends!
The lamb dishes are amazing here and if your feeling for something different why not try the pumpkin curry which always comes highly recommended by all.",1
4,"This is a really great place - for the venturesome, which we are. It is thronged and they are a no nonsense restaurant that moves 'em through quickly, politely, and efficiently. As noted, it is BYOB. We had a really wonderful daily special, a tandoori chicken starter, garlic nan, and a desert. It was all super. Note that portions are generous and the food is on the spicy side. The flavors were incredible and well worth the spicy smoke we sometimes inhaled as the food went by. This is well worth a try. You can't help but like it, crowds and all!",1
4,"i came here with a bunch of work colleagues. to be honest, i'm always going to like a place that is byob...getting to drink my favourite wine at no mark up is a winner for me!
that being said, i'm not a fan of curry. growing up, whenever my parents gave in and ordered a take away once in a blue moon, i'd have to fight to have anything but curry, since it was the favourite of all my family members (hello, i am the black sheep of the family!)
i have had to adapt to eating curries over the years, and i have had some pretty good ones in my time, but they are still not my preferred dinner of choice. in that line, i was definitely impressed with tayyabs. the mixed grill we shared for a starter was delicious, and it was cooked very well. loads of food too, so you could eat just this and be fully satisfied.
i ordered the king prawn dish, which was almost £5 more expensive than the comparative meat dishes on the menu, and it was yum. i do love a good prawn! the sauce was very flavourful, and not too spicy at all (although i love a good spice, i think the flavours stood out well on their own without needing this addition to it). the peshwari naan i shared was also mega delicious, and i am a peshwari naan expert considering my mantra when being forced to eat curries is ""when in doubt, peshwaari naan and starter party it...""
this place is huge, so even at its busiest, the turn around should be fairly quick. there is a million wait staff and they are very quick, efficient and to the point, which i loved. dudes, i don't have time for faffing around when ordering either - just give me my food! 
you are in close proximity to other tables, which, for a people watcher like me, is great, but for other people i can appreciate might not be so fun. 
i liked it, i was satisified, but purely based on my own tastes, i wouldn't rush back unless i was out voted...which will definitely probably happen.",1
4,"Holy crap. What an awesome Pakistani restaurant. They know how to grill food, and bring it to you still sizzling, and spice it up, and make it have bright colors and bright flavors. Get the lamb chops. Wow.",1
5,"I'm going to stuff my little greedy face with as much Indian food as I possibly can, and I want to do it here. New Tayyabs for atmosphere and tasty meat gets a stonking 5 stars. Queues out the door, people drooling over your shoulder as they wait for you to finish so it's then their turn to eat, curry in still simmering metal pans hovering over your head, waiters ordering though ""action man"" style radios, New Tayyabs is chaos. But in a fabulous way. 
I love curry, I have a set few dishes that I like, ""westerners curry"" as my Asian friends will call it but here you are pushed to try something new. Tip 1: Ask what's on the menu, find out what is in each dish and order a selection for the table.
This place is BYOB so make sure you bring your own lubrication. You'll also have to wait about 40 minutes for a table even if you have booked it, prepare fr that and you won't be disappointed. Tip 2: Slip a tenner in someone's hand and I'm sure this wait will get shorter, remain polite and patient. The food is totally worth waiting for.
You will leave stinking of curry, this is normal. If you haven't split it down your front it's a sign that you didn't make the most out of the night. Tip 3: Have dessert! Yes I know you are full but you really need to sample the amazingness that is the sweet treats here. I want to swim in the food here, not in a pretty way. In a dirty cover me in food I'm a glutton way. I left here and my head was spinning from the wine and my lips tingling from the spice. I can't wait to go back!",1
5,"I'd never had Punjabi style Indian cuisine.  Tayyabs in London was not just a new treat, but food to die for. Extremely friendly and personable staff who were very eager to please and recommended exactly the right thing. Ahhh... I need to go back to London again one of these days, just to go to Tayyabs.",1
2,"I have to say, I was not impressed.
From the moment I walked in and was nearly knocked over in the chock-a-block reception area by some completely oblivious Australian's messenger bag  as he shoved me into a mass of people in order to get through with his off-license carton of Fosters, I knew there was NO way New Tayyabs could possibly live up to this hype.
And I was right.
Half of our party sat down at our table while the other half was left standing, waiting on the previous diners to eat their dessert.  Strike one.
The service was abrupt and not at all friendly, which, I have to say, I kind of liked, especially when the servers shouted on their walkie-talkies (""I need a naan here at table niner"") and shoved through the masses of queueing patrons with poppadoms and chutneys without so much as an apology.
The menu was very meat-tastic, and although there were vegetarian options, I have it on good authority that they're just not the main event.  Perhaps this is why I'm underwhelmed by New Tayyabs and you can thusly ignore my review and opinion.  You see, I got a pumpkin curry, and it was simply mediocre and contained too much ghee for my liking.  But, also, the naan was a bit deflated and boring.  The pilau rice was nothing special.  Strike two.  (The tandooried fish starter, that I tasted, however, was excellent.)  
But, barring the unimpressive food, the huge queues and the fact that you will dine with an audience of hungry would-be diners hovering over your shoulder (literally), my lasting impression of this place was the way it made me smell.  My entire being wreaked of curry house.  When I woke up today, my coat smelled so much of stale, nauseating curry that it transferred onto my clean cardigan during my morning commute, so I had to face my entire workday wallowing in curry shame, subjecting my colleagues, too, to the stench.
I've taken two showers since yesterday.  
I can still smell the curry.
Oh god, please make it go away...
(Also, no chocolate with the bill?  WTF kind of Indian restaurant is this?)",-1
4,"This is a very successfully traditional family run restaurant opened in the 70's that serves traditional Pakistani food. They have a great selection of food on the menu including Karahi mixed veg which i had and Karhi small prawn which my friend had and both were absolutely delectable. Great value for money also at Â£14 for 2 main courses, rice and nan bread. The waiters are uber friendly. 
My friend brought me here one evening as she used to live around the corner from it, I wouldn't have come here otherwise because it is a little bit away from the main curry land that is Brick Lane.",1
4,"If you ever find yourself wondering Which Indian or Pakistani restaurant to try. Go no further than Tayyabs. 
We were seated in seconds and a given poppadom right away so we could munch while looking over the menu.
Based on some over yelp recommendations, we ordered the lamb chops. (thank you for that). Amazing. 
We started with veg samosa and moved on to chicken tikka masala, kahari chicken keema, lamb kahari and Chana masala ( which might have been the best dish) rice and garlic naan. 
We ended the meal with a kulfi (which I've never had before - think of it as a spice-busting popsicle)
Full bellies. Full smiles.",1
5,"Trying to get a seat in this restaurant becomes a serious bonding session with your fellow man. Near on one hundred (it seems like it) people cram into the already fully sat establishment aching for a seat, just anywhere they can be handed a menu so the delve into arguably London's best Indian food can begin. It doesn't matter whether you have a reservation or not, you are going to have to wait if you come here in the evening, the place is packed to the rafters.
We did have a reservation, and the waiter took us to our table (after waiting) where some of the seats were still taken be a small group finishing their desserts. He duly told is in a loud enough voice for those sitting to hear, that this table was ours once these people got up. Talk about pressure. 10mins later they were gone and we had our table. The calamitous nature of trying to get seated is an experience in itself. The queue never ceased at any point of our two hour stay.
Now we were to the reason that this place is the most popular restaurant in the area, if not London. The food is absolutely sensational. The meat samosa's were stuff of legend. The peshwari nan was impeccable and the lamb chops... OH MY GOD - heavenly! I ate and ate, till I thought my inners would spill'th out. Yet I would not stop. I ate fish, mince, curry, rice, weird brown cake that looked like poo, but tasted like a small moist parcel of love. I drank fluffy mango lassi and water from the never empty jugs.
If Jesus wanted to remake The Last Supper I'd take him to New Tayyabs. Non of that water to wine nonsense, this is BYOB. Tayyabs is affordable, the experience and atmosphere is something to remember and the food is sexy incarnate.  
If you haven't eaten here yet, set a day, put it in your diary and go.",1
5,"When I was waiting in line, I was convinced I'd come home and give this place one star. We were in a rush, they'd thrown us at the end of a very chaotic line, and no one had acknowledged our presence for over half an hour. Then they fed us, and somehow that one star multiplied into five.
The restaurant is located on the street behind Whitechapel. It has a modern, bar-like feel to it that actually exceeded my expectations for the decor. The place is kind of like a madhouse, with the line winding around tables and waiters dashing all over the place, but the food was so good that I didn't even care that the door swung in my face every time someone opened it and waiters kept bumping into me every time they passed behind me.
After the excruciating wait, everything went pretty smoothly. We ordered meat samosas, lamb chops, kahari chicken keema, rice, garlic naan, and mango lassi. All of it was amazing. Sure, it was greasy and the portions weren't that big, but the dishes were reasonably priced, well-spiced, and incredibly filling. The service was quick and, contrary to my expectations, surprisingly polite. I would absolutely come back here again.",1
4,"If you tell anyone in London your going for curry in Whitechapel, they wil ask if your going to Tayyabs, and its earned its reputation. Im vegetarian and would recommend the aubergine daal, saag aloo and peshwari naan. its BYOB, so the meal is always a bargin too. However, because its so good expect to queue outside the door for a table if you havent booked (and sometimes even if you have booked!) and the waiting staff are always pretty stressed so can be abit rude. Still deff worth it though",1
4,"YUMMMMY! I went here for the first time this summer with a group of friends.  The food was amazing and plentiful.  We ordered 4 main dishes and countless apps, so I tried a lot of the food.  I can't wait to go back! 
Side note:  I would have given it 5 starts but our table was almost in the kitchen and it got pretty smoky (not great for my contacts or lungs).",1
5,"It's not for everyone: It's cramped. It's a long wait. It's rushed. The staff could not be described as 'pleasant'.
For some reason, that only made me like it more- it builds adrenaline. Once you get through the hectic atmosphere and actually arrive at your seat, you will be treated to an unbelievable mess of lamb, chicken, fish, naan, lassi, samosas, etc. I tried everything I could get my mitts on, and not one thing disappointed. 
I left feeling pregnant, confused, satisfied, and exhausted. Overall a great experience, but not ideal if you need a relaxed meal.",1
3,"7 years ago this restaurant was one store front next to the biggest crack house in Britain. The menu has not changed one bit nor have alot of the waiters ! 
Here we are in 2008 and 5 well kept green store fronts later and newly renovated  ""luxury flats "" next door  -(former hospice famous for housing ""elephant man"" , ""stalin"" plus numerous prostitutes and crack addicts!!)  
Tayabs has had to expand to meet its customers needs.
A totally mixed client base from Bengali locals, hospital workers ,  Shoreditch  trendys  and city bankers  -you can get some serious lines for dinner.
This is a place for meat eaters  as the grilled meats are great - chicken tikka , grilled fish and lamb ribs are all crackling and spitting straight off the grill . The food is pakistani punjabi and is  fresh and 100% halal. 
Service is really quick and prices reasonable. It is noisy and lively  - tayyabs keeps the crowds moving -",-1
4,"Been twice. It's as good as everyone says. Still remember their dry curries. Great, great food.",1
3,"Have now eaten inside this place on 2 occasions. Once on a Friday lunch time, and then also on a Wed eve. 
I still cannot see what the fuss is about. 
The place was noisy as f%$K! I mean, I could not hear a thing anyone in my party was saying, but I could hear the random next to me screaming to his dining partner opposite. Friday lunch time was quieter, so if you are keen to go but want to hold a conversation, try a week lunch time instead.
The waiters were friendly and accomodating, if not a bit distracted and distant!.The  food was so so, lamb chops were good, but have definitely had as good elsewhere (Delhi grill for example). BYO is always a winner. 
A  few things that let it down...
I don't think it's good practice to place poppadoms, sauces & a salad down on the table without asking if it is wanted, then charge for it at the end of the meal. That's like placing a plate of samosa's on the table without saying anything and charging for it!
ASK if we want to BUY/ORDER poddadoms or give them complementry!
The rice was not good at all. It was gluggy, sticky and wet.The flavours weren't there either.
The Karahi curries were nice, good kick of flavour, however, 3 bits of chicken in a chicken curry just isn't enough. There was more ghee than chicken.
The naan bread was pretty good & fresh.
I know it's an institution, it was probably fab back in the day, however, there are plenty of great places like it now in and around London to give it a run for it's money.",-1
3,"Been here twice and both times there was a queue of people waiting to be seated. We were lucky enough to only have to wait about 20 minutes to get seated. Seating is a bit cramped.
The wait for the food was equally long, however the gosht, tikka, karahi, kebabs, curries and naan are very good (if you want extra spicy they will make it for you).
The good:
good Indian/Pakistani food
efficient service
Alcohol BYOB (Free corkage)
Cheap Prices 
The bad:
The ambience is lacking
Wait is long 
They fill others waiting in line to seated in between tables so you could have your head close to someone's crotch or rear for much of your meal.
Tip -come early and make a reservation.",-1
4,"Make a reservation. Otherwise, your experience at Tayyabs will be tainted. The line to get a table is a bit ridiculous--you queue inside the restaurant while miserably watching plates of food being served to seated customers. But given that my group was seated right away, we had a fantastic time. 
The restaurant does a great job of explicitly describing what to expect out of each item in their menu. With four in our table we ordered a chicken, fish, lamb and a vegetarian dish and were thoroughly impressed with each one. 
For those who plan on going out to an event after dinner here, make sure you allot enough time to shower beforehand because you are going to smell. Don't say I didn't warn you.",1
4,"There was a long line on a Friday night, but we surprisingly got seated relatively fast. Maybe because we were only a party of two?
I like the ambiance here. It's a warm place to gather and enjoy good food with good friends and company. New Tayyabs serves up some of the best Indian food I've had. We had some lamb kebabs and spicy chicken curry both served on hot sizzling plates and bowls, along with buttery, soft naan. Now that I'm reading the reviews again, I should have gone with the lamb chops but once I looked at the menu, I couldn't remember at the time what everyone had been raving about.
Oh man and how could I forget. Their mango lassi is wonderful, sweet but not over-the-top sweet but milky, smooth, amazing AND huge. I could have easily shared one tall glass with a friend. I also didn't know you can bring your own drinks here. Not sure if there's a corkage fee, but it didn't seem like it. The young gals next to me brought a giant bottle of rum. 
Service is great, and the prices are pretty affordable. I went out for Indian food again another night and definitely paid £2-3 more for sub par curry. Should have gone to New Tayyabs instead.",1
3,Decent middle eastern posing as Indian. This is middle eastern food in every sense of the word.,-1
4,"We really enjoyed our trip to Tayyabs, an interesting introduction at the door as Xmas office parties were lugging in crates of wine and beer as per the BYOB policy.
We were a little late due to a small tube issue , but they still got us seated in ten minutes ,then followed  a frenetic meal just outside the kitchen area ,its worth going here just to see how they cope with the volume of traffic both internally and take-away. 
All the food was great ,the seekh kebab, excellent garlic naan , we had the lamb karahi , chicken keema and some rice , we didn't get the lamb chops which seem to figure on just about three out of four plates ,but we can try that next time. 
All in all a great choice for quality Indian.",1
5,"Visited here in Summer 2009. There was a bit of a wait for dinner but it was certainly worth it. Very authentic food, nice ambiance/lighting, neither spacious nor cramped and I like the idea that you can bring your own alcohol if you so choose. Looking forward to eating here again next time I visit London.",1
4,"Very good, moderately-priced Indian food in a bright, clean, nice atmosphere. Seemed to be quite popular with the Londoners, as it was very busy the day we went. With that being said, there was no wait, and the service was fast and efficient.
The mango lassi was perfect, not too sweet and the flavor was spot on.
The Karahi Chicken Keema was delicious...chocked full of flavor. The baby pumpkin was also good, though it was loaded up with cilantro, and since I'm not a huge cilantro fan, I only ate some of it; my husband, on the other hand, had no problem finishing the dish for me.
If you are in London and looking for great Indian food, I would recommend Tayyabs. It is a little out of the way, but worth the trip.",1
4,"I chanced upon Tayyabs with some friends on a recommendation from a barman in Brick Lane and what a find it was. I find that Indian food is either good or not good, there's no in between. This definitely falls in the 'good' category. The starters were delicious, sheesh kebabs for £0.95 each! Lovely lamb samosas, and chicken tikka pieces that were moist and succulent. For the mains we had chicken biryani (pretty good, not amazing), and chicken curry (lovely). The naan breads were perfectly cooked. They didn't serve alcohol so we popped over to a local Tesco for some canned beer (ergh!). The service wasn't fantastic, but I wasn't expecting much. The place was packed, and everyone seemed to be enjoying it all. I'd definitely go back. I paid £16 for a very substantial meal - amazing value!",1
3,"For all the hype, I was pretty underwhelmed by Tayyabs. I was pining to try the lamb chops after hearing so many good things about them, but mine were only okay -- they seemed a bit burnt to me. The curries were good, but not excellent -- I would have liked a good deal more spice. The best part of the meal to me was sadly the pistachio kulfi I had for dessert, which was like eating frozen heavy cream on a stick.
That said, for the food alone, I would give Tayyabs a solid four star rating, especially at such reasonable prices. The service, however, was appallingly bad. So bad that it affected the quality of the meal itself.
The first shortfall came in that we had to ask to see a menu about 20 minutes after being seated. Secondly, my brother had to ask for a banana lassi at least three times (after the waiter reassured him that it was on the way) before one finally showed up about an hour later. After we got our bill, two more banana lassis showed up as a result of the ineptitude of the waiter.
If you're in the area, Tayyabs is a great place to get some dinner. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. As an aside, they don't serve alcohol, so if you want a drink with your meal, you'll have to bring it yourself.",-1
3,"I enjoy the food here but I have to say I always feel rushed by the waiters.
This place is busy and can have a queue waiting outside to be seated so they want to get people in and out as quickly as possible.
This does cause stress for me whilst I am eating as I feel I have to rush which I don't like to do with food.
I have been here many times as the food is good and even opted to take away on one occasion so I wouldn't experience the stress of having to rush.
The waiting staff aren't friendly the service I find it rushed and cold, I understand they want to accommodate as many people as possible. It is a business too which I appreciate I would have given more stars if the whole experience was good.",-1
4,"Great food.  It's more Pakistani than Indian. But still really good kadai lamb, great flavor in the daal and the dry meats. Service was OK which is why the 4 stars.",1
5,"This place is hands down the best kebab place that I've been to in London AND NYC.  Any night of the week expect to wait for 30-45 minutes before getting seated and don't be surprised if some people walk in after you and get seated before, there is a little bias towards the regular patrons.   If you can wait come back another day, their food is definitely worth a try.  
Always start off with the mix plate of kebabs which includes Chicken & Lamb.  They have an assortment of entree dishes varying from Lamb/Chicken to traditional Indian/Pakistani vegetarian dishes. A glass of Mango lassi is a great way to end the night.
The staff here are very pleasant and the service is excellent.",1
5,"An excellent restaurant, i really liked everything there food and service. Give it a try, you won't regret it.",1
4,"Probably not saying anything that hasn't been said a hundred times already but..
- great food, especially the lamb chops, seriously tasty
- gets super super busy so book ahead, and don't expect a nice quite meal later in the week, last time I went on a thursday and we had people queuing all around our table. It's much more relaxed early in the week.
- BYOB, great.
- Also check out Lahore Kebab House, same standard of food without being so rammed.",1
4,"If you want to avoid the queuing and hassle, make sure you arrive before 7.30, don't go in a large gorup, and try and aim for a weeknight. If you can live with these limitations then you will not have to wait hours for a table and the entire experience will be that much better.
 I love the food here, I don't bother ordering curries, instead I just get grilled meat, naan and rice. The naan is amaaazing! It's really buttery and tasty and I happily stuff my face with it. Obviously, the lamb chops are amazing. I don't know why I like them so much, because there's barely any meat on them and they vary from being painfully spicy to being virtually mild, but I love them! They're truely addictive, though I haven't gone as far as some who only ever order the lamb. I also like the tandoori chicken, which is much better than the dry flavourless stuff you get in most places, and the tandoori fish is also amazing.
 If going for a lassi, get the mango or sweet. I accidently was given the sour one last time, and it is disgusting. They put in whole seeds (coriander? I don't know) and it's just rank. Stick with sweet, or bring your own.
 Btw, don't come here on a first date. Wait until you've been together long another to be comfortable shouting across a table and gnawing on bones. Also, if you're with a companion who only ever orders korma at Indian restaurants, maybe avoid here and head for somewhere on Brick Lane instead. Apart from that, go for it!",1
4,"Worth the jaunt from Victoria for excellent Indian food! We had the lamb & potato (aloo), tandoori chicken, seekh kebab (sp?), and garlic naan. All was excellent but the star was the ""meat aloo"". Reminiscent of my mom's cooking - is there a high compliment for this type of food?? - with super tender lamb and deep rich flavors in the ""sauce"". (Sorry, it's not really sauce but I don't know that there is an English language equiv of the thick sauce/broth in Indo-Pak meat dishes.) The room was a mix of ethnicities, all digging into food and chatting away.",1
4,"This place is getting 4 stars - not just for the food  but for the sheer value for money. It's only not getting 5 because one of our party was refused a glass of water whilst waiting in the queue - it was very hot in there and we had been standing for over 40 mins at this point. NOT impressed....
Anyway - we waited for over ONE HOUR for a table. A whole hour of being squished in a queue with waiters shimmying past, hands full of sizzling hot platters. A whole hour of standing there as the spice filled air made my eyes smart slightly and fatigue was starting to set in.
When we finally got seated (in the less manic and less cramped downstairs section of the restaurant) we ordered quickly as we were sooo hungry. 
3 of us polished of
round of poppadums
pakora
chicken tikka
LAMB CHOPS - omg the LAMB CHOPS. I have to say it twice. I am not even a huge lamb fan and they were AWESOME
Khari Keema
Another lamb dish (can't remember what it was called but think it might just have been called meat curry or something!)
Chicken saag
3x mango desert things (frozen lassies on a stick)
2 rounds of rice
1 naan
The bill ...... under £50 including tip!!!
We bought our own wine and the corkage was free!! 
Fantastic value and definitely worth the wait!!",1
4,"Came here last night after some London Yelp xmas party action.
Even on a Tuesday at 10pm, it was packed. There was a line but it went quickly and since it's BYOB (with no corkage fee), we cracked open some beers while we waited on a table. 
We ordered the Tandoori chicken-ok, mixed veggie dish-good, lamb kabobs-great, another Lamb special-excellent, and the garlic naan was incredible. Order more than you think you'll want - it's thin and crispy but soft and chewy at the same time...don't ask, just order lots 'cause it's delicious.
Prices are extremely reasonable (most dishes are 5-7 GBP) and easy to share. Service was good - our order came out in about 5 minutes, no joke - I recommend if you want some time to chill and enjoy those tasty Indian chips appetizer they bring out, you  might want to wait a second or two before the feast arrives.
Nice atmosphere - not too fancy but definitely has a nice vibe and sophistication to it...great place to take out of towners or go with friends over the Brick Lane Indian restaurant-food-court-carnival madness.",1
4,"Good Pakistani grill place, but I'm afraid I like Lahor's lamb chops more!",1
4,"Not a bad place at all.  We went with the Karahi chicken tikka masala. Karahi chicken. Garlic naan and a mango lassi.  The food was all great.  It is a different take on tikka masala, incorporating quite a bit of cardamom, and some other twists with some vegi's.  Overall I was quite great after a hard day of walking.  The atmosphere was amazing.  very hip very clean.  This place is huge.  There is an upstairs and downstairs all clean and well kept.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",1
2,"So many people rave about Tayyabs and say it's one of the best curry houses in London. REALLY? Maybe going there on a Friday night wasn't the best idea, but the place was over-crowded and the dishes tasted more like fast-food Indian to me......sorry to all the fans of Tayyabs.",-1
5,"I've lost count of how many times I've returned to Tayyabs since discovering it last year. 
You can tell everything is fresh and they have the best selection. 
Make sure you order a huge selection, and reserve! Though I have to admit, I have queued for an hour before just to get in ... definitely worth it.",1
2,"How the mighty have fallen. As the Vietnamese restaurant Song Que has shown, canteen-style, express food service is an art-form. Unfortunately Tayyabs is victim of its own success. Another one of these East London restaurants that's living off the fumes of a former accreditation of excellence but fails to deliver. I would say the average customer was not raised on a diet of Indian cuisine so experiencing curry is an irregular event (being half-Pakistani I had the stuff coming out of my ears from an early age) and perhaps hard to quantify - my own gf exclaimed how a lamb masala ""nearly blew her head off"" so there you have it. I had a chicken karahi which was bland (real curry houses offer chicken thigh as is the tradition in the Punjab), the meat rubbery and unbelievably luke warm. My naan was stone cold and my Nan could make better pilau in her sleep. The place is packed to the rafters making it uncomfortable to relax - at one point I had the jacket of a customer dangling in my curry as he was squeezed along an overflowing line. Ok compared to the crap on brick lane people think this is epic but If Tayyabs was in Southall it would be EMPTY. Time to look for a better local curry or just stick to my excellent take out from Samosa.",-1
4,"The one restaurant I don't tell anyone about because there is always a queue. Everyone always says you need to go to brick lane for a curry - they are so wrong! Brick Lane is for the out of town visitors. Anyone who spends some time around in this area soon starts looking for the real curry places, and yes Tayyabs is a real curry place. GO but don't tell anyone - the queue is already too long.",1
5,"Where to start? Maybe by saying this was the best Indian food I've ever had. I just wish I hadn't eaten anything all day so I could have eaten more, it was just that good. Oh, before I forget its BYOB, so come prepared. 
J and I could smell the Indian food about a block away. We walked in and the place was PACKED and since it was a Monday night at 8:45, we figured that with all these people here that we must have walked into Indian food heaven and we were right. There was a ""queue"" of about 20 people. So we queued up with the rest of the folks, but for some reason after about 5 minutes the guy doing the seating quietly asked us how many we were and when we said 2 he gave us a subtle head nod to follow him to a table.  Sure we were sharing a table for 4 with a couple of Greek guys, but that only helped in getting some tips on what to order and made for some good conversation. They also told us you can make reservations, which I would recommend. 
Ok, so now on to the food. While the samosas were good, I do regret wasting some stomach space on them, because the other stuff we order was absolutely outstanding. You have to get the lamb dishes, especially the lamb chops. We also order Lamb Karahi Ghost and Chana. I only wish we still had room for the Karahi Bindi (Okra). The
If you're ever in London you have to get to this place for Indian food. 
One note of caution, don't wear anything you have recently had dry cleaned because you're going to come out of this place smelling like Indian food head to toe, but its well worth it.",1
5,"This place is the best place in the country for Tandoori Lamb Chops.
The things are some of the best things I've ever had in life.
The decor is very good for a Kebab House and I would say is suitable for all ages.
It is the busiest restaurant I know and sometimes takes 1 hour plus to get a table in the evenings, but don't let that put you off, the food is great and atmosphere also. The atmosphere is also aided that the place does not serve alcohol.. It is however welcomed for you to Bring Your Own Booze which saves you a fortune.. Off-licences are very close by so don't worry if you forget to pick it up on the way",1
1,"Use to love this place, was always 1st choice, however recently has gone down hill.
Chicken tikka with the smokey onions wasnt thoroughly cooked so the waiter took it back to recook it. My friend was preganant so not good.
We ordered a vegetable curry, and it was full of potatoes, usually the vegetable curry has mixed peppers but it didnt have any pepers or vegetables in it.
I havent been back since, was exremely disapointed considering we went off peak time, so expected better.",-1
3,"Tayyabs, I'm dissapointed.  After the number of my fellow yelpers that have given 5 and 4 stars I expected much more of both the food and the service.
With 2 starters, 3 curries and breads shared I feel like I got a decent sampling of the food on offer.  To be fair I enjoyed the Karahi Bindi that Vicky ordered immensely, but the rest... meh
And the service.  Really???  I mean, I know it's not the States, but to roll your eyes at a customer when they ask for a new knife because the one in their setting is dirty?!  Come on now.
I'm hoping this was just a one-off bad experience.  I will return to Tayyabs in the future, here's to hoping the experience is much improved.",-1
5,"I really wanted to like this place, I really did...
erm...
This is the type of establishment I wish I could give 6 stars...
ummm...
Why try... not even an abundance of over used yelpisms can describe the joy that was presented before me tonight. In the form of meat on a bone. 
I'll admit, other than throwing in an impulsive order for naan, I didn't have much to do with the piles of lamb chops, chicken tikka, spinach and potatoes, rice, chunky lamb and chicken curry and mango lassie action that I systematically devoured. But I wasn't complaining. 
I came, I saw, I loved, I yelped. Definitely a spot worth putting on your list of restaurants to try 'round these parts.",1
3,"1 star for the amazing mango lassi.
1 star for the very nice paratha bread.
1 star for the nice chicken tikka masala (the sauce was good).
No stars beyond this, because they don't seem to be able to cook meat.  Spices and flavours were great...but the lamb rack was very dry after my first piece (there were 4), and the chicken in the curry was pretty dry, as well.  Didn't finish my meal.
This did not live up to the hype.",-1
3,"I must say that the last time I came the service was appalling.  It was my b-day and they didn't have my reservation, wouldn't seat us until everyone came, there were no waiters on the second floor only bus boys--we had to hail them like a taxi driver in NY on a rainy day to get our food, and then some food never even came.  Boo",-1
2,"Good tasty but not over spiced Punjabi Indian food at resonable prices especially if you do BYOB. The lamb curry and puri were very good if not the best I have ever tasted. A well known place in Whitechapel and a real alternative to Bangladeshi cuisine style in nearby Brick Lane, with a colourful decor upstaire and downstairs, it is always busy and yet you don't usually need to book though you're likely to be packed in close to your neighbouring tables; quite OK for the sociable.
BUT  I have been there twice and this time the service was particularly abysmal. They hurry you up all the way through, despite the space they have and income they must be raking in, the waiters don't know much about the dishes they serve (well it's just a lamb curry) and you have to help youself to glasses etc when you feel you have bothered them enough already. Worst of all the bill included a service charge but they still asked whether we really wanted the change!",-1
5,"There aren't enough stars in the universe for New Tayyabs. I would have a word with the man upstairs about fixing that, but I think he's still pretty pissed off at me about the orgy of deliciousness I participated in last night.
Whatever...it was worth it - and anyway, I would spend an eternity roasting for some of their roasted meats. The dry meat was surprising and wonderful; the paneer tikka was simply the best I've had.
And the lamb chops. Order lots of them for your table. Like a kid with a lolipop I sucked, chewed and nibbled on that thing until there was nothing left. Then, like a kid without a lolipop, I complained to my friends that I wanted more.
So take your friends out here for fun. Or take me out on a date. All I require is lamb, naan and a £5 jug of delicious mango lhasi.",1
5,"Lamb chops: I will gnaw you like a hungry mutt attacks a stray bone. 
Tinda Masala: You are delicious like baby pumpkins have no right to be. It is dangerous when babies are this tasty.
Dry Meat: You are called dry, yet you are not. You are sort of wet from hours of soaking up flavor. Regardless of your misnomer, you are full of awesome. 
Naan: You are tasty. NAAAAAAAAAN! (That's for Laura N.)
Gulab Jamun: You are a yummy sugar syrup-soaked little munchkin (for those of you raised on Dunkin' Donuts).
Queue: You are renowned, yet you do not exist if one goes hungry at 5pm or 10pm. Go very early or very late, be seated immediately, then scoff at those who wait while you gnaw ravenously on lamb chops.",1
3,"3.5 stars at this point will do.
Breakdown:
Food = 4.5 stars.
Pokora, lamb chops, lamb karahi, naan -- all spectacular, as everyone else says.
-1 is for:
1) they ran out of popodams.. at LUNCH. WTF? You just opened.
2) the inconsistent/ occasionally offensive service, which confused me a bit. 
I had called them ahead of time to let them know I was running late. ""sure, no problem, we will wait for you,"" they said. When I got there, they reminded me that my reservation was 30 minute ago. Yes, I know. I called.
One server carrying food over knocked over a drink and spilled all over my co-worker. He didn't say sorry, he didn't even look at her, he just stepped back while another server came, admonished him not-so-subtley, and cleaned up the mess and replaced the drink.
While the food did make me momentarily forget all the weird shit, it still affects the general experience/high expectations I held for the place. But I would still come back for what it offers, and hope that the service isn't as crap as it was today.",-1
4,"Just eat as many of the lamb chops as you possibly can.
 And be prepared for a queue/bunfight.",1
3,"A few years ago would have given this a five. But victim to its own success this place is so busy the staff never notice you. The food is good but not as good as some of the other places nearby, it used to be amazing. I loved you for so long Tayyabs but I have a new love now and that's Needoo. :)",-1
4,"Tayyabs seems to instigate very strong reactions in people who know of its existence, either really liking it, or disliking it. Their offerings are really simple and clear - a selection of Pakistani and North Indian appetisers mostly served on a sizzling platter, a variety of different curries, standard bread and rice and a small selection of drinks including a very generous sized lassi (I highly recommend the Mango one).
 They don't sell alcohol, instead opting for a Bring Your Own (BYO) licence so if you want wine or beer, you can really have whatever you want.
 Service for food tends to be very prompt, almost on the side of excessive eagerness and pressure to both order and clean up at the end. This is completely understandable when you look at the long queue of people inside, and often outside. One of the diners I was with found it a little on the rude side, although I think it just comes with the territory of the restaurant wanting to please all and is a way for them to keep the prices down.
 This restaurant is easily accessible from both Algate East and Whitechapel tubes, and just a small walk away from Brick Lane. I reckon it offers much better foods than many of the other places on Brick Lane, and made much better without the constant harassing or pressure to come and dine. This place knows what niche it fills, and that it doesn't need any more advertisement.
 Their prices are extremely reasonable and I've found their quality consistent enough to want to recommend to people who don't mind walking just that little bit further away from brick lane.",1
5,"Don't like crowded waiting areas? Then you'll be missing out on the best curry I've ever had. No nonsense, yeah you'll totally wait for at least a half hour even with a reservation, but totally worth it.",1
4,"It would seem that all has been written about Tayyabs, although I have no idea where the name derives from, including best chops and horrendous waiting in a long line.
I have been a couple of times and phoned a day or two before and reserved a table and it worked a treat - no waiting in the line, can't work out how to spell cue, that ain't right, and excellent service with chops for a starter.
Bon appetit",1
5,"I queued for 90 minutes and it was worth every second. 
Every dish was delicious though there were several standouts. The aubergine was seared on the outside, pulpy and soft inside, and balanced with lightly spiced dhal. The karahi prawn drew grunts of delight with its multifaceted symphony of a sauce. 
 
Ambience was festive and warm. The service was attentive and knowledgeable.
Can't wait to go back, long wait and all, because its a treat just to SMELL the food from the queue.",1
5,"Wow !!!!!!!! this was good. It was like your tounge having a booty call. 
Their Nan's were very tasty but a little too lathered with lard. Their tandoori's were very tasty. I would not go for the minced meat ( lamb ) as it was a bit too dry. On the other hand I would try the lady finger or their egg plant. This place is very much like Khan's in Bayswater but a bit nicer inside. I also liked the fact that they had lassi in jugs, which was kind of kewl. So you can drink up a lot after the spicy food. One more kewl thing is, you can bring your own drinks.
To wrap this review, i thought they had friendly staff !!! Good location and great for dinner.",1
2,"Tayyabs... hmmmmm.....
I am in two minds about this place. 
1) The food was amazing. We ordered loads of different dishes (there was about 8 of us) The lamb chops and ribs were out of this world amazing! They arrive sizzling and so spicy you choke! (good thing for me I love spice!) The Tandoori chicken was lovely as well. Nanns were perfect and the King Prawn curry was exceptional! 
2) BUT When I come to a restaurant its because I want to sit down, relax, enjoy my meal, calmly, no rush, no stress....This was a very stressful experience from start to finish. It was a Wednesday night and we had booked but we had to wait an hour for our table... outside. When we finally managed to squeeeeeeeeze our way in as I was sitting down i was PUSHED out of the way by two waiters on their way to a table. Not a good start. Its crammed full of people waiting. When you sit down you feel like the people waiting are your audience. The waiters were just rude, rude, rude. Not in the way like 'we are busy so we will be short and sweet' no just plain rude. The waiter seemed confused and annoyed when I asked for tandoori chicken with a side salad. What rice? no rice please. Salad? What do you mean salad? I had to explain what a salad was even though we had salads on the table with our popadoms. Throughout the meal we were constantly rushed, plates were taken before we were finished I was pushed into the table so many times by waiters I thought this must be a joke? It was hot, cramped and noisy (not in a fun jolly kind of way). 
Maybe its just me but when I go out to eat its for the whole experience not just the food (although the food IS the most important thing for me don't get me wrong). I just like it to be effortless and stress free...",-1
2,If you enjoy it here and think it's worth the queue then you need to reevaluate your existence on earth.,-1
5,"While good curry isn't hard to come by in London, this place exceeds all expectations. The chickpea is incredible, as are the lamb chops. Naans are amazing as well. Absolutely will be returning. Definitely call to make a reservation as it's always rammed here.",1
5,"My husband and I were looking for a late night dining spot. The neighborhood where we were staying had a bunch of Indian (specifically Bangladeshi) restaurants, but when we walked past here, it was the only one still packed at a late hour. We thought we'd give it a try. Didn't know you could bring in your own alcohol, so we just stuck to water, but that would be another plus for me. The food was absolutely amazing. I had the Dhal Gosht Karahi and my husband had Chicken Keema Karahi. Both were served quickly; we each ordered the small portions, but were satisfied with the meal and left full and happy. We typically enjoy spicier foods, and if I could order the same item again, I would have asked for a mute intense heat. But the flavors were fresh and delicious nevertheless. It looks as though we'll be the ones able to recommend a restaurant to our friends who live in London rather than the other way around!",1
4,"Few restaurants so cheap they can boast such popularity that people will queue for over an hour to get a table. Not that you could ever persuade yourself that you're waiting for a table at an exclusive new haunt. The interior and casual dress of the diners ensure this is nothing more than a cheap and cheerful eat.
 The best curry places are rarely glitzy  and certainly not in London where you can find an infinite number of authentic international restaurants. Those who consider their surroundings more important than what's on their plate would do well to aim for a bland Mayfair restaurant. If you've made the journey from Aldgate East or Whitechapel station down this back road (which you would never walk down by accident) then you either know what you're coming for or someone in your party does.
 If you have the foresight to book, and I strongly urge that you do  it's the equivalent of a queue jump, then the wait isn't too unbearable and you get to enjoy watching less organised, impatient, hungry people as they form a queue that crawls round the restaurant.
 The service is not amazing. But that's also not why you would come here. You are served promptly, which is marvellous if you don't wish to wait 45 minutes for your food. And when it comes it's worth it. The menu is limited and it has every right to be. They know what they do well and I would struggle to order anything other than the lamb karahi as I know I will be more than satisfied. That said, I've never had a bad meal here and have yet to find another curry in London more tasty. Given the option of an Indian (and being able to book) I would plump for Tayyabs every time. There are two types of people in this world: those who love Tayabbs and those who don't know about it.
 Just don't forget to bring your own beer (Tiger or Cobra, obviously) as it's unlicensed.",1
5,"Delicious, fun, lively and cheap! Four obvious words to describe Tayyabs. Not only is it BYO (always a favorite perk of mine) but the food is absolutely delicious. I dined here on a Tuesday night with 3 other friends and we ended up just ordering a bunch of food for the table to share. The service was quick (maybe not the friendliest though) and the atmosphere is boppin'. It's obviously a popular place so you have to make a rez at least a day in advance. I suggest it for groups, parties or just a fun date.",1
3,"This may have been a hidden gem once but now it is neither cheap nor nice.
 Yes, the sizzlers with spicy meat as starters ARE excellent. But that is pretty much it.
 The main? Average at best. The naan? Greasy and expensive. Plain rice? Not to be had. The desserts? Overpriced and undifferentiated.
 The place? Noisy, dark (unless you happen to sit at the window).
 Nothing to write home about.",-1
3,an institution but can the help feeling the vegetarian selection is not as great as the meat.,-1
1,"The food here, at least the grills, is good. The currys not great and certainly far better in most other places around London. The grills as good as they are lack the distinct flavour of a tandoor. You can't serve Tandoori Chicken and not cook it in the tandoor. The roti's were the same.
Now all this would still make a restaurant lack well but their service is quite horrible. We had a reservation for 9.30 pm last night and upon arrival our name was checked in to their computer and we were 5-10 minutes. We could see how busy they were so we waited patiently for 15 minutes before I asked him again and they said ""you have cancelled your reservation"". This was rather strange as we had already been told by the same guy yes I have your reservation and we will seat you soon. 
The manager then finds us and says, your table is ready at which point I narrate this incident to him which he just shrugs off!
During the meal one of our grill dishes never showed up. So we pointed this out to them and both the server and the manager proceed to question about how this could be true as the kitchen said they sent it. Are we sure we did not eat it. Now, which self respecting restaurant would question their customer, especially when the dish in question was £2.70!
I for one will not be going back to this place and I would suggest if you want service and great Indian Grills head on over to Sitaaray on Drury Lane.",-1
5,"Crowded and you'll have to wait -- even at 10pm on a Sunday night.
But with good reason.
The food was overall delicious -- including hands down the best peshwari naan I've ever had.
One note on the service; I see various complaints in other reviews here but they were prompt and courteous in my experience, and while eating there I saw another group seated by the window ask if they could get moved somewhere warmer and the staff happily complied (ok, it probably helps that they actually had a free table, which probably isn't the case most of the day, but my point isn't that you should try to bounce around the restaurant, just that the staff was accommodating in my experience).
One strange note, though: the tile floor in the left end of the restaurant was pervasively slippery -- possibly/apparently with oil?",1
4,"The food was as good as ever, except I got to remember their paratha sucks big time.  Everything else was delicious though.  Fazan, Migel and I came before the elite party for a bite, which turned into a veritable feast.  We ate parokas (then i found out they were premade), grilled paneer (yum and spicy), okra (delish), lamb rogan (melting in the mouth) and dried meat (very flavourful!) and came away holding our bellies.
The only problem is that because lunchtime is quite quiet, their crappy service and hate of customers really shined through.  Since I don't notice it when they make you queue and it's heaving, I probably will weirdly only come back in the evening; when customer service apathy will not bother me as much.  
So, Tayyabs, I don't know you don't give a f**k, but you have to loose a star until you are a little kinder to your customers.",1
5,"Don't be deceived by the simple looking exterior of this place, it is most definitely the bestest place to get indian food, if you're looking for something on Brick Lane.  Yes, yes, I know it's not on Brick Lane, but that's kinda the whole point.  Brick Lane is full of 'touristy' restaurants along what used to be a street packed with canteen style diners for the original Indian, and Pakistani migrant workers who first moved to London.
Well, Tayyabs came most highly recommended by a number of 'Desi's"" (meaning Asian) so obviously I had to come and check it out.  So I brought my fellow colleagues from work, and we sat down to an absolute treat.  With an Argentinian, American, and French/Chinese having never really sampled 'real' indian cuisine - (I'm sorry but most typical indian restaurants cater to the bland British palatte), nobody walked away from our table disappointed.
We had the Sag Aloo (Spinach with Potatoes), Sag Gosht (Spinach+beef), Chicken, Karela Dal (Bitter Gourd+lentils), more meat, some chicken, lamb, rice, and plenty of naan.
It was all just yummy and scrumptious.  The dishes were so good, that I will definitely have to bring my family here for dinner one day in the future.  And I know they won't be disappointed.
After teaching my colleagues how to eat with their hands, we then having polished everything off, ordered some desserts.  Oops, forgot to mention, for starters, we had some seekh kebabs and chicken tikkas, done really well, and cooked just right.
For dessert, we tried a bit of everything, splitting it all in four - my the warm Gulab Jamun was just right.. not too hot, not too cold.
I can't echo this place's praises enough, the food was great, the staff were kind and courteous, we went at lunch time so we didn't have to wait to be seated.  They even had the traditional 'Masla"" chai.  Try it - it's a 'MUST'!",1
3,"Once a valued secret, hidden away from the main high street, Tayyabs offered good food and excellent value.
 The price has gone up, and so has visitor numbers ever since Time Out awarded it a high score a few years back. Still good value for money, it is the sheer amount of people here and the noise that has made me stop visiting this restaurant. The dining area has been extended but it is still super packed nearly every night. As polite as the waiting staff are they find it difficult too handle all the tables at once and regularly confuse orders.
 One of the chefs has started a similar but smaller restaurant around the corner on New Road called Needo's Grill. If Tayyabs is too busy, which it probably will be, then try Needo's instead.",-1
2,"MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
After more than 10 years in the UK, we had the opportunity to try many Pakistani/Indian restaurants and Tayyab's is certainly not one of the interesting ones. Although the service is good, Tayyab is, in fact, rather average when it comes to the food, and quite poor when it comes to the dining experience: Expect long queues inside the packed place which makes dining rather stressful, with people banging on you and your chair every minute. Admittedly, there is quite a hype about Tayyab - but we cannot understand why. Is it the ""Time Out effect""? Go see yourself - and find out that it is NOT worth going at all: You will find many Pakistani/Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants nearby, with a much nicer atmosphere and food of the same - or better - quality.",-1
5,Bring your own wine or Beer and opener!,1
4,"Tayyabs - Pics at The London Foodie
I have wanted to go to Tayyabs for a very long time but for one reason or another, I never managed to get a table. On one occasion, a couple of friends and I tried our luck without a reservation - as we arrived there we found, as predicted, a very long queue ahead of us. After waiting for 20 minutes or so we gave up, and headed to the nearby Lahore Kebab House.
Last Thursday, I finally made to Tayyabs thanks to the delightful Jennifer and Louise who miraculously managed to book us a table - never underestimate a woman's power of persuasion I would say! I had first met Jen & Louise at the Bangalore Express tasting a few weeks earlier, and was looking forward to eating and catching up with both again.
We arrived at Tayyabs to find the busiest restaurant I have ever seen - the queue was a tangle of nearly a hundred or so people huddled together, pushing and shoving and looking rather miserable. Despite our booking, we still had to wait a good 40 minutes for our table while others with no booking had to wait even longer.
Our waiter was cheerful and well natured considering the number of diners he had to look after - he patiently took our order and assisted us to open our bottle of wine. Being a Pakistani restaurant, Tayyabs is a BYO restaurant which helps to make it an even more affordable choice.
After a few minutes, two sizzling hot plates, piled high with a selection of the most beautifully char-grilled meats, arrived at our table - the smell was wonderful and we quickly tucked in. The meat was tender and had been perfectly seasoned. It was spicy without being too hot, and combined with the heavenly char-grilled flavours it made for a sensational dish.
The selection of meats included ""chicken tikka"" £2.80, ""lamb chops"" £5.50, and ""sheekh kebab"" @ £0.90 each. Each plate of meat cost £11.90.
To follow the grilled meats, we ordered two curries - ""Karahi Chicken"" £6 and ""Allo Meat"" (Lamb) £6.20. These were also excellent, as the karahi (like small woks), where the curries were cooked and served, had been blackened by the intense heat and were giving out that perfectly char-grilled aroma.
To accompany our mains we also ordered a couple of the vegetable dishes, the ""Lahori Chickar Chana"" (chickpeas) £4.80 and the baby pumpkin or ""Tinda Masala"" £5. These were fried and served in Karahis, they were both deliciously spicy and had good flavours.
We also had ""Pilau Rice"" £2.50, the most scrumptious Peshwari Nan £2.50 and a ""Garlic Nan"" @ £2.
As we brought our own wine, we only shared a large bottle of water £2, and a very creamy and delicious mango lassi which £2 was a real bargain. By the end of the meal, we were all too full to order dessert so we shared a couple of ""Kulfi"" (Pistachio ice cream skewers) @ £2.50 each. The ice cream was sensational and I wish I had ordered a whole one for myself!
My experience at Tayyabs has revived my love for Pakistani cuisine, its kebabs and curries. At £67 for a table of 5 or £13.40 per person, Tayyabs is incredibly good value. Despite the chaotic booking system and ludicrous queues, I cannot wait to return to Tayyabs and try all those dishes again.
Verdict - Sensational grilled meats, wonderful Karahi curries and vegetables at very reasonable prices. I cannot wait to return. Highly recommended.",1
5,"Once upon a time I was tipped off that if you carried on past Brick Lane you got to the real top-notch Pakistani/Punjabi restaurant where the locals lined-up night after night for the best of subcontinent.
Where? Where? was my reaction, and it wasn't that easy to find either. Behind the London Mosque of course! Try not to come right after prayers either doofus.
Nowadays it's always busy.
Awards Awards Awards.
Queues Queues Queues.
Karaahi Karaahi Karaahi. (so good)
Eat until you explode. The menu showcases a handful of the best curries. They're cheap, full of flavour and mostly lamb or chicken. No beef and no beer but you can BYO fourpack or bottle, just don't get rowdy and disrespect religion.
It's well worth the effort of all the legwork, the queuing and the impossible parking in this area. If you do get lost then just hold your nose into the air and drift towards the pungent smells of coriander and cumin like the Bisto kids.",1
4,"New Tayyabs is fantastic.  We had an assortment of grilled meats, including juicy lamb chops and fat, perfectly grilled prawns.  The veggie dishes, with spinach, lentils, chick peas, okra, and eggplant, were all great too.  And the garlic naan was the best naan I've ever had.
Be prepared to wait, but fortunately my wife and I were half an hour late and our friends had already secured a table.",1
4,"This Indian restaurant is on my must-go list every time I visit London!  Make a reservation, pick up some beer from the Tesco, and enjoy the delicious (and very reasonably-priced) food.  The dishes I come back for are the tandoori lamb chops, mixed grill, and the naan!",1
4,"This restaurant is a bit of a show in and of itself. Make a reservation and show up early with the expectation of waiting for a table anyway. Don't let that stop you from enjoying the atmosphere. The food is very tasty and you can bring your own bottle of wine. The price is very reasonable as well, and it's away from Brick Lane so there's no annoying guy out front trying to entice you inside (not that they'd need it).",1
4,Delicious! More of a pakistani with awesome meat and proper spicy sauces! But don't take your best clothes as you'll be smelling like lamb all day...,1
4,"This place is as delicious as all the previous reviews state - and the prices are reasonable, especially for an American dealing with the current exchange rate! The garlic naan was delicious as was my chicken tikka. My boyfriend and I both got dessert  - and spit it out. It looked so good too but not our cup of tea.
Reservations are only taken 24 hours in advance but the large queue moved quicker than I thought possible.
Two words of warning: your clothes will smell. It's been a week and I have to take my jacket to the cleaners. It hasn't gone away. And I would suggest taking a cab - getting off the tube and walking was a little scary in this neighborhood. People were literally fighting in the streets. Maybe its because I was in an unfamiliar city - but I work in Harlem and this neighborhood gave me the creeps.",1
4,"priceless advice:
Go through brick lane and don't stop. You will be tempted by dozens of curry houses, none of which taste as good as they smell.  Men will be standing outside, trying to lure you in. Don't do it. Hold out.
You'll get to a little street called Fieldgate, walk down to 83. You'll walk in and there will be a line. Wait in it. It will be worth it.
Order something. Anything. Everything.  It will be tasty.
And if you're anything like me, make sure to order the coconut naan, aubergines, and garbanzo masala dishes.",1
3,"Probably the most famous fast food restauraunt in the area. In my opinion too busy. Good fast sizzling food, no doubt about it but a little impersonal and you always get the feeling they are in a rush to get you out so they can move on to the next punter.",-1
5,"Found this place in my search for great Indian food (although it's Pakistani). Apparently there's always a line. We waited about 40 minutes for a table. Had the lamb chop and paneer appetizers, then king prawns and chicken for main dishes. The lamb chops and king prawn were standout dishes.
Tayyabs is heavy on the protien, probably not as great a meal for vegetarians.
It's an interesting experience and as a tourist. I recommend it highly. BYOB.",1
4,"Holy crap this place is AWESOME. 
My friend / local tour guide insisted we eat here as one of the must-try foodie adventures in London. I was not disappointed. With rumors of endless lines during the dinner time rush, we opted to do a lunch instead. Either way, just go. 
Sitting down at about 1:30pm, the place was full with people and still more coming in. Guess Londoner's take the late lunch mentality seriously. We got seated rather promptly though (thanks to my friend ingenious reservation making skills) and began to drool at the menu. Service is, well, a bit off. I can only rationalize it to ""your restaurant is so popular that your servers could act like a-holes but we'll still sit there no matter what""... and we did. 
We ordered the: lamb chop starter, mutton tikka, chicken kahari, allo gosht, and some naan. Did I mention there were more then 2 of us although I could have inhaled all that food on my own. It was amazingly delicious and hearty. They did the lamb chops well (I am generally not a fan) and the mutton was ridiculous! Top it off with some BYOB action and I was a happy camper. Ended the meal completely satisfied with room for a mango kulfi. 
While it took about 15 min . for us to even get our check or for them to make change (again, service is questionable), I became an instant fan of this place and I thought the prices were REALLY reasonable.",1
5,"In the spirit of Diwali,  I lit this diya...  
The kebab aroma infuses the nose even 2 blocks away... be careful w/ your knitted wear and long hair... it grows on you :) 
The colourful sweets are magnets to the eyes while we wait for a usual good 40 mins ... although it's hardly you'll have the stomach post the feast...you can always take away, having those as midnight snacks like me :) 
The small tables for 2 are very cozy, you can almost do forehead kisses w/ your date ... while the round big table close by the kitchen is good for group celebration. As you sip the jumbo mango lassi, one feels that you can dance w/ the chefs. 
It's not always crowded as you think, i.e. Friday 5pm is not a bad try.",1

After waiting for 20 minutes or so we gave up, and headed to the nearby Lahore Kebab House.
 Last Thursday, I finally made to Tayyabs thanks to the delightful Jennifer and Louise who miraculously managed to book us a table - never underestimate a woman's power of persuasion I would say! I had first met Jen & Louise at the Bangalore Express tasting a few weeks earlier, and was looking forward to eating and catching up with both again.
 We arrived at Tayyabs to find the busiest restaurant I have ever seen  the queue was a tangle of nearly a hundred or so people huddled together, pushing and shoving and looking rather miserable. Despite our booking, we still had to wait a good 40 minutes for our table while others with no booking had to wait even longer.
 Our waiter was cheerful and well natured considering the number of diners he had to look after  he patiently took our order and assisted us to open our bottle of wine. Being a Pakistani restaurant, Tayyabs is a BYO restaurant which helps to make it an even more affordable choice.
After a few minutes, two sizzling hot plates, piled high with a selection of the most beautifully char-grilled meats, arrived at our table  the smell was wonderful and we quickly tucked in. The meat was tender and had been perfectly seasoned. It was spicy without being too hot, and combined with the heavenly char-grilled flavours it made for a sensational dish.
 The selection of meats included chicken tikka £2.80, lamb chops £5.50, and sheekh kebab @ £0.90 each. Each plate of meat cost £11.90.
 To follow the grilled meats, we ordered two curries  Karahi Chicken £6 and Allo Meat (Lamb) £6.20. These were also excellent, as the karahi (like small woks), where the curries were cooked and served, had been blackened by the intense heat and were giving out that perfectly char-grilled aroma.
 To accompany our mains we also ordered a couple of the vegetable dishes, the Lahori Chickar Chana (chickpeas) £4.80 and the baby pumpkin or Tinda Masala £5. These were fried and served in Karahis, they were both deliciously spicy and had good flavours.
 We also had Pilau Rice £2.50, the most scrumptious Peshwari Nan £2.50 and a Garlic Nan @ £2.
 As we brought our own wine, we only shared a large bottle of water £2, and a very creamy and delicious mango lassi which £2 was a real bargain. By the end of the meal, we were all too full to order dessert so we shared a couple of Kulfi (Pistachio ice cream skewers) @ £2.50 each. The ice cream was sensational and I wish I had ordered a whole one for myself!
 My experience at Tayyabs has revived my love for Pakistani cuisine, its kebabs and curries. At £67 for a table of 5 or £13.40 per person, Tayyabs is incredibly good value. Despite the chaotic booking system and ludicrous queues, I cannot wait to return to Tayyabs and try all those dishes again.
 Verdict  Sensational grilled meats, wonderful Karahi curries and vegetables at very reasonable prices. I cannot wait to return. Highly recommended.",1
5,"I was completely blown away. So, so, so good.",1
4,"This place is very popular which can be seen by the queue you will most likely experience if you chose to dine here in the evening especially on the weekends. I would regard the food here as better than the fare you get in Brick Lane.
 The food is not particularly expensive and is pretty good. I wouldn't say the food was excellent but you will have a good meal here nonetheless. A speciality seems to be the lamb chops which everyone will tell you to order. They are arguably their best dish. I would also recommend the Korai.
 Whilst this place gets rave reviews, do not go here with too higher expectations as the food is not that amazing. It's good but has been overhyped in my opinion.
 If you don't like queuing then you wont like this place as even those that book end up having to queue. Very busy",1
4,My friend in London directed me here and I'm glad she did. Get the lamb chops and be happy.,1
5,"The queue is long.
The place is always packed.
The place is crammed.
And the place has an exceptionally strong smell.
However, I have never ever had a bad meal in this place in my life.
Absolutely brilliant.",1
5,"Our supper club was 10 strong on Tuesday night when we arrived at Tayyabs around 7.30pm to find a queue of hungry punters stretching down the road. The lamb chops that I had been looking forward to sampling looked like they might have to wait for another occasion and talk turned to other establishments in the area that could possibly accommodate a large group at short notice. Fortunately we had the diminutive, but pretty scary, Priya in our party who marched to the head of the queue and had a quiet word with the staff in Hindi. Five minutes later we were all seated and cracking open the first of many Cobra beers. The restaurant itself is big, bustling and very vibrant. There are a couple of large rooms upstairs and another one in the basement. A wonderful, pungent aroma of meat and spices hits you as soon as you walk through the front door; great for getting the taste buds salivating but be warned that you will be making a trip to the dry cleaners the next day. After Priya's amazing success in getting us all in at the drop of a hat we decided that we would leave ourselves in her hands and let her order for the whole table. Popadoms and the usual accompaniments were first up; all very tasty but nothing to write home about. Things started to move up a gear with the arrival of plates laden with a section of nan breads which looked divine and tasted even better. To start with we had the mixed grill which is highly recommended. The succulent chicken tikka came sporting a lovely char, the sheekh kababs were full of flavour and the lamb chops took this meal to whole new level. I was beginning to understand why there was such a big queue of hungry punters happy to wait for an hour to get a taste of this delicious cooking. I'm struggling to remember everything that we had for the main courses but stand out dishes were the lamb chop curry, which was the special of the day, and the karhi keema. Despite our best efforts a couple of hours later we still had a mountain of food left which seemed a waste to leave uneaten; not a problem said our friendly waiter and few minutes later her returned with our food and nan bread beautifully package for us to take home. As Tayyabs is a bring your own booze place and charges no corkage fee the bill for this amazing Pakistani Punjabi feast came to an incredibly reasonable £16 a head. A very small price to pay for what was one of my favourite meals this year. I have one final top tip which I picked up from my good friend Mr Sudra; if you give the restaurant a call the day or so before you wish to eat you may find that you are able to book a table in advance.",1
5,"First overseas Yelp review!
Having experienced lackluster British food before on my travels to London back in 2006, I was determined to find good eats the second time around last week. Enter Tayyabs, which I came across back in 2009 when Charles L.'s rave review of this place.
Granted it's a bit out of the way from Central London, but it is WELL worth it. Succulent flavorful lamb chops and tandoori chicken on sizzling platters with onions as well as their tandoori paneer made for excellent starters. Their okra and chickpea items were beyond anything I had ever had in the US, and their Tuesday quail special was particularly exquisite. My favorite though was their tikka masalas, and no, they aren't anything like the creamy, neutral-flavored dish that everyone has come to know in the US. No, their version here is much different, and much much BETTER. I ordered both their chicken and mutton tikka masalas and out came pieces of meat in a piquant chile laden sauce that had the perfect balance of spice and heat. Add hot from the tandoori naan and rice and a pitcher of perfectly sweetened, richly flavored mango lassi you get the best Indian meal I've ever had. Me and the fam managed to stuff our faces here not once but twice on our five day London excursion. Now I'm just sad that Indian food will never be this good stateside. *sigh*",1
5,"I've never been a real big fan of Indian food. But when some friends invited me out for lunch at Tayyabs, something told me to just try it. I'm so happy I did! It was a-mazing! A-MAZE-BALLS!! We're the type of gals that love to eat and eat to our heart's delight we did. We tried so many different dishes but my absolute favorite is the Dry Meat and the Pista Kufti. I taste these in my dreams, that's how great they were. The lamb chops are decadent, savory, spiced morsels that just melt in your mouth. The channa was the stuff of legends and the pappadums and mango chutney, there just didn't seem to ever be enough. The chicken tikka was absolute delish as well. Service is super fast and everyone there is so friendly. Since I've moved, I can't partake in the goodness as often as I want. Whenever I travel back to London I make sure to make a stop at Tayyab's. It's the stuff foodie dreams are made of.",1
5,Awesome. Simply put. We went here twice.... intentionally after we couldn't order enough food that we wanted to try on our first trip. Our Londoner friends now go there regularly. Make any excuse to hit this place up.,1
4,"While I am not a big Indian or Pakistan food lover ( actually usually can't stand Indian food), I did love this place. Maybe what I ate was more Pakistani.  The nan was fabulous and the lamb chops to die for!  Had a chicken dish for my entrée that was very good.  I don't remember what it was called, but if it had curry ( which I do not like), it was very light.  We are returning to London next summer and plan to dine at Tayyabs again.",1
5,"You can't get better food than this in Londontown. Forget Brick Lane, come here! This place will knock your socks off! Not only is it a BYOB (which seems to be rare in London), but it's also very affordable and extremely tasty! You will not be disasppointed! Just make sure you get a reservation or you could be standing in a very long line.",1
5,"Any serious curryphile needs to give Tayyabs a visit as my experience was positively divine. Any concerns regarding the much maligned queuing system disappeared when the waiter told me that he would find me a table in 5 minutes, and proceeded to do so despite the long queue!
 Tayyabs, alongside Lahore Kebab House has long been championed as one of London's finest traditional curry houses but unlike Lahore (
cheap-eat-london.com/200…
) , Tayyabs manages to deliver on all counts.
 Starters consist largely of meats off the grill and I can wholeheartedly recommend the plate of lamb chops (£7 and is big enough for 2), curried koftas and chicken tikka whilst the mains saw the oddly named Dry Meat curry and chickpea dahl as the standout items although we were pleased with the prawns and chicken karahi as well. If you like the slow cooked texture of Beef Rendang then you should definitely go for the Dry Meat, whilst the chickpea dahl melts in the mouth before you can register the loving spoonful....Full review and high quality pictures at

3,"With such a mixture of reviews I though I must give this a try to see for myself. We visited early to avoid the long waits. It was about 17:30 and the place was just about empty, so we had a good table by the window. I have to admit I am a bit of a hygiene freak when it comes to food preparation, here you will find the toilets not far from the food preparation area and a bit smelly. (there may be other toilets, but these were the ones I used). Staff were sampling the food behind the open buffet counter, I dread to think how many times the spoon was used between each bowl.
When our popadoms were served they came on a small plate and were held in place by bare hands. I do hate other peoples fingers in my food. I can see why some reviewers have complained about the poor standard of these popadoms to me they were the prepacked ones you cook under the grill and there were a large quantity just stacked in front of the buffet serving area.
The saving grace were the chops, as all previous reviewers have raved about, yes they are good, but that was as far as it goes. It is a small menu if you leave out the vegetarian section, and the portion size (unless you go for the large) is nothing to write home about.
I think the price for the meal is a psychological thing, yes it seems reasonable, but considering you bring your own drinks with you, if you add the price of a couple of bottles of kingfisher at restaurant prices and have the large meals, the bill is about on par.
Having said all that we were not disapppointed. I like a restaurant where you take your own drinks and there is no cork charge. Take screw tops just in case, and your own wine glasses. We left about 19:20 as queues were srarting to form and we felt a bit guilty.",-1
5,"Tayyabs is a quick-eat, casual Pakistani restaurant and can be found a stones throw from the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel (near Shoreditch, worth venturing to).Prepare to queue unless you go at odd hours eg 5pm or earlier and fill your boots with some of the best and freshest Pakistani food in London at v. reasonable prices. Once in, order hot,buttery,fluffy naans, anything from the sizzling grill (Tandoori chicken and lamb chops are a must for carnivores), daal begum (spicy mini aubergines and daal) and spicy keema are the highlights. The hot sauce with the poppadums should be marketed on its own, its that good. PS BYO alcohol or slurp on mango lassis and they have a takeaway service for your other half. (

4,"the crowds are true and the food IS worth the wait.  i went home smelling of grilled meats.  i had had the veggie samosa, chicken tikka and the saag aloo and garlic naan.  all for a mere £14.  i was stuffed and satisfied.
don't me afraid of the queue.  it goes by pretty quickly and once you sit down and order the food arrive on the spot.  all sizzling.  i'll be back for the ribs.",1
3,"Food is good, but the restaurant was cramped and noisy and the waiters uninterested.",-1
4,"Excellent tandoori items. Lamb chops, some of the best I have had in my life! The curry dishes are good as well but not the best. Service isn't all that great but the food makes up for it! Decor is very nice, just awkward to have the the waiters standing there wearing all black and watching you eat every bite...
This is the one place which I make it a point to eat every time I am in London and always will!!!",1
5,"This place is the nuts for curry! but it does come with a price. Having heard about this place after its write up in 'The Metro' and recommendations from friends I decided to head there with 6 people one Sun evening. It's a little walk from Aldgate East tube and Whitechapel and down a few streets..get a map out!
I'd pre booked after being told to do so by my friend who'd been before and expected to wait a bit but wasn't prepared for the chaos that ensued.
The bad points were as follows
1) Pre booked and still had to wait 30min to be seated after talking to nearly every staff member in there
2)The staff's faces as they all look like they've lost the will to live from the chaos in this place, they couldn't care whether you stay or go so don't think about complaining as there are 100 more people who will willingly take your place in the queue to get a seat- yes you still have to queue to get a seat after you've booked
3)People everywhere, queues over-spilling in the restaurant
4)The look of anger from your friends as they secretly want to kill you for bringing them to this madness and making them wait for 30min till you get a table
5)Being seated like cattle
6) Rushed atmosphere to finish food- maybe this is a good thing?
Now the positives- there are some honest
1)Bring Your Own Booze- nice touch
2)The cattle seating and chaos actually becomes quite atmospheric and adds to the charm of this place
3)Very cheap food
4)The look of satisfaction from said party when they realise this is pretty damn good food
5) Probably the best curry I've ever tasted and being half indian I've tasted a few
Definitely go for the dry meat or lamb chops, they got thumbs up from all of us, I also really liked the saag aloo The food here is perfect and was definitely worth the wait but be prepared for the stress if you go at peak times. Not recommended if you're easily stressed or impatient.
Also if it's late evening be a bit weary as someone was stabbed outside the restaurant as we were waiting to pay our bill
All together a perfect night and will definitely be going back!",1
4,Ate here before the England Holland match and enjoyed it. The food was great but the waiters were as misserable as sin! They don't have a drinks licence so get some beer or wine before hand.,1
4,"Tayyabs is very good. The first time i went there was with a huge group of about 20 people for a birthday party and they were well ready for us as we all arrived. They were very on top of our orders and took care of us all in a reasonable time. The food came out in no time and it was really tasty as well. Not only is it good, but it really wasn't that pricey at all, which is hard to find sometimes. All in all I'm definitely a fan of tayyabs and will be returning in the future for some delicious Indian cuisine :]",1
5,"I don't know why it's taken me so long to get here, but my first visit was excellent.
 The decor is nothing fancy: it's a mad-busy restaurant, loud and with lots of tables spread across three rooms (with one private and bookable, I guess). Make a reservation unless you want to join the queues which can stretch to many dozens of people.
 I didn't try the much-adored lamb chops, instead having some Karahi dhal gosht and focusing on veg dishes: bindi and a pumpkin curry. All were really well-flavoured.
 My wife and I were stuffed full on the above, rice, roti and some paneer - and we had to take some home, we couldn't finish it all - for just £25. It's not the best curry I've ever had but it's certainly value for money.
 It's BYOB.",1

hungryinlondon.com/2011/…
 
 Tayyabs is a real London institution as it is the case for few other cheap ethnic haunts. Not far from Whitechapel Tube Station, this inconspicouus restaurant is tucked away in a little backstreet. That said, Tayyabs would be inconspicuous, if it wasn't for the hordes of people patiently waiting in front for their share of Punjabi Pakistani food.
 Tayyabs was founded more than 30 years ago and has been growing from a local cafe to one of the places you have to visit in London before you die (or before you leave, which some people might argue is the same). It does not have an alcohol license and what adds to its incredible value is there is no corkage charge for bringing a bottle or two.
 Finally it was my time to pay Tayyabs a visit. When you are disorganised enough to go on a Saturday evening like yours truly, be prepared to queue at least 30 minutes. Even though the turnover is high, there are a lot of people queuing too
 As soon as we were seated we got served poppadoms with raw cucumber, onion and tomato and a selection of very tasty chutneys (mango, rajita and a tomato chili one), and this for free! I The menu is small and easily fits on one double-page  there is selection of tandoori dishes, some meat and fish curries and some vegetable dishes. Apparently the lamb chops (6) are a must at Tayyabs. They came sizzling hot (a portion consists of 4 chops) and full of wonderful flavours from the tandoori grill, unfortunately they were borderline to completely overdone. While I was not fully convinced about the reason for Tayyabs cult status after these chops, I was fully taken by the wonderful garlic naan (2) which was light, soft and fluffy with just the right amount of garlic.
 I thought the Karahi Chicken (6.50), tender chicken immersed in a rich tomato based spicy sauce, was merely nice. The Karahi Mixed Vegetables (5.20) however, were among the most delicious curries I have ever tasted. Vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, peppers, aubergine and potatoes were cooked far beyond al dente in a flavourful gravy of Indian spices. Yes it was greasy but I loved even the grease on this rare occasion.

 The atmosphere is reminiscent of a canteen but well, so are the prices, one can't complain really! The value for money ratio at Tayyabs is hard to beat. I didn't have Indian food this tasty for that ridiculously small amount of money anywhere else in London. I don't say it doesn't exist, just that I haven't found it yet. Open for suggestion though!",1
4,This place is known for their lamb chops. It is very delicious served on a sizzling plate. I really enjoy their sweet lassi as well. Most of their dishes are above average but I go there for the lamb chops!,1
5,"Mmm how good are the lamb chops - seriously for meat lovers this is a must!! I would defo recommend being organsied and booking a table in advance as the queues are huge... but this just goes to show how good it is!
Great buzzy atmosphere and friendly staff.",1
1,"For a place as intensely raved as Tayyabs, I was seriously disappointed. My drink (salted lassi) and appetizer (a meat samosa) were delicious, but our entree, karahi gosht, was abysmal: it tasted exactly like a canned beef stew! Even worse, in the following hours I came down with a bad case of food poisoning, a first in all my years of heavily patronising Indian restaurants. I won't be going back.
Plus, the tables were uncomfortably close together; we were essentially sitting with two strangers.",-1
5,Sketchy neighborhood but THE BEST Indian food ever!  Quick service and very clean.  Tandoori chicken and tikka masala was amazing... hands down the best Indian food I've ever had.,1
4,"Mango Lassi: to die for 
Lamb chops: as good as home
The meat samosa: rockin'
The speed at which you are expected to eat: crap
I'm a slow eater and in my mind, I'm paying for the atmosphere and enjoyment of the company I'm keeping as much as the food. I'd order take away if I wasn't. The poor table before us had to withstand 2 waiters breathing down their necks and us, looming over them, desperately waiting to appease our starvation. 
I suspect from the queues that this place is always busy but perhaps next time I'd test out lunch and hope for a more peaceful experience. 
P.S. The food is everything it's cracked up to be.",1
5,"WOWWW!!! I think this is my top London eat so far. Incredible. I'd been told of this place back in the day when I called East London my home (a distant 5 months ago), but, deterred by the tales of queues out the door, I hadn't made the journey. 
Thanks to my good friends persuading (well not much persuading at all) we ended up there last Friday night, 6:30, prime rush hour. Yes, there was an enormous line, but it moved surprisingly fast. I actually enjoyed the wait, as the aromas that fly past you are a fantastic appetizer for what's to come. As it's a dry restaurant, my friend popped out to grab some wine, while I watched sizzling racks of lamb and chicken kebabs criss cross in front of me. I busied myself by reading some of the reviews on the wall (apparently Zagat rated it #10 resto in all of London, scoring only one point less than Gordon Ramsay's). And apparently the usual range of celebs (Britney, heads of state etc.) have stopped in. This restaurant is a highly efficient operation (which I always observe in great detail, having worked the hospitality industry. These guys know how to run this ship). Veggies and dips on the table literally as we sat down, a waiter at our side within 2 mins...my friend's napkin replaced *before it even hit the floor*. Seriously. They are all over you. Very fast, very hustle/bustle but in a good way. Now...the FOOD. OMG. (must stop saying that). But it was OMG. Could they pack any more flavour into these dishes?? My friend (who's Pakistani, I was told to go with a pro) did all the ordering, so I can't me more specific to the dishes other than to say, pretty much anything you order will be absolutely amazing. Fall off the bone chicken, beautiful curries, incredible. I hadn't done Pakistani food and found it to be a mix between Indian (for the spice factor), and Persian (one dish in particular, name fails me). The price factor is also pretty omg (small caps omg, as this is London after all, but relatively speaking, very very affordable) As soon as we finished I wanted to do it all over again. 
Because it's so busy, it's not a place to linger over your byob, so get in, get out and get back in line!!!",1
5,"Worth the wait.... possibly the best Indian food I've ever had. 
I think my clothes still smell so choose your outfit wisely, haha.",1
3,"The food cannot be faulted but my experience with the service staff (a very important aspect for me is the service) brings down the rating to three stars as they have outed themselves as a greedy bunch more than once.
 I have been there several times by myself, usually order the chicken tikka and a dal and it is quite bothersome to put up with the same questions every time - What?? No rice?? No bread???. Um, no. I'm here for some lunch, not a three-day feast.
 Staff also get annoyed when you send back the papadam - i guess because they have just earned 60p less (for those who do not know, they charge you for the papadam they automatically bring to your table).
 One waiter flew into a badly masked rage when, after ordering a mango lassie and not recieving it with the meal, we insisted that it be taken off the bill (he wanted us to have the lassie even though we had finished our meal and were paying). He was furious and let's not forget that a lassie costs 2 quid, you would have thought it was 200!!
 Great food but greedy, greedy, greedy staff. They should be happy that business is doing so well instead of getting in a twist about someone not wanting their 60p papadam.
 And oh, if you order take away it is advisable to check you have everything - I've had take away three times and each time they managed to forget something or give me something i had not ordered.",-1
5,"Tayyabs serves Punjabi/ Pakistani cuisine.  It's more pungent than traditional Indian and the dishes have a little more of a kick.  The grilled food was delicious (must try the lamb chops) and the curries, though a little oily, were decadent.  The best part was the price.  You can eat hear and be stuffed for less easily less than £15 a head.  Four of us went, and with desert (not a must have here) it was less than that.  Its also BYOB!",1
5,"A family run restaurant in Whitechapel, this place was the best Indian food we had tasted yet.",1
1,"My boyfriend and I made the mistake of going here in the middle of Ramadan.  It was just a buffet layout which you served yourself and I think there were two other people eating at the same time.  None of the food was that good and the mango lassi was warm, ick.   I wouldn't go back as it was also very expensive for the quality we received.",-1
5,"The best Indian / Pakistani food I have ever had. Period. Also, tasty sweets.  Bring your own wine (or other alcoholic beverage) if you desire.",1

5,"Everytime I'm in London, this place is a must.  The lamb chops are serious business and I've never had anything like this back in the States.  The King Prawn curry is also not to be missed.  
The queues are long and I suggest getting a reservation if you can.",1
4,Best curry house in London.  The mixed grill starter is also fantastic.  Be sure to go early or for lunch because the line starts to build around 6pm.  Be sure to go with a group and share dishes.,1
5,"whoa.  loved it, deserves their longstanding reputation.  obviously been around awhile and is a well oiled machine.  the lamb chops were excellent.  perfect seasoning and prep.  also got the karahi chicken keema with garlic naan and a mango lassi.  again just the right amount of spicy seasoning and heat, extremely tasty.  lassi right consistency.  location is a little farther down the street compared to where yelp maps it.",1
3,"When I visited London last year, my relatives took me to Tayyabs. Now I know for a fact that outside the Indian Sub-continent and Pakistan the best Indian or Pakistani restaurants are in Dubai.
Lived there 31 years and know it for a fact. Now in London, my relatives took me to Tayyab and I was quite happy with a good Pakistani Punjabi cuisine. 
Many people make a mistake and say it's the same, but they are not. The Pakistani and Indian cook in different manner. 
The day we went into Tayyab was crazy. The queue was so long and waited for an hour to get a table. But it was worth the wait.
As soon as we got seated there were these spicy popadums with different chutneys. Had to lick the last chutney off my finger tips. Being a fan of lamb I tried the ""Gosh Dal"" - lamb cooked with lentils and i loved it. The ""karahi bindi ( okra or ladyfingers) were ok..not spectacular. The nan and rotis ( bread ) were great. 
My overall experience: A good place for Pakistani punjab cuisine. Please and i repeat please have the mango lassi ( mango buttermilk )  like they say in London it's AWESOME....",-1
3,"Pakistani cuisine. Voted number seven in the Zaggat guide's top ten London restaurants this year as well as Indian restaurant of the year so I had high expectations. You can have a nice meal here for £10 which is typical for the Brick Lane area, not typical for central London generally. The service was not good in a conventional way, but they got the job done, and were very fast. It's a place to grab a quick bite, don't expect to hold your table unless you book the private dining room. As Tayyabs is not licensed you can bring your own and on the upside there is no corkage fee. 
To start I recommend the Seekh Kebabs, they come out sizzling on a hot plate with loads of gorgeous onions. For main course I got the Daal Tarka. It was nice but not as good as I'd had on Brick Lane before. Definately get the garlic Naan, its really tasty especially compared to the pilau rice which is only average.",-1
5,"A fantastic restaurant, have always had great food and great service.  It is also BYO which of course make it all very much cheaper to eat here. For two people it's hard to spend much more than £25.  It is best to book is you don't want to wait for a long time before a table is available.  The restaurant is very busy every evening, not sure about lunch as have never been there then.",1
3,"perhaps my expectations were too high? i was expecting the best indian food of my life. instead i had decent indian food and an overcrowded restaurant. sorry london yelpers (and tourist yelpers), but im afraid ive had better or just as good in los angeles. im curious, is the fuss because its trendy and theres a line? it was definitely not worth circumventing closures to hammersmith and district lines (i went in june). oh well. maybe next time im in london i'll find the holy grail of indian food.
ps was there an old tayyabs?",-1
1,"The curry I had at Tayyabs was saturated with oil.  So much oil I had pour it off the top of every dish.  The Dahl was mushy with no texture due to over cooking, it had no heat despite asking if it was both dry and spicy when I ordered.  The Okra was swimming in oil and again mush.  There was nothing good about the meal at all. I talked to the waiter and got a wave of his arm saying look how many Indian families love their food (most of which were bordering on obese, so I guess they love their oil).
 My friends had the lamb chops and the a couple of chicken curries.  The lamb apparently was excellent. The chicken curry again was full of oil and had very little punch to the spices or subtlety to the cooking. They left both curries.  
Do: have the grill
Don't: have anything else on the menu unless you love oil, lovely oil. oh and more oil. a big thick layer of oil. on top of, in and oh, go on more oil would be great thanks.
Nasty, badly cooked curry. Not good.  Brick Lane is notoriously bad for curry and this is no better.
I think I'll stick to homemade Punjabi food, Masala Zone or Vijay's Chawalla on Green Street - all amazingly made with very little oil at all and far superior to the rubbish Tayyabs serves as Indian food.
Yuck.",-1
5,We went here on a recommendation from a friend. Very popular place for Pakistani and Punjabi food at an excellent price especially when the dollar isn't too hot. We were seated immediately. The service was fast and professional. The food was fresh and delicious. Good portions!,1
4,"You cannot flaw this place. The food is delicious and cheap. It's BYOB so you really save on the wine bill.
The staff are friendly, the interior is slightly dark but not so that you can't see your food (pet hate of mine). 
Only issue here is how busy it gets, there's always a queue trailing outside. If you're gonna go, book.",1
4,"I've been back several times now and the food is always great and at really reasonable prices. Away from the over-the-top and unpredictable Brick Lane this is a real gem. The staff are keen to move you on quickly but having started out at the back of a 20 strong queue there before I've been pretty grateful for that side of things in the past.
Most of the dishes are pretty spicy so beware.",1
2,"I have to think that some of these reviews are fake. The food was average (a little greasy but not bad for the price). The place tables are jammed together like a ryanair flight, the decorations are as tacky as an 80's gameshow and most of all the staff are incredibly rude. Not just one but several. I think the BYOB policy has meant they are doing good trade so they don't have to be polite to people anymore. When I asked could they take our order the waiter was rude. As soon as we finished up our food we were asked did we want the bill 4 perhaps 5 times. I know they to get more people in but we hadn't been there very long. Just rude.",-1
4,"This place is great. Pretty much always crowded but the queues move quickly and the food is worth the wait.
 I can highly recommend the seekh kebabs which are less than £1 and have a great kick to them. The samosa's are also good value for money. An excellent range of starters and mains makes it an ideal place for large groups which allows you to try lots of the dishes in one sitting. The chicken keema dish is particularly good with their freshly made naan. Goodness I'm just salivating at the thought of it!
 The mango lassi is huge - definitely couldn't finish it myself, and the bring your own policy is a good way of ensuring you pay less than a tenner.",1
2,"Went back for dinner the other day and it wasn't as good or nice as I remembered it used to be. Food didnt taste any different from other Brick Lane eateries and service was quite rude, rushing us after we finished eating. Good BYOB, but for the same price Id rather have a more relaxing dinner at Maedahs next door.",-1
5,"8. TAYYABS
 Tayyabs is an impressively busy Pakistani grill house that is so popular it is difficult to suggest a time when there won't be a queue. Sheek kebabs and shami kebabs come to table piping hot and are very competitively priced. About £8pp ex-drinks.",1
4,"Randomly located behind the Royal London Hospital, this seemingly average looking restaurant is beset by a glittering array of photographic frames (yes, I do mean David Gray). And these accolades are justly deserved as the food is good, seriously good! I'd recommend the prawn biryani, but honestly you can't go wrong with this eaterie. Certainly not a date place, but excellent for a pally Sunday lunch.",1
4,"I've been coming here since 2001. The service is always courteous and the food is the best North Indian/Pakistani food this side of the Amritsar/Lahore border post!
 The food is faultlessly spiced; some say it's a little hot. Well, real Indian food is. But like all real food, you can see the spices as well as taste them. No mucky generic sauce blankets the dishes here. Everything is served piping hot and riddled with distinct cooked in flavours, whole spices and real taste.
 To start I'd recommend the Sheek Kebab (comes with salad) and a naan - when these arrive, tear the naan, fill with salad, a kebab and yoghurt sauce and tuck in . . . . it's a delicious starter. The Samosas here are also great.
 Keep an eye out for the daily specials on the menu - my favourite is the Tinda Masaala, a gourd not unlike a round courgette cooked with lots of fresh ginger, green chilly and spices. Don't go overboard on the rice and naan thing that so many people seem obsessed with, you won't have room for the real food. Have one, or the other, not both. You won't find a single dud in the dishes served here - the owners (and the clientele) just would not stand for second rate food.
 To drink, I'd recommend the Mango Lassi. It's sweetness soothes the heat of some of the dishes superbly. Booze is not available here, but you can bring your own subject to a modest corkage charge.
 This is real Punjabi food as it is eaten in North India and Pakistan. Eat at Tayyab's and challenge your pre-conceptions. You might realise that the so-called Indian food served in Brick Lane (with one - just one - exception) bears no relationship to real Indian and Pakistani food. Oh - and you always come away from here thinking 'It can't have been that cheap, can it?'.",1
4,"I can join in the consensus that the food at Tayyabs is excellent and it is super cheap (especially when you factor in byo). I especially loved the lamb chops and the prawns. The only hitch is that Tayyabs is a victim of its own success - we waited an hour to get a table.

4,Very fast. Awesome food. Only criticism is that it's so popular felt slightly pressured to finish.,1
4,Delicious lamb chops!,1
4,"Friends make fun of me for the number of times I've been to Tayyab's, suggested it for dinner or artfully woven it into any discussion about anything Asian. Needless to say I LOVE this place.  It's not in my nature not to branch out and try new spots but I always knew I'd know love when I saw it  and Tayyab's is really tasty!  Don't let the line (at times out the door with a 30 min+ wait) turn you off, for this off-the-beaten-path BYOB is a treasure.  My favorites include the mixed grill, paneer tikka, karahi bhindi (okra) and of course, the lentils with aubergine - I've never had anything like it.   However I have had better chicken tikka masala and the sourness of their pumpkin curry is unexpected and doesn't quite jive with my taste buds.  If things get spicy - which they can here - the mango lassi won't let you down.  Unfortunately I've never quite made it to dessert but when I do I'll report back and add to this post.  I don't have to try all the other restaurants on / around Brick Lane to know that this is the best one!",1
5,"Last night, six of us gathered in the smokey, spicy brilliance of the infamous Tayyabs. And the infamy, I've decided, is seriously well earned.
 I'm a real beer and curry girl so I know a good sizzle when I see one and this, my friends is the real deal. This is food you'd kill your granny for. The tandoor starter got us off to a screaming start. And then, mouths atingling, tastebuds ajumping, the mains dazzled us senseless. Everyone should add their dry meat to one of the things you have to do in London before you die or leave.
 I proclaimed mid-meal that it was a gazillion times better than the michelin starred Indian place I'd been to in Mayfair a couple of months ago. When the bill arrived (a mere £80 for six adults - one of them pregnant - all of us eating for two) I loved that it was one gazillionth of the price too. Eat that!",1
4,"Excellent lamb chops and mango lassi and kulfi. The chicken tikka and seekh kebab were very good but not the best I've had. The naan and other rotis we had were quite good but not exemplary. We went early, around 6:15pm so the wait was very short, however by the time we left at 8pm, it would have been around 2 hours. Food for children that we asked specifically to be mild was still too spicy for our children. The bathrooms were clean, the staff were helpful though they were eager to see the table freed up for the next seating.",1
4,"The best Mango Lassi I have had the privilege to taste. None of that tinned nonsense - this is fresh from the motherland (Alphonso for sure - the creme de la creme of the mango world). Problem is, I had this at the beginning of the meal and it was so good that I remember little else from that evening. I'm sure the food was excellent but it was irrelevant - Tayabb had me at Lassi.",1
5,"This is a very sucessfull traditional family run restaurant opened in the 70's that serves traditional Pakistani food. They have a great selection of food on the menu including Karahi mixed veg which i had and Karhi small prawn which my friend had and both were abslolutely delectable. Great value for money also at £14 for 2 main courses, rice and nan bread.",1
4,"Fast, frenetic and fabulous. Tayyabs is one of those best-kept secrets where the secret has long got out.
 I am by no means an expert on this kind of cuisine, so all I can say is that the emphasis is squarely on taste, rather than blasting you with spice, and that the menu is one of those where you feel encouraged to venture beyond your own comfort zone.
 I like this place for the following reasons:
 BYO - it's a rarity these days, and thus feels like a bit of treat. You get these little glasses to drink your grog out of, which make you feel like you're at a speakeasy.
 Credibility - it feels like a local restaurant, rather than a tourist experience (Brick Lane) or a recreation of the 'great days of our colonial empire' (your average high st curry house).
 Atmosphere - it's always buzzing.",1
5,"This is by far and away the best restaurant I have ever been to in London. And although I am prone to exagerrations, this is not one of them!
 Since the restaurant doubled in size and became snazzy, the number of clientele seems to have tripled in tandem. The word of mouth is extraordinary on this place. Book ahead if you can, or expect to queue for a while, but the wait is worth it. Even though the business has changed over the years, it still retains a fun, jostling mood.
 The food, oh the food. Delicious tender chunks of Hallal meat, covered in strong but balanced spices and flavours. I think we have tried every dish on offer and they are all incredible.
 The only down side is that the waiters ship you in and out as quickly as possible, which can be annoying. But who cares with food this good?",1
5,Amazing pakistani food - lamb chops are to die for. The best part is it's a BYO and it doesn't stop here. It's cheap as chips for the quality of food that they serve. Very authentic and super spicy - the way I like it. It's a bit crowded and the waiters can rush you on weekends (evenings) but what else do you expect from a low budget great restaurant. Definitely recommended if you like spicy and authentic Pakistani/Indian food.,1
5,"We had to queue for an hour, despite booking, but we knew this would happen so came prepared with extra beer. We got off lucky though, as people that hadn't booked had to queue to join the queue! I think that is always a good sign when people are prepared to wait for hours for a table (the guys that sat next to us, just as we were leaving had waited for 2.5 hours!).
 Once seated we were asked what we wanted straight away, but hadn't had a chance to look at the menu. When we asked for a minute we were left alone for ages, amd became probably the only people all night that needed to actually flag down a waiter! We ordered our starters and mains, but everything came together. Lamb chops, chicken tikka and pakora were outstanding, as were the nann. The mains were ok, no real heat, but liked the use of tandor-cooked meat with the sauce, leavng the meat very tender.
I wouldn't normally have given 5 stars, because of the service, however considering how hard they were working and the fact that the food was so good, I had to. The fact it was so cheap is also in their favour...",1
3,"Not many reviewers seem to give this place less than 5 stars ... so i guess my review will be different. :)
I would like to know whether there is anybody in London who has been able to get a table here by waiting for less than half an hour ? Whenever you go, you find a long long line that snakes out from the door and for 50 metres beyond. It probably shows how popular the place is, but its such a turn off for a new customer.
Even after you get the coveted seat, the ordeal is not over. The place is cramped, very cramped. You have to almost get up to let the server pass on to the table after you.
But having said all this, one has to admit that the food, the non vegetarian food,  is excellent. The lamb chops are well known. The kebabs are heavenly, the chicken tikka or the fish dishes. The main course is also probably good (sorry, i stuffed myself with the kebabs and so couldn't try much of the main course dishes :p).
The question is, how much trouble are you willing to take for the sake of tayyab's food ? I for one, probably will not go back very often.
Full 5 stars for the food, and -2 stars for the pain.",-1
5,"I haven't been let down by the food at Tayyabs yet. The Tandori paneer (as a starter) is delicious. Tayyabs has great vegetarian options. Definitely recommend making a reservation in advance. The seating downstairs is preferable, as it's not as busy. Hands down much better than any restaurant I've been to on Brick Lane.",1
3,"You will get fed, presented with the bill and 'encouraged' to leave with almost obscene haste, but Tayyab's can get away with it because the food is so fine, in particular the starters. The tikka paneer is out of this world, and the baby aubergine dish is consistently excellent. Don't get me started on the meaty starters my mouth's watering already.
 You can bring your own booze but don't expect to be able to get through more than a bottle of beer.
 One final touch which I like: tap water is provided as standard, and your jug will be topped up regularly.
 If you've tired of Brick Lane's identikit, meat-and-sauce curries, this is the place for you.",-1
5,"Fantastic pakistani food: lamb chops, masala fish, karahi chicken, dry meat (yes! but it's good), dal, there's something for everyone here. Be prepared to queue every day of the week, if you're clever you can book the day before. Fabulous mango lassis.
 Ridiculously cheap - starters £4.50 (that's for 4 lamb chops or 3 pieces of masal fish) and mains on average £6 for small. Trust me, that's all you need! Does it get better? Yes! It's BYO and there's no corkage.
 What are you waiting for? Get down there!",1
5,"An absolutely fantastic restaurant with the most delicious curry in London. 100% authentic Pakistani/North Indian fare, this place far surpasses not only the tourist traps on Brick Lane, but other authentic curry houses in the same area.
 The starters are lovely and smokey and cooked to absolute sizzling perfection. Our samosas weren't too greasy and stuffed absolutely full of delicious, herby meat. The chutneys provided on the table are a great variety and wonderfully made (taste so fresh!). We also got a starter of paneer tikka (I've heard the chicken tikka is die for, but I wasn't in the mood for chicken that night), which SO smokey and deliciousobviously marinated in delicious spices and then freshly grilled, it was the best paneer I've ever had.
 The curries did not disappoint. After reading raving reviews, I ordered the dry meat & my husband got karahi lamb gosht. The dry meat curry is something everyone MUST try - absolutely nothing like your traditional British curry that is greasy and watery. The dry meat is called such because they cook the lamb in lovely juices and sauces so slowly and for so long that the lamb positively absorbs all that wonderfullness, leaving very little sauce behind (but infusing the lamb with SUCH flavour). It was absolutely divine and probably the best curry I've ever eaten.
 Next time, I am going to try some of those lovely sizzling starters I keep seeing described, but I am definitely ordering the dry meat dish again. Tayyabs also serve their trademark creamy sweet/salty lassi, which I hear is quite popular for cooling tongue unused-to spicy curries.
 Meal for 2 with 2 curries, 2 naan, 2 samosas, 1 starter: an UNBELIEVABLE £19! Tayyabs is BYOB for drinks, so this helps keep the prices down a lot.
 Either get there early or be prepared to queue - this place is popular. Also, don't expect to linger over your food - with prices so cheap, they need a huge turnover of customers to make money, so don't be rude and stick around. Eat quickly, enjoy it, then leave so the next dinner can be blessed with some great food,",1
5,"We had a difficult time locating this restaurant, but the line out the door quickly revealed that we were in the right place. And that line moved fast, a testament to the quick yet attentive service at New Tayyabs. Before you head out, be sure to pick up the beverage of your choice (BYOB), or go the non-alcoholic route with a delicious lasse. All the classic dishes are better than you've had them anywhere else, you really can't go wrong with their menu. All of the meat dishes prepared on the bone are particularly great. And save room for desert, it's worth it.",1
3,"New Tayyabs has a big reputation and the queues inside and out are testament to this.  I went there with a team from work and chatting to the girls on the next table I asked them how their lamb chops were and whether they were better than those from the Lahore Kebab House.  They said they were good but hadn't been to the Lahore Kebab House and that's the problem.  This place is like the Lahore Kebab House on an off day in an Ozwald Boateng suit, very sharp decor but not quite as good with a tandoor as the local competion.  
The sheek kebabs were good, the garlic naan was great, the urad dhal was good, the lamb chops were quite good too, but the chicken and lamb tikka were a little on the dry side and the tarka dhal was bland, dry and looked like it had been left out over night.  The karai gosht was also nothing to write home about.  Still, very reasonable prices and a good place to go on a date if your other half likes Indian/Pakistani food.
All in all the food is better at either the Lahore Kebab House or Mirch Massala which are both nearby.  If you must go here you have to book, even on a Monday.  Not a bad place by any measure, but I probably wont come back here.",-1
1,"One of the worst restaurants I have been to. I went there with my wife after much hype and recommendations from friends. Reasons below.
 1, Poppadums were stale (They were soft). One of the waiters was blaming the weather!
 2, Mango Chutney was watered down - It was pouring off the spoon like water - not thick and gloopy. Manager infomed me it wasn't watered down and that they make it themselves. Any one who has worked in an Indian restaurant knows that you don't make Mango Chutney - you buy it in.
 3, We ordered two curries - a sag gosht and a dahl dish. Both had onion skin in it! They both tasted horrible. I have eaten about 200+ of these dishes in my life time and never have I tasted such horrible dishes.
 4, Manager was rude and unapologetic, to a point were an argument ensued
 They took the charge off for one of the curry dishes, not both. I had to ask them to take the poppadum charge off.
 The mixed grill was good but I thought it was not as good as Lahori Kebab House on Umberston Street. I would much rather go there.
 Edited to say: I am a critical person hence I have a lot of reviews here but I do give credit where it's due. Give it a try - I might have been very unlucky but at least the management could have treated me better.",-1
3,"It is good food - but not amazing.  I think a bit overrated, but can be an experience to go and wait it out with the crowds.  Your clothes will smell for the rest of the day though - so beware!",-1
4,"A big downer is how freaking hard this place is to find. Fieldgate street forks, mind you. The neighborhood isn't quite exactly what you'd like to show off to your folks either -- hasn't quite got the character-filled, fun atmosphere brick lane has.
 BUT THE FOOD. OH THE FOOD. whereas brick lane can be hit or miss depending on which curry-pimp you listen to (and this can be very tiring), tayyab's is hands down tasty, inexpensive, and very accessible in terms of the crowd -- lots of types here, no need to be in a suit, nor hipper than you in skinny jeans. indeed i don't recommend the skinny jeans as this is the place to loosen the belt in terms of your tummy. the menu won't explain things to the unfamiliar (know what all the curries are ahead of time) but you may as well just close your eyes and point, you can't go wrong, or if you really want to be careful hope that you get one of their more patient waiters who might help clarify. the place is big and the turnaround fast, so pardon the speedy, cold service that's usually the norm.
 Long and short - under any other restaurant I wouldn't go back, because of how far it is and the service, but Tayyab's is SO delicious and INCREDIBLE value for money (30 pounds for four people, inc. drinks when i last went) that i would definitely just go ahead and plan a day around it. :-)",1
5,"I absolutely LOVE this place. I was lucky enough to live nearby and to be able to have regular curry evenings here with my friends. It's tucked away in Whitechapel & is about 5 minutes walk from Brick Lane, it might as well be on a different planet as far as the quality of food is concerned!
 It's a bring your own bottle (no corkage charge!) place & the food is truly wonderful & remarkably cheap for what you get.
 The place is always full, I've never seen it empty, even at lunchtime. It is a truly very bustly place with waiters running around at top speed. You do feel a little bit rushed but you can't hog the table all night I suppose.
 I've taken lots of my friends here & it has always been an excellent choice.
 It's one of London's best kept secrets & blows away any of the Brick Lane Imposters!",1
5,"Was on holiday last week in London and was so glad that I ended up here for dinner with some friends.  I'm from San Francisco, home of many great ethnic restaurants and this place beats them all.  The lamb dishes are just outstanding.  I'm definitely coming back to this place the next time I'm in London.  Cheers.",1
5,"Fantastic restaurant. The food is incredibly good, the mixed grill is really..really..really amazing. The style is a lot different to your average high st curry, less creamy more dry and herby and a whole lot more tasty.
 It's BYO which is great, but getting a seat can be difficult so go early to queue! Prices for the area and for the quality are exceptional and top off a really great meal.
 Definitely recommend steering yourself clear of brick lane and finding your way here. You won't regret it.",1
4,"Lamb chop, garlic nan, kebab, mango yogurt recommended. Reservation recommends.",1
5,This place gets very busy especially at the weekend! The food here is the best in Brick Lane! Very popular place in Brick Lane,1
4,"The lamb was flavorful and delicious, and the mango lassi was AWESOME! However, the service was a little lacking in that some of our order was forgotten. No worries, though because they were quick to bring out the forgotten Naan. The Naan by the way was fluffy and delightful. Smiles all around leaving. My clothes smelled like the food all day and brought nothing but good memories even though I offended the noses of the other people on the tube.",1
4,"Teyyabs is crowded , hot, hectic, friendly and really tasty. Not your typical curry house it has a small menu of things it does very well - you may not recognise them if you are just used to standard curry fare but the ones I had were great. Their meat is good, both the mutton tikka and the lamb karahi gosht were bursting with flavour and spicy without being over hot. The prawn karahi was incredibly zingy with coriander and again the spiciness was just right. I can't tell you about the rest of the menu (rices and breads were good though) but all I can say was there was a queue on the way in and a big queue on the way out with loads of happy diners iinside. It is not a place to linger as it is noisy and the service is VERY quick if not always slickly co-ordinated. I will be going again, see you there?",1
5,"After being told that my phony British accent was nothing more than an American speaking slowly, my friend and I wandered the streets of Whitechapel, or what my friend and I refered to as I(ndia)-town,  in search of something tasty to satisfy my phony british tongue. I'll admit it, east London is dodgey and scared me silly but I've heard that Indian food is better in London than in India. I doubt that can be true but Tayyabs makes it easier to believe. 
My friend and I wandered the streets and peered into a few establishments, nothing caught our attention. We were tired and hungry, so we decided to stop at the next decent Indian place which happened to be Tayyabs. We showed up at an odd hour and the place was empty. We sat down as if we had the life sucked out of us and ordered some usual items. When the food came out, we both forgot that there were utensils in front of us and did not breathe until we had finished inhaling our food and anything that seemed edible on our plates.. Yes it was THAT good. Good thing no one else was there so there were no one there to witness our uncouth behavior.
Fat, happy and amazed; we returned to our friend's flat. Later on in the week, we asked our buddy to take us to an Indian restaurant that would convince us that Indian food in London is better than Indian food in India. He said okay and where did we end up? Tayyabs! [Yes at this point I felt as if I was a local] Although the experience this time was completely different. It was the same great food but since it was dinner time on a friday night the service was rushed. We ended up waiting a full hour until they sat the 5 of us at a table. We all ate merrily and were chatting away when the waiter came by and started taking out plates away. A few that were not finished eating looked at each other. As the waiter was reaching for my friend's plate he was compelled to ask [in his un-phony British accent] the waiter ""Excuse me sir, are you short of plates? We are not finished eating"" It was clear that he was still eating and the waiter replied ""Yes, Youuuuu are not finished but shhheee is"" and took my plate away. Now this warrented evil-burning-the-back-of-your-head-crazy-eyed-stares from all of us at the table. Another waiter came by and asked if there was a problem and my friend explained what happened. The waiter told us to take our time... 
We finished eating and when the bill cameout, we were tempted to leave a bad tip.. but in the end we decided that maybe they were short of plates and left a decent tip. Hopefully they spend it wisely.",1
5,"For quality of food and price this place can not be beaten.
 The food is classic Indian whit all your favs like Chicken Tikka, Saag Aloo, Tandoori Paneer etc. All the food is cooked quickly and is sumptuous. The mixed grill is what Tayyabs is famous for and it never disappoints! Within minutes of the sizzling plate landing on the table most of the food is gone.
 I suggest you book ahead as there are always queues. Tayyabs reputation has grown quickly due to its proximity to the square mile and once people try it they always come back and bring others.
 I recommend the mixed grill to start off with and then chicken Karahi with Naan bread. Also go for the Mango lassie as its a mango milk shake that is out of this world!
 Finally the best thing about Tayybas is it serves authentic top quality cuisine at rock bottom prices. A meal costs on average £8 - 10 each! Plus its Bring Your Own which also allows for more money to be saved.",1
4,"""are you running out of plates?"" - my friend to our waiter, after trying to clear plates from our table before we had finished eating from them.  there was a bit of a standoff at this point.  managers got involved.  no tip threats were made by my friend.  it wasnt pretty..
after nervously wandering through the dodgey end of the city for most of the afternoon in search of itown, my friend (a different, non-beligerent friend) and i stumbled upon this restsaurant around 4 pm.  being 4 pm, we were just about the only patrons in the place.  our food was served quickly and eaten even quicker.  little did we know we would be returning the very next day for dinner.
the friend quoted at the beginning of this review said he wanted to take us to a great indian place not far from his flat.  at the end of the walk, we were surprised to be back at tayyabs (we have bad memories, obvi).  we arrived right during the dinner rush.  we waited on the queue, which was unbelievably long, wrapping all around the front waiting area of the restaurant.  but the food made the wait worthwhile.  scrumptious.  again.
GOOD STORY?
i would definitely eat here again.  well, whenever i next return to london...",1
2,"Took a party of 10 there last night  food good, good value, service the most appallingly awful in London",-1
5,"Great grilled meat and a very nice karai sauce, went first thing an saw impressive selection of fresh veg being delivered. Lamb is preferable to chicken, but everything is good. Nice lassi selection. BYOB.",1
4,"Tayyabs continues to deliver the most ridiculously pleasurable, rustic, straight-to-the point Pakistani dining experience. Totally chaotic and urgent (queues of drooling punters practically snaking down the street), this is all about the lamb and the mutton. The dishes are beautifully spiced and flavoured, practically dancing on your plate with complex, hypnotic aromas and perfectly balanced spiciness. The service is abysmal - they rush you to finish so they can replace you with new diners - but not unfriendly, and diners sit elbow-to-elbow, cramped liked anchovies in a jar. You also come out smelling of oil and chilli, and all your clothes will need washing. Still, a classic, absurdly cheap, and one of London's great experiences.",1
2,"Sheesh. I love lamb chops as much as the next person, but when I have to wait 90 minutes to eat them and also eat them next to a 20-strong stag party swilling vodka straight out of bottles, my enjoyment is vastly reduced. Not going back any time soon - there are other places to eat tasty grilled meat without the hassle and shouting!",-1
4,Wait staff a little standoffish. Food very good; great lamb kabobs.,1
4,Visited London a few times and this time with our kids. Had a fabulous feast at Tayyabs. Very crowded since it was a holiday week but the wait wasn't too long. The naan and paratha was so amazingly fluffly. Everything was superb.,1
3,"Really tasty spiced meat at reasonable prices and an always welcome corkage-free BYO policy. But what they give you in meat they take away in life force. Their refusal to take a booking and subsequent request that we join a line of dozens snaking round the edge of the restaurant meant it was 90 minutes before we started eating. That's the length of Jurassic Park III right there! We were shoved downstairs next to a stag party in an area that resembled a nightclub, where let's just say the service was distracted. Is it possible for a place to become too successful for its own good? I'm not sure even their extraordinary lamb chops would be enough to bring me back anytime soon. If I do return it'll be at 3pm on a Tuesday.",-1
3,"Yeh went to Tayyabs it was packed as usual, good food, buzzing atmosphere, the service was quick once we got seated but expect to que for 1 hour at least.",-1
4,"Excellent Indian food. You may have to queue for an hour or so if you havent booked, and the queue goes all the way around the inside of the restaurant.
 Bring your own booze, no corkage charge.
 Food is very reasonably priced and very tasty, especially the mixed grill",1
5,We like the place a lot. I threw a birthday dinner there a few months ago for about twenty people and the evening was a huge success plus they were a pleasure to deal with from start to finish,1
5,"As you draw nearer Tayyabs you'll notice the queue of locals and city boys loitering optimistically outside, trying to edge their way closer for a table. Queue's are always a good sign outside any restaurant but this one is actually quite fundamental to the whole Tayyabs experience. Even if you manage to book (which will require at least two weeks advanced preparation for weekends) you'll still have to wait at least 15 minutes until the waiter manages to turn your table. Therefore my advice is to go at least half an hour before you think you'll want to eat. That way you can take full advantage of their BYOB policy, have a couple of cans of beer (they don't allow glass in the queue) and scour the menu. By the time you manage to get a seat your taste buds are already warmed up and you are ready to order.   
  Please don't let this warning put you off, I'm only trying to prepare you so as you don't run away when you're warned it'll be a 45 minute wait for a table. Tayyabas is well worth it. It is my favourite Indian restaurant in the whole of London. Their Tandori Lamb Chops are smokey, spicy, sweet and delicious, the kind of taste you could only hope to recreate at home. Their curries are phenomenal too- I'd recommend the Sag and the Bindi which are both packed with fresh vegetables. A small curry is more than enough and that way you can order starters and side dishes guilt free. Last time I went the bill for four of us was £45 and we ordered poppadoms, starters, curries, nann, rice- the works! I would recommend Tayyabs to anyone who likes a bit of buzz about their restaurants and doesn't mind waiting for a great meal",1
2,"It was a year ago we went there with friends visiting London who were adamant they wanted to go on a busy sat night. We waited over 3hrs, yes 3hrs to get in the door! It was obvious that if you openly bride the staff, or speak Urdu, you move up the queue quicker!Once in, the food was ok, but not outstanding. Very noisy with tables & chairs jammed in every corner. Staff rude & orders forgotten. They brought meals we hadnt asked for & tried charging us for them.Maybe on a quieter time, the food & ambience is better, but I'm not in a hurry to return.",-1
5,"What a great place!!!! I always enjoy going there! You can bring your own drinks, since they have no licence to serve alcoholic drinks. If you don't book a table you end up queuing for at least an hour while chatting with your friends and enjoying a glass of wine.. Definetly a must-go!!!",1
4,"Service is a bit choppy sometimes but I would rate it in the top 10 places in Tower Hamlets. If you have reserved and turned up on time, you should be seated straight away. I would make a fuss if I wasn't!",1
4,"Good value (£15/head for plenty), no license, but no corkage for BYO. Tasty grilled meats and flavoursome curries.",1
3,Sunday 7pm: Very crowded and very busy. Staff gave me the feeling the sooner we are finished and are leaving the better. They were not exactly unfriendly but also not really welcoming. Food was decent but I still I cannot understand the hype about this place. In my opinion it is not worth to wait for a table. There are plenty of alternatives in this area.,-1
4,"Tayyabs. The legend! I'm not sure it lives up to the hype, but it sure is a yummy place - and very popular too! On my visit (
londonist.com/2009/03/lo…
) (accompanied by more than a dozen other food bloggers), I was whisked into the VIP Room. So, I have no clue what it's like to queue up for a meal here. But, I can tell you the queues are long (and have been known to stretch down the street). Is it that good? I dunno. Tayyabs' lamb chops are pretty damn tasty but ... Anyway, it's certainly worth a visit and seems to be one of those must-do places for all Londoners to visit.",1
5,"I am no expert on Pakistani cuisine but this place is the best. There is nothing fancy about this place and one definitely doesn't go for the decor. It's the food the keeps people coming back and raving about this place. I stick to the chicken dishes and love the tikka. Although I walk out of Tayyabs each time stuffed and in a coma, I want to return the next day. Their food is addictive and first rate. As a bonus, it is affordable... something London is not known for. Tayyabs is a top ten for me and should be on your list as well.",1
1,"After hearing so much about Tayyabs from lots of people, my wife and I finally went here. The food was ok, nothing out of the ordinary. I have had much better in Harrow, Southall, and most areas with a sizable Asian population. The service was atrocious. Firstly they made us wait for 45 minutes despite having a reservation. It was a Friday, so it was busy, but what is the point of reservations if they cannot stick to them? The food was slow to come, and did not come at the right time. Ordering an extra coke, for example took about 20 minutes. The food was very average, and not much choice.",-1
5,"This is a hidden gem and now due to so much press coverage everyone's getting in on the act!
If you book in advance you can book their 'VIP' section which granted is quieter than the main restaurant but as a compact space when the sizzlin' dishes come in you'll be choking!
The food is fantastic, and it's accessible due to where it is (easy peasy) and the prices will suit anyone's budget. 6 of us went for a meal and had about 10 starters of sheek kebab (only around 80p each) and then opted for chef recommended curries which did NOT disappoint.
I have heard the Lassi drinks are fab but I often opt for BYI - don't forget that btw as if you turn up and fancy a nice cool beer - you wont get one! It's all about bringing your own...which is a fantastic idea and cuts out the middle man who whacks on 50%!
Go enjoy this slice of India just off of Whitechapel and it wont disappoint. Great atmosphere, big queues - rowdy and noisy but that wont put you off as the food will just top off your exciting experience.",1
3,"Very good flavors but the whole ""experience"" of dining on good Indian food is brought down by the rushed and somewhat rude waitstaff. I forgot that it was BYOB and had to go to the local Tesco for some wine. By the time I got back my two ladies had been moved to another table because they had not ordered. Apparently, since we had a reservation, we were first seated at a more desirable table. When we failed to order quickly enough we were demoted to the very busy and bustling front of house where the tables are shared. I wasn't too bothered by that but I was bothered by my thanking the waiter without getting so much as a look or a smile as we left. It was almost like we had pissed them off by coming to dinner there. Too bad because the food is very good and very interesting. The dry meat curry particularly so. I'm not sure I would return given that I only get to try London Indian food so rarely. Even though the prices are three to four times what Tayyabs charge, I would still rate Amma in New York and Noor Jahan in London as the best Indian food I have eaten.",-1
4,Pretty awesome spot for a lunch - Indian food on steroids!  We had a thali and dosa which was heaps for food for 2. So much flavour.  Definitely get a mango lassi too!,1
2,"I was walking around by myself one evening and thought it would be nice to try a fine dining Indian restaurant since many near where I live are quick serve.
I probably should have left when I first walked in as I felt like the people working there thought it odd for me to ask to dine alone.
It took a very long time before anyone came to take my order. And overall, not really friendly at all.
I wish now I had gone with the traditional Thali, but the dish I ordered sounded very good on paper. Noodles with prawns and squid.
The dish came out very quick, considering their menu mentions giving them time to prepare everything fresh. Now the sauce was delicious. Very very good. But given the price of the dish being over £17, there was very few prawns and only a couple pieces of squid.
When I finished eating, it took a long time for anyone to check on me and get my bill (I had to ask for it). Even though I saw them attending to other tables.
Therefore, given the poor service and price, I give it 2 stars.",-1
5,"Believe it or not... London is the place to eat the best Indian food in the globe! 
Masala Zone in the heart of the Soho delivers that great expectation. The food is exquisite and the flavors are not spice overpowering which makes the food delightful. 
If you are not too much in to the super hot and spicy, there are great options. The waitress Sahana took the time to ask preferences and Based on answers she made excellent recommendations from appetizers, to main course, side dishes and dessert. Highly advise to order the  Butter Chicken, delicious! , and  Chicken Saffron Korma.  Make sure when you eat here to ask for Sahana she will ensure you will leave this place in love.
The  value was great for the quality of food! 
The restaurant is posh and chic! 
The Host was kind and very attentive,  and not having a booking was not a big deal.",1
5,"This place was excellent/ ambiance was good!  Food was flavorful- the only draw back ... the waitress was not very attentive- she started cleaning up while my friend was still eating, we felt rushed!",1
3,"Good ambience, but acoustics can be better. A bit noisy restaurant. 
Food quality is very good, but it's no real Indian food taste. Very westernized and tasted bland. Ordered Butter Chicken thali, but had to add a bit more salt to it make it easy to eat. Probably inime with catering the local crowd, but the spice composition cannot be compared to 'real' Indian food. But customer service and attention given was good.",-1
5,"This was our first Indian Cuisine experience in the United Kingdom. We looked them up on Yelp and saw that the reviews were encouraging so we took a chance on a Friday night and showed up without reservations. They were about a 15 minute walk or less from Leicester square. They were fairly busy and we waited at least 10 minutes but still a very reasonable time to wait on a Friday night WITHOUT reservations. 
The service is NOT great but you get over that pretty quickly because of the food. The samosa was amazing. Both of our meals were great. The drinks were excellent. The ambiance was awesome. The bathrooms were even cool. We wanted to order and eat so much more but we were full on the food we had ordered! All in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back the next time I am on ""holiday"" (vacation) again in the United Kingdom.",1
4,"Nice place for good and affordable Indian food.
The atmosphere was great, quiet and I enjoyed the decoration. The service was ok.
We ordered a lunch bowl (vegetarian) and a chicken thali. It was good and fulfill. I really liked the thali which was composed of a lot of small plates with different flavors. It was delicious and perfect to taste different spicy and Indian dishes.
The price was decent for what we ordered and I think I will go again !",1
5,Love their butter chicken! Had it as the lunch bowl and it's quite a decent meal at a good price! The ambience is really nice too and the staffs all very friendly.,1
3,"I came here for lunch yesterday had a great meal.  Mini-chains of Indian restaurants is not something we see in the States, so I was intrigued to see what the results would be.  The place was buzzing and very busy for lunch and we were seated right away.  The décor did not seem much like a chain restaurant in my opinion, it is modern, but also warm and cozy at the same time.
The menu is very busy and there is a lot to choose from.  I had the chicken saffron korma and we also got the butter chicken thali.  Additionally, we got garlic naan and rice.  Everything was very good.  Nothing was amazing, but not one thing that hit the table was mediocre.  I really liked the chicken saffron korma.  I have not seen it at many restaurants back home.  
One thing that was lacking here was the service.  We waited for a long time for our server, ultimately ordering from the host.  We got our drinks from one server, food from another server, drinks ordered from another server (which never came) and the bill from someone else.  A little annoying as we ended up being in a bit of a rush to get somewhere after.",-1
4,"I've been to Masala Zone on multiple occasions and the food and service have always been good. Sure, sometimes it's REALLY busy and you may need to wait a little bit, but overall the service is very good. 
To be honest, I still don't really understand how to order the Thalis, but whatever does come out is always yummy. We tried the shrimp curry and it was delicious. I love all the options you have with a Thali. The flavors are always so diverse and interesting. 
One of my favorite appetizers is the dahi puri- it's like this spicy puff filled with cool yogurt. AH! SO GOOD! And the mango sorbet is a delicious finish to any meal. 
On another occasion we decided against the Thalis and just ordered curry. They were also good but I think we've learned we can't handle heat as much as we thought we could ;)",1
3,"I had one chance to eat good Indian food during my WEEK in London. One would think I couldn't have screwed this up like I did.  Pressed for time we walked into Masala zone.  It should  be called the ""coriander zone"" for their  heavy handed use of the  spice.  The veggie samosas had large offensive seeds that I had to spit into my napkin. The korma has so much coriander it was inedible. 
Also, I'm confused about the curries. They were more like  soup than actual curry.  The butter chicken lacked any kind of subtlety or depth. It was more like tomato soup.  
Finally the rice didn't get eaten and the naan was bland. Such a bummer and I have to wonder how this place gets so many 5 star reviews.
On a positive note the staff was pleasant and the atmosphere appropriate for a soho restaurant.",-1
4,"Review for the take-away. The interior however looks very nice and every time I walk past here it's quite busy. The place does seem a bit overdecorated but the vibe and the atmosphere is pretty good - I can definitely see this place being a good date dinner venue.  
Service was pretty lacking. Their payments system was down, and staff didn't seem to do a very good job communicating with each other so there was quite a bit of confusion and a pretty significant and frustrating delay. I ended up needing to pay in cash since they couldn't really sort out what was wrong. 
The food is delicious and very heavily spiced - the spicy offerings are actually quite spicy. They have thali sets that come with a little bit of everything if you like variety. The grand thali can be split between two people easily. Portions are reasonable although Masala Zone is a bit on the pricey side, although I don't think it's egregious for the area.",1
2,"On the hunt for good Indian food.
This place was not it. We wouldn't have chosen a place called Masala Zone but our friends chose it b/c it was close to our hotel. We tried a lot of dishes but they weren't authentic. The service was good.",-1
4,"Really enjoyed this place even with kids. The staff was attentive and friendly, polite to a T. We had a few standards and a few more exotic choices and despite a few of us who are sissies about spiciness, everyone found things they liked. Yummy Indian Punch too!",1
4,"This place offers traditional curry and other classics. Manages to serve them quickly despite a crowd. This place does try to make you wait too long for a table even when they are clean and you are next for it. They seem to be content with leaving you at the bar and hoping you order a drink to pad your bill. When you're hungry this is a nuisance. The decor is great and if it was quiet it could even be romantic. That isn't possible however since this is close to soho's many bars. Service was pretty good for London.
Definitely recommend you go but get a reservation so you aren't one of the many groups being pushed back out the doors.
Also the doors are weird. Pay attention when you open them.",1
3,Only reason this place gets a 3 star is because of its decor and ambience. This place is well lit and is beautiful. The food here is not as good as the decor. For someone who is from India or knows taste of some traditional dishes would agree with me. Their undhiyu was sweet and had ripe bananas in it which was a dealbreaker for me plus it was super oily I couldn't even eat anything after that. Their grant thali is ok but the worst part was when we asked server which vegetables are part of the grand thali she mentioned completely different vegetables from what came as a part of meal. Horrrible service plus ok food =not coming back again anytime soon.,-1
5,"I was on a business trip alone in London and was craving Indian food. As any Bay Area person I looked for a place nearby in Yelp and found Masala Zone. It was the perfect ambience to have a nice meal alone. It was nice, but totally acceptable and not awkward to dine alone. I ordered the smaller size Thali w/ lamb. It also came with lentils, and a delicious broccoli dish. It was all soooo good.",1
5,"Very pleased with this place. We didn't have a reservation but got there around 5.00 and there was no wait. It quickly filled, however, so I'd recommend a reservation (but it obviously worked out for us, so don't be deterred). 
They have a collection of curries that they serve on a platter with set sides, delicious chutney, and a few other things (called a thali). You can get a regular thali or a grand thali, which has a few more bells and whistles. You can add on another curry for a bit extra. We got the butter chicken (suuuuuper creamy) and the lamb curry (lamb was super tender). 
If you are moderately hungry, adding a curry to the grand thali would sufficiently feed 2. We didn't realize that and added the chicken kottu parantha. Kind of glad we did, though, because it was delicious. Spiced chicken with lots of veggies and delicious things. They warned us it would take longer to cook, but I thought it was served quickly.",1
2,"Poor quality Indian food, over-overpriced, on a nothing-to-mention space with slow service. Seems like someone thought to make an Indian fast-food but somethibg went wrong.",-1
3,"Went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch around 1.30 pm. My friend has made a reservation so we didn't have problem getting a table.
I think the food was just ok. Definitely not the best Indian food I've ever had.
I ordered the grand thali with lamb (I added garlic naan) plus a glass of mango lassi.
The veggies dishes in my thali were actually better than the lamb curry (which suppose to be the star). The curry could be served hotter, it was a bit cold when I received it.
Portion wise, it was big enough than I couldn't finish it.
The restaurant is classier than regular Indian restaurants, the service was also good. The waiter checked on us several times, and in the end he asked us to fill the feedback form. I guess they're trying to improve their service level due to the bad reviews about it.
Overall, I had a good experience. However, I probably won't go here if I really craving good Indian food, if you know what I mean.",-1
3,"Open concept and beautiful decor. Definitely should have gotten a reservation prior to arriving. Only waited 30 minutes at the bar. I tried the Chai Negroni which I didn't like but in the restaurant's defense, it was labeled bitter and spicy. I tried something new; they aren't all winners. The Narial Punch was the perfect amount of sweetness and creamy texture. As for the meals, the food overall was incredibly full of flavor with different levels of heat. I highly recommend the cheese naan bread. I ordered two for myself, it was that good. Now to the bad stuff. As an American, I am comfortable in cargo shorts and a hoodie. Just because I look casual doesn't mean I'm broke or a poor tipper. I had to ask several times for more water AND when someone finally brought it, it was as if I was inconveniencing him for even being there. The food was divine, I can't deny that. My thing is I felt judged for how I prefer to dress. I still paid in full and as the tip was included in the bill, I can say my experience didn't warrant the 12.5% already added. Normally I tip 20% for excellent service. 0% would have been more appropriate.  As I am zaftig, I have no issue spending money on food. So now, I judge the service here and hope future experiences with people won't feel as overlooked as I did tonight.",-1
4,Great service and atmosohere. Get the large thali with butter chicken. It was quite delicious with a side of garlic naan. Made reservations an hour before online on a Friday night. We arrived 15min early and were seated right away.,1
4,"The service is excellent, the food is delicious. We had the chicken masala plater it had a little bit of everything. Good place to eat when visiting London.",1
5,Delicious Food! Beautiful ambiance. Wonderful service. The Grand Thali was excellent!,1
5,"Great ambiance, tasty food! They took our group reservations and had no problem fitting us all in for dinner! Slightly pricier than anticipated given that it wasn't necessarily ""extra special"", but overall still a good experience!",1
5,"I walked into this place expecting solid Indian food. What I did not expect is the well thought out and innovative cocktail menu. The star was a punch that is a twist on a chai tea and served in a metal tea cup with crushed ice. There is also a take on a. Gin and tonic that was delightfully bitter and a floral cocktail with a hint of prosecco. All of this melded perfectly with the meal, the thali with mangalore chicken. It's nice to know that you can swap out the main for the thali.",1
4,"I've been here a couple times always with a friend or family and we were always lucky not to queue because it can get very busy some evenings, especially Friday night. The food is a good range of everything and there always a different starter menu which the staff will tell you as soon as you sat down. 
It's a little pricey and can get quite loud sometimes but the food is fantastic. It could be a little bit more as I had portions that were a bit small for my taste.
The restaurant is about 5 min from Oxford Station on the Central, Victoria and Bakerloo Line and 3 min from the bus stop Conduit Street Hamleys served by the buses 3, 6, 12, 13, 23, 139, N18 and N113.",1
4,"A very tasty experience from drinks to dessert. Friendly service, very pleasant atmosphere, and great food. We enjoyed the Regular Thali and Grand Thali - a good way to sample many flavors. Finished with the delectable Pistachio Kulfi. Highly recommended.",1
5,"This is my first time here and won't be the last time for sure.
I strongly recommend it.
1 tasty food 
2 amazing atmosphere 
3 friendly staff 
4 excellent in general",1
4,Cute decor with yummy Indian fare. Had the grand thali with butter chicken. Huge portions and delicious side dishes.,1
5,"We really enjoyed our evening at this beautiful restaurant. The service is impeccable.  The food is superb.  If your ever in London, this is an exceptional Indian restaurant to try.  You will not be disappointed.",1
5,"The lamb curry was beyond any expectations and even after becoming full, I felt compelled to continue eating. It was indescribably delicious.
The restaurant is also very beautiful and the staff are nice!",1
3,"I usually go for grubbier Indian joints where I don't even quite care what cut of meat or animal is being slapped into the curry sauce, so Masala Zone was very ""Oh, I see, we are properly in the West. Carry on.""
Not that it's a super fancy place, but it's clean, shiny, and you certainly don't smell that pungent oily fog of curry that permeates your clothes for days after. 
Many of us opted for the thalis, which is the usual order for indecisive people like myself. Why have one dish when you can opt for like nine things on a big silver platter. You have a choice of GRAND and regular, so being American, I of course supersized mine, so the thali gained kachumber (tomato & onion salad), raita, and an appetizer. Both types of thalis have a choice of meat curry, two veg curries (root & leaf), chapati, rice, and papadum.
The fish curry was fine as my main, though it could have used a kick in the spice levels. The chutneys and side sauces were on the blander side as well, but still mighty tasty. This might be an issue of getting used to more subtle flavors versus the sodium assaults of the curry houses I usually frequent.
Great place for large groups of hunger diners since we were a group of eleven and were seated immediately, right around dinner time on a weekend.",-1
2,Food was good. The service was terrible in that no one was attentive enough to serve us properly. We had to ask for the bill several times. We had to ask where our naan was twice and came out when our food was cold. Disappointed with the high ratings.  Seemed like the staff was half awake.,-1
4,"Wow. Wonderful Indian food. I'm not the biggest fan of Indian good, but I was really impressed with every dish (may except for the stewed lentils). I came with a group of 5 friends around 8 on a Thursday. Since Masala is large and spacious, we were quickly seated.
Based on Yelp photos, I decided to opt for a curry. I forget what it's called, but it was spicy (two chilies on the menu) but with nice coconut-y undertones and with large pieces of dark meat chicken. The curry doesn't come with rice, so I ordered some Yellow lemony-Jasmine rice which was perfectly seasoned, spiced, and I even found a roasted lemon rind mixed inside.
I tried my friend's Butter Chicken curry, which was a different type of spicy. Not in the sense of hot-spicy, but more like a flavorful, almost sweet spicy. She ordered garlic naan on the side, which came out slightly fluffy, fresh and warm. Other friends ordered the Thalis, which are definitely meant to be shared. I sampled their small side dishes - the lentil stew was mediocre but everything else was great. Also, good service!
Tl;dr - authentic, affordable Indian food in Soho.",1
5,"I think its the best indian food I had during my stay in London. The restaurant has a unique atmosphere, in comparison with other indian restaurants . The food is really delicious and esp. the starters ware very good and different from any indian restaurant i have been to.",1
4,"This chain is still doing great Thalis after all these years! Prices have definitely gone up, but still OK. Portions are big, food is delicious, and not as oily or fatty as your ""local"". 
Service at this branch was slow though, even though it was a Tuesday evening.",1
4,"4.5 stars - Side of dal 
4.5 stars - Chickpeas with lotus root and bread, even though it didn't have any lotus roots in it

5,"Great service. The food was great and the ambiance was very elegant. Get the Narial Punch ""if you like pina colada!""",1
1,"Terrible service, subpar food. Samosas  and chicken tikka were below average, sev puri and chicken 65 were ok, but garlic naan was good. 
Unfortunately, I had to ask three times before I got chutneys and they never refilled our water. Disappointing experience, will not be back.",-1
4,"Cheese Naam was great, garlic naam - ok, regular Thali and grand Thali trays with chicken were pretty good. 
The main con: service was a bit slow.",1
3,The food was okay the drinks were awesome. The waiter was super helpful. I was a little disappointed because they didn't have a tandoori oven and I really wanted tandoori chicken. Ended up ordering the chicken biriyani. It was good just not memorable. It wasn't bad but it wasn't 5 star great. This is kind of surprising to me as I'd heard that England had some of the best indian food and this place was rated almost 5 stars.,-1
4,"Good food in a modern setting. They have a nice ledge over looking the kitchen that is good if you are dining by yourself. I had the chicken curry and vegetable curry. Both were good but I would have preferred it if they had a little more flavor, I thought they were on the mild side, although I normally like a lot of spice.",1
4,"Came here on the recommendation of Rick Steve's London guide. Mind you, he's not that type of a traveler that knows good food. However, taking his advice on this chain while being in the neighborhood was a pleasant suprise.
Masala Zone are a chain of retaurants with various themes, this one having the theme of an Indian marriage with close to 100 vibrant puppets from Rajasthan suspended from the ceilings. Definitely a great conversation starter.
Menu is vast, but I went straight for one of the Thalis combo. I love my favorite Indian place in Glendale that does a great job on Northern Indian Thalis, so I had to see if this one stood up to it. 
I went with the The Grand Thali, which is equal to a starter and main course combined. It comprises a Canapé,  a choice of  curry, 2 vegetables (one green and one root), Dal (lentil), Raita (yoghurt), Indian salad, Papadum & Chutney, freshly-made whole wheat Chapatti (Indian bread) & Rice. You get to choose the meat. Be forewarned that when you say mild, it's VERY mild. You won't drip one bit of sweat at all. If you're like me and like to actually taste some spice in your food, medium should be good. Anywho, as noted on their website, the etiquette of eating a Thali is to spoon a small portion of food from an individual dish into the area next to the rice, and then combine it with the rice. Repeat this process in sequence. This enables the flavour of each dish to be appreciated individually. Do not either mix more than one dish simultaneously with the rice, or mix the rice in the individual bowls. Chapattis are eaten with the food by using a piece of chapatti to scoop the food from one of the dishes.
For a chain restaurant, the Thali was great and a good portion. It's not ""home made"" Indian food, but it's food that's tasty and you can try different combos. After walking an entire day around London, this did the job for a casual sit down. Definitely make a reservation if you're going to eat at 6pm and after or be prepared to wait and wait at this location.",1
1,"I have visited the Bayswater location twice and had a fabulous experience. The food was excellent, including the kabobs, butter chicken, rogan josh, thali, pav bhaji, chaat, etc. however, I had a terrible experience at this location. 
Yesterday, I came to this location for dinner. After a wait, we were seated and I ordered a lassi and then lamb seekh kabob and garlic naan. After 20 min, the kabob came out but the naan did NOT. After failing to get a waiters attention, I finally flagged one down and told her about the naan. She noted it and then continued working. 15 min later, still no naan. 
I finally flagged another server and she said she'd get us a naan. 10 min later, the naan showed up. It was flat, doughy, undercooked, and there was NO garlic. If you order garlic naan and you are being charged EXTRA for it being a garlic naan, there better actually be some garlic! And this wasn't a naan! This was a doughy chapati! And I know Masala Zone can do better since I had a good naan at the Bayswater location. I finally got the attention of the original server and asked him to send it back. He apologized briefly and offered to get me another one and check with the kitchen. 10 min later he finally came back and just said ""apologies for the naan"" and then went off again. 
We wanted the bill but the servers did not come by for another 10 min. Finally he came over and explained that he hadn't charged us for the naan and he had taken off the service charge. I was very disappointed by the customer service at this location and I probably won't be coming back. It's a shame.",-1
3,"Casual Indian chain that's great for lunch. 3.5 stars
Food: 3.5, Atmosphere: 3, Service: 3
Cost to worth it rating: 4
Return worthiness: sure
Highlights:
- Variety and quantity: with a thali you get rice, bread, vegetables, sauces, and a main of your choice 
- Butter chicken was good 
Lowlights:
- Spiced cola: gave it a try but not sure it's my thing
Had a fine lunch and would return.",-1
5,"I was a little weary of coming here since I heard it was a chain restaurant. Boy was I wrong. It was a beautiful restaurant and when you first walk in, the wonderful smell of the Indian food was enough to make get rid of my doubts of this place. We ordered the thali and the grilled chicken. I ordered the Indian yoghurt drink and it tasted great. The food was amazing and everything was perfectly flavored. It was proportionate and filling. The service was good. A reservation is probably a good idea for this location since it was packed before 8 pm on a Saturday night.",1
3,"Three stars indicates just ok, but let's be clear, I actually like the food here just fine. It's not your momma's cooking, no, but it's fresh, clean-tasting, and everything actually tastes different (you know the ol' takeaway curry joint trick of making a giant vat of bland base gravy and then just adding a dash of tomato paste, saag, spices, etc to make it into separate dishes, yeah? yeah, this place doesn't do that, as far as I can tell).
I would say that the stand-out dishes are almost exclusively the veg ones. Chicken tends to be a little dry and tired; lamb tends to be only ok. The veggie offerings are really quite nice, with a good range of starches and pulses and some solid paneer-based offerings.
Thalis are a good size.
So why the three stars? Primarily it comes down to price. Yeah, you can come in, get just a veg thali (£11.15) and their cheapest drink (tea or filter coffee, I believe, at £1.80) and have lunch for £14.57 when you add in gratuity. But that's an expensive lunch for Soho when you can get a solid, fresh falafel wrap etc for under £7 with a drink around the corner. And let's be real, you don't want just the thali: you want to try the appetisers (all sadly overpriced and not good value for the size, also generally underwhelming in terms of taste) and have a drink (also expensive), and maybe tack on a second curry to pad out your thali (£3.50). 
The last time we went (yesterday, actually), we dropped just under £60--ouch!--for lunch: lassi, iced tea, thali with extra curry, a curry main, two appetisers, two desserts (both of which were awful), a tea, and a coffee.
What gets my (roast) goat here is that the pricing always feels vaguely like a scam about to happen. It's always a little different; this time it was ""If you order a main and a drink, it's 20% off!"" Hey, that sounds really good-- no, wait. ""The 20% off is already reflected in the menu. If you want the full-price menu, we can offer it."" What even is this? Seriously, guys. It's not classy, and your poor servers have to keep explaining it like it's reasonable. Don't do it. Just admit your food is grossly overpriced and then offer a discount from the price you want to charge, if that's what you're after.
Food also does take forever to come out. Granted, yeah, things are being made mostly to order, but let's be real, the kitchen doesn't hustle, and there's no excuse for dessert (pre-made sweets and a lump of ice cream) taking 15 minutes to appear. Basically, you can't just nip in for a quick lunch here. Set aside two and a half hours.
I don't hate this place, though I do sort of hate how it's structured. But after this last wallet-searing experience, I'm done. I really am. So, how about it, fellow Yelpers: is there a decent Indian place anywhere near-ish to Soho?",-1
5,"Everything top notch, reasonably priced (esp. for that pat of London), great service. Very happy indeed! The Grand Thali was truly grand and beautiful to look at.",1
5,"I really didn't expect it, but this was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. My daughter loved the labneh (?) paneer, and my husband and I had thalis. Every single dish was incredible. My husband's cocktail was ridiculously refreshing, and I enjoyed my white wine as well. They were nice to our kids, and our kids loved the food. I really wish we had these restaurants in America! Make a reservation to ensure you don't have to wait in the queue.",1
3,"It's my second time in the soho establishment...great location. 
Thali for lunch is just perfect.
The service was quick, friendly and helpful. 
The food was tasty and plentiful. 
I only lamented very small dabs of chutney. Otherwise the experience was very good.
Fresh fruit juices are lovely.",-1
4,"Huge place. Lots of tables. Maybe too spacious. 
The size of the restaurant didn't influence the swift service and frienlyness though. 
The quality of the food is very o.k. and not too expensive.",1
3,"I went here on a recommendation from a friend of mine that has, what I'd perceived to be, excellent taste in the culinary arts, but now, I'm really starting to question that assumption. I head things like ""it's really good"" and ""there are clearly Indians making the food *and* eating there..."". I guess I should have asked for more elaborate descriptions.
For a chain (famous last words), it's good. Better than just okay. You walk into the restaurant and it's undeniably aromatic, fresh spice and charred goodness emanating from the tandoor. Your palate whet with anticipation.
My date and I dined on the Dari Puri and Goan Crispy Prawns to start. I didn't detect any chickpea in the Dari Puri, nor any chutney (perhaps it was the drizzle), but there was sure a mouthful of yogurt. The Goan Crispy Prawns were more crispy than prawn, and tremendously greasy. For our mains we had the Paneer Makhanwalla and Roghan Josh. Both mediocre, lacking the signature depth that we've all come to know and love from Indian cuisine, and falling a bit flat. The portion size was also slightly less than satiating.  
Moral of the story: in a pinch, lack of similar alternatives, and need to get away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford and Regent, duck in here... it won't be offensive.",-1
4,"This is not first time we eat at this particular restaurant and as usual, the food is just great. A huge rainbow of different tastes and very delicious. The reason for 4 and not 5 stars are the fairly steep pricing.",1
4,"Good food, nice ambiance, and friendly staff. All good. Worth going back again.",1
4,"I saw their adds in the tube and was craving Indian, so I thought ""why not"". I had checked out a few of Indian places in the neighbourhood and they were all way more expensive. 
I had the vegetarian thali and a mango lassi it they were quite tasty. Although, way more oily than I'm used to and I didn't like that I had to pay extra for naan bread. Good portions for the price and quick service. 
The staff were very kind as friendly. The location is ideal for tourists.",1
5,"The best indian food I've ever had. I ate prawn coconut curry with rice, and some awesome indian bread. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I'll be back soon!!",1
4,"I would have given them a five star rating but the service was subpar and the server kept us waiting a long time. Also, there isn't a lot of ventilation so it's hot and stuffy. Other than that, the food was amazing! The price was appropriate and portion sizes were generous. The grand thali and regular thali dishes were such a steal for the price/quantity/quality. I'd recommend this place to Indian food lovers!",1
4,"Cool kinda - safe bet- Indian eatery near Carnaby street. 
The Thali's are always a little hit and miss in what accessory dishes you get, but overall it's a good experience place for a fast weekend lunch.
Some of their curries are very tasty and it's not overpriced for the west end.",1
4,"I came to Masala Zone with 2 friends when we were perusing Carnaby Street.
We decided to try multiple dishes so we could try a variety of Indian food.  We ordered a regular vegetarian thali, gol guppa, bhel and what I think was the Chana Dabalroti.  All of which were very tasty, however, it is a bit pricey for the portion of food that you get, but it is central london.  Each of us ordered a soft drink and our entire meal came to £51.
If you come here and are unfamiliar with indian food, definitely try to order different platters and try them around.  One of my friends is Indian and she thought the gol guppa were too tiny and were not filled with enough filling.  My favourite dish was the ghel, a puff rice and peanut salad.  It was something I wouldn't pick out if I was on my own, but I was certainly happy that my friend suggested it.",1
4,"I have had a fair few curries in my time, some good, some really ropey, but this has to be up there with the best.
I had the two courses for a tenner deal,which was a veg street food starter and any Chicken curry.
The courses aren't massive like a lot of curry houses, but besides, who wants to eat too much rice anyway. Here they concentrate more of the flavours and blends of spices which were perfect, non of that greasy 'gee' topping that you get with a lot of curries.
Staff are all really friendly and helpful, so if your'e in the area pop in, if you're not in the area get a train,bus,taxi,magic carpet,but get yourself here.",1
2,"Bad customer service, rude server. Food mediocre. Can get this somewhere else for half the price.",-1
3,"My experience at Masala Zone Soho was good and I can see how you could give the place more stars. However, I wasn't overwhelmed by my experience so I am giving three stars in my review. But the place really does Indian food very well and there is a lovely ambience. There are a good selection of street food. The dahi puri were delicious. Unfortunately the aloo chaat had been taken off the menu, as I was looking forward to ordering that. The thali and grand thali meal options are really good. They offer a balanced Indian meal. In general dishes are a good portion size, which is nice because you can avoid eating too much.",-1
4,"This place does a job and does it well.
It's not the most characterful Indian restaurant you've ever seen.  No opulent flock wallpaper here.  Quite functional.
However, it does serve a wide range of Indian food you don't tend to see elsewhere.  Food which claims to be ""Street Food"", rather than the typical Chicken Tikka Masala.
It's the only place I've had a salt lassi with herbs (and that isn't a type of dog).
Tip: although the Thali is really cost-effective, you can easily fall into the trap of mixing everything up and getting an oddly featureless mush.  Discipline is needed to try to eat one thing at a time.  I've given up on that now, and go for the starter, main course, dessert route, to guarantee more distinct tastes.",1
4,"The food is very good, the service great and the prices very reasonable.  I was traveling on my own and they have a counter that was perfect for the solo diner. Well worth a visit",1
4,"We stopped in here after visiting the Royal Opera House, which is literally around the corner. My friend and I are complete Indian food enthusiasts, so it was a must when traveling in London. I'm so glad we stumbled upon Massala Zone! Affordable and delicious Indian in a fun atmosphere. We had chicken briyani, naan, and green curry and all were excellent. Four stars only because our server was extremely unfriendly. We will probably be back.",1
4,"Good food. Relatively late on a Sunday night, the place was half full, which is a good sign. It was spacious, not noisy, clean, bright and nice design painted on the walls.
I enjoyed my thali, although the selection is slimmer than a typical Indian restaurant. The spice level was at the top of my range, so I do not recommend if you like bland food. My only disappointment was that I had to get up to get the bill 15 minutes after the waitress confirmed I was done and did not want any dessert or tea.",1
4,"I dined with two friends (26 October 2011) at Masala Zone in Soho. We had early dinner reservations (6pm), as we flew in that morning from the USA and Canada. The place is quite lively and filled up quickly. The acoustics was pretty bad, but we still had a very nice time together. 
 
My friend Lee selected Masala Zone for its Thali, which we all ordered. Thali is a medley of different dishes served on large platters. I selected the butter chicken for my meat course (you can choose chicken, lamb, shrimp, etc), which came with curry vegetables, lentils, raita, chapatis (whole wheat bread), and rice, all for about £11.50. Everything was scrumptious and the chicken tender! 
While this is a chain restaurant, I thought the food was well prepared (the flavors of each dish blended well), and reasonably priced, especially in expensive London. I would definitely return here the next time I'm in London. I'll have to search out for a similar type of place where I live.",1
4,Good for the price. Butter chicken is spicy but not too much. Chicken samosas are good.,1
2,Star rating only for the customer service. Food was so so so average! Don't be fooled since it is Indian Food for the non-Indian palette.,-1
4,"I love the lunch offers and a regular place to come for my late sunday lunch to get rid of a hangover. 
For 10 pounds we get a chicken biryani and a starter as well. A brilliant filler. 
The staff are courteous to a fault and ask you how we are enjoying our food a few too many times. This is a chain of restaurants so I can't say the food is unique to this place alone. But it isn'y curry house stuff. The spices are quite genuine and I truly like what they serve.",1
4,"Masala Zone is a great venue overall.  The place is spacious for larger groups, an 8min walk from Piccidilly Cirxus.  Sevice overall was good.  Tried lamb kebabs, malahi chicken, butter chicken and green chicken.  All the dishes were very good and would recommend.  Only negatives are portions are smaller than expected and as a result we had to order more dishes pushing the price point higher then we expected.  Hence in a price scale it becomes at least 3 out of 5.
Would visit again, so that pretty much sums it up.",1
4,"Indian puppets decorated the ceiling of the large open space. I ordered the chicken thali which gives you a choice of curry and comes with four side dishes plus rice/naan. Pretty good portion sizes and flavourful dishes for ₤14. Not to mention, the waiters and servers were on it. Great stumble upon!",1
4,"Delicious authentic indian food. The fish thali was plentiful and very filling. I especially loved the cauliflower and potatoes dish and of course the fish. The place is very big and spacious, no reservations needed since we came around 5pm for an early dinner. It is a bit pricey but really good.",1
4,"On impulse, I decided to try this place for dinner since I was in Soho and was planning on getting dinner somewhere anyway. There is a lot of space inside so I can tell it is a good place for groups. They have a bar-like seating in the middle of the dining room facing the open kitchen which is great for solo diners like me. I got a mango lassi and a regular thali with prawn curry. The thali was delicious and just the right amount of spicy. I loved the prawn curry - the sauce and prawns were cooked very well. They had a lot of staff that evening so service was good and attentive.",1
3,"We figured a chain would have non-spicy food for the kids, so we picked Masala Zone.  So here is the review ...
- Location: In Soho.  Easy to find.  Very accessible.
- Service:  Good service (for a chain) in general.   The server gave us an introduction after we told her that this is the first time we are in Masala Zone.  She also recommended some dishes for the kids.
- Environment:  Bathroom was clean.  Restaurant was clean and OK looking.
- Food:  So so.  I definitely had much better Indian food before.   I also wish that the entree includes rice or bread so we don't need to separately order for the normal items.",-1
2,"Masala chai served without sugar by the side- not my idea of attentive service. But my siblings were happy with their masala ginger mojito. The food was good- some things were even very good. Dessert was meh. Service was unfortunately very slow and the demeanour of the person attending to our table was very ungracious to say the least. Was piqued enough to ask that the discretionary service charge be removed. Might still go back, hoping this experience was aberrational.",-1
3,"Who doesn't like Thali? Well I suppose if you don't like Indian food, but if you do Thalis are a great way to have a taste of multiple things and Masala Zone does a good solid take on Thali in a modern clean setting.  Something different when you don't fancy the local curry house with the 70s decor.",-1
3,"3 star for this place due to service
I was super excited to eat some Indian food in London. Can here on a sat night and the place looked modern. The menu has a lot to offer and we ordered a butter chicken and thali with a coconut chicken base. Both were tasty. Other people at our table also got different thali meats, beef and veggies. Reason for 3 star was due to service. After we just sat down our waiter asked if we want an appetizer and we said no but ordered drinks. After 10 mins we got our beers and then ordered.  We ended up ordering an appetizer and the waiter made a smart remark ""oh now you want an appetizer"" we didn't say anything. After everyone dishes started to come out we got our butter chicken but no thali. We waited till everyone else at the table got their food and after a good 5mins I had to ask for it. The waiter grabbed his pad and doubled check everyone's order and said oh I'll get it now so it looks like the kitchen either missed our order or a runner brought our food to someone else. By the time we got the thali everyone else was done eating so we rushed to finished ours. We also asked for water 3 times and didn't get it till the end of the night. I think the over all experience could of been better because there are waiters, food runners, managers and busboys but we some how couldn't get water when we ask 3 different people for it.",-1
5,"Masala Zone?  Are you kidding me?  I'm not going to eat at somewhere named Masala Zone, that sounds terrible.  
Wrong.  This place is the tasty-ness.  If you didn't eat here because of the name then you just fucked up.  oops.  
Lets talk for a minute about why MZ is the hotness.  
1.  If you have to eat out alone a lot (obvious I eat out alone, look at this review, you think I have friends?) they have a huge bar thats perfect for eating some lone tasties and not feeling like as much of a weirdo. They also are good about not keeping you waiting if you are on your own.  nice.
2.  If you are jetlagged and eating at odd hours they have super cheap deals. Get on that.  
3.  You can do your laundry next door while you eat.  Look how efficient you are.
4.  Thalis mean you don't really have to make up your mind, Just order big and eat all kinds of goodness.
5.  The desserts look delicious but I'm always so full I've never been able to try them.
6.  Way cheaper and way better service than Chor Bizarre.  Whack ass Chor Bizzare, get that shit out of my face.  
Whatever, lists are weaksauce, I'm sorry for even doing that.  I eat here all the time.  ALONE.  Come on, if that isn't going to persuade you to eat here then stop reading yelp, you are beyond helping.",1
5,"I typically avoid chain restaurants, especially while on vacation but I was definitely impressed! I ordered the grand thali which was delicious and left me wanting more. We luckily were seated without a reservation even though we were initially told reservation only. Also far enough away from the hustle of Regent Street but close enough to explore SoHo after a great meal.",1
4,"Clean and classy Indian joint in a convenient location. Delicious traditional recipes that do not disappoint. We enjoyed the butter chicken and the lamb vindaloo, each served as larger dishes accompanied by a mango chutney, mango sauce, lentils, rice and potatoes. Honestly one of these large dishes with a side of garlic naan is more than enough for two. But it was so tasty and we got greedy so the second serving was necessary. I definitely recommend this place and would come back again!",1
5,"Lived in India for 6 years so know good Indian food.  Their special was great with a variety of different choices.  Ordered naan and water on the side.  Curries are very spicy so ask if they can make it milder when you order.  Beautiful setting, easy to find, great service, reasonably priced, and extremely popular place to eat.",1
4,"Masala Zone was a recommendation from our hotel Concierge and a nice walking distance from where we were staying in London. 
We were seated right away on a busy Saturday night. Service was excellent.  The waitress explained the menu to us and took our drink orders immediately. 
The decor is modern and cozy. Soft lighting throughout the restaurant but still very upbeat with a combination of large party groups and tables for two.
We each ordered the Grand Thali, thanks to our gluttonous behaviour!
The Grand Thali consists of a canapé, papadum and chutney, a choice of curry, two vegetables, dal (lentil), raita (yoghurt), salad, chapati (indian bread) & rice. It sounds like a lot of food, but each of the dishes come out in mini bowls so you get to try a bit of everything. Price was 10-12GBP each. 
Also on the menu is a good selection of starters; cold and hot, as well as 'street food' appetizers. We wanted to try some; however, resisted since our eyes are always bigger than our stomach.
Very satisfied with this meal, as it was the end of our Europe trip.",1
4,"Very tasty food. I am very very partial to the Thali, especially the Managalore chicken curry. The regular thali was a bit much for me, in terms of portion size. I had trouble finish it up but forced my self anyway.Something to keep in mind, for next time, I should skip lunch if I am heading out here for dinner. 
My husband had the butter chicken with naan and a chicken biryani. The portions were huge and he was able to finish it up quite easily. 
Service is very good. I was quite surprised how attentive the waiters were.Always had our glasses of water topped up. 
One of the few good Indian restaurants in the Covent Garden area. Good find, definitely going back.",1
4,"I come here a lot. 
I mean, a LOT.
Mainly because of a promotion (no longer participating :() that gets me half price food to be honest. This makes their thalis a great lunch treat if I'm feeling like a chilled lunch. The grand thali is a fantastic beast comprised of a curry of your choice alongside several vegetable side dishes; always different, always a delight. Round it off with some rice, chutneys and a chapatti and you have yourself a meal. I'm that weird kind of person who doesn't mind taking a gamble on menus so this sort of pot-luck approach to the thali is awesome and encourages repeat visits. 
Quality of the food is good. The meat is cooked decently, never dry, and the curries have a great combination of flavours. The fact that the majority of your meal is in fact vegetarian and still fantastically tasty is testament to the chefs here (yeah, I'll say it, a lot of vegetarian food is bland and pointless)
At full price the dish is decent value; at half price I'm planning my return trip on the way out of the door.
Oh, one word of warning. Don't order the masala cola. Grim.
Update on the taste london card discount: they no longer do it. However their lunch deals are still reasonable (starter and a regular thali for a tenner) so it's still not terrible value for money.",1
4,"BEST Indian food I've tried (but i've only tried LA Indian food). Luckily, Yelp has extended it's reach to the UK, otherwise I would've never found this place. The staff was extremely kind and helpful with our dining choices.
It has been a month since I ate here but I STILL remember the name of the dishes I tried -- 
The Grand Thali came with plenty of food (your choice of curry and different kinds of side dishes that were great for dipping your bread). If there's one thing you MUST try it's the DAHI PURI. No need for explanation just get it. You won't be disappointed. :)",1
4,"Great ambience!! Good food! 
Thalis are really good!! We ordered one chaat and one thali, it was good for two of us.. They do give extra rotis :)",1
5,"Good selection of north and South Indian dishes (loved the Mangalorean Chicken). Food and atmosphere is great, so is value for money.",1
2,Being a nitpicking Indian foodie I can vouch for the masala dosa which is done perfectly. But am afraid I can't say the same for the golguppas and the aloo tikki chaat. That is not how you make them and they are far from being authentic. Also found the service extremely slow but the staffs are pretty friendly.,-1
5,I've been here on two occasions while visiting London. Both times I had the Thali which a mix of the daily specials. Indian is one of my favorite cuisines and I've been to many restaurants all over the world and this is truly world class. The staff is very friendly and the service is quick. Plus the atmosphere in Covent Garden with the puppets hanging from the ceiling give the restaurant a cool vibe.,1
4,"I had always wanted to go here having walked past many times, and never quite managed it. That was until last Saturday when I treated my mum for her birthday. We all ordered a lunchtime thali, and what a delight it was. Often Indian food can be greasy and unfresh. This was quite the opposite. The grand thali came with at least 5 different small dishes, each one delicious, and all for a bargain £10! I will definitely be going back. The staff were lovely too.",1
5,"We quite travel the city to come to this place cause if u google ""best Indian food london"" this restaurant it's coming first up. I must say: best Indian food I ever had! Small portions of many types of Indian food. Delicious!!!! I would comeback for sure!",1
2,Deeply average. Sauces were unsophisticated and bland. Salad was crudely prepared. Service was meh. I expected better from a place rated 4 Yelp stars in London.,-1
3,"Came here after a few hours hard shopping on Oxford Street on a Sunday. Although the staff were welcoming, the place was practically empty. The menu is quite varied, and centres around 'thalis' which provides for an assortment of complimentary dishes in a traditional plate. I had the tandoori chicken wrap which was filling but not particularly flavoursome. My friend had a small thali and she was very happy with that. If you're in the neighbourhood, and want something quick and reliable, if a little unadventurous, this might just be the place!",-1
4,"Wow, this place was good. 
I think I got the Thali (regular not grande) with butter chicken for about 8 GBP - I believe? The quantity was not too large, but the quality was definitely good. Actually, it's probably better that the quantity was average because you would get full. Unless you have a really large appetite, just get the regular thali. 
The thali came with a potato salad type dish (which was excellent), green mint/coriander dish, and I can't recall. Either way, I enjoyed it and would definitely go back again. 
Apparently, the owner is supposed to be similar to Tayyabs, which is another good Indian joint. (Don't take me for my word...this is what I heard from another person who lives here.) I have been to Tayyabs, and the wait is RIDICULOUS. 
Masala Zone is quite nice. Not loud. Nice ambiance. Good food. Would go back again. =)",1
5,"This place is a favorite of mine, and offers amazing Indian fusion food for the price. 
It is located on a street that isn't as busy with stupid tourists and frenzied shoppers, which is nice if you are a calm person like myself. 
The service at Masala Zone is top-drawer all the way, and the servers are very good and personable. 
The menus offers a great deal of choices, and it is a good place for vegetarians too.",1
3,"Not a HUGE fan of Indian food, but  this place gets a 3 star rating. They're decently priced, always a plus when the food tastes decent too.
When in London, I usually end up eating here at some point during my stay. Again, not into Indian food, but this place makes the cut. 
Its not good when you have it delivered, so be sure to visit a location. 
If I were you, I would order:
the grand thali with veges or prawns (the prawns are not good in Indian food from what I've been having...they're just way too small & unfulfilling)
This grand thali comes served on a huge round silver tray with little silver bowls of a crazy variety of spices, herbs, sauces, salads, veges, indian bread, rice, and lentils.
I've never had Indian food served like this until this place, so it was unique. The whole layout of this particular place is pretty nice, simple, oak/wood decor, bar like seating in some areas, not usually crowded.
I don't know if there is a specific way, or a specific order to eat everything on these trays, but I just graze about, trying all the different colored & textured randomness. Works for me every time. 
I don't like the yoghurt they serve with the entrees, nor do I like their special herb sodas, SOO GROSSS. Don't do it, don't. 
This place is better than any other Indian place I've tried. I really don't like buffet styled restaurants, and most of the Indian places I've been to are, so good on ya Masala Zone for taking the road less traveled.",-1
4,"Been to this Masala Zone several times now and still think its great. Their food is delicious, if not incredible. Most importantly,  its different from the standard curry house - in a good way!
They have plenty of room but you should expect to wait a little while on busy nights as they're very popular. 
Food wise the thali is my favourite, you get a range of starter dishes and your own choice of main course but they also do a great line in tandoori. As if that wasn't enough the cocktails are delicious! 
There are a couple of negatives... I'd say that its a little impersonal and sometimes rushed. The menu is also not very extensive, you'll quickly find yourself returning to the same old thing.
On the whole its well worth a visit, there are some great dishes and a great night to be had!",1
4,"Everytime I've passed through Carnaby Street/Soho I've always found myself saying I must try Masala Zone and now I finally have!
Being located in a busy area the restaurant is simply but elegantly decorated like a canteen styled eatery. Menu is easy to read and the staff are very helpful explaining what everything is. I love food and I love curry, so I instantly went for a grand thali which is basically enough to count or a starter and main course. There wasn't a long wait till our huge platters arrived. I was a bit anti-social as I was concentrating so hard as I didn't know where to start with all the little bowls of delicious things. I accompanied my food with a yummy mango lassi which in hindsight I should have ordered for desert.
We had a voucher for 2-4-1 mains but there were 4 of us the and waiter kindly re-printed another voucher for us making the evening even more sweeter! However everything is very reasonable anyway considering the quality and quantity of food.
A big must for a quick fix curry or for a group occasion.",1
2,"Indian fast Food. Nothing else unfortunately. Good service. Nice place. However the food was just not good enough. Watery Korma with only cream flavor. Tikka Masala with no taste. Thin Naan with a taste of flour only, even the garlic one. Sorry there are much better Indians in London",-1
4,"One of the best things about being in London is experiencing the Indian food! So it's ideal not to be disappointed when your food arrives. Masala Zone packs in an explosion of old world tastes into a new world setting.
One of the first things you'll learn when you enter the restaurant and talk to your waiter is that masala means spice. Here you'll find ""street dishes"" that are fit for royalty! Be sure to try the pan bhaji- yum!",1
4,"pretty great ""street food"" from india. big share plates of multi items with dips.(Thali) big one nice for 2...samosa was perfectly good...lassi nice. even had one half decent beer choice. bit fast foodie...but all in all quite ok... would return..",1
4,"I have seen a number of reviews deriding this as merely a 'chain' as if that immediately detracts from its capability to deliver tasty robust and reasonably genuine Indian food. However when that chain has the parentage of the much respected Veeraswamy and Chutney Mary restauarants you tend to ignore that. Indeed as a 'chain' it has grown considerably but the quality of the food has not changed since there were one or two of them.
Thankfully I have at least a good enough comparison of food having been to India and living in an area where there is a large Indian community and award winning restaurants. So I can say that this is very well done and very well presented food. The spicing is as it should be and pungently aromatic at times. Well priced for the West End and with friendly and efficient service, this is a favourite of mine.
It can easily cater for couples or groups as they have tables of varying sizes. The menu caters for what they call 'street food' and is presented really as a fast food Indian experience. But that would be doing it down as these dishes are well worth savouring. 
It's not a restaurant to bring a romantic date nor is it one where the wine list will leave you breathless but for excellent and extremely tasty Indian food, well presented and efficiently served, you can't go wrong.",1
4,"The Masala Zone chain is a favorite in general for reliably good Indian food, but this location seems to be the best of the bunch.
It's located on a quiet street behind the bustle of Regent and Carnaby Streets, and is a welcome respite from the flotillas of stressed-out holiday shoppers. 
I almost always go for the chicken tikka kabob, which changes flavors on a daily basis so we can be surprised when it arrives.  And the garlic baby spinach dish from the side order menu is a must have which we always share no matter what else we order.
Don't let the fact it's a casual dining chain keep you away - Masala Zone is under the same ownership as the fantastic and upscale Veeraswamy on Regent Street (which you must treat yourself to at least once in this lifetime).",1
4,"Good food and good service, had the thali platter with lamb which has great taste, only the curry portion size was quite small and only had 3 pieces of meat in it",1
5,"This review is for the desi who's sick of eating bland Indian food that caters to the western palate. 
Let me begin with saying that the 'chaat' was perfect! We tried the sampler plate & they were all good. The chaat may not be as grand as that which you get in Delhi or Mumbai but it comes darn close.
For mains we ordered the regular 'thali' and there wasn't one thing in there that we could complain about. The thali was fairly spicy, though (both my husband & I had to blow our noses once through the meal). The portions are large, so we were stuffed & didn't try the desserts.
      
The service was friendly & quick (we went after peak time & the restaurant wasn't full). We had 2 different restaurant staff walk over & ask if everything was OK.
The bathroom area door is deeply recessed & you don't get to see the insides of it each time someone opens it (yay!)
The ""show"" kitchen is visible from the dining area but it's pleasant to watch the activity in there. There main kitchen is behind recessed double doors & not visible. I liked the understated decor here (Warli murals on the walls) no Maharajas in gilded frames. The place is well lit.
It is handicap accessible (call ahead for assistance).",1
4,"I like Masala Zone for 3 reasons:
-Thalis (I love everything that comes with more than 3 different kind of food on it)
-Gol guppa or ""pani puris""
-Indian street food without having to spend 3 days in ICU after it (I will review the indian healthcare in YELP Bombay as soon as someone creates it, I promise...)
Thumbs up, Masala Zone!",1
4,"I typically start with one of their delicious Mango lassis and then jump straight into either a Grand Thali or Regular Thali plate depending on whether I am going to share. The Thali plates come with a bunch of little bowls filled with dal, various vegetables, yogurt, and other things that are great for dipping. You also get to choose a curry. I can personally vouch for the butter chicken, chicken mangalore, and the other spicy green chicken curry.
The prices are already pretty reasonable, but if you want to have a very reasonably priced meal and there are two of you, try splitting a Grand Thali and throwing in an extra nan. You can also throw in an extra side bowl of curry. Even with the lassis the two of you can probably escape for just around 20 GBP. 
I think the only area that Masala Zone could significantly improve on is their nan. It lacks the freshness and fluffyness of excellent nan.
Cheers",1
1,"Yelp lets me down again.  They is nothing four star about the place.  Had a a stellar curry last night, so coming off a fresh comparison.  Ok, this place is much cheaper, but really the food was so bland and uninteresting I could make better.  Lamb rogan josh, bland.  Garlic naan - looks like it had garlic on it, but couldn't taste it - oh and undercooked and cold.  Spinach with garlic - no garlic taste.  You get the idea.  Maybe relatively cheap, but no value.  Best to avoid.",-1
3,Grand tali nan. We went here twice and I thought this platter was great AND they were open late after a show.,-1
3,"Lets say you were dating someone that was British-born Indian and you had never really had curry before and you asked them to bring you somewhere legit for your first curry experience.  Would you expect to be brought to a chain restaurant?  
Let's just say I was mildly furious at the lack of effort. 
Let's also acknowledge that the term 'mildly' is an understatement. 
So I have to say the only curry I had before this was on a flight on Air India on which I was weighing the probability of statistical outcome on which would kill me first:  the shotty plane, the pilot that seemed to like to create turbulance where it probably didn't exist, or the botched airline food that came in containers, none of which I could identify other than the one that said ""water""... 
So this being my first ""curry"" and living in the land of ""curry or go home"" I expected to prepare and deliver some speech on how ""oh gosh, this is what I've been missing, I feel so cultured""  but instead I recited, ""hmm ok... well, thanks for ordering for me.""
Maybe Indian food isn't for me, it was ok, I've since walked by what seems like zillions of Masala Zones and have yet to be tempted to go back in.  As my date pointed out, there were other Indian people eating there and that was a good indication, so apparently it's somewhere close to legit.  
I've been taken to two other places since then, one was supposed to be the top top top amazing and one was apparently supposed to be ""pretty good' for Brick lane standards, and they all tasted and looked the same to me but had different price tags.  I say this with the caveat that I'm apparently not a curry-person, but if someone is making me go get one with them, I'd rather just go to Brick lane.",-1
2,"I've been to masala zone several times now and I still haven't decided whether it is good or not.  However, since I only ever come here about once every year and it is pretty low on my list of places to go for an indian, I think honestly, the verdict is leaning towards ""no, I don't particularly like it"".  
My friend and I arrived at peak hour- just after 8 and were asked to wait for a few minutes to be seated- however, during the 10 minutes we waited, there was a table close to the door that was free, and lo and behold! that was our table.  I guess this was to be expected as all the staff seemed very busy and in my personal opinion, the restaurant could have benefited from at least 1 if not 2 more servers this evening.  I was impressed that the staff were calm and friendly after running around in frenzy, although they did forget our extra order of poppadoms and had to be prompted for them.
We both had the butter chicken thali and the chicken was good, spices were well balanced.  The chapati was a large round pita/ naan without substance rather than a traditional chapati, so I was a little disappointed as I expected well, a chapati.  Personal bugbear of highly spiced poppadom was here and the daal tasted like Chinese red bean (aduki bean) soup without the sugar, underspiced and under salted (total failure in my point of view).  Aloo gobi was ok and the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced.  Actually I take that back; the poppadom was so over spiced, I believed the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced- I am not entirely sure on that one.
I really like the idea of a fast food type thali restaurant serving good quality Indian food at reasonable prices.  However, I also believe that good indian food is delicately spiced- i.e. bursting with flavor; you can taste all the spices but not all screaming bloody murder in your mouth at the same time, then replaced by a bland hotness.  Masala zone comes in a little heavy handed with their spices, and that is just not the kind of indian that makes me food happy...  I want to taste be able to taste all the different dishes, I don't want to just slop different types of goop in my mouth.
All in all, I probably won't come back for at least another year, and by that time I would probably have forgotten what made me upset about the Masala Zone.  It is a lot of food for the money they charge though.  
At least I have tayyabs to look forward to tomorrow!  Yum.",-1
1,"I took my godson who loves it here and loves curry...he's 11....it was my first time....and I hasten to add my last. The only saving grace were the staff who are lovely and very helpful but the food was a miserable excuse for Indian Cuisine....it's sort of dumbed down Indian for the masses and that's being kind. Everything was gloopy and even the Grilled Chicken Tikka had some kind of sweet slimey sauce on it....my Godson had the chicken saffron tikka Masala which was bright yellow..(not with saffron but tumeric) and sickly sweet with way way way too much coconut cream....the naan bread was clearly bought in and flat as a pancake, tasteless and cold... and all in all not good.
 Give it a miss.",-1
5,"This is one of my must-do's everytime I visit London and is often my first real meal after getting off a flight.  
Anyone that is with me has to experience it and I have yet to have someone who was disappointed by the experience.  
The Thalis are definitely the way to go.  They offer quite a variety and for someone who loves to have multiple options during a meal they are great.",1
4,"Fun stuff.
A place like Masala Zone could only exist in a densely-packed and highly concentrated Indian enclave like London, New York, or possibly San Jose.
Naysayers will snub Masala Zone and call it a chain restaurant, but it's really quite nice and their concept is sound.  That and the fact that their food is quite good.
Their focus is thalis, and in my mind, this really is the best way to serve Indian food if you're not into the ""all you can eat buffet"" kind of thing.  A thali is pretty much a complete meal served on a large steel platter.  The rice is in the center and it is surrounded by small bowls (katoris) of condiments, side dishes, and whatever the kitchen was in the mood for making that day.
The ordering process is a little confusing at first, but easily understandable:
Step 1: Decide on which thali you want, regular or grand.
Step 2: Decide on your main protein or veg (e.g. chicken, prawn, veggie, etc.)
Step 3: Decide on the style of your main protein or veg (e.g. curry, tikka masala, butter chicken, etc.)
Step 4: Wait for your platter and chow down.
Thalis come in regular or grand, and they're a pretty good deal ranging from 9-12 pounds for a complete meal.  
Papadum are so thin, you can almost see through them.  Chapatis are whole wheat and have a nice texture too.
Staff are friendly and eager to guide you through the maze of choices on their menu.
Atmosphere and decor is hip and casual.
Complain all you want about the chain restaurant thang, but I'd kill for a masala zone here in the States.",1
3,"Masala Zone is a chain of Indian restaurants serving mainly thalis - combination of different dishes on one plate. I like dining here when I come to London on my own as it's relatively cheap to get a complete meal for one person with starter, main course, rice, naan and condiments without breaking the bank.
There is a lot of flexibility as to what you want on your thali plate as well as how many curries etc, with price obviously increasing with the number of items you choose. There is also a nice section of starters, which can be ordered separately.
For me, the food is competent and the portions are generous but the flavour is average. Perhaps I'm spoiled by having the curry houses of Tooting so close to home. However, I do still return here when I'm in town and fancy a curry for one.",-1

cheap-eat-london.com/200…
 
 Time Out describes Masala Zone as ""Soho's best Indian, no contest"" and therein lies the curry lover's problem: NO CONTEST!
There's a real dearth of good ol' Indian curry houses in the West End with a few sporadically dotted here and there, but most notably a small cluster of dingy restaurants on Denman Street in the Soho area. If you're ever unfortunate to walk into one of these places, might I suggest negotiating 10% off the menu price first. They usually oblige and you might feel a bit better knowing you salvaged something to go with that slab of ghee swimming in your belly.
Masala Zone have thrived in part due to any lack of alternative choices but also through innovation (or modernisation), if I can call it that: Big, illustrated and descriptive menus; a bright interior; spacious seating; and well trained waiting staff that don't wear waistcoats. Most importantly of course is the food which I found to be a commendable effort. Previous visits with friends have taken in their renowned Thalis - a complete meal on a tray made up of several small dishes - and they've kinda dissapointed. The meat curry dishes aren't swimming in oil but at the detriment of any real flavours. Same with the vegetable dishes which were slightly on the cold side. At £11 for a thali, I'd also question the value - sure the variety seems impressive but an espresso cupful of rice, some shredded onions with green bits and a pot of minty yoghurt does not fool the tummy.
This recent visit with my buddy Nige saw us share: he, his lamb madras and I, my chicken mangalore. Supplemented with rice, chapatis and garlic spinach. For little more than a couple of thalis I'd say that it was a more fulfilling eating experience.
The madras was delicious - heavy on the chilli and tempered by tamarind. Lamb seemed a tad overcooked but it could've been a bit too lean. The Mangalore chicken was just right in it's combination of spice and coconut, with ginger being most prominent. The chicken was a bit dry though and I'm finding this to be a common occurence in all their meat dishes.
We decided on the Rasmalai for a sweet thing but other choices are standards - Golub Jamun, falouda (a sweet drink with colourful noodles) and kulfi almond ice cream. Rasmalai was a great choice - light, spongey, milky patties soaked in a saffron flavoured milk sauce and topped with pistachios went down a treat with the chai teas.
Masala Zone is a pretty good Indian that provides a more contempory experience to the traditional restaurant and if they figured out a way of serving meat that isn't overcooked to a high turnover of customers then I'd say it'd be excellent.
This was my second visit and it was a more positive experience than the first one.
£40 for the two of us which includes 2 mains, rice, chapatis, sides, drinks, desserts and chais.",-1
4,I really liked this place. Perhaps the best Indian I've had in awhile. The thali was a good size and I felt satisfied without being over stuffed. The flavors were really great and you get a little taste of everything. Solid choice in London.,1
5,One of the best indian restaurants in London. Perfect food but slightly slow service.,1
4,"This place has become like my second kitchen. I eat from here nearly everyday! You think I'm joking but I'm not. It helps that I live right next door but that isn't the only reason why I keep coming back. I love fresh food with flavor at bargain prices and that is exactly what I get here! How do I know it's fresh? Well, I see the delivery truck loaded with fresh fruit and veg everyday! Furthermore, I can smell the delish aromas of real Indian cooking creeping through the crevices of my windows and doors everyday! 
Typically my partner and I will order the regular sized thalis. The thali is basically like a set meal which comes with  sides of veg, potato, and lentils of the day, along with two sauces to eat with your popadoms, and then of course the main which is normally rice with whatever curry you choose. I usually go for the Prawn Malai. To me this curry is a perfect blend of creamy coconut milk based sauce with a barely there spice. 
My partner likes to get the Lamb Korma. I am a pescatarian so I cant personally comment on this curry, but I take it from the numerous people that have tried this dish that it is pretty damn good.  
There isn't really any difference between the regular and large thali as you aren't getting larger portions with the latter. In fact, the extra bit is some naan bread, little salad, and small samosa. Regular thalis are about £6-7. I definitely recommend this set as you'll get to taste a little of everything without spending more.  
Dining in is also a nice option since staff are very congenial! The place itself is not posh but more casual. The look they're going for is maybe an underground clay like hut but creative and Indian inspired nonetheless. 
Compare this place to all the little restaurants on Brick Lane and Masala Zone would still come out on top for me. Only reason why this place didn't receive 5 stars is out of homage to my Indian friend's mum's cooking, who by far is the best at Indian cooking ever!",1
3,"Ok, so it's not the most authentic in the entire world, but it's pretty good value, especially for the veg thali.
Service better than average.  Usually easy for a walk in after the theatre.  Recommended.",-1
3,"A very satisfactory canteen-style approach to Indian food, which makes a welcome alternative to the traditional high st tandoori. I went to this one on Marshall St and had a very tasty meal with a friend.
 We started with Bhel Poori, which my dining companion had never had before but I recommended. It's like a crunchy mix of raw ingredients with a tamarind tang. Yum.
 The main courses were good too and the wine went well with the moderately spiced food. I was quite surprised by the good standard of food from a restaurant that is part of a chain, and the prices were very reasonable.",-1
4,"Masala Zone is run by the same people as Chutney Mary and Veeraswamy. There are other branches located at Covent Garden, Camden Town, Islington and Earls Court.
 Masala Zone - mercy be - entices and does not disappoint. Excellent service. Lovely range of non-alchoholic drinks (though booze is available for those as wants). A balanced selection of vegetarian to meat dishes available in combinations that illustrate the range of flavours from across India.
 As my record shows, I am a stern critic of sub-standard Indian/South Asian food. I can't bear insults to that culinary heritage such as bright red/orange sauces with generic chemical flavours which are an insult to the palate and do not represent 'Indian' food. If you want a curry out of a jar then get some muck from Sainsbury's or wherever but don't insult India's millenia of food tradition by calling it 'Indian' food.
 Masala Zone compliments India by serving proper Indian food - long may it stay that way!
 Prices are reasonable with excellent deals for 2/3 course lunches for between £8.50/£13. Dinners attract similar deals so you can be sure to fill up for £15.",1
5,"Very good Indian restaurant. I advise you the ""Grand Thalis"" which represents the typical tastes of indian food, it is not expensive and very copious !",1
3,"Masala Zone. This was the first restaurant we went to in our Live-one-week-of-indian-cuisine-only quest in London.
 Well, not really much to say. It's an ok place, but sure not outstanding from what I've seen in quite a couple of years of eating out in indian restaurants around the globe.
 For the price, the food is acceptable. Special wishes were not handled, especially not that of having the food spicy / hot / authentic. What a pity. Yet, the service was anxious. The place had, as others noted before, much of the franchise charm of big M. Yet, the place was clean and nice. Comfortable and ample.
 All in all, this experience has not floored me in any way, but neither did I regret going there.",-1
4,"for a chain, this is pretty good.  we shared the veg thali (not the grand thali, just the regular one), chana dabalroti, and the dahi puri.  i loved the dahi puri.  the chana dabalroti had more bread than i expected, and i was hoping for more lotus root.  the thali was great, and i liked that we were able to pick the curry we wanted.  it came w/ 2 chapatis, so it was plenty of food for 2 of us.  to drink, i had a mango bellini.  yum!",1
5,"Masala Zone is the little sister of the stalwart Chutney Mary and Veeraswamy. Voted best value Indian in Soho by Timeout magazine, it's a fantastic Indian restaurant that has a great location, feels like a proper restaurant (to people like me who're usually on a budget anyway!) and doesn't break the bank.
 Masala Zone is built in a split level kind of way and has a lot of room - but it is so popular, you may have to wait a few minutes before you get a table, especially if you visit on Friday or Saturday night. I don't think it is possible to book ahead. The decor is nice and uncluttered with none of the kitsch that afflicts most Indian restaurants. The kitchen is located behind a glass panel and you can watch the chefs put your food together from the dining room. The service is polite and friendly and very quick.
 The food is essentially North Indian with a lot of curry and rice combinations. The chilli factor is clearly indicated and quite accurate. Try the double chilli options only if you really like spicy food! They also have a nice Indian drinks section, with the yoghurt based lassi being the thickest, creamiest lassi I've had in this country. Nimbu pani is the Indian lemonade and they also do a mean masala chai among other things. They have a liquor licence so you can also order from a selection of wines, beers, and a limited selection of cocktails. Everything I've eaten here has been good but among the starters a special mention goes to the seekh kabab which just melts in your mouth. The curries are all good; I haven't tried the noodle pots but if they really are the Indian version of Chinese (which is NOTHING like real Chinese!), then they should be worth a try.
 Their thalis seem to be very popular and are great value for money. Thalis are basically a full Indian meal served on a large metal plate (aka a thali). There are options in terms of the number of items you want and you can choose at least one of the items but in general a thali contains 2-3 vegetable curries, an optional non vegetarian curry, a poppadum, some rice, a lentil dish, and some sweet chutney. They also do a special ayurvedic thali for diabetics though I haven't tried this.
 In terms of prices, considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's located in Soho, it's very good value. My husband and I have stuffed ourselves for £55 for two people but we've also gone as a group of 4, and the bill has come to £68. It's possible to have a good meal and a drink there for under £15. So all in all, Masala Zone is great place to eat if you're in Central London.",1
5,"masala zone. 
i love you.
its funny. since ive moved here, about once a week i crave Indian food. some might argue that Masala Zone isnt that great, but for what it is, its pretty fantastic. its reliable, its fast, it tastes amazing. any questions?
it serves until 11, so my friends and i often meet here before a night out. only once has the service been bad - and that time it was a nightmare - but the management took care of part of our bill with out us even saying anything, just reading the looks of horror on our faces. and hey, ive been back again, so...
and their toilets are labeled ""Toilet Zone."" if thats not hilarious, i dont know what is....",1
4,"Very tasty and great atmosphere. All in all, I really enjoyed dinner here and would definitely recommend it. The thali dishes are excellent- little tasty bowls of curry, with veg dishes, popadoms and sauces. The wine was very drinkable and reasonably priced. The restaurant was clean, toilets clean etc. Staff were friendly, but did forget to bring the tap water we requested with our wine.
There is a variety of dishes available, so all tastes (and levels of spice!) should be catered for.",1
4,"I'll go along with the majority of other Qypers who rate this casual dining, Indian restaurant very favourably.
 This is new generation Indian dining, a whole different kettle of fish than the after pub type places that don't make any effort because the customers are all trolleyed.
 Well spiced food, meat eaters and veggies well catered for. Not to much oil and I would guess no artificial colourings used. They serve beer. Stainless steel thali style presentation. Well spaced, adequately comfortable tables and seating. Contemporary decor.
 Top marks, fully recommended.",1
5,"Was mega impressed by my meal there. I went with a small group on a fun night out. I was dubious at first and thought it looked like a standard chain serving bland food.
 How wrong was I?! Our very friendly and helpful waiter had us seated in no time and our order was taken equally promptly. The food was delicious and the portions weren't too big.
 We all had a great time and it set us up nicely for a good night",1
3,"I am not an Indian food expert (although I eat it quite a bit in the US).  I had reservations about this being a chain, but the food was - my butter chicken (aka tikka masala, aka whatever) was good, and the accompanying side dishes in the Thalis were good.",-1
5,"Not only am I the worlds number one curry fan, but im the worlds number one curry critic, and given the slightest reason ill happily put to shame a curry if its not up to my standards. Once I even dared to complaine about a korma I had ordered in Goa, as I found it sour tasting. The chef was not impressed and I got the feeling I wouldn't be welcomed back
 The Masala Zone in Soho leaves me without complaint, and no matter how hard I try to find fault, I'm always left hushed. Every dish on the menu is mouth watering, the starters are gorgeous and the mains are divine. If your lucky enough to have any room in your tummy left then indulge in an Indian desert of coconut ice cream, probably the nicest thing to come out of Asia since silk.
 A meal for two with drinks shouldn't set you back more then 30 pound.",1
5,One of the things we wanted to try when we visited the UK was Indian food.  Masala Zone did not disappoint!  It was some of the best food we had on our European vacay.  Everything on our thali plate was delectable!  It was a great dining experience and a nice way to end our trip.,1
3,Nice restaurant deco....except the day I visited the air-con wasn't working and it was extrememly hot.  I had the lam and the mint apple juice.  I love the apple juice.  The food was decent and has a nice selection of sides.  This places emphasis is on vegetables.  Decent food but average for Indian food.,-1
5,very tasty food. price is also good compared to the portion size. nice staff and atmosphere. i'll going to this place again!,1
4,This is modernized Indian food at its best. Clean restaurant with more mainstream type décor. It can get quite busy on weekends but the service is quick so that's usually not a major issue once you get a table. The staff are friendly and sincere and food was delicious. The menu is extensive and the vegetarian options are excellent. Highly recommended.,1
2,"It was one unfortunate evening when the restaurant we had planned to go for dinner was not what we expected, and without a table reservation we ended up wandering along the streets of Soho with no luck of finding a restaurant with table  for six persons. Masala Zone was the only one welcoming us, and hungry and thirsty we were just glad to get into a any place.
The impression I got from the restaurant is that they offer fast food with Indian influence. My dish was actually very extraordinary mix of potato and banana (yes!) in a curry sauce and not bad at all. Creative at least! My friends experiences varied, but overall the food was ok. It was the service that gave us the empty feeling. 
The waitresses were really fast, and little too effective, and gave us this in-and-out fast food restaurant feeling. You know as soon as you lie your fork and knife on the empty plate, it vanishes! We felt like we were pushed out as by that time there was already queue to this restaurant as well but that just left us a bit disappointed by the experience.",-1
3,"Good quality curry house that also opens on Sunday nights, unlike a lot of Soho restaurants. My girlfriend loves the thali, but I have one big problem with the place: they don't like people with nut allergies. Mention that you have a nut allergy in here and they present you with a bright yellow card informing you that if you eat one of their dishes and they happen to have chucked a brazil nut in it, then it's your own fault if you end up dead. Ask for the nut-free menu and you get a list that's barely one-eighth of the full menu. Is it too much to ask to eat something other than lamb rogan josh? Apart from that, the restaurant is both clean and speedy.",-1
2,"I didn't find this to be an enjoyable experience overall. The time I went it was noisey, a bit too noisey and I couldn't hear the waiter properly but he didn't seem much interested either. The food seemed to be favouring heat rather than flavour and we both felt disappointed especially as it came on a good recommendation. I would have to agree with another poster here it did have a McMasala feel to it. Not somewhere I would go again as I prefer somewhere with a more intimate feel.",-1
3,"I'm a real freak of indian food. I literally cook indian every week once or twice. For that reason I believe i'm hard to please.
I have heard these people has something to do with Camelia Panjabi, an indian cook living in London. I bought her book and I thought the recipes were rubbish. The same book they promote for the web. Irrelevant? let's talk about the restaurant then.
Masala zone looks like of the interior decorator of Macdonalds came to advice them. It's indian and so cliche that feels really unnatural. You could feel the chainish effect in the waiting system, in their uniforms.then10 minutes for a Masala coke, which is great, but 3poundsand gosh, is just lemon juice, mint and coriander (i reckon) with coke.
food? I do better butter chicken. Roghan josh was of sorts, so was naan. service was unhelpful.
With so many indian restaurants In london i certainly can't see the point in McMasala, Try little restaurants in esta London. they always deliver",-1

4,"When it comes to Chinese and Indian Food - I never compromise and go for some doggy eatery. I was a little unsure when my mate at work told me about Masala Zone as I thought it would be another restaurant that serves unauthentic indian cuisine. I was so wrong. It's the best indian food is found in people's homes, in india. The menus present an exciting combination of flavours and offerings. we have something for everyone- freshly prepared. The quality of ingredients, the presentation and quality are not compromised by the price level. Meal for 2 person, without alcohol comes to about £15 per person. Value for money.",1
4,"This is the latest restaurant from the owners of Chutney Mary. It is an extremely delightful place just off oxford circus. The Decor is very homely with very original wallpaper designs. The red colours make it feel extremely warm. It offers all the most favourite indian dishes though the best bet is the indian Thali. This is especially good for those of us who can't decide as it offers a bit of everything in small bowls. Okra, Chicken, Fish, dahl and rice all in one big combo dish. THey serve Kiran beer at a reasonable price and the waiters are extremely friendly and helpful.",1
1,"A definite no no. 
A while back I don't doubt that the quality of the food was good but the freshness of the food is somewhat questionable, probably due to the fact that the restaurant was pretty much deserted.
On entering we had to wait in the entrance for 15 minutes (timed - no exaggeration) before being seated. Fine. Bad service doesn't particularly bother me - if the food is good, I couldn't care less.
My friends and I ordered vegetarian thalis. On reading the terrible reviews before my visit I had braced myself for the worst, but it was worse than I could imagine. The starters were okay albeit overpriced but as they were cold starters it was bearable.
The thali was the worst indian food I was ever tasted.
The poppadums within 1 minute had become soggy and there was no liquid on my plate but they tasted stale and were not crisp in the slightest, instead they had the texture of wet cardboard. The curries were COLD and I don't mean tepid, I mean COLD! They were completely lacking spice which is fine, I don't particularly want to eat food which has me running around screaming for water, but there was absolutely no flavour. So I had been presented with poor service, stale poppadoms, old cold tastless curries and at a price which is certainly not unbeatable!!
Don't make the mistake I did in just taking a chance, because I can assure you it will not pay off!",-1
4,"the service of this restraunt should be one factor why i would like to go here again. the clientle of this restraunt indicated to me that its a well known place, the prices are competitve in some cases but the prices for the rice dishes to me seemed on the higher end marginally but was not a cause of concern, i ordered a vindaloo curry, it was nicely finished, i also had the makhni curry which is worth mentioning, i topped this out with a mango lassi and scoop of choc ice cream for dessert, all in all was good experience. what i must say abt d decor is dat it is a little bold but dat depends whether u like it or not as dey say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.
 abt me i did like it :) ...
c for urself and comment back if you found this review useful.",1
5,"This place is awesome - to deliver food of this quality, variety, and genuineness at moderate prices is quite an achievement. Plus they manage to combine it with smiley staff, and a funky decor. I cme twice a week, and it is prettyu consistent, a few minor points apart. The street food, and the thalis are particularly fab.",1
