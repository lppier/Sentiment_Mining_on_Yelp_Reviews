3,"Food - 4.5 stars however all other ratings considerations drove my rating lower. So here's the scoop:
Food: wow - excellent meal.  I started with the vegetarian hot and sour soup. It was probably the best I have had - lots of flavor and no flavorless dollops of tofu. I had the Three Style Mushroom Stir fry. Normally, I would not select a mushroom only dish although I am a huge fungus fan - largely because I usually find the dishes to be uninteresting but I was intrigued given other menu selections and the restaurant's reputation. It was a good decision - the mushrooms were amazingly flavorful with just the right sauce. My date selected the dim sun option as an appetizer and the stir fry peking duck. Both were very good. Ordering brown rice as an accompaniment must not be common as instead of a substitution for white rice, I got a huge bowl of it and it cost an additional 8 pounds. 
And here was the downside:
Service: ...was uneven, and not just a little uneven. We had good service at the bar where service was efficient. I was especially impressed with the well chilled glass in which my date's vodka martini was delivered - perfect!  However service went downhill once we were seated. We dined downstairs. It appeared that the waitstaff was assigned to a section and our waitress was challenged with keeping up with orchestrating the meal. She would disappear for a while and appear at times when we weren't ready. The addition of a second person to take our drink order was poorly coordinated and he did not seem to be very interested in his job nor in our requests. He wasn't interested in explaining the wine list; he plunked our drinks down as if he couldn't wait to leave. We waited an inordinate amount of time to get our bill as well. 
In addition, the wine list was terrible! It wasn't organized by varietal nor region, nor even flavor profiles. Instead, it was a weird mix of selections under topics such as ""Classics: Fine Wines with History"" (most wines have history and nobody offered to provide the history nor was it explained in the list), ""Vielles Vignes: old vines"" (NOT all French and old vines is an undefined designation) and ""Purity: the expression of the fruit"" (huh?!). I love my wine and I love to peruse a good wine list.  The Hakkasan wine list was just painful and its organization made it impossible to make a selection.  It was so poorly organized that we gave up on finding something and ordered cocktails.
Prices were really high. I could chalk this up to it being London and London prices but the prices were over the top.
Before leaving, I stopped at the bathroom and met another American while washing my hands.  We looked at each other and almost simultaneously said ""Weird"".",-1
4,"Come here for the food!! Amazing authentic Indian food - service and cocktails were not the highlights. We arrived slightly early and headed to the bar. My boyfriend got a Dishoom IPA which was delish - I ordered a bellini cocktail which was crazily sweet.
We were led to our table on the outside patio (fully enclosed - except for the sliding doors which weren't working properly on this particular night = winter cold draft). 
Service was slow - and my boyfriends glass of wine was served with a massive crusty food fingerprint smudge. Dishes we ordered were forgotten on both our table and the table next to us - the servers had to be reminded and finally came out at the end of our meal. 
That said, the food itself was AMAZING!!!
- Black dal - Traditional style, smooth and delicious. Watch out for all the butter in this bad boy!
- Lamb Raan - My boyfriend lived in India for two years and LOVES this dish - the most amazing succulent, slow marinated and tandoor cooked leg of lamb. It falls off the bone!
- Chicken ruby - Classic English style curry.
- Chicken Tikka skewer - Succulent chunks of chicken perfectly cooked in the tandoor
- Rumali roti - Thin bread that unfolds like a giant napkin - much less filling than naan.
- Garlic naan - The classic for dipping into a curry
There are three locations in London, but the Shoreditch one seems to be the most popular. This is a must visit for Indian food lovers.",1
4,Ignore Michelin - not cos they're wrong about this place but becasue Hakkasan isnt that type of place. It merits a Michelin star but that's not the thing you should focus on. It's actually fairly unpretentious and certainly not stuffy. the best thing to go for is the Dim Sum at lunch. There's a way to do it where you can only pay around £15 a head - just steer clear of the mineral water it's massively expensive. the best dishes to try are the Venison pork puff and all the cheung fun are pretty good. The service is always utterly charming without being OTT. I find the desserts a bit disappointing but overall I would say this is better than Hakkasan.,1
4,"Tasty breakfast with an Indian twist! Make sure you book, I would give it five stars but the staff weren't overly helpful!",1
5,"Delicious food, great atmosphere and very professional staff.  The dim sum is ridiculously good...  Highly recommended.",1
3,"Very high end Indian 'Nouvelle Cuisine' with small portions, sophisticated presentation. It's a far cry from 'regular' indian restaurants and the prices are, well..., high
The food was good, no doubts, but nothing exceptional either
Great service, very nice space in a library, just a little too stuffy for my taste, but some people may like it. Not a huge fan of the location either, behind Westminster Abbey, not much around...",-1
4,"Bone daddies one of the top ramen place in London?
Yes, I dare say. I still have a slight preference for Ippudo but Bone daddies is a close second plus it had more interesting choices in ramen combination.
We started with snacks: chicken wings which were simply yummy the right amount of sweet and spicy with a bit of a crunch.
Chashu pork and corn croquettes are abs fab a must order!!!! 
Now onto the ramen:
My friend went for the Prince of darkness. They warn you the it is f***ing spicy and it is. It s the kind of spice that creeps up on you (meaning its progressive) 
I went for the IP tonkotsu with an egg and it was just greatly balanced. The 20hours pork broth is just perfect but for me the noodles were a bit too large and too cooked but that s a personal choice. I like my ramen thin and al dente. Other than that the whole was just delish 
for the drinks we had the asahi cream head and the watermelon crush. Beer is beer obs but the watermelon crush was just the right amount of sourness and freshness I loved it, it goes perfectly with my dish as it was a little bit spicy so they married well.
Overall there is no doubt Bone daddies is one of the best places to get ramen in London!!!!",1
5,Superb ramen.. Nicely priced too. That was a great stop on my travels.,1
3,Food was good but not amazing. Very hot day and the air conditioner had stopped working at 6 we arrived around 8:30 and it was to hot to relax. Water was needed to stop you from passing out and the staff were more than happy and to charge for the bottle of water even though the air conditioning was off. The bar below is amazing and will return to the bar. My suggestion is go on a cold day,-1
4,"Ok I can't fault this restaurant other than their too-hilarious-to-be-mad-at-them shoddy service. 
Luckily I was armed with the knowledge of very low expectations over the service and the expectation of being very disappointed, that I thought nothing would surprise me but boy, I so wasn't ready for this lol!  
When we first arrived I scanned the room and took in the working class Chinese man's cafe tables, and thought okay... not complaining. I'm only here for the food! and then I looked over at the gaggle of staff hanging around the bar and then one stuck two fingers at me lazily (basically indicating a table for two) and I said yes and then he waved us off in the direction of the stairs. He didn't escort us upstairs nor did he come to the front to greet us. It felt very self service, almost empowering :D 
We then helped ourselves to the best table of 4 after realising there weren't a table for 2 around but the waitress hurriedly ushered us to a 'table for two' which we later realised was a shared table with another two customers!!!?? I tried to protest but in vain as the waitress was having none of it. Honestly, the whole concept of customers are always right and you must prioritise customer's needs before anything else are completely foreign to these people. 
The other two customers were as surprised as we were but later whispered that at least we all got into the exclusive dining area normally reserved for Chinese folks and as a Chinese myself, I got my non asian friend a free pass to the exclusive club which had linen covered tables with comfy enough seats compared to the greasy cheap looking mish mash of tables and chairs downstairs.
We were so fortunate that our fellow neighbours were such cool peeps and abit like the shared benches in Wagamama, we were like 'can you pass the soya sauce please?' etc. I mean I totally would've shared their food too (if they'd let me). Totally. Love the fact that Wong Kei forces us to interact with complete strangers. Such a unique perk. Also they know the issues with London's first world problems in their lack of communication with one another and has set itself on a mission to break these barriers. ;-) So admirable!
Our neighbours even helpfully smacked down some annoying flies and wiped it off the table for us. :') The flies acted as a bonus decoration ;-) The authenticity in this restaurant to the Far East is so in tune. You want abit of China? Go to Wong Kei!!  
If a food restaurant other than your typical Mcdonald's and Burger King, offers a drive through speedy service then this is it! The whole service was comparable to a factory conveyer belt. Time is precious and every second counts despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty with ample amounts of unoccupied tables and chairs scattered across the floor. Compared to your typical Chinatown establishment, this one takes the prawn cracker! As soon as we were seated and handed our menus, a waitress hovered above waiting to take our order (like less than a minute after we sat down). When I asked her to come back in a few minutes, the look on her face was utter shock. Truly funny to see. Honestly our table was wicked. We interacted with our neighbours and made such jokes that the same waitress came back looking horrified with nose flaring, that we were enjoying ourselves lol. 
Now onto the food. This is what I came for. Prices have gone up ever so slightly since well, the last recorded menu prices online) but still remain ahead of competition in terms of value, portion and quality. We had hearty meals of won ton noodle soup which was laden with won ton dumplings that when I finally demolished those meat parcels, I was actually surprised to see noodles underneath it! For a fiver, it truly was the epitome of eastern comfort food like bangers and mash is to English folks. For the side, we opted for bean curd with chilli and salt. I would totally recommend it to anyone because once you try it, you can't stop! Might need some water at hand because they don't use that msg sparingly!! 
Service is quick. You're in and out of there like fast food. In fact so quick you needn't worry about time. What they lack in service they more than abundantly made up for in quality and quantity of food.
Question of whether you're genuinely welcomed sits in the balance. Service charge is optional (thank goodness!!) and the waitress counted the money at our table (quite insecurely) after hovering nearby for a while whilst we emptied coins from our purses lol! Not to forget that the tea is freeeeee!  
Coming here is an experience onto itself like a ghost ride in a theme park. You love to hate it. All in all, I'd definitely be coming back here in a rush!",1
1,"Having lived in Shanghai and visited many Chinatowns in cities around the world...Dumplings here were average at best.  They lacked the differentiating flavor one expects when you take your first bite.  Bland fillings wrapped in a dumpling.  It took 25+ minutes for 3 of 4 of the items I order to arrive at my table.  Worse, they brought me a check before the fourth item I ordered arrived.  Good concept, but poorly executed.  Dumplings were temperature hot.",-1
4,"Ah the legendary Wong Kei!
This place has been a firm favourite for myself and my friends for the past 6 years (possibly more!). The free green tea, people-watching opportunities and rock-bottom meal prices have incentivised us to return year after year, despite the occasional cheeky comment and disturbing rumours of the chiefs doing a circle spit into the dishes of punters they dislike (seriously wish I'd never been told that story!).
When times are good I order the Chicken with Cashew Nuts and a side of Egg-Fried Rice. When times are not so good I order the 3 Cold Barbecue Meats on Hot Rice. I have never not cleaned my plate. Myself and my best friend usually, in addition, order the Mixed Hors d'oeuvres. And proceed to argue over who gets that last succulent teaspoon of seaweed when the rest of the savoury treats are devoured. And we do this every. Goddamn. Time
The restaurant staff have certainly gotten a lot politer since 2014's change in management. Which many punters are sad about, given that Wong Kei's former reputation as a 'legendary' rude restaurant. Not me, however. The times I've been back since I've enjoyed more than ever. Customer service goes a long way with me.
My only big gripe with Wong Kei (and this is sadly perennial) is that I always seem to suffer from an upset stomach the rest of the night and the next day...",1
2,"**SPOILER ALERT** I'm going to rain on this parade.
I spent a miserably cold and wet Saturday in a 9-5 exam class in the City.  To lift the spirits, I dragged my boyfriend to Bone Daddies for an early supper on the way home.  I suspect I was in the queue mentioned by the first reviewer (I overheard him talking about Cocoro!)
We ordered chicken karaage, yellowtail sashimi and edamame to start.  As mentioned in a previous review, the karaage was not crispy and I, too, believe that it may have been preperared and reheated.  The flavour was correct but overall it was disappointing -- afterall, what is fried chicken without its crispy shell?  The yellowtail sashimi was also nothing special: fish slices drenched in a non-descript soy-based dressing and sprinkled with coriander leaves.
One portion of tonkotsu ramen, one portion of chicken tantanmen ramen.  Both came out barely warm which makes clear how these dishes are prepared.  
Method: 
1. Put stone-cold ramen noodles into bowl
2. Ladle broth over noodles
3. Top with more stone-cold (pre-prepared) ingredients: split soft-boiled soy-braised egg, meat (char siu slices in case of tonkotsu, minced chicken in case of tantanmen), soy-braised bamboo shoots, beansprouts and wakame
4. Serve
Bone Daddies, this doesn't work.  Basic formula: cold ingredients + soup that is not hot enough = lukewarm noodle soup dish.  Any Asian will tell you that prior to constructing any noodle soup dish the noodles must be dunked into a vat of boiling stock or water.  This heats up the noodles which then ensures that the noodle dish is hot.  Or, failing that, just ensure that your broth is nuclear hot.
This all detracted from what could've been two very flavourful broths.  Unfortunately, we couldn't tell (although I think the tonkotsu had potential): heat brings out flavour, remember.
I had high hopes for this place but, like in any good ol' black and white love story, slipped out of the joint into the damp night with a heavy heart.",-1
3,"This is an old school fast food Chinese restaurant the kind that used to line the streets of America's Chinatowns.  It is a tremendous bargain, and very reliable.  I am not a fan of the crispier duck dishes served in London.  I prefer the more succulent versions.  We had a shrimp cashew, a vegetable dish, and a pupu platrrer appetizer on the fixed menu.  I enjoyed the shrimp dish the most.  If you love no frills restaiurants this place will do!",-1
3,"Cheap & cheerful, if you're in a rush this place is ideal, super efficient service. Downstairs is good for single diners & upstairs you either share a table or get your own if in a larger party. 
Dishes can be hit & miss, but you can't really complain when they are about  5GBP per dish.
What happened to the rudeness, they've got more polite over the years!",-1
2,"Big fan of ramen and was looking forward to digging into a bowl of hot broth when we arrived. We ordered the fried chicken along with two bowls of ramen (T22 and miso). When I get a bowl of ramen I expect the soup to be steaming hot. Unfortunately, the soup was just warm so marks off for that. The miso one had way too much miso which overpowered the chicken bone soup and made it too salty. 
Last but not least, we found the fried chicken was served raw and this was after we ate most of it.  After inspecting, manager was very apologetic and tried to blame it on the fact that they use corn-fed chicken which didn't make sense to me. However, the meal was on the house which was a nice gesture. Anything less and I would have given a one star review. We were very worried after the meal but thankfully didn't get food poisoning! Will probably not be going here again.",-1
4,"Deserves its awards. One of the best Chinese restaurants in the Capital. In the cool and expensive category, at least. I went with Chinese friends from Beijing who thought that the food was very good. Believe me, they are hardly ever complimentary about Chinese food in the UK! The beefs? Well, the teas are seriously good but at £5 for a small pot they're a bit of a rip off. And the seats. Oh, the agonising kiddy height seats cunningly combined with the massive support under the table that keeps your feet folded under you. I am really short at 5'7"" and I got cramp. STILL ... I would eat there every week if I could afford it. The decor is really uber chic and the take away sweties and tea counters are good.It is not that expensive to lunch off dim sum and they are seriously good.",1
4,"This is a top place, at a price. The food is excellent and portions are bigger than you might expect, so order small and add if you need it.
Arguably a little dark and claustrophobic, but you could say that's the atmoshere. They like to serve you quickly, to keep the tables turning over.",1
4,"Came here during my first night in London. Got there and was told the wait for 2 people would be 1hr+, but my coworker said they're usually faster than the estimate so we went inside and got drinks. While we were in line to check in, a waitress came by holding free samples of sherry, chai, and champagne - how delightful! 
By the time we got a spot at the bar and ordered/received our drinks, we were called to our table. We got a chance to through the menu while we were waiting at the bar so we knew what we wanted to order when we got seated. This has to be the favorite place I ate at during my short trip in London. 
We ordered a variety of things: the lamb chops (my fave!), chicken curry, garlic naan, corn on the cob, a salad, and some other vegetable dish.  Our waitress was great - she was super friendly and gave us recommendations. Everything was delicious! I would definitely come back to try other menu items. They also have free wifi (for those traveling with no cell service like me).",1
5,"I'm no expert in Indian food but this was AMAZING. We got:
- vegetable samosas (5/5)
- pau bhaji (5/5)
- chicken ruby (5/5)
- chilli malai pomelo (5/5)
- dishoom chicken tikka roll (4/5) - not a very shareable plate as the rest of them, and I wish they had told us - I also feel it's a lackluster dish compared to the many other better options
- house black daal
- lamb boti kabab (5/5) - they managed to make a 'dry' dish still delicious and flavourful
- gunpowder potatoes (5/5)
- side of basmati rice & garlic naan (5/5)
We also got chaijitos and the viceroy's old-fashioned, both expertly crafted cocktails.
I would highly recommend going to this place! We sat on the veranda and it was very cosy, with great food and great service.",1
5,every dish was seasoned and executed just right; very small restaurant with small rooms,1
3,"Hearing reviews that this place was known for their duck, we made a specific trip to Chinatown to experience it for ourselves. Unfortunately, it felt like another restaurant at any Chinatown where the food was bland and just average.
Our main dishes were the Roast Pork/Pork Belly, BBQ Pork, Roast duck. All the food was served at room temperature. We had some greens but nothing spectacular or memorable.
Maybe it is a London Chinatown practice, we were shocked to be charged GBP 2.5 for a bowl of rice. Given we ordered 5 entrees, we assumed that we would get a bowl per entree and were disappointed when our bill arrived.",-1
5,"This is a fantastic restaurant and bar which offers great meal and drink options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
It is the ""go-to"" please for Indian in East London but make sure you get there early in the evening to get a table as it's super busy and popular most nights of the week!",1
5,"We planned on eating here to get our London-Indian fill before we even left for our trip. When we arrived to the location, we found a line way out the door and the doorman said the wait to get inside was about an hour and a half and the wait once you were inside was another half hour. My husband looked at me like I was clinically insane when I said we would wait. But we did wait and it did take about 2 hours to get sat down at a table. I tried to order a little too much because we were so hungry at that point, and the waitress reined me back in. When we finally got that food, the wait was all worth it. Best Indian EVER. We got chicken ruby, tikka paneer, and lamb raan bun with naans and rice and holy moly we raved about it the entire trip. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Wait for it, it's worth it.",1
3,"I agree with another reviewer that this is a great restaurant for socializing, but the food can go either way.  I arrived as part of a group of five, and we sat downstairs around a (too large) round table with benches.  It was a work-meeting at lunchtime, so non-alcoholic, and I had a delicious lemongrass-flavored iced tea. The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, but the ordering and delivery of food was confusing, in part because it is all small dishes, and in a group it was difficult to figure out how much to order and sharing some of the dishes proved awkward.  Some of the deep fried stuff was great, but some of the others - meh.  Also, the bill escalated quickly, as all these little dishes add up very quickly.  I would suggest this as a place to go with one or two others who like to share, but it was not great for a larger group.",-1
1,"The staff mixed up our booking. 
We arrived before booked time and were told our table was given to someone else because they thought we booked for an hour earlier. I even showed them the email confirming the actual booking on my phone. No apologies, nothing. 
We were treated better in a sushi place. 
Very poor service. Not recommended.",-1
5,"I guess in the end it all comes down to one questions, does the hype match the results? And in this case I'm happy to say it did! Like many people in London Ive heard about Dishoom over and over and over it was going to make my ears bleed.
The wait wasn't crazy, we waited about an hour and a half for a table, and this lovely little chica came along with some sherry for while i was waiting in the queue, in the little chai cups reminiscent of my time in India. Not only this but I had a cocktail that really brought me back, using a reduction of thumbs up! I was so impressed i raved at the bartender about it for 20 mins and that made the time go fast. I really tasted the thunder in that beautifully put together drink.
Finally the atmosphere was electric and the décor was perfectly in tune with the Parsi Cafe vibe that Dishoom tried to set, now i was worried about food, living in Mumbai for 4 years of my life, meant i had tried some of the best and most authentic Parsi delights the world has to offer, but Dishoom played it off in style, i loved the beautiful simplicity of the dishes while really hitting home those flavours, everything was delicious and the service just as expected. 
Definitely will be visiting again!
Peace & Love",1
4,The food here is no doubt good and worth the wait. The waiters are known to be rather rude but they've improved since the last I visited in December. The noodle and rice dishes are aromatic and tasty and you don't have to wait long to get a table!,1
5,"Bacon and egg naan and bottomless chai for breakfast?? Erm, YES please. Amazing. The food was so good we actually asked for the menu back to order more (but filled up on chai instead). 
I have tried to come here on an evening but the queue is just too long for me...I get hangry pretty quickly. So breakfast seemed like a great solution: no queue, calm and relaxing, and bacon and egg in a naan. 
I will definitely be coming back (probably armed with snacks to keep my hanger at bay while I wait in the queue for a table) so I can try their dinner menu!",1
5,"Fantastic Indian food!  The dahl was amazing, the naan hot, the flavors terrific.  I came with a friend we shared about six different small plates, each one better than the next. There was a line to get in, it was worth waiting for. 
 Our waiter was helpful in deciding what we should order and the drink menu was terrific as well.
Will return!!!",1
2,Im still looking for any sort of flavor in the vegetarian ramen (am i asking for the moon?!),-1
4,"A really great chinese. the food is super cheap, but that doesn't mean it's low in qualityquite the opposite in fact! You can get all our favourites on the menu, and the waiters are really entertaining too.",1
3,"It's kinda sad if this is the best ramen that London has to offer. I got their classic Tonkotsu X which was very very plain. The noodles were too thin and the broth didn't quite any punch. I should've ordered an egg to go with it, but the side black garlic sauce was a good choice.",-1
4,"Very good Indian place: clean, close-enough-to-authentic, and you don't walk out smelling like you've been sitting in a kitchen all day (especially if you're wearing a sweater that day). Chai is good, but pricey. And their wifi is called ChaiFi (super clever name, but didn't work that well when we went).",1
4,"I had no idea that this was a chain (you'll see my other experiences with London chains soon - ugh) when my Aussie pal brought me here fo cocktails and endless rounds of dim sum. Being from Vancouver, where Chinese food is practically the local cuisine, I have high standards for my dim sum, and I (mostly) wasn't disappointed!
The decor and menu were interesting, and we ordered round after round of the yummy dim sum - 10 orders and prawn chips between 3 of us. 
Favourites included the crispy prawn balls (we ordered a second round of these) and the shu mai. The crab spring roll, shrimp har gow and prawn and shitake dumplings were also delicious. 
For me, the only miss was the veggie steambuns- wayyyy too sweet for my taste.
The cocktail list was fresh and inventive - I tried a fennel and apple martini, a basil, lemon and black pepper martini and a vanilla vodka lemonade that tasted like Lucky Charms. Yum! Just one question - when we order mixed fancy fruity cocktails here in Vancouver, they are generally made with 2 ounces of liquor, but I am sure that these were just made with one. I noticed this a few other places in London - is this standard?
The service really petered off by the end of the night - in order to make this a five star experience the wait staff really needs to keep the standards high thoughout the whole night. 
On the whole, give it a try!",1
1,"Markedly unprofessional behaviour by front of house staff on a Tuesday afternoon. Rude, dismissive, and unwilling to answer simple questions regarding wait times and availability. I will not be returning.",-1
2,"preparation//
my friend and i decided to check out this restaurant because of its honorable mention in my 1001 destinations book
tucked away in an alley...almost like an exclusive member's only entrance
so if it's your first time, be sure you have a smartphone so you can find this place easily
my friend and i walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately! yay!
ambiance//*****
wow how luxurious!  from the members' only entrance to the foyer and then into the dining area
there's a sort of quiet elegance to the place...*think* lawry's where you're surrounded by other tables, yet given privacy to engage in your own conversation
service//****
we were seated immediately after a long day of running around and catching a musical so this was a welcome end
we had a fairly attentive server that made recommendations and periodically checked with us on the refill of our drinks
food//**
they had interesting fusion dishes
i'm not sure if it was because of the overwhelmingly high expectations for yummy indian food, but i've had equally good indian cuisine in asia for a much more affordable price especially when the portions are considered
~*~
as far as upscale indian dining experiences go, this is probably as good as it gets! however, as a foodie, and price vs. taste...i'd consider this a bit out of a splurge!",-1
3,"I don't get the hype. Their signature tonkotsu ramen with 20 hour pork bone broth is, IMO misguided. It's thick from the long stewing, almost a gravy, but to my taste buds lacking in the right flavor. I'd much rather have a thinner broth with more taste. I've gone several times to confirm and I have - the ramen is just not that tasty. It's OK. Nothing special.
I'd give it fewer stars except I do think the appetizers are quite good, especially the yellowtail sashimi, fried chicken, and soft shell crab. If only the ramen were as good as the appetizers.",-1
5,"You're not going to find many Michelin starred Chinese food restaurant, and Hakkasan is one of them (in fact, I think Alan Yau's other creation, Yautcha is the only other Michelin starred Chinese restaurant). And it doesn't disappoint: A trendy, dark lit setting, with comfortable seating, plus good food and service.
 Starting off, we ordered dim sum (prawn har gau anyone?), which was good, but not spectacular. For mains, among the dishes we ordered included the roast chicken in satay sauce (which was good) and the sauteed roast duck (which was brilliant).
 The friends I took were non-alcoholic, so we abstained from the strong selection of wines and cocktails (though there were non-alcoholic cocktails). The only obvious downside is the price.",1
5,"BEST.BRUNCH.EVER.
Beaut location and it just looks and smells nice.
And it's rather cheap! 
I've now been here a few times and every time I'm so happy.
I always have the naan with bacon, eggs and chilli jam, but I've tried a few things from their lunch menu and they're also scrumptious.
I mean, seriously, you all need to go.
But it gets booked up really quickly so bear that in mind ;)",1
4,"Dishoom for me is a go-to place more for the ambiance and the menu, which tries to encompass Mumbai food in a booklet.
I got pretty nostalgic looking at the menu, but promise is one thing and delivery another. The food is strictly okay. The over expectation probably added to the disappointment levels. I had the koliwada prawns, naan, chicken and vada pav. Nothing except the vada pav left me dazzled. 
This place does make you love it though. And for someone from Mumbai, it makes you very very nostalgic - the service is super quick, staff is very busy, there's Thums Up Float and Nimbu Paani on the menu, the decor bears some touches of an Irani restaurant. All remind you of home. I am particularly thankful to Dishoom, and I am not being dramatic here, for including Thums Up and Malabar Coffee to their menu *tears of joy*.
Should probably try their Irani food and breakfast spread next time. It's all about second chances.",1
3,"Came for dinner with a friend - plan was to eat around 8:30 PM on a Wednesday, but the line was insane, so we went to the pub around the corner, had a pint, came back and the line was gone. We were seated promptly and put in our orders. I was a little hesitant to go to this place as I like my steak a certain way (blue - as in, almost still alive) and it almost always disappoints in the UK (because a steak ordered blue in Britain often comes out as medium rare or even medium - ick! And British people get twitchy if you send food back in restaurants, so it really is rolling the dice). But my friend really wanted steak and this seemed like a good option in the neighborhood.
As others have noted, there are no menu choices - only desired level of doneness for steak. I ordered mine blue. We also got the house Bordeaux, which paired nicely with the food. When the steak came out, it actually was blue! Success! But the plate was so ripping hot that it was starting to convert the beautiful bloody meat to a grey overcooked mess, so I had to be uncouth and evacuate it to the bread plate. The server gave me a ""wtf"" look and I tried to explain, but she didn't speak English, so they probably just thought I was a weirdo, but whatever. That's better than ending up with overcooked steak.
Overall, it was a reasonably good dinner, but for £24, I could make myself better steak frites. Nice atmosphere, though. I'd say it's worth it if you want a simple, pretty good meal, but it's definitely not worth waiting more than a few minutes. If the line is long, probably better to find someplace else.",-1
3,"Excellent service and okay food. Service was as expected for a Michelin starred restaurant. We went on a Monday for lunch and it was dead but I would assume it gets quite packed at night. The restaurant interior is very trendy with a large bar.
Duck salad was the stand-out dish with crispy duck pieces complemented by pomelo and grapefruit to lighten it up.The grilled Shanghai dumplings really just looked like run of the mill pot stickers or gyoza. The crispy duck rolls were loaded with duck but when eaten without the sauce they lacked flavor.

5,"Amazing find. Really is the most beautiful/romantic restaurant in the world. Try to sit in the conservatory if you can. Creative cocktails, great wine. Truffle parpadelle was amazing!",1
3,"I'd been dying to go here for weeks. Tonight all the stars aligned and I landed a table after only about a 10 minute wait. 
In truth, I was a bit disappointed- I expected soooo much more. I suspect that it was my own build up based on reviews than their actual shortcomings. All in all, the steak was good, fries were tasty, and the sauce was interesting... sadly, it was a long way from the best steak I've ever had and odds are, I'd try another steak house before going back...",-1
4,Favorite spot in Shoreditch. Especially great for lunch. The door can have a spotty maitre'd sometimes who doesn't seem to want your business (the only down star) but the food and waiters are absolutely exceptional. I could eat here every week!,1
4,"The agedashi tofu is one of the best I've had outside of Japan. The soyu ramen was also on point. However, please please PLEASE train your staff to know what ""togarashi"" is when I or anyone else asks for it. I speak pretty good Japanese, but asked for it in English multiple times. Only the Japanese member of staff knew what I was after and brought it. In Japan, it's on the table in every ramen shop I've been to. Consider putting it out to avoid this problem.",1
3,"Perhaps it's a case of the Yelp curse- a well-rated restaurant with reviews that set your expectations so high, even a great restaurant couldn't possibly live up to the hype- but I wasn't all that impressed. 
If you stumbled on this restaurant and had no idea what it was, you'd probably rate it 2 stars. Why? Let's see. After waiting outside (not terrible I must admit) you're rushed into a jam-packed restaurant, only to be sat at a table so close to the one next to it that it must be pulled all the way out before it's shoved back trapping you in the booth. Then you're met by a ""waitress"" who appears to be dressed for Halloween who asks only ""how do you want it cooked."" At this point you had better have figured out you're there for steak, or you're screwed. They then scribble your preference on a paper table cloth and are gone. Someone else comes by less than 30 seconds later, throws a forgettable salad down and disappears. Five minutes later a different waitress returns, tosses down a plate of steak smothered in watery green sauce and overcooked, soggy fries and is gone. Sure you get two servings, but I'd trade quality over quantity any day. 
In short:
Service? Non-existent, and my standards are low. 
Steak? I've had better off a George Foreman grill. 
Green sauce? Seemed a bit watery and rather flavorless given all the hype. This can't be the best London can do. 
Overall? Not terrible, but certainly not five stars. I thought the meal was ""good,"" but certainly not exceptional. 
Full disclosure: I lived in Texas for a few years, so maybe I'm biased, but I've had better steak at even upscale chain restaurants like Ruth's Chris, and better fries at Five Guys. Go for the experience, if you must, but set expectations accordingly.",-1
4,"Being from San Francisco, where I can get good, high quality dim sum anytime, anywhere, I would say that Yauatcha is up there. 
Stopped by here on my family's last day in London. Since we were in the chinatown/soho area, we figured we can try Lond's version of dim sum. After some yelping, I came across Yauatcha. Hearing that they have a Michelin star, I had high expectations when I visited. The restaurant was huge, having two floors and also a sweets/dessert station. My family and I sat downstairs. The restaurant was beautifully decorated that was modern with an asian twist. 
After looking over the menu, we ordered some cocktails and a few dishes. The dishes are small for a dim sum place but it was expected since this was more of a fancier take on dim sum. Everything that we ordered was delicious! Also the drinks were great. I the only thing was the price. I figured that the price reflected not the food but the owner and status of the restaurant. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is not from San Francisco.",1
4,"We ate at both branches Soho and City.  Both had amazing food.  I would give the City branch the win on service although both were good.
We ended up at the Soho branch after trying with out success to talk to anyone next door at Duck and Rice (I believe under the same ownership). Working on the principle of if you cannot say something nice do not say anything at all.
You can see how Yauatcha got its Michelin.  Amazing food served beautifully.  
The desserts were incredible maybe not very Asian but beautiful to the eyes and mouth 
Prices are a value but higher than you would pay for Dim Sim in NYC or Toronto",1
4,"Great service - fast paced environment but very welcoming.
Great for sharing and food is delicious! 
Lots of small plates so you can try loads of different things. 
Very busy - but always accommodating",1
4,"Good ramen!  
I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen, I thought it was nicely done.  I like a rich fatty broth, and they had it here at Bone Daddies.  
My friend ordered the TanTanMen but it was something like peanut or sesame ramen.  That was just OK - a bit too heavy and rich and nutty.  I think she's gonna stick with the standard ramen next time.
Sitting on the table was a jar of raw garlic, a garlic press, and a little jar of hair elastics - VERY useful for anyone with long hair!",1
3,"I went to Hakkasan once with my friend and her boss together with their clients. It is overall a great place with tasteful (but just a little too commercial for my liking) interior. Lighting was particularly bad on the table; we could not even read our menu properly.
 The food is great but not superb considering the amount that we paid. The roast duck with caviar was £150! The total bill came to about £1000 for eight of us. The service was fantastic but I can't help but wonder if it was because we were spending so much. I heard from friends that they were really stringent with the 2 hour slot that you get when you book the tables. However, we booked the table for 8.30pm and we stayed for the entire evening till about 12 midnight!
 On the whole, I would say that this is a restaurant with good food and designer interior. However, it is not a place that warrants all the talking and all the hype.",-1
4,"A great place to have quick meal at great prices. I ordered a plate of stir friend noodles and a chinese tea drink for under £5. This is a fantastic price in central london. However, do not expect restaurant like service and be prepared to share a table with some other people.",1
3,"Ok so many people have been hyping about this place I just had to give it a try. Unfortunately I really wasn't THAT blown away, it was good don't get me wrong however I won't be rushing back. But would definitely try it again, hoping that my first experience was just a bad-ish/average experience.",-1
5,"Every time I visit London this is my must have! The breakfast and dinner are both amazing and two completely separate menus.
Breakfast:
What's good
+ Sausage and Egg Naan Roll - what's not to love about this...sausage and a runny egg smeared with cream cheese and chutney wrapped in warm and delicious naan bread. 
+ House Chai - probably THE best chai I've had so far and you get free refills...yes please!
What's meh
- Big Bombay - nothing special here, it's pretty much a typical homestyle breakfast dish just with slightly different flavors. Wasn't wow'd by this dish at all
- Keema per Eedu - this is actually a super savory dish, but the pieces of chicken liver were a bit large and dominating for my taste. If you love chicken liver this is the dish for you.
I'm not going to talk too much in detail about dinner because almost everything we ordered was delicious like:
- House Black Daal
- Lamb chops
- Garlic naan
- Chicken ruby (any curry really)",1
3,"The name kind of grosses me out for some reason, but that's irrelevant. The ramen is pretty good but I found the soup slightly too salty for my liking. For what you get it is slightly too pricey in my opinion but the atmosphere is buzzing and it does pretty well at distracting you from the perpetual drizzly greyness.",-1
3,"My first china-town experience in London..... not bad, not great.... about in the middle.....  and especially since it's my first.  
Compared to Chinese in the states, this is pretty poor.... but at least these people looked chinese, and seemed to understand a bit of the chinese that my parents were speaking to them.
but hey... its nice once in a while having something that actually resembles chinese food... I don't know if mexicans feel the same way in california... shrug",-1
2,"I fail to understand why Yauatcha has a Michelin star. Food is good, though for the dim sum / cheong fun / shui mei, you can get equally tasty in chinatown. Service was not great: from the reception (no smiles), to the waiter (forgot to take our drinks order, interrupts table discussion to reach out for plates). Oh, and disposable wooden chopsticks? Really?
Like the rating says... Meh, I've experienced better.",-1
1,"I cannot speak for the food because I was kept waiting for a reservation I made. I arrived 15 minutes early and was told to wait 15 minutes. No problem. After waiting 30 minutes directly in front of the host, I felt that I had been mishandled badly enough. I told the same host that I wanted to cancel the reservation. He acted surprised and indicated that it was my fault that I did not just go downstairs at the time of the reservation. Flabbergasted!",-1
3,"I been there several times, that doesn't mean that restaurant is great. The price and taste were OK for me when I was a student. I couldn't remember too much things over there. I just remember that I have to eat with some strangers by the same table and the service was sucks, but I was OK with that. It is kind of unaccepted condition for me right know. Do I really grow up?",-1
4,"Love this restaurant, one of my favourites, and not even for the food! The atmosphere grows as the night does so what starts out as lounge type music, builds the vibe as it gets later. It is expensive, but the place is classy and sophisticated. Its obscure entrance, makes it even more exclusive from a ladies point of view, the toilets are extremely grand Drinks selection goes on for days. Always had great service when we come here too.",1
2,"For such a posh neighbourhood a very mediocre dining experience.
I'd been wanting to go to Nobu London for a while as I had tried it in other cities like Miami and found it to be a fashionable and trendy dining experience. Not so in London's Nobu. As a matter of fact it was disappointing from soup to nuts, from hello to goodbye.
We arrived, having a confirmed reservation, and well, I found the host a bit off putting and snooty, like he was quite bothered by having to work at all. That was the welcome but I was determined to put that behind us and enjoy the food. The dining room was very noisy and to be honest I can't say too much for the very plain decor which for having the upscale market clientele did not fit. The service too was very sub par. Our waitress really didn't know the menu and when asked questions had to go ask someone else and come back to relay the information, it all just felt 2nd rate. 
The food too was just OK. Some of our sushi rolls were very basic and uninteresting. Perhaps had we had a waitress who could have made suggestions it might have helped with our selections. We did know our sushi but it might have helped to have tried more of the house specials, that sort of thing. It was all just bland and unexciting. Not to mention the noise in the dining room made it very hard to converse at the table. I was quite ready to leave which is a shame because we were very much looking forward to dining there. 
To end the whole night out, a quick stop at the toilets resulted in a trek down a back staircase that felt like I was in the back of a nightclub. And the toilets themselves looked like they were from a nightclub. It really highlighted the fact that Nobu is way past its prime. We left looking for someplace else to have dessert.",-1
1,I do not recommend this place. it is very small and one the starters came I found three little hairs. they took the dish away and remove the hairs. Again I would not recommend.,-1
5,"Hmm...where should I start, probably with the calamari, shrimp, and some okra fries! Then a MUST is the flawless house black Daal which is hands down my personal FAVOURITE! My hubby loves the chicken ruby and all the grills are great! The Garlic Naan is also a must alongside the basmati rice! By far the best restaurant in London!",1
5,"You get what you pay for. This is fine dining and memorable. The staff was attentive. The wine choices beyond excellent. 
The food preparation and presentation were stunning and all very tasty. 
After a week of so-called ""hot"" London restaurants, this was a lovely way to end the trip on a high note. 
The tasting menus were perfect so don't cheat yourself out of the wine pairings. 
Our new romantic London destination.",1
3,"Firstly.... This is a beautiful restaurant,  a space that welcomes you on both levels,  the top floor has a shared eating area with a gorgeous sweets display,  featuring macarons,  layered deserts and chocolates.... Very impressive. 
Orchids are displayed through out,  Yauatcha has many interesting features and the beautiful fish tanks are used in away that compliments the decor. 
Sadly... The glory of Yauatcha stops there. The pricing of the food is fair but portion sizes are quite random. The service.... On this occasion.... Terrible... We waited 25 minutes before asking the manager (who caught the bewildered expression we had on our faces) for a drink as we hadn't seen our waiter since being seated. The manager was very attentive and made a true effort to correct our waiter who clearly was failing to service his section. We noticed tables around us were also waiting,  and recieving their meals in random orders and feeling.... Like us.... Abandoned.... 
Definitely unacceptable for a Michelin Star Restaurant. 
The food.... 
The food was good but not great, but I think the service had affected this side being appreciated like it should have been. As I said the food is fairly priced although some food items are heavily hiked for what you get. 
All in all I'm not sure if I should be so hard as to say we didn't enjoy ourselves. We appreciated the friendly attentive staff who ushered us to our table,  the trendy decor, the innovative ice teas on offer and the food was acceptable but it wasn't mind blowing. The table  service where we were seated needs work. If I go back I will adjust this review as the restaurant had a feel of being able to redeem itself.",-1
3,"Four Seasons not to be mistaken for the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel chain, unfortunately did not make four stars during my visit.
Luckily for us,  a table for two in the center of the main restaurant was available immediately for seating during dinner. (I consider this the best seats in the house) Perfect view and access for service and visibility.
Access to the restaurant is conveniently located near the main entrance gate to chinatown.
The restaurant is old, as expected. Not a place you want to take someone on for a first date and might be difficult for groups larger than a party of four.
The food was decent but we ordered the aromatic crispy duck instead of what we were craving for, the Roasted Peking Duck.
What was ordered:
Peking Set Meal A
106 Minimum For 2 Persons (2人以上) £20.50 per person
酸辣湯 Hot and Sour Soup ,, (uniquely added fishcake, tasty)
酥炸香酥鴨 Aromatic Crispy Duck (good enough for two as suggested)
乾炒牛肉絲 Deep Fried Crispy Shredded Beef with Chilli , (not authentic)
宮保肉丁 Diced ""Kong-Po"" Pork , (Can't taste the pork, too much batter)
清炒雜菜 Stir Fried Mixed Vegetables (Good)
蛋炒飯 Egg Fried Rice (Good)
Value is filling but I recommend you order from the a la carte section.
This is probably not my first choice to return but they do offer many selections for duck.
What you need to know:
- There are three locations, two in Chinatown 
- Tea is charged
- Three levels 
- Understand the cooking method of duck you want to eat: Roasted Cantonese BBQ style, Roasted Peking Duck or Aromatic Peking Crispy Duck 
- Take time to look through the menu before ordering",-1
3,Have been to Nobu in New York and Miami. Felt rushed here. Waiter made us feel rushed . If we mentioned a dish he would comment. I don't go often to Nobu but in the other places it was nice when the waiter took the time to offer suggestions when we weren't sure what to order. It was okay but the other restaurants have better atmosphere.   Place was packed though.,-1
4,"LOVE IT HERE! The BBQ duck is so delicious, wonton soup is fab as is the sizzling filet. Service is quick, not overly friendly but efficient. Queues get really long so we always go early. China Town can be overwhelming but you can't go wrong here!",1
3,Great service and very good value for money try the Vindaloo will be back for more Yummy,-1
3,"My friend and I went the other night 
I doubt we will be returning
Here is the experience beginning to end
Chiltern fireplace has always had a buzz about it attracted a nice crowd  and good food and drinks
I looked up the restaurants website on google hit call a posh sounding woman answered , I communicated that I wanted to book and she asked me to hold for a minute. 12 minutes later she said she could offer me a table at 8:30 in response to an 8 pm request  I accepted ( this was a month in advance for a Sunday night)
I confirmed the booking the day before by email no probs
On the day my friend was delayed by heavy traffic 
So I called and asked if it would be ok if we were 15 minutes late the woman who answered said ""that should be ok I will note the booking"" I wasn't sure where I stood but just assumed all would be ok.
We arrived 10 minutes late staff were cheery polite and receptive and showed us to a nice table
We both ordered salads a rib eye on bone steak to share a bottle of 2012 tignanello  420 pounds
Cesar salad nicely presented tasty but hard to eat as dish was a bit small ( fell over sides when you tried to eat it) steak was excellent and perfect one of the best I have ever had it was shared but when it came waiter hadn't cleared starter plates and tried to have us eat it on salad plates 
No bread served until requested (over 45 minutes)
I ordered chocolate desert bland too tart tasteless and texture less 
Sommelier was all show and no go  acted  trendy snooty etc but didn't know his game  served wine way to cold 17 degrees c good wine (240£)
Needs to be served at room temperature when challenged he was a bit disrespectful
When we were leaving we attempted to have a drink at the bar we were polite we were refused  I asked for the nice hostess who met us upon arrival and was told that she was doing her evening management report . instead  we were lead down a dark coloured passage to an alleyway  behind the restaurant where a nice burley guy managed to find us a cab after a 10 minute wait while we were waiting another ""uncool ""couple met the same fate
This was the second time this has happened on a quiet Sunday night I can't help but feel like I was trying to gain admission to studio 54 in the 80's
So here is my message to management : be careful this restaurant/hotel has been going for a while and is starting to come off the boil a bit Staff in general are well trained and polite there seems to be an over abundance of peacocky Italian types that are more show than go and a smidge arrogant 420 pounds is a lot for a steak and a bottle of Italian wine not everyone can pay that effortlessly  rather than let a pair of nice well dressed polite older guys have one drink after dinner  to choose to lead them down the basement tunnel of rejection is a bit off putting and demoralising and takes the edge off what would have otherwise been a fun evening
Getting too cool for school ...... maybe management is considering selling the place and is trying to hang on a little bit too long to the exclusive celebrity hype image . I don't know but if I am not good enough to have a drink at the bar I am not going to buy fine wine and posh chow in the restaurant
All the best for the future",-1
1,"The decor is super and our waiter was fabulous, however, when the starter came wrong and we complained the manger Jonathan arrived who had the wrong attitude. He was more keen to prove us wrong than correct the mistake. We booked a table for 5, a few weeks ago but were given a table for 4 with a seat in the passage for the 5th. Don't be excited to visit as they overbook and have arrogance.
I think once the popularity wears out this place will be a disaster as needs to pay attention to the customer.",-1
5,"Awesome. I hate the word but credit where credit is due. V Good food. V Good atmosphere.....and the cocktails....Take the Hakka cocktail - a fine  beverage- I dare you to drink 5 hakkas and make it out the door without wanting to be amorous with the bouncer on the door (mate in case you read this please note that I am straight), the door, the lamp-post outside. It's not an aphrodisiac but it sure puts you in a good state of being... all that without the Yoga exercises. The price for the dining experience.... mmmm...bite my head but I did nor find it that bad. Less classy joints have cost me more even with vast amounts of alcohol I ordered. This place is my current favourite in London.",1
3,"Alright. Arrived around 6:30pm and was seated immediately for two. Started with the chive and prawn steamed dumpling and another steamed dumpling with prawn. Three of each were served, and the presentation was unique and dainty. Also got the kung pao chicken and baby pak choi with garlic. It was a decent meal, but for the price, I thought it was unmemorable. Service was pretty slow: ended up having to ask three people for the check. Desserts looked amazing but opted for donuts down the road.",-1
5,"I came here with my parents while living in London and have been to several other locations since.  This was one of my favorite dining experiences ever.  The decor is very trendy, all with dark wood but due to lights over each table, there are no problems reading the menu to experiencing the food.  The duck salad is one of the best things that I have ever eaten, and the dim sum was pretty fantastic as well.
Overall, this place blew my expectations away compared to what I thought an 'Asian Fusion' place would be like.  The food was amazing, drinks were good and strong, and desserts were unique and very good as well.  While a meal here does come with a hefty price tag, I felt like it was somewhat justified by the quality of our experience.",1
3,"Ate with some relatives here.  
Four Seasons is located in the middle of the Chinatown corridor in London.  A bit difficult to find.  
Had a very nice white fish, tofu, and vegetable soup.  The roast duck was delicious, although a bit on the sweeter side.  It was served on a bed of napa cabbage.  Also had the crispy roast pork and bbq pork which was a bit on the dry side.",-1
3,"This place was so popular that I wasn't able to get dinner here, so we came back the next morning for brunch. They don't have a dairy free friendly menu, even though they have a ""dairy allergy menu."" The allergy menu highlights what doesn't have milk (mostly drinks, they don't have milk substitutions) and what can be made without milk/butter (not many of the dishes, as all the bread contains milk.) Breakfast here was just ok, for some reason they were burning incense downstairs where we were seated. They did have what looked like a smoke detector inside but no fire sprinklers.",-1
3,"I dont know how to feel about the Indian food I am getting in London.  Dishoom is good, but nothing all that special outside of what I have gotten at some of the places in NYC.  Perhaps I am being too picky?
I stopped by for lunch one day and got the chicken tikka and the black daal.  Both dishes were tasty with the chicken tikka being delightfully moist and the daal being smokey and creamy.  Definitely good food, but just not anything more than that.  I do not see any reason for this place to have lines of an hour or longer.  My Indian friend said check out Chutney Mary's in Chelsea.  I think thats my next stop.",-1
5,"How can one resist a dimsum place with a Michelin star?  Well, you really can't.
The dimsum here is the best I've ever had.  My sister and I ordered an entire meal, then saw that our table neighbors had some yummy stuff that we didn't get, and ended up ordering another meal.
The restaurant is very hip.  The upstairs is a patisserie and tea shop.  The downstairs is dimsum.  The decor is very minimalist and modern.
Everything here is very high quality and it shows in the price - £60 for lunch for 2.  Though admittedly we did not need to eat until our tummies hurt.
Do make reservations as it is very popular.
If you've been to Hakkasan, the dimsum is just like the incredible dimsum starter there.",1
4,"Really legit ramen. It's small and loud, but it adds to the atmosphere. I had a special which was lamb ribs and aubergine, was very good. Also save room for dessert as they have a good selection of mochi. Service was also pretty good!",1
2,"I love the broth. I am a huge fan of Bone Daddies. However, I went in for lunch today and ordered the Tantanmen 2, my favourite one, and then once I realised I couldn't finish this incredibly rich, chicken bone fat infused amazingness, I asked for a take-away box. I was then refused a take-away box. Here are the reasons why:
(apparently)
: there is no room for take away boxes (really?)
: they would have to allocate another layer of operations to justify having a service to do take-away boxes (that doesn't really make sense, but okay)
: it's wasteful of packaging, more so than actually chucking away half of a ramen bowl
(despite having wooden chopsticks instead of reusable ones, but ok)
: one can't control the experience of the ramen if it's boxed up and sent away with the customer who paid for it 
Anyway. All arbitrary reasons to me.  Look, if you want to have a new take on a non-native (aka the owner is not Japanese) in an international city like London, you make allowances like offer tupperware for those who would like to continue experiencing your delicious product. None of the reasons the owner presented as justifications for not offering a take-home option were air tight. The basic answer was, 'We just don't want to. And the customer can f*£$ off.' Fair enough.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm going to Tonkatsu next time.",-1
5,"Ping Pong opened the last year I was with my old company, and we had our departmental Christmas dinner at the original branch opposite the London Palladium. It was packed solid, and I remember it was difficult to get a booking. I had the day off due to moving into my new home that day and met my shortly to be ex-colleagues for what was a very fun evening, with delicious, madly affordable food served in a gorgeous setting. My boss managed to give me no sign I was to be fired right after Christmas.
 My fondness for Ping Pong survived this incident and I went back with my now ex-colleagues (minus the boss) for a catch-up about 6 months later, after the legal wrangling was completed. Again, it was fun.
 And I've been back subsequently with very different crowds  once with my houseguests in the summer, after a performance of The Sound of Music at the Palladium, and last week with my brother and the niece and nephew after our Royal Society lecture.
 Both visits were great. I think my older guests enjoyed themselves  the Jasmine tea is always a show-stopper  and they are the type of older visitors who appreciate an experience of 'trendy' London. The dim sum were duly demolished while friendly banter was exchanged with a couple down from the North at our communal table.
 Some critics have sniffily compared Ping Pong to Hakkasan and Yauatcha. I think the Ping Pong dim sum stand up very well, considering Ping Pong is aiming at a completely different market: mostly the post work crowd; with the dim sum hoovering up alcohol consumption.
 The trip to the new branch at the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank was a wonderful half-term family treat. We arrived just after 8pm, me thinking innocently that there would be a lull as punters left for performances at the Hall. Ha ha ha. The place was hopping, with a queue snaking out the door. We were told we had a half-hour wait but would shortly be moved into a bar area. I asked if the kids could have a snack while they waited, and my brother started complaining we couldn't wait 30 minutes with the children 'at this hour'. I mentioned there was an EAT around the corner  but my nephew bridled at this (EAT is clearly their default pit stop in Cambridge). Also, he had spotted the Chinese script on the ceiling and wanted more.
 We were asked to hang on for 5 minutes and a table was magicked up for us. I was really impressed they even bothered, considering they had flocks of people to spare. Service was brilliant and slick, and the dim sum arrived smartly. Stand-outs were the Har Gau and the squid in satay sauce. The Jasmine tea blew the children away  my little nephew thought it was an alien pod hatching.
 The dim sum are keenly priced for such a glam atmosphere  the most expensive item is £3.99: each menu item comes with 3 portions, allowing easy sharing. My nephew had a series of lemonades with fruit 'shooters'  these were as phenomenally beautiful as the jasmine tea. My brother and I stuck to G&Ts  quite fabulously delicious. These were Tanqueray but on a completely different plane to others I have had recently. 3 G&Ts = half the bill for 4 (12 courses) : £67 including service.",1
5,"I haven't been to that many ramen places in London, but this was the best as of yet!
I got the spicy miso ramen with extra bean sprouts and spring onion. We also shared salmon sashimi and fried chicken as starters. Everything was solid. I particularly liked my ramen -- the soup was perfectly thick and flavourful. We also got cocktails, all of which were great. 
Service was prompt and good. It did hey quite crowded during peak hours, so be sure to plan ahead!",1
4,"Environment: casual and noisy, not in a bad way but don't expect privacy. You're going to sit with other people at the same table. Expect some waiting time, around 20 mins in average. 
Food: great stuff. Probably the best ramen I've had so far. I even had friends from the US with previous ramen experience express the same view. It's a huge bowl filed with broth noodles and whatever other ingredient you order.",1
4,"This place is chic to be sure. But I had doubts about the food as we walked in. The dimly lit, sexy feel of the place echoed Mr. Chow's or some gimicky Chinese fusion place. And in a way, it IS gimicky, but it's still damn good. You won't come here just for the food - you'll come here for the ""scene"" as well. But we were surprised that this place had the authenticity and deliciousness to back up the scenester vibe. Every dish on the menu is almost as good as the real thing served in Chinatown or Paddington or Bayswater, or even Vancouver, NYC, or LA. The dishes are well presented and tasty, and they should be, because you're paying an arm and a leg for courses that should cost half the amount.  The steamed dim sum was pretty good, as was the stir fried morning glory vegetables, but our favorite was a dish of chicken braised in a clay pot with dark soy, ginger, and vegetables. The flavor of the dish was deep and hearty and very, very satisfying.",1
5,"Paneer tikka on point tho 
And that mango lassi lemme not start
The ambiance and staff were really nice and then neighborhood was cool AF",1
3,"Overall a good meal.  But the whitebait just wasn't good.
The wagyu buns were large and fluffy compared to others, but were filled with tasty beef and melted in your mouth.  
The Piri piri Tonkotsu ramen was good.  Lots of flavor with a beautiful egg and a nice kick.  
The gyoza was nicely done with a crunchy lace in the bottom of the skillet.
The whitebait was fishy though.  Didn't taste very fresh.  Didn't finish these.",-1
4,"The best place we have tried on the main china town sreet so far. 
Good food, reasonable sized portions for what we paid. The service was also good. 
The duck is especially good.",1
3,"Post ECC cocktails my friend and I were a little peckishand wandered right next door to the Four Seasons.
It's just your standard Chinese Restaurant, nothing special, white wall, Asian Pictures, etc...  Service was curt, food was palatable.
Energy levels restored and we stepped out into the dark and rainy night.",-1
3,"After a 1.5 hour wait in a slowly moving line, we made it in (on a Wednesday evening)... lots of hype about the amazing food, and honestly it was unique- Anglo-Indian food, but not worth the wait...
Authentic it's not...
Service was great, very loud in there so don't expect to hear each other- and really by the time you get in all you want to do is sit down and eat so probably ok that it's not the spot to catch up!!!",-1
3,"Went for dinner and ordered the dim sum. It was delicious. The presentation and flavors were on point. I was def impressed as I've always thought of dim sum as greasy and a bit heavy and the innards always ground up in some mystery combination. Here, it was actual pieces of vegetables and meats that you can see and distinguish...and taste! I would mark for 4 stars, but I felt that 3 pieces per dim sum for the price was a rip off. Also, when you order a pot of tea, you don't get hot water top up. Gotta pay for another (small) pot. Awesome. The ambiance was very nice. I'd say it has a better decor than Hakkasan. I'd revisit this place on special occasions when it warrants me to splurge on dim sum.",-1
1,"When I arrived, I hear people speaking Cantonese so as a Cantonese speaker I speak to the guy up front in Chinese only to be met with gruff, broken English. We are sat and given water but had to ask for tea at $1.50/pp. When it came time to place our order I asked again in Chinese for 1/4 duck, chicken satay appetizer and the braised beef wonton noodles.
The chicken came out first and then the noodles without the beef. I looked confused and said I ordered the beef one. One of the waitresses offered to switch it but I said it was fine. What bothered me was that waiter was adamant that I was wrong. He protested in Chinese ""I'm not wrong! She didn't order that!!!"" Soooooo when I speak in Chinese you pretend you don't know any but when something is wrong you complain in Chinese?? What great customer service...
The wonton noodles were soggy and an off putting grey color. It's as if the noodles were pre cooked and just left out - the noodles were still sticking together in clumps in the hot broth. 
The duck was extremely dry and I was insulted that they would serve it. We were basically given shredded scraps (see pic). Had I not slathered the pancake with hoisin sauce, it would've been inedible. 
The chicken satay was decent from the one bite I tried but still fairly dry.
This establishment provides better service to non-Chinese clientele from what I saw when I was there. 
Also, I think they sensed I was annoyed and they automatically charged  20% tip to our check under ""Discretionary"" even though we were just a party of 2. What crappy business practices!!!!!",-1
3,"I came here for dinner after spending a somewhat rainy day seeing the sights in Westminster and spending a little time avoiding said rain at the National Gallery. Living right next to the neighborhood for curry in NYC (dubbed 'Curry Hill' as a result), I wanted to check out how curry in the UK would compare. Getting a seat was easy enough, but unless it was a bad day, do not sit downstairs unless absolutely forced to. There's no natural lighting (which is depressing at 6 PM), but whatever was going on in the bathroom was infecting the aroma of the entire room. I don't like dining in places that smell like dank urine. After struggling to breathe for a few minutes, my girlfriend and I were able to get a seat upstairs. Much better, but a mark off for having a bar downstairs that smells worst than most dives.
The food itself was alright, although I wasn't blown away, particularly at London prices. The lamb kebob was very flavorful, but the portions were a bit small (a recurrent theme with the dishes here). The dhaba chicken curry was good as well - the curry sauce was definitely more tomato-based (or vegetable-based) than the curries I'm used to, but it didn't leave much variety for the palette.
Service was pretty standard for Britain, so all in all, it was an experience that came in a bit under expectations. Even with ordering an appetizer (I forget right off which one we ordered), the bill came out to 40 pounds - which is pretty damn expensive given the rather small amount of food we ordered. Considering I can score top-notch curry + rice for under $20 in the U.S., I'd give the upper hand to the neighborhood shops that are right across the block.",-1
3,"This place evoked so many feelings in me, some contradictory.
Apprehension. One of the first places where i decided to go solely based on yelp reviews (and i had 3 vegetarian friends with me)
Elation. The food was so good ... so tasty. I loved the foie gras ... and the steak ... yumm :)
Wonder. I am used to French food in London being pretty expensive. It came to be 21 quids per head ... very very reasonable.
Disappointment. This is a very veg-unfriendly place. There was only one vegetarian option among the main course ... gnocchi. My friends didn't like it and they ended up having a horrible dinner, made worse by the fact that i enjoyed my share of the food. So i ended up having to pay for all of them :(
So this turns out to be one of those restaurants where i would like to come often but i won't be able to since i can't bring my friends along. But maybe someday when i am all alone ...",-1
4,"In a word: YUM!!!
I came here last week with some friends and we loved this place! The overall vibe is trendy, modern, and just generally cool. We arrived at around 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! With the promise of being seated in 15 minutes, we put our names on the list, took a buzzer, and decided to get a drink in the lounge upstairs.
The lounge is outfitted with plush seating and sleek wooden tables. While the space looks pretty, it's a bit impractical. The seats are quite low and packed closely together, which is inconvenient for my fellow members of Team Long Legs. Also, the lounge features table service, but there was no clear host/hostess on the night that I visited. I think my friends and I caused a bit of a kerfuffle amongst the staff when we 1) seated ourselves and 2) ordered drinks from someone who wasn't assigned to our table. Welp I don't feel bad because better service procedures would have avoided the confusion.
When our buzzer finally rang 30 minutes later (!!), we returned downstairs to one of the circular family-style tables. Our waitress recommended that each person order five dishes. I'm not entirely sure how ravenous one would have to be to order that much food, but I was very hungry and very satisfied with two dim sum dishes, one rice pot, and a lite bite. All my items were delicious, filling, and well worth the money!
The one other issue that I had with Ping Pong was our waitress. Le sigh, here comes the classic ""bad British service"" complaint. But seriously, our waitress rolled her eyes at my friend when she asked for a different liquor in her cocktail, which the lounge hostess upstairs specifically told us was an acceptable request. Then when we asked to split the bill, our waitress handed us a pencil and told us to split it ourselves. I personally didn't have a problem with that because I assumed that doing the math ourselves ensured that everyone paid for their own items. After our waitress took the divided dim sum sheet from us, she returned with receipts that did not match the sums that we calculated for her. On top of that, she added 12.5% gratuity. I did not recall seeing a note about automatic gratuity on the menu. I would certainly expect that for a party of 6+, but not for 3 people! And certainly not for such mediocre service. We all paid it anyways because we didn't want to cause a scene. 
I think I'd return to Ping Pong for the food and the atmosphere, but I'd just avoid that particularly rubbish waitress.",1
3,"I was skeptical about eating Japanese food in Chinatown, but I was pleasantly surprised. They have a pretty limited menu but do cover the basics. I ordered zaru udon and chicken karaage. The zaru udon was average. The chicken karaage looked really ugly but ended up being moist and tasty. 
It is higher than my standard of normal pricing for Japanese food, but for the area seems average. 
Seating is limited but there is a downstairs section if you're not picky about being able to see out a window.",-1
3,"An interesting little eatery with cheerful staff and a colourful decor. Great to pop in after work and grab a quick meal, not great for groups or a long evening meal.",-1
5,Delicious. Saturating the fried chicken in the ramen broth is amazing. We tried the Tottham and Spicy Miso ramen both were excellent.,1
4,"My experiences at Dishoom have run the gamut from 3 stars (my first visit) to 5 stars.
BRUNCH:
Ah, you used to be a 5 star brunch.  Don't get me wrong, it's still very good, just not quite the excellent value for money that it used to be.  I should've known when the Ginger Pig bacon naan roll was trialled that prices would be raised (£5.20 now, used to be £3.70).  It's still worth it, just less so than before.  I can't honestly remember if they're a little bigger now than they used to be, I think they are but not sure.  A few other notes - the Akuri (scrambled eggs with spices) are still tasty, but last time I went they were serving normal grilled tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes.  It's not the same guys, sort it out.  I also used to like the Full Bombay breakfast (bacon/sausage/beans/tomato/toast), but it's steep (£11.50).  I will say that none of these things will stop me coming back, I'm very partial to the place - I really enjoy their Malabar coffee (very low acidity, very dark) and their mango/fennel lassi.  It's just not quite as wonderous as it used to be, unfortunately.  Still, if you want something a little bit (admittedly not hugely) different, then this is an excellent choice.
MAIN MENU:
My experiences of the main menu here have been quite mixed.  My first trip with a veggie friend was somewhat underwhelming considering how popular the place is - all the dishes we tried were ok, just not especially memorable.  However, I've been a few times since and there are some total gems on the menu:
i)  Bhel (starter) - I love bhel puri, and this ones a good 'un (it's a mixture of puffed rice with chopped onions and a coriander-based dressing).  It does sometimes come a liiiiittle bit soft, but the flavouring is good and comes with a nice topping of pomegranate seeds.  Moreish.
ii)  Chicken & pomegranate salad - this is delicious, a large plate with a generous helping of well spiced chicken, coriander dressing, and pomegranate seeds. Really good balance of flavours and textures, nice and tangy.
iii)  Chicken ruby - so buttery and tangy and delicious.  Definitely one of my favourite curry dishes I've had of late.  Nothing with this much butter in it can be bad.
The breads are also all very good (as are the accompanying sauces - I particularly like the chilli one).  A lot of my friends are very fond of the black daal. I like how buttery and thick this one is; at the same time, I find it to be lacking a little something - probably because I like my daal to be loaded with garlic.  I want it to make me stink.  This doesn't quite do that.  It's good, it's just lacking that little something to make it truly moreish.
I really like the interiors here; there's also a veranda to sit in which is nice when it's sunny outside. It's  very spacious too.  The staff are generally friendly although the service speed is pretty variable.  It gets pretty busy and things get a bit haphazard. It's surprising given how well established the place is (and should be used to high volumes of people), but it's not usually too much of an issue.  On the subject of volumes of people...evenings are mad (1+ hour waits sometimes).  Still, I will keep coming back to this place, for some reason I find it...calming?  I don't know. There's a lot to like, even with the recent changes.",1
4,"Three words; Spicy miso ramen. This is my ultimate favourite type of ramen and Bone Daddies did not disappoint when I came here for lunch one cold, fall day. The broth was delicious, the pork was melt in your mouth amazing, and the spice level was spot on. Could have done without the red straw like vegetable garnish but a minor hit on an otherwise perfect meal. 
We also ordered the fried chicken as a snack. Definitely some of the best fried chicken I've ever had as it was light and cripsy, not greasy at all. 
The service could use some improvement as we had to remind them we wanted the bill about three times and some servers were great while others were a little oblivious. Nevertheless the food was worth it and it was nice to escape the rain with a bowl of warm, comforting, tasty ramen!",1
5,"More than likely you'll have a wait. They say it's an hour but generally it's a lot less. EVEN if it was an hour wait, I WOULD wait. This restaurant is absolutely amazing. By. Far. My. Favorite. I live in the US but if I ever visit Europe again, no matter where I go, I will have to stop in London just to come to this restaurant. IT. IS. THAT. DELICIOUS. I have never had Indian food. But this place definitely put a huge standard for me. We had lamb, naan, chicken, potatoes. I mean everything was pure magnificent. Our waitress was such a doll. Everything from standing in line, waiting at the bar and being seated was perfection.  As anyone who enjoys going out to dinner knows that doesn't always if ever happen, but this place absolutely gets an A+ for everything.",1
3,"Only enter this place if you are okay to sit with strangers. We entered as a couple and were ushered upstairs and pushed over to a table of 6, which had two others sitting there. We awkwardly sat down and said a little hello to our neighbours opposite us, already eating their meal. After they had finished and left, they were replaced by two others. So our date turned out to be not so much a date. We had it good though on our table of 6 with only 4 people. Behind us were an older couple sat opposite two young Indian guys on a four seater table. It looked super cramped and awkward. At least we weren't single diners. The downstairs is reserved for single diners only. I don't know what's worse...being singled out because you're single or being forced to sit within perfect distance to be able to hear the couple opposite whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears whilst we devoured our food.
Onto the food...We had the deep fried salt and chilli squid which was actually amazing. Not greasy, lightly battered, great flavours. We also had a pork, chicken, duck and vegetable dish which has basically just pork with pak choi. Find duck or chicken and you were lucky. Good sauce though. 
Would we come back? No. Too many other places to try in Chinatown and this one did not stand out. Service was okay compared to what other diners have written. Complimentary tea was nice.",-1
4,"Very trendy and modern but deserving of a Michelin star? Not sure about that yet... We tried a few items and although they were all very good, nothing in particular popped out to us like what that was amazing! Although we picked the standard items, I was hoping for something different, a twist to the expected. And of course I wanted to try the standard dim sum items just to see what they were like. Next time we come I will have to try some of the items they are known for like the Venison puff, Jasmine tea smoked ribs, and the Roasted duck pumpkin puff with pine nut. 
We were very disappointed they were out of Cheung fun but I guess next time! We overheard someone saying they did not have any as the quality was not good that day. At least they are doing quality control..but we were still bummed.
Another random note, the seats are very low and felt a tad awkward.

4,"Ok maybe I am getting old and if I am going to eat somewhere in Soho, certain things will affect my decision regarding WHERE to go.
Bone Daddies was a must when I first arrived in London 2 years ago and I have to say that I'm still enjoying going there once a month BUT there are some Pros and Cons that I would like to share with people mid 30's like me. Let's start!
PROS:
- Ramen is really good, tasty and rich. I normally go for a TANTANMEN but also SOY RAMEN is lovely and the price is good (11£ or less),
- food is coming quickly,you don't have to wait ages and there are also some nice thing on the table like elastic band for people with long hair or additional garlic, chilli and sesame.Nice!
CONS
- nice food = big queue. Don't think you go there on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday evening (after 7pm) and you will get a table in 5 mins. You will get a table in 15 mins (if you are lucky...)
- This place is really loud!Loud music playing all the times. If you are going with friends, the conversation with them could be quite difficult.
- small venue: I think they might have 10 tables in total and quite closer one to the other so if you want a bit of privacy or having a chat (hard with the loud music playing in the background), this could be a problem.
In the end, I give you a 4 star my dear Bone Daddies, but trust me, you'll need to get some areas improved :)",1
4,"I've visited Bone Daddies countless times in the past three years, and I still love it just as much as I did the first time.  I will admit that there have been a few times where I felt the quality of the ramen dropped slightly, but overall it's quite consistent.  I also stand by the fact that their fried chicken is still one of my favourite fried chicken dishes in London!",1
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow. 
Located in the Soho district of London you will find Yauatcha, another one of Alan Yau's masterpiece restaurants. One of my mates who resides in London was nice enough to intro me to the restaurant by meeting me there for lunch, it was no doubt THE best dim sum restaurant I have EVER been to in my life, thanks Si. The décor of this restaurant was simply stunning, so much so that I can not even do it justice explaining it here, I'll have to leave it at that, seriously. 
I started with a bowl of Hot & Sour soup with shredded chicken for $6.50 quid. It was truly what I expected, a smooth sweet medley of flavours with a slight hint of tartness (doubt that's a word), one of the finer soups I've tried. They also had shark fin soup which immediately put a foul taste in my mouth althought I didn't even order it, I HATE everything about shark fin soup and that is a completely different discussion. I am glad to know that Alan Yau has removed his 40 pound shark fin soup dish from his world famous restaurant Hakkesan. 
Next from the menu I tried the Pork & Prawn Shumai. It was delectably different from the traditional Pork Shumai that I am used to in the GTA. The texture of this particular dumpling was just perfect with the right amount of meat. It didn't blow me out of the water, but it was damn good. 
Next I had a dish which re-shaped my discerning palette for good. It was a baked venison puff, the best dim sum item that has ever graced my mouth. The texture of this puff was perfectly flaky, the filling was of a richer darker meat, and the sweet taste was so good I thought I was dreaming. The puffs came x 3, but I could have done x 25.  
Aside from Yauatcha there is also Alan Yau's Hakkesan which I briefly mentioned above. Hakkesan is considered by many to be one of the best restaurants in the world, and I am somewhat disappointed that I was not able to hit it up while I was in London. However, I really can't picture the quality of food and décor being all that much better than Yauatcha, at most I can see it being on par which says a lot! I just wanted to mention Hakkesan because if you are in London I would highly recommend both of these restaurants if you are a Dim Sum enthusiast. I will warn you the prices are very high averaging at least $6-7 quid per dish, a big change for me because the dishes here in the GTA run for $3-4 CAD, but more than worth it. 
Only after I came back from my visit to London did I come to learn that Yauatcha had gained 2 Michelin starts since its inception in 2004. If you don't live in the UK, book your vacation now.",1
5,"If you wanna get in without having to wait, come right before they switch from the breakfast menu to the lunch menu. We came at around 11:30am and we're promptly seated to enjoy one of the best lunches I've had during my trip to London.
My two friends and I ordered so much food, the waiter was questioning our judgement. Even though he was right and we tapped out with a good amount left, he also gave us a bowl of raita on the house. So... essentially he added to our pile of food.
Everything is amazing so you can't go wrong with anything you order. I personally got the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and pau bhaji. Everyone raves about the chicken ruby and I also wanted a curry type dish to dip my naan in, but the true star of everything I ordered was the pau bhaji. A curry is a curry but the pau bhaji I haven't had anywhere else.
My friends got the chicken biryani, lamb samosas, cheese naan, cucumber salad, house black daal, chili and cheese toast, and paneer tikka. One of my friends also ordered the house chai which was delicious and has free refills! 
Needless to say, this place is worth the hype. I had incredibly high expectations and it met them. The service was also excellent with the free raita and our server kept our waters constantly refilled.",1
3,"Dinner at Dishoom on a Thursday was an atmosphere. The upstairs bar and dining area was very much hopping, and the basement bar and dining area much the same. Was a bit taken back by the statement of 'an hour wait' by a server without even so much a look at the books. Turns out it was only 20 minutes. Dishoom's sharing concept is a rarity I am afraid, but it is a very welcome rarity. 
As others have said, it is not the finest Indian in Central, the Bollywood-esque decor isn't particularly interesting but fun, and the service is expected but not above par. The dishes were hot, the variety wide, and our hunger satisfied. We shared a couple of grill plates (the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and  Mushroom Paneer), some Lamb Biryani, and the Chili Cheese Toast. I would patronize again.",-1
5,"Of all the Dishoom locations in London, this Shoreditch mainstay was my first and remains my favorite of the bunch. The Indo-Persian joint has great food and cocktails, at fair London prices, but what puts it over the top is the outtasight decor. You'll feel just like you've stepped into some kinda film noir Bollywood set circa mid-1900's. If it's a sunny day in London, and you're lucky enough to grab a seat on the coveted veranda, all the better. The okra fries are a delicious staple, and the black Dahl and lamb bothi kebabs have never disappointed. Dishoom also does breakfast and the naan-based egg sandwiches are out of this world, even the simple yogurt and granola is done with a spectacular Indian twist and sublime attention to detail. Only downside to this joint, is sometimes you'll have to wait in a line, as it's popular. The good news? They'll bring you refreshments whilst waiting, and usually you can hang at the bar, have drinks and snack on ones fries and the lot.",1
4,"The poshest Chinese in London? I think sonot sure it does take away though, which is a shame as the food is really excellent.
 There is a great variety on the menu for both food and drink and both are really very good and its worth going along just to try out the cocktails. You certainly used to be able to go and just bar fly which was a (relatively) cheap way to check out the venue and have a very nice drink. Not sure if you still can as I haven't been in a few months.
 Great atmosphere in the darkened basement with some very subtle lighting and some great understated but cool decor, and although it's big the lighting and set up means it holds onto a feeling of intimacy for either a date or a business meeting where you don't want the information to be available to all and sundry. The low lighting gives it a bit of a feeling of a new york restaurant for me.
 Anyway it's well worth a visit and its open late as well for all those night owls amongst us. Be warned though - I've only been phoned about possibly fraudulent spending on my credit card twiceonce was in Tokyo after buying two things in 5 minutes in a shop.and the other was after going out for dinner here. Cheap it is not.",1
5,"First time here. On a training course in London and thought I'd try it out. Walked over a mile from my hotel as it was a nice mild evening. Got there and loved the vibe of the place but was told there was over an hour wait for a table.
Thought I'd chance as I was already here. Waited about 20 mins in the outside queue and was served a couple of free sherries, nice! Once inside had to wait another 30-40 mins at the bar.
But once I was given a table, let me tell you, it was totally worth it. The food was absolutely delicious. No complaints whatsoever. Ordered a Salted Lassi, Masala Prawns and a Lamb Biryani. Everything was spot on. Would gladly come here again and highly recommend it. Great atmosphere too.",1
1,I would give this place 0 stars if possible. The food was subpar and the service was terrible. Not an authentic experience.,-1
4,"Highly rated Indian restaurant and it did not disappoint ... not like those curry houses that are selling crap and calling it Indian
The Covent Garden one is super crowded. Try the Shoreditch where is easier to walk in without reservation",1
4,"Wandering about Soho on a drizzly, cold ""summer"" day (really, it's August but feels like winter already! Guess it's a bit like SF), we came across a ramen shop and stepped in. At 5:30pm, it was already packed, which is a good sign. Hubs got the tonkotsu and I ordered the spicy miso ramen. Great broth and good noodles. Pork were ample and eggs cooked perfectly. What a great dinner! They even provide plastic bibs for you to wear...which most people did not use, but I did just because. Another surprising and amusing touch was a jar offering hair bands for the ladies with long hair -- because it's annoying to have hair falling into your face as you labor over the lovely soup and noodles! There was even a garlic crusher with garlic on the counter and a sesame grinder for additional flavor. Great place. Don't miss.",1
2,"Went for Saturday brunch.
Coffee was great, but my meal was blasé.  No one else at my table seemed to be all that jazzed about their meals, either.  I ordered the New York pancakes and, to be clear, these pancakes are not 'New York' pancakes, nor is there any such thing, for that matter.  They are, perhaps, an attempt at American-style pancakes, but that's about it.  In any event, this New Yorker who arrived with an appetite for some heavenly pancakes wasn't impressed with the effort.  Folks who enjoy more of a Dutch-style pancake (mmmm, lekker!), for example, would also be greatly disappointed in this effort.  They just weren't good pancakes in any regard.  Fairly decent pancakes are just so easy that to get them all wrong speaks volumes of a restaurant's kitchen.  
I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs, and the eggs arrived barely above room temperature and, as with the pancakes, were fairly bland and disappointing.  Again, eggs are not astrophysics in the world of culinary arts, so c'mon Balthazar.  Get it together.
As a side note, I'm really tired of these otherwise fabulous U.S. restaurants and businesses (Balthazar, Shake Shack, Whole Foods) opening up spots in London, getting a ton of business from their reputation in the U.S., but then half-@ssing it over here in the UK and getting away with serving sub-par dishes that would make most of the kids back in the States grimace, and certainly the New York crowd.
In sum, Balthazar London is just no match for the New York location, and not even close.  In fact, I don't think that Balthazar would have ever made a name for itself if the dishes flying out of its New York kitchen were as boring as those at its London location.  Such a shame.",-1
3,"Possibly the darkest restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating in. The staff are intimidatingly polite, well dressed and numerous. No less than four members of staff showed us to our table in relay. A maze of passages guide you through corridors of latticework walls through which you can glimpse the faces of other diners and see the winking glint of spotlights and reflections as you walk along. Take a trip to the loo and you'll encounter a member of staff whose sole responsibility to guide gents into the mens ladies into the womens.
 At the table the service was efficient and the food arrived quickly. The starters are on the large side and more appropriate for sharing. I had the soft shell crab which was delicious. For the main I went the whole hog and ordered the grilled Wagyu beef. This was my first Wagyu experience; the meat was tender and succulent, easily the finest steak I've ever had. The steak was served sliced and arranged on two banana leaves that were formed into the shape of a boat. Bamboo shoots stood in as oars; the oar blades were slices of fresh chilli. My two friends ordered scallops and lobster and I sampled them both. Although the scallop and lobster meat itself was excellent, the sauces were a little bland which made the dishes seemed a little lackluster.
 It's a pity that the menu seems a little hit and miss as the surroundings are magical and the service was excellent. I'd come here again but would be careful about what I ordered.",-1
4,Fantastic restaurant. Wonderful service and great food. We really enjoyed the starters whilst we waited. We really enjoyed the cocktails too. Would recommend to anyone and it's worth the wait!,1
4,"Took my daddy for his 50th while in London!!
Great atmosphere..a bit noisy! Welcoming service.. Had cocktails at the bar while waiting on our table..cocktails were good! Although I did think a bit pricey which would be typical of a Michelin star restaurant in London!!
Food was amazing...we had two starters the squid & the duck!! Both lovely! Waiter was very attentive, pouring water & wine each time glass was low! Mains were both beef & both very very good..large portions & the rice was perfect!!
They even brought out a dessert for my daddy with happy birthday on it! Nice touch!
Would deffo book to go back again or better still try the sister restaurants that are scattered around the world!!",1
3,"Went to Ping Pong last night with a couple of friends. I'm quite a fan but they've certainly gone down hill recently.
Now we hadn't booked a table and I do have to commend them on getting us seated pretty quickly on a busy night. However, we were told to go upstairs to the bar where we then had to queue for a table. Being in a queue because we're already in another queue really isn't great.
We were called pretty quickly but were unfortunately sat outside on one of the coldest nights of the summer so far. They wouldn't switch the outdoor heaters on so we spent a good part of the evening shivering.
The food we chose wasn't bad at all but nowhere near as good as what I'd had before. The pork buns were a delight as usual but the rest wasn't much to write home (or a review) about. Much of it was fairly tasteless and much of it all tasted the same. Was it chicken, prawn or something entirely different? It leaves you wondering whether they've labelled the boxes not because people don't know what each piece should look like but because people need help identifying it when they've got it in their mouth.
Due to the cold we all drank tea to try and warm ourselves up and I had to admit that the lychee tea is rather lovely. The cocktails did look lovely and most are priced around the £6 mark so definitely worth a shot if you're sat out not in sub-arctic conditions.
The bill came to £45 between three of us which wasn't too awful although I did have to buy a bag of crisps on my way home to keep my stomach quiet.",-1
3,"Space is beautiful and staff is very friendly but kind of a weird experience...pancakes are served ""barely warm"" as opposed to hot, though the flavor is delicious. Had to ask for water when other patrons were offered. Service seemed to be all over the place.",-1
5,"Had take out as I heard that the roast duck with rice was the best here. Therefore, I walked out with that one item. 
It was amazing and the sauce was even more amazing.",1
2,"We have ordered tonkotsu with extra bamboo shoots, tantammen with extra chashu and eggs and kimchi ramen which was a special menu. 
We all think they did good on the eggs, chachu, relatively but not really up to the standard, and the noodle itself. However, the core of ramen is soup and i do think that it both missing something and exceeding something. 
An idea of adding peanut into the soup was absolutely a disaster, its override the richest of the fat that the soup suppose to process, instead of the pork fat which was suppose to include in the soup, instead i think they are adding more oil which totally do not blend with the original soup they had, which resulting in oilyness taste which kills the other 3 elements which was great. 
The price was ok, which is why i think they are using oil to reduce the production cost.",-1
5,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in London, every plate combines taste with aesthetics and the preparations are always so colourful and good-looking.
Hakkasan is a well known name as it can be found all over the world. In London there are two restaurants, one in Fitzrovia and the other one in Mayfair. The style is nearly identical, consisting in wooden surfaces, glass panes and coloured lights; a cocktail bar, a low-lighting and intimate ambient with some music playing in the background.
This is probably one of the most popular restaurants within its category. In fact, people need to book their table some days in advanced since there is always a lot of people and it is very unlikely to ind a table without having a reservation.
Some of the dishes I suggest the most are the Crispy duck rolls and the Dim sum platter which are two of my favourite plates and I always get them when I go here.
If you like Chinese cuisine I strongly suggest you to check this out and maybe also let me know what you think about it. If you are more into Japanese food, there's also that! Always a part of the Hakkasan group, it is called Sake no Hana.

1,"we come here (from Washington DC) for my husband's birthdays, since it opened...
food is wonderful ....
but we were rushed out, and we did not idle, we were eating all that time
and the waiter messed up the birthday surprise, he told my husband that the dessert is coming! when I've emailed them, and I told our waiter in person how I wanted to handle it ... all he said: ""ooops""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATE:
I took my girlfriend for dinner to celebrate our arriving in London
(Date: December 18th)
worst experience ever. Waiter from Lithuania did not understand us, did not care to serve us. We were in a basement (I made a reservation for the main floor) it was literary empty, just few tables were busy, he was too busy to chit-chat with his fellow co-workers. 
One of my order was (always is) the crispy duck salad. The table next to us ordered the same their waiter mixed it well for them at their table. Not for us! I had to ask this female waitress to do it for us too, please. My cocktail came after 25 minutes sitting at empty table.
No more, never ever I will go back to this place.",-1
5,"I come here regularly for the Cantonese roast duck. Always delicious (and you can get it boneless which makes it infinitely easier to eat).
I didn't used to like squid until I had the salt and pepper squid here. So light and yummy, and not at all rubbery (I tried this dish a few times on my recent visit to Hong Kong and I maintain that Four Seasons does it better).
Service isn't exactly delightful, but it is efficient (although I have turned up with a few people drunk once and we did manage to crack a smile from our waitress).",1
4,"It's a tricky one, upsides, the food was wonderful, the service good but for me, the downsides were : the bar was very busy and full of trendy media types who like the sound of their own voices, lots of beautiful people wanting to be seen and jostling their way past. Not really my kind of place but can't fault the food. Expensive (but I didn't pay)!",1
5,"Best Indian food outside India. What else do i say.
I was in London for a week and ate breakfast 4 times and dinner 4 times. Dishoom is inspired by Irani cafes in Bombay. Walk in and you will feel like you are in India. The wait is pretty long. If you go after 7 expect to wait in line for about 30 minutes and then maybe another 30 at the bar area. I would recommend going early. 
Breakfast: 
- Bottomless chai , must have. This is just like I would make it at home. Soothing and a great start to the morning. 
- Akuri : Delicious indian scrambled eggs with indian bread
- Bombay omelette : Fluffy and has a great
- Chilli cheese toast with eggs : ZOMG this is the best and takes me back to my life in bombay. Cooked to perfection 
Dinner
- Ruby chicken : this is butter chicken , almost as good as eating in india '
- Naan : Perfect naan actually cooked in a tandoor, thin flaky , heavenly
- Chicken biriyani : Parsi style biriyani from Bombay. Made to perfection with marinated chicken spiced with pepper perfectly. 
Drinks 
- thumbs up flip : Thumbs up is Indian coca-cola. This drink is served with egg whites and whiskey 
- Chai : anytime of the day 
Desert: 
- Kulfi : average
- Memsahibs mess : this is strawberries , merengue and cream muddled to perfection.",1
5,"A totally different dining experience - excellent quality of food, a unique venue.
 Would definitely visit again.",1
1,"Really don't understand the charm of this place - I did not understand it in Paris and I still don't understand in London... I think it is French, steak and all you can eat French fries at the price of 25gbp is what makes people go crazy. I personally much rather grab a good old Babette and chips for 15-20£ rather than being in this mess..
Also the steak has no crust, could argue this is how French take steaks, the green sauce has hardly any flavour, the meat is under salted... The salad tends to be over dressed - the only charm seems to be fries.. Which for me is a very bad value... 
By the way, this is one menu restaurant, salad followed by steak in green butter sauce with fries.. 
I would easily live a happy life without ever having to go.., by the way, I did not have any particularly bad experience... It is just super crowded, and chaotic for nothing for my taste.",-1
4,"Amazing place.  Glad we stopped by.  Friendly staff and fantastic food.  Enough food to share. The food came in less than 15 minutes. 
Make a reservation on their site to avoid lines.",1
4,"Best desserts!! If you go there, GET DESSERT!
Right next to Covent Garden.
Get a table in the main dinning area. It's feels like you are in a garden and if the weather is nice, they will open up the roof. Def a place you can bring guest to impress as I have done (in-laws and friends).
Service is inconsistant, one time I didn't enjoy my fish dish as it was quite bland (but other times I've been there the food has been fresh, well cooked, flavored, presented).",1
5,"My favourite restaurant so far. In King's Street- the most romantic restaurant of London, I went for the Valentine's Day, we had a special menu pre-theatre. It's really expensive, you don't have a lot of food, but the bit that you have is delicious. Their wine list is the most extensive in London!",1
4,"Finally I have emerged from a period of hard study and no social life, to explore London trends that are no longer new. So ramen! I went to Bone Daddies on a weeknight by myself, and there was still a queue, though I got a seat with a minimal wait. Being gluttonous, I got the soft shell crab starter and the kimchee ramen. The crab was fine, though I wouldn't get it again for the size and price. The ramen was quite delicious and surprisingly spicy. Maybe even a touch too spicy? I feel a little ashamed saying that. But very delicious indeed. The noodles and egg were perfect.
The music was a bit too loud for my preference. I would have been hard pressed to maintain a conversation with someone. In and it for the ramen, that's what I say. Correspondingly, service was fast, but 12.5% added automatically seems a bit much.",1
3,"The Cinnamon Club offers Indian style breakfasts that are an interesting take on the traditional British fry up. So if you fancy something with a bit of spice to get you going in a morning it's worth a visit. 
I'm not sure that their food agreed with me though as the spicy scrambled eggs, Bombay spiced vegetables with cumin and a jasmine tea that I washed it all down with was a bit too much of a taste explosion to experience first thing. I would definitely go back to eat later on in the day as the food and service were top notch, but Indian for breakfast just seems a bit wrong (yes I admit to eating least nights curry when I woke up, but that's just somehow different, isn't it?!).
I'll be sticking to bacon sarnies and fry ups, but if you for those of you who like it hot at all times of the day then it's nice to know that there are variations of the great British breakfast also available on London's morning menu.",-1
5,"My wife and I visited this restaurant right before attending Les Miserables.  We wanted dim sum but maybe in a more elegant setting.  This restaurant definitely fits the bill.  Reservation was simple and painless with open table.  The ambiance was great.
Most importantly, the food was superb.  The standard menu items were a tad more but we have the option for more high ticket item like lobster, king crab, and even caviar.  We ordered the set menu for two.  They were all delicious!  In particular the venison puffs was to die for.  The prawn and bean curd cheung fun was glorious.  They were distinctly dim sum  but not like the standard menu item I'm accustomed to at a typical restaurant.  In addition we also ordered a spicy soft shell crab which was exquisitely served with roasted almonds.  We finished it off with lychee rose Charlotte, again another gem.
The only downer to the whole experience was that we served disposable chopsticks.  That was out of character with the rest of the dining experience...  All in all  still a five star dining experience.",1
5,"just a fantastic experience!  For being michelin starred - it is very well priced.  Also the staff were excellent and service was quick.
We will definitely come back the next time we are in London!",1
3,"WHITE PLATE FOOD!!! The taste of the food was great - so no problem there but it was pricey though...and I left hungry.
I am not a stranger to fine dining (and before you ask nooooo I don't have a chip on my shoulder) but the atmosphere was far too quiet and ultimately I could not shake the feeling that this place too stuffy for its own good.  Sorry guys it just didn't work for me.
Everyone else seemed to like it though....so maybe I was having a bad day...or maybe I wasn't...",-1
2,"Service was awful. Our server didn't come once to refill our waters and took forever to take our orders and give us the check. Both times, we had to have 2 people flag down servers multiple times before anyone came over. Manchurian chicken dish was gross and flavorless. Lamb curry was the best in terms of great lamb texture and curry flavor. The chilli paneer was definately a hit all around too.",-1
1,"Pedestrian food and terrible service
This location has two restaurants. The restaurant on the lower level is a formal sit down and upstairs is a casual first come first serve location. Front desk is understaffed and rude. They consistently seated others ahead of us in the upstairs location. After they seated us, the waiter forgot our order. We were waiting for 30 mins and when we followed up they told us we need to hurry up and order. When I told them, incredulously, that I have ordered and am waiting, the person went away from only to come back annoyed at us and took our order again. Not a word of apology. Food's not worth the hassle. Never going back.",-1
3,"Dinner
Went there with my cousin and her boy friend. In total it costed £40 for three of us. Therefore i shouldn't be so judge mental? However, ramen in Japan is a serious topic, can be the theme for life. 
I think it could earn four stars as the quality of food was great overall, but the bean sprout tasted old, kinda sourly almost people from FSA will question about its freshness. Shame.
Maybe it's one off.
Thus highly recommended for a casual dinner.",-1
4,"The good, the ok and the ugly 
The ugly: 
- We had to wait for 30 mins to get to the bar and another hour to get a table
- They lost our credit card :(
The ok:
- Drinks at the bar and the dinning room were different and I preferred the drinks at the bar - wish I could order more from there
The good: 
- While we were in line they brought out masala chai!
-  The drinks at the bar were super unique and tasty 
-  The food was delicious. Some of my favorites lamb chops, Ruby chicken, okra fries, prawns koliwada. Things you can skip lamb raan bun and chili cheese toast.
- They felt terrible about losing our card so the meal was on the House :)",1
5,"We all have that friend that goes ooooon and ooooooon about that one place and absolutely wants to take you out THERE - even if he/she has probably already went 3x in the week - right?
Well Bone Daddies was THAT place of one of my dearest friends in London, and I actually love a good ol' ramen - so hey, why not? 
The place doesn't seem that Japonesy, and to be fair, a bit in the hype of Soho - I would have probably not even gone in by myself. Anyway, we got there around 6:30 on a Monday, and had to wait around 10min to get seated - so I can easily get that it can get over crowded during the weekend.
I went for a Tonkotsu ramen - and not wanting to be crude, it was not far off a foodgasm. The egg was perfect squishy, the noodles were tasty, the broth has just the perfect seasoning. Not bland, not overpowering. Nom nom nom.
Our night out cost us 17£ each for the ramen + extra + diet coke - which for Central London is not excessive, and in this case a very good value for what I got in my plate.
Can I go back tomorrow? :D",1
4,"Oh Chinatown, no matter what city and country I'm in the service just as bad. Can't complain I suppose, although I have to admit this was the rudest asian restaurant I've ever been to. The food however makes up for most of the crappy service. I recommend the boneless ROAST DUCK. The sweet soy sauce just PERFECTION drizzled on. Every time I'm in town I stop by Four Seasons. Though, if you do takeaway they don't give you the veggies that comes with the order when you eat in :( I'm a bit sad when i found that out. If you're bringing buggies you might be yelled at since the restaurant is small, which is really RUDE. I still have to give a 4 for that duck, coz even LA's chinatown got this beat from the get go. :)",1
5,"I'm partial to Dishoom. I spent two amazing nights there recently, one of which was NYE and included new friends, mouth watering food, incredible cocktails, and dancing to The Beatles on a dance floor off the kitchen downstairs until the wee hours of the morning. 
Rob. Boon. And a few other folks there really made Dishoom unforgettable. 
Can't wait to go back. Even if Boon is on hiatus, as long as they have that garlic cheese naan, it is worth the flight over from LA. All the rest: beautiful space,tasty authentic Indian food, a fun and eclectic drink menu...  is simply a bonus.",1
5,"Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Decor & Style: 5/5
Ok yes, the food is amazing, but it is pretty expensive. It is not true authentic Dim Sum, however it is still very good. Michelin 1 star rated? Definitely. 
Shui Mai & Har gauwas great, however not true Chinese taste, had a modern flavor to it.
Char siu bun, Wagyu beef puff, Roasted duck pumpkin puff with pine nut, crispy duck roll all very, very good. 
Again, come here for the amazing food and nice modern environment but don't expect true Chinese dim sum flavors.",1
5,"Another tough competitor at the best ramen in London. If you like a thick ramen, you'll love the Tonkotsu variations that Bone Daddies has to offer. 
This was my second ramen of the weekend after having just been to Toro for Tonkotsu Ramen just yesterday (I'm a ramen addict!), but this time I'm trying a new type of ramen, Kani Tonkotsu. This ramen has chashu pork, softshell crab, chilli, kale, beansprouts and black sesame. Alongside a Bone Daddies Cider. The ramen was good, very very good, it was hot and a nice refreshing change from the normal Tonkotsu that I'm always eating. Highly recommended! 
I had Green Tea, Coconut and Salted Caramel Frozen Mochi for dessert. Normally I'm not a fan of frozen mochi but these flavours were delicious. 
Please, please go check out this Ramen as it is one of the best in London!",1
3,"The food was genuinely not Indian. I do understand the need to westernise Indian cuisine as the habits may vary. However, you don't have to pretend to render it gastro when all you do is scrap all the spices from traditional daal or curry. 
Naan bread was delicious as well as the chai.",-1
5,"Made a reservation for 4 people about a week before! The only option available was 9pm. I requested the conservatory, like everyone else, but when the restaurant called to confirm they said we'd be seated in the restaurant. We really enjoyed our dinner, although not in the ""romantic"" part of the restaurant, the service and food were great! We did the 3 course dinner and enjoyed every bite! Service is amazing and the Somali, wine expert, was wonderful! I had wrote in the reservation that my husband and I were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary, so they surprised us with a sweet dessert and candle! Perfect night!",1
4,"The food at Yauatcha was absolutely phenomenal; It was the best dim sum I've ever had. The selection was great and there were plenty of options.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the staff was rude and condescending (the woman at the host stand, in particular).  Loved the chic decor.  Despite the rude staff, I will definitely return on future visits to London.",1
4,"Good dim sum place in London! I had it once in NYC and The consistency is there! I still not sure whether I can appreciate price tag that much! Don't get me wrong, it's a great presentation and service place! Just hard to beat home style dim sum!",1
2,"Cool design ,food below average much better Indian food available in london ,none of the dishes tasted fresh ,probably Pre cooked in bulk to cater
To the long lines,I really cannot understand what the fuss is all about extremly average food go for ambience only",-1
3,"Definitely not the best place for ramen in London but still pretty good. Wouldn't queue for it again as i find the broth too oily and the noodles too soft for my liking. 
Its opposite the Supreme store so don't be alarmed if when walking towards it you see a long line of people especially on thursday mornings, we almost left as we thought that was the queue for Bone Daddies!",-1
4,"Yauatcha is a Chinese restaurant specializing in dim sum created by Alan Yau who also created Hakkasan located in London. In 2005, Yauatcha earned a Michelin star.  I believe Yauatcha is deserving of the rating. The restaurant serves a wide range of teas that pair perfectly with any of the beauties in the elegant pâtisserie at the entrance. You are immediately greeted by a gorgeous case of chocolate truffles, macarons, and petit gâteau. The dining area downstairs feels like a very hip night club decorated with tiny lights, colorful orchids, and the bar has a lovely tropical fish tank. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I had the prawn and bean curd Cheung Fun and the Spicy Soft Shell Crab with almonds.  For dessert, I had the coconut mousse with tangy lime curd, and coconut pandan cream. This restaurant came highly recommended by my aunt and uncle as one of their favorite restaurants in London. I agree...I loved Yautcha also. Reservations are recommended.

3,"You know, I expected it to be better, much better.
I've been to the one in NYC and it is an institution so was looking forward to trying the London version of this cosmopolitan French styled bistro. It looks very much like the one in downtown New York, but much bigger and along with that it loses some of its intimacy. What was imported across the pond was a good helping of New York type attitude. The service was a bit cold and always seemed to be bored with whatever was said or asked for. Our waitress could barely be bothered to help with the wine when I asked if they had a Bordeaux by the glass she seemed confused. There also seemed to be the bare minimum of interest shown while just getting the job done properly. 
The food was good but not amazing. You would think that a pretty straight forward Steak Frites with Bearnaise would be delicious in a place like this.  It was fine, but lack luster. Starting with the meat which was not cooked the way asked more medium than medium rare, and also not the best cut of meat. The Bearnaise was a bit thin and vinegar-y, overall just a bit off and not what you would expect. Dessert of Tarte Tartin was delicious though.
Nice enough, and for Covent Garden Piazza a bit of an oasis if you want something a bit more upmarket. The bar makes a great place for pre opera drinks.",-1
1,"Let me start by saying I am Japanese, spent the first 18 years of my life there, and have spent the last 25 in New York City, where there is plenty of and an increasing amount of ramen competition, that most ramen connoisseurs would be proud of.  I adore ramen, and am comfortable claiming myself as a connoisseur.
I am not trying to be racist, but there is a non-Japanese manager at Shoryu, who does not understand how ramen is properly consumed.  I ordered the most simple combination of a bowl of ramen and an order of gyoza.  As any seasoned ramen eater knows, each of those dishes are good on their own, but eating them together is what makes the experience whole.  Well  I received my gyoza within 5 minutes of ordering (great), but did not receive my ramen for another half hour (not great).  Given the standard ritual, I of course held off on eating my gyoza until the ramen came, and by then, it was cold, greasy, and to be honest, slimy.
Now the ramen.  The soup (I had the piri piri tonkotsu) was not bad.  The noodles felt and tasted a bit like soba noodles, i.e. too straight, and too hard.  And worst of all, they make the same mistake that so many foreign ramen outposts do - they pile on the vegetables and other stuff, taking away from the taste of the ramen itself, perhaps to fool you into thinking you're getting a good bang for your buck.  True ramen, as most know, shouldn't be adulterated by too much ""gu"" , so you can let your tastebuds focus on and appreciate the simple noodle and soup combination.
When I complained to said manager about the half hour gap between the gyoza and ramen, she simply said sorry, and quickly stuck another customer in front of me - they make you share tables, so as not to slow down business.  So those of you who feel weird about eating at a small table for two with a perfect stranger sitting eighteen inches in front of you, maybe you should venture elsewhere.  Very different from sitting next to someone at a counter, even though you are just as close.
With very mediocre ramen and horrible service, I will continue to wait for the awesome ramen shop this city so desperately needs.",-1
3,"Ok so I've been here a few times now and whilst the Ramen is undeniably excellent I have been ground down a little more each visit by one recurring thing which I can't help but be bothered by - the music. I understand that there is an aesthetic and a brand to uphold but let me tell you this - whilst eating Ramen, I do not want to have Pearl Jam's ""Jeremy"" or ""Them Bones"" by Alice in Chains, or any other ""chin-rock"" classics piping out into my ears. Ive tolerated it each time but today I realised I could take no more when at approximately 7:25pm, my ears were assaulted by the Stone Temple pilots. In 2015 there is no excuse for this. I was in such fear that the next song was going to be ""Mmm Mmm Mmm"" by the Crash Test Dummies, that I had to rush the ramen down in light speed and get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. Quite a stressful experience, and as a result marks have been lost. Three stars, but could be so much more.",-1
3,"So, this place has great ramen, and at roughly £12, the price is pretty reasonable.
However, the 12.5% service charge is outrageous! For me, a service charge of this magnitude is only justified in a proper sit-down restaurant with great service, which this is not. First, the server didn't get our order right. Second, the server didn't remember at the end of the meal that he had served us. Third, you don't even get a proper table and are squished in amongst others. None of these are huge issues, except when the cost of my meal magically increases by over 10%.",-1
5,"Very delicious food, great service, and a posh soho venue! Definitely make a reservation beforehand because this place is popular. The food was incredible. Some favorites include the edamame truffle dumpling, and wild mushroom dumpling. The cocktails were also great! I had the Hana Maguey which was a sweet tequila cocktail. The desserts must be good because by the time we got to dessert, most of them weren't available. I plan on coming back soon to enjoy another meal and order some desserts! This is definitely deserving of its Michelin star.",1
2,Had great expectations when I walked past this establishment a few months before it opened. This place was heaving at lunchtime. Lunched with 2 friends in the Indian Street Kitchen  my overall experience was just lukewarm.,-1
5,"We came to this restruant because of the amazng revews on yelp... it was even better than what they said. The service was great, and the waiter was super helpful, and the food was GREAT! The best dish was the dal by far!!! I highly recommend this place!",1
4,Went for some tea and desserts yesterday. Hostess wasn't too friendly but the overall experience was good. Love the contemporary decor and food was delicious. Good place to spend an afternoon chatting.,1
3,"There were two main reasons for dining here: it had been recommended by the Michelin guide and, if you're a fellow Street Fighter fan, then you'll understand the other reason why.
 
Along with our respective bowls of ramen (one Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu, one Dracula Tonkotsu), we also ordered a couple of the Shoryu buns.
Personally I wasn't a huge fan of the buns as they actually had quite a bit of mayo on them. They were still tasty but I would probably pass on them on any subsequent visit.
The ramen was quite good and you have the choice of how you would like your noodles prepared. The broth of the Hakata Tonkotsu was flavorful, savory, and rich. The double nitamago egg was eggsellent. The Dracula Tonkotsu is filled with tasty garlic bits and flavour but may require an after-meal mint. 
3.5 stars overall.",-1
1,"They made us wait 20 minutes and said the food is no longer available. So we changed our order and after 20 minutes they came back saying sorry your food is not available and served us the bill. 
Really really unacceptable and rude service",-1
5,"This place is da bomb. We ordered the edamame with their sweet/spicy sauce on it. So good. We also tried the Salmon Tartar and Soft Shell Crab apps. Both were delicious, especially the sauce for the crab. 
I ordered the tantanmen ramen and it was THE BEST ramen I've ever had. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in London. 
My only complaint is that they try to fit so many people in small spaces. I was continually bumped the entire time and I don't think this would be a good spot for big groups.",1
4,"Ramen - a nice, light, healthy option, right? 
I left Bone Daddies absolutely stuffed last night, a feeling which lasted me all night, and I reckon that my cholestrol levels have most likely doubled.  Job well done.  The bowl of tonkotsu I received last night was basically Gojira in ramen form.  Not only does it look fantastic, but the taste doesn't let it down - the slabs of pork are delicious and falling apart, veg in the soup add just the right amount of crunch, and the fried garlic topping is a great little bonus.  The real star of the show, however, is the egg.  Not only do you get a whole egg (not everywhere can say that), but they are perfectly soft and totally delicious - however they do them, they are amazing.  Job well done.  
On top of that, there is a plethora of condiments to choose from - on the table is a sesame grinder, soy sauce, pot of chilli oil (the kind with chilli flakes in it), and the pot of pickled garlic and a garlic crusher.  Awesome.  Oh, and you can also get additional toppings too for a couple of extra pence here and there: nori, pulled chicken, pork mince, extra egg, and - the big one - a pipette of fat.  Hey, as much as I love my arteries, I think I love pork fat a little bit more.
The side dishes on offer include softshell crab, yellowfin sashimi, and fried chicken (obviously in a bucket).  The fried chicken was tasty, although is wasn't particularly crispy which was a let down.  Still, you get a decent quantity for your £5.  The other sides were good, although I wasn't blown away.
On Josy's recommendation, I went for the hot Junmai sake which was nice and very clean tasting, although I cannot profess to be an expert in such matters.  The drinks menu is pretty comprehensive generally, containing a range of cocktails, a large selection of Japanese whisky, and a few sake options.
Overall, I had a great experience with the Yelp crew and the staff were ever helpful (even if we did have a ridiculous number of people and kept sending them to get water).  The decor is cool too with a mixture of retro and vintage Japanese photos and Asahi adverts...however, the jars on the shelf on the back wall look like they contain Alien foetuses, and there are no Lucky Cats anywhere to be seen.  What's that all about?!
Bone Daddies is very very good, and I'm looking forward to returning soon.  It's a bit annoying that ramen in this country isn't really a cheap-and-good-thing like it is in, say, the States, and ultimately £11 for a good tonkotsu is great considering that Wagamama's ramen is hitting double-digits these days.  However, I will take solace in the fact that Bone Daddies will always be able to provide me with a noodle soup to keep hunger locked up until, well, whenever the pork fat un-congeals from my stomach.",1
4,"A nice place to go for a special occasion--but you will end up paying at least twice what dimsum in Chinatown will cost you.
 What the premium pricing does get you, however, is some of the freshest dumplings you will ever have tasted. The dimsum tastes like it is made to order, unlike the mass produced stuff that has been sitting in bamboo steamers all morning. There are also many items on the menu that are certainly not-dimsum or Asian at all: honey glazed lamb ribs, venison puff pastry, etc., that are an interesting take on fusion cuisine.
 People often talk about the decor here: it is an interesting modern and trendy looking space but very un-Chinese. In fact, other than the kitchen staff, almost everyone else you will encounter (at the door or serving your food) will be Caucasian PYTs of both genders. The experience felt more LA than London.
 So save up some money and give the place a try, and you'll walk away with a dimsum experience you will still be talking about a year later.",1
4,"Went here before a matinee at the Royal Opera House. So we told them we did not have much time. It was not a problem for them. We managed a three course meal in one hour comfortably.
The food is really lovely. The wines superb. The location and decor could not be better really. All in all, a wonderful lunch.",1
3,"I think I need to come here one more time to taste the food here properly, the restaurant always very busy, always a very long queue outside and they don't do advance booking.  I waited at least 25 mins in the queue before I get a table. We order two rice dishes, both are similar, the food isn't as heavy as the other India restaurant.",-1
3,"A meal here is always great value for money.  It's cheap and cheerful and for  French food, you will be hard pressed to find such prices anywhere else. Le Mercury is a great stand-by when you want a decent meal for a decent price. 
The food will not wow you. Everything is a little under-seasoned and underwhelming.  And it's a super busy restaurant so don't expect a quiet intimate meal. Although the waitstaff are attentive, there is a sense that they are trying to turn tables.",-1
5,"By far, my favorite food I ate in all the places I traveled to it Europe. EAT HERE! First, the environment is super cozy and dim lit. Secondly, the service was outstanding. Our waiter helped us with our choices. I'm glad he did because wow! The food was terrific. We had naan and the black house daal! Best Indian food I've had, hands down. I wish I lived closer so I could enjoy it more.",1
3,"Food was good. The wait for the food and service was not great. We waited about 35-40 min for our food without any explanation. The waiter was terrible, perhaps there was a language barrier but he was rude to us. Seems like he was rude to Asian patrons. 
Also, they can't pack up leftover food to go apparently because they don't have a license to, says the waiter. And they brought out sparkling water even though we asked for still and still charged us for it.
Not impressed.",-1
5,"The egg! Oh... the egg.
Perfectly marinated, soft, gooey centre... Glad I ordered an extra one.
I had the corn butter miso ramen-- SUPER rich, velvety and quite buttery soup. The thing that makes this ramen great is the attention to detail- the corn is clearly fresh, not frozen and charred before being tossed into the bowl. They give a fresh crunch to the dish. Perfectly cooked noodles with good bite/chew, lots of goodies in the bowl (sprouts, bamboo shoots, shredded chicken, wakame, etc.) with a variety of textures (though I wish the fried garlic that came on the tonkotsu ramen was available as an extra for the other dishes-- I had fried garlic envy!). Plus, I love condiments, and the pickled garlic, chilli oil, sesame seed grinder, and soya pot were fun to play with and allowed me to customize my bowl. Since the broth was so rich with butter, I didn't feel like it needed the extra pipette of fat that others agreed enhanced the tonkotsu broth. 
As others have said, the Karaage chicken (fried chicken as they call it) had the right flavour, but wasn't crispy enough. That said, in spite of that, I REALLY liked it and would order it again. Perhaps it is the container that they use? Though attractive, perhaps too close of quarters with the steam?
Only two gripes: There were some cartilagey-bits with my chicken (like, crunch-ow kinds), but to be expected, I think, in a chicken broth (though I would have preferred to not have those). And, as another reviewer has said, my broth wasn't nearly hot enough. Now, I've heard that some ramen places don't serve their broth piping hot on purpose, as a warmer broth is the more optimum temperature for appreciating the depth of the broth. If this is what they are going for, they should outright say it. Otherwise, I think they need to watch this-- I was surprised how luke-warm it was. 
Service was good, friendly, and accommodating (though I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group in the future since they don't take reservations). 
I'll be back, and soon. Double egg again for sure. 
(but please put a mirror in the loo!)",1
3,"I would call this place the McDonalds of steak. You get a fantastic deal on steak, salad, and fries. The food is good, but not amazing. 
I won't repeat what the other reviews attest to other than to confirm that: 
1) We waited about 45 minutes in a queue snaking around the corner.
2) There is no main menu. Drinks and desert are extra.
3) Vegetarian (cheese platter) includes desert ""free"".
4) The green sauce is delish.
Everything is rushed. The interior is loud. Waitresses in French-maid getups quickly serve you food in an efficient manner. Fries are ""pre-cooked"" (i.e., not made to order) and sit in a large tray waiting to be dished out to you. The house wine was pretty good.
For the steak itself, it is served in slices with green sauce. Americans who like their steak grilled will be disappointed. The steak reminds one of brisket. The steak is good, but again, not awe-inspiring. Don't expect Kobe beef.
The desert was disappointing. I ordered the creme puffs and my friend ordered something resembling stacked macaroons. The pastries themselves were OK, but they were slathered in chocolate. It's like someone got a bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup and went loco. Not what I expect from a French restaurant.
All in all Le Relais provides a unique experience in that it efficiently serves a single menu item at a good price. Just don't be fooled by the long name of the restaurant, this isn't fine dining.",-1
5,"I've been to Dishoom twice since my original review, and it definitely deserves a five star update. The wait gets a bit crazy if you're showing up at prime dinner hours (waited two hours Saturday night starting 8:30P), but the food and cocktails make up for it once you're finally seated. For three people we ordered: far far, lamb samosas, pau bhaji, bhel, chicken ruby, vegetable biryani, a lamb dish, black house daal with three garlic naan, and a couple desserts. I'm still stuffed!",1

 Ironically in the middle of Chinatown there is Tokyo Diner, a cheap but decent Japanese restaurant. Even though the owner appears to be English (if you agree with me that Richard Hills does not sound terribly Japanese) the place has a distinct Japanese atmosphere to it. I have just been to Japan couple of months ago and Tokyo Diner feels very much like one of the Izakayas I went to in Kobe. I am talking not only about the furnishing and (as far as I can judge it) Japanese waiters but also the fact that, just like in Japan, tips are not taken, that you pay on the counter when you leave and that green tea (I think it was Hojicha) is served free of charge.
 The menu is really weird but at the same time rather entertaining: you can spend ages reading the detailed description about every dish as well as some trivia about Japan and Japanese food. In addition the menu contains 5 whole pages with allergy information regarding the nuts/seeds and gluten content for each individual dish.
 The food only partly lived up to my expectations. I was a bit disappointed actually by the Hoso-MakiI Set (6.20). The rice was too sticky and the salmon didn't taste that fresh. The vegetarian cucumber and pickled radish maki were much better actually but also they did not quite satisfy my palate which has become used to the outstanding quality of sushi in Japan.
 I love all kinds of Japanese noodles and particularly when I am hungover, as I happened to be at this particular occasion, nothing is comparable to the healing powers of a Japanese noodle soup. I chose the Curry Udon with Chicken (8.20) which was a very decent bowl of soup drenched with the rather mild but strangely addictive flavour of Japanese curry. The udon were not quite Koya quality but really not bad at all.
 It is not the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to but considering how cheap, friendly and uncomplicated it is, it is well worth a visit for a quick pre-theatre bite or for a hangover cure.",-1
3,"The ramen was wonderful. Ordered a signature ramen. Besides the ramen, I ordered a pork bun too. However, it came out a little disappointing, as the bun is cut into halves instead of folded, like how it was supposed to be. There was also some mayonnaise used in the pork bun, which to me, was a bad idea to a cuisine like this. When it was served, the bun was a little cold, indicating that it was not freshly steamed. On the other hand, the broth to the ramen was just nice! Perfect! And I like how we get to choose the tenderness of the noodle. Overall, the ramen is good, and the ambience is perfect since the server tries to use Japanese but I would avoid the pork bun.",-1
2,"Having tried the other recent Ramen places that have popped up in London, I thought I'd give this place the chance.... Now I know it's all personal preference but this place wasn't for me. To be fair I went for the signature  tonkatsu (as I have in all the others) all the ingredients were there and the noodles were good, however the soup just was a little salty and bland. We accompanied the Ramen with steamed pork buns that were very good though!! 
The layout of the restaurant is a little bit awkward also, the entrance door inconveniences at least two tables and if you need to use the only toilet then you will again have to disturb people.
Overall, fairly good and slightly cheaper than the rest but defiantly trailing  the others in my opinion.",-1
3,"First sip was somewhat bland but after it felt a lot more creamy and flavourful for a tonkotsu ramen.
Disagree with the Hirata Buns. Meat one was sub par compared to the many different buns offered using a japanese fusion take on things. The veggie one was different and actually special which pleased my vegetarian date.
Overall not too bad. Probably rare to find this type of cuisine in Europe but plenty of better ones in California and Toronto.",-1
4,"Some stellar dishes, like the mushroom and truffle spring rolls, scallop shumai, and the fresh bok choi in oyster sauce. Great drinks and good service and an attractive dining room. Many other dishes are standard dim sum fare, but this place is fun and worth a trip.",1
3,"Let me start by saying how excited I was to try my first Michelin Star restaurant. My overall experience was great but I just couldn't see how this is a Michelin Star Restaurant. I've traveled across the world for food, been to many upscale venues, and have had much better dim sum. I'm mind blown that this place received such a prestigious award over other establishments. The ambiance was elegant and modern. The service was standard for a high-end restaurant but the food was not that impressive. We ordered five a la carte dim sum dishes to share between the two of us for lunch. We got Har Gow, Wagyu Puff, Shrimp Cheung Fan, Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings, and Scallop Shumai. The food was subpar but the dessert was pretty good! We got the Chocolate Pebbles cake. Hmmm... maybe they got their Michelin Star for their desserts?",-1
2,"Poor service, we had to keep asking for water, waited 30 mins for a single dessert while other guests ate. Flavours were very good, presentation also, but it's overpriced. Cocktails were fantastic. Overall disappointed - I won't be coming back.",-1
3,"Went here last night with 3 friends, good atmosphere although very noisy (we were in a nice semi-circular booth but I could hardly hear my friend across from me). Started with a cocktail, nice but at £10.50 a little steep for a small glass with a lot of ice. Food was tasty, I had fish pie which was rich but delicious, packed with fish, then the lemon posset for dessert, which was fine but nothing special.  Overall I came away with a bill for £50 (including a glass of wine) and felt that for the quality of the meal (and the wine), although good, it was a little overpriced. I had been expecting more because of the hype. Service was excellent. I probably wouldn't go again, too many amazing choices in London!",-1
5,"I'd barely recovered from the sticker shock of Hakkasan when I was convinced to try its younger sibling, Yauatcha. I'd been told it was more focused on dim sum and was ""cheaper."" Well, you can say that again. Pretty much anything's cheaper than Hakkasan. ;)
I enjoyed catching up with an old roommate on a recent trip here, and unlike Hakkasan, I truly felt that the high quality and exquisite presentation did warrant the price premium and Michelin star. Yauatcha brings Western flair to traditional Chinese dim sum with gorgeous results. I mean that too, as I'm of Cantonese descent and I've had plenty of good dim sum in Hong Kong, mainland China, Canada, and the U.S. 
The one dish that still sticks in my mind was the roasted duck pumpkin puff, which was almost too pretty to eat. It's a deep fried shell made to look exactly like a miniature pumpkin - complete with a tiny leaf - and it's packed full of flavorful roasted duck. 
Yauatcha is also known for its macarons, and my friend got a takeaway box for his girlfriend. We didn't have any problems with service whatsoever, and all in all we had a pleasant time catching up. Definitely a place to try at least once if you're a dim sum connoisseur and your budget allows.",1
2,"My experience here was nothing spectacular unfortunately.  Being sushi snob myself and having visited other Nobu locations (NY, LA, etc.) many times, I had to say this place did not meet my expectations.
I don't usually order stuff from regular menu and it works just fine at other Nobu locations, but the server here had no idea what I was trying to order.  I asked to speak to one of the Japanese chefs and the issue was immediately solved.  Still the sushi I had was nothing special.
Considering the price I paid, I had way better experience at Zuma for sure...",-1
4,I had the mushroom ramen which is the ONLY vegetarian option (vegan if you ask them to leave out the egg in it). Bit of a pity really cause it was so so so so good. Taste-wise I'd give 5 stars.,1
3,"I do not know what all the hype is about. We had a reservation and were seated in a lovely room. When the food came we were shocked to see only 1 naan for 2 people. That's just weird. 
I ordered the Tikka chicken and it was OK, it wasn't anything to write home about. It was just OK. It was so quiet during lunch that it really was no fun. 
I will never go back again. Keep your hype, I'll just go to my amazing neighbourhood place that's yet to be discovered.",-1
5,"The only Michelin-starred restaurant we have been to in London has been Barrafina, but a year or two before they were actually rewarded a star (I know, so much foresight). So it seemed to me that not having eaten at one before we leave for good would be a mark on our soul, so I looked up...Yahuatcha...due to my own love for dimsum. But after perusing through their menu, I became unsure as to whether there would be a marked difference between the dimsum there vs the dimsum i might find at Jade Garden in Chinatown, aside from the prices and ambiance. 
And then I perused the menu at Hakkasan. And then I couldn't decide. And then I consulted my college roommate who's been Yahuatcha and didn't see a huge difference and i was still in indecision..until i found that Hakkasan has a tasting menu of  £38 which included a cocktail, an app, main, and dessert (per person). It also came with rice and stir-fried asparagus during the main, which i did not expect.
This cheap tasting menu is only available before 6pm Sundays to Thursdays or something (can't remember the details) and not advertised in the restaurant. Although we specifically made a booking for that menu, when they seated us, they did not provide us with it and we had to ask for it in the dim dim underground lighting. The servers when we asked, also told us that we likely will not be full from the menu but we were undeterred.
The cocktails were so good. And the food was even better. I was really surprised because my expectations were really low - believing that Chinese food is just Chinese food, but they made it better! Rather than explosion stir-fried wok heat flavours, the food is more delicate and nuanced. 
After the dimsum platter, wasabi fried shrimp, duck, cod, and asparagus, the server was right, we were still hungry so we added some ribs from the a la cart menu. Holy the rib was the BEST. And then dessert was so good too. We walked away about £100 lighter in our bank account, but it was actually worth it. 
I'm looking forward to coming back again.",1
2,"The ramen is still delicious but the wait staff is terrible! We were the second pair of customers seated right as the restaurant opened for lunch service. About 15 minutes later, we were asked to move seats to accommodate another group AFTER our food had been served. We had to stop our meal to move our bowls and plates while the waitress swept crumbs from the table on to my head as I was reaching to move my bags. No apologies. Unbelievable!!",-1
5,"This was my first visit to Clos and I have no idea why it has taken so long to get there as it has quickly climbed towards the upper echelons of my Favourite Restauarant list. Relaxed and intimate, with excellent food and a truly intimidating wine list, it is an excellent special occasion restaurant for couples or small parties alike. The decor is great: we were downstairs at the back under an impressive canopy of twigs in spring blossom (not real, but the effect is excellent) and the whole effect is subtle lighting and discrete charm. Good aircon too which was essential on the balmy July evening that we visited. The food was superb with the meat dishes particularly impressive. Service is friendly, efficient and non-invasive and winos can spend hours working through the encyclopedic wine list. This isn't a cheap restaurant, but it is not outrageously priced either - the problem is that with the relaxed atmosphere it is very easy to get pulled towards all the little extras that produce a bill larger than you might have wished! It is hard to regret it though as Clos is a really satisfying place to spend an evening. Highly recommended.",1
3,"Came with really high expectations given the reviews and the line.
Lamb Samosas - Came out really fast. Were not hot or fresh. Tasted like they had been cooked earlier in the day and left under a warmer. The homemade samosas from my co-workers taste so much better.
Chicken Ruby - Tasted like it was made with canned tomato sauce.
Lamb Biryani - Again lamb was tough and not tender. Almost chalky, which again makes me think ""not fresh"". I cook with lamb very often and it's not difficult to get it tender. Rice had great flavor though.
Garlic Naan - Very good
Mango Kulfi - Very good
The Line - As I finished my meal I counted the number of empty seats upstairs and downstairs when I went to the restroom...the number of empty seats exceeded the number of people standing in line, which was about 20 people. So why the line? To create false sense of exclusivity or popularity? Or are there simply not enough staff to handle a full restaurant?
Overall, I say it's okay but not worth an 1+ hour wait in line.",-1
4,"This will be review no. 350 for this particular branch of Dishoom reflecting just how popular this chain of Indian street food has become. I'll be keeping this one short as everything has been said before.
There are always queues but it's worth the wait - our estimated 1 hour 20 minutes turned into about half an hour's wait before a table became available. The interim at the bar was a bit stressful as there just wasn't enought space. When we finally found a table to perch on, staff were very helpful and we relaxed with our first drink.
By now we all have our favourites at Dishoom and mine's the okra chips. We shared a selection of daal and chicken dishes, everyone was happy.",1
3,"Spend New Year's Eve there. Fortunately we were placed in the best room. Still the food quality was not better than the three stars given by me. Service was good, but 12% service charge ended up in 40£ tips. Incredible, but do you start an argus five minutes before New Year's Eve?",-1
4,"If you're in London with a niece and looking for somewhere to mutter sweet nothings into each others ear, then Clos Maggiore is the place for you.
 Packed to the rafters prior to theatre, once the luvvies have disappeared, the place really comes into it's own. The lighting is subtle, the conservatory - if you can get a table there - is delightful and the service matches the sublime elegance of the food to a tee.
 The wine list can appear as a bit of a shocker but, put your pretensions in your back pocket and even the cheapest wines on the extensive menu are wonderful.
 Pretty much all the dishes appear to be a smidge heavy on the truffles which, whilst delightful, can leave you feeling that you won't be needing a kebab on the way home.
 The pace is unhurried and friendly, and the waiters more than willing to make sensible suggestions for both food and wine.
 A really lovely and relaxing way to wind down after a day in town.",1
3,"This is the trendier sibling to the Nobu at the Metropolitan. It's more clubby and chic at night, offering good people-watching opportunities in the evening. But I prefer Nobu at the Met. The food is comparable but the Met ambiance is just so much more relaxed and less poseur. And the real celebs know this, anyway, so you're going to find them at the Met branch and not the Berkeley one. Ironically, as I write this, I just had lunch there last week with Noami Campbell sitting at the next table. Which is even more bizarre, given that she was sitting at the table next to me a few nights prior to that when I was eating at China Tang... go figure.... not that she's a gourmet tastemaker but we do seem to like to eat the same things ;)",-1
5,"I've been going on and off pretty much since it's opened and it's retained its quality. Of the dozen places I've been to in London this is by far the best and the only one that comes close to what I'm used to in Hong Kong and Singapore, although I have yet to try Hakkasan which is supposed to be on the level.
Yauatcha brings modern cooking techniques and interesting ingredients to dim sum. The venison puff is a textbook butter pastry with French, rather than Cantonese techniques. The parcels (sorry, ""spinach prawn dumplings"") would not be out of place in a Vietnamese kitchen and are also reminiscent of greek leaf rice parcels. There are a few twists on classics, such as the pumpkin crystal dumpling which plays pumpkin's softer texture against just a hint of crunchy water chestnut (expected) and the oily nasal nuttiness of pine nuts (unexpected). Since the classics are done well without using the usual bulk frozen quality items, they taste different: the prawn and deep fried tofu cheung fun was crispier and more flavourful than expected although it's a shame they hold on to the sauce pot after pouring. The kitchen team here has taste and knowledge and the cooking is consistent. I like it, authenticity gets boring after a while.
They have always had amazing desserts but having not had one in 3 years I cannot comment on whether quality has been maintained, only point out that many tables were ordering some and they still look very pretty and skilled.
The restaurant itself is still claustrophobic downstairs, although it feels less packed than when it first opened years ago. There is also less queue, although it is still full. The audience, visually, seems half Chinese, and sounds mainland, probably a good sign, from large groups of men to lone diners enjoying a taste of home. The waitstaff has become more European.
Prices feel much higher (4-5 GBP for the cheapest punnets), maybe I'm not used to London eye wateringly high food prices anymore, they are high at all the yum cha we tried this trip. I forgot that the ""pot"" did not have leaves and you have to pay twice as much if you want to be able to re-brew. One of the many ways in which your bill can skyrocket here, especially if you are used to tea being included.
The other way in which it does not feel like yum cha is that you are somewhat rushed every step of the way. The seating is uncomfortably low, the space between tables limited, the space noisy (downstairs especially), your legs hit the table legs, and they start cleaning your table before you've even finished your pot of tea. But I expect this considering the location, fame and long queue. If they let people linger 3 hours there wouldn't be any tables for walk ins and the prices would be even higher.
Well, sometimes you want to have some yum cha that does not taste of MSG and frozen prawn and this is the place to go for it in London. Maybe I should try Hakkasan some time but old habits die hard.",1
1,Most racist place.. Went for dinner there with family and friends and it looks like they like to cater only to English people ... Serving Indian people in A Indian restaurant is below their dignity .. The owner was disrespectful and inappropriate with even kids. Just appalling behavior !!! Honestly just full of ..: !!!! Don't waste ur money n time to bear the humility from these dumb racist idiots.,-1
3,Great value for money in London- very enjoyable food - company and service- sure there is better about but this is a great sushi - Japanese Restrauant in a nice quite location- you will enjoy it without fuss- walked in freestyle for a Restrauant and found this gem. Was very close t giving it a 4 star rating - but is just isn't there yet,-1
2,"Had better from Nobu, but was fine since we got in at the last minute.  There has got to be better sushi in London and this was only slightly better than Yo Sushi.  Really too bad as i have had fabulous sushi at Nobu in Atlantis.  The loud atmosphere made it almost impossible to talk with my friends, which helped make the experience mediocre.",-1
3,"Wednesday, 6.30 the queue was already building up. We queued for approx half an hour. Walking inside, the music was loud, we could barely hear each other but we all know that's the trick in this kind of places.
So queuing, ok past that. We're off to decide on food. Simple menu, few dishes, mix and match. Got the Tantamen and the Soft shell crab, as so many people do in such places.
I thought the soft shell crab in nearby Shoryu ramen was OKish, well I take it all back, that was awesome compared to what I tasted at Bone Daddies. Most flavourless, oily and soggy piece of crab I'd ever had in my life. Such a disappointment and practically too expensive for £8.50.
Past that, off to the noodles. The noodles were nice. The flavours were bold, too bold for my liking. I think the adaptation of rock-n-roll-esque decor, they tingled with the taste to be liked by the UK audience. Nothing wrong with that but my bowl tasted like a race of bold flavours. There was a lot of oil in my sauce (that only made them taste more delicious) but the profile was completely different to what I've had before. It wasn't bad - it was actually pretty nice but strong! I find it hard to say that I didn't enjoy it, but at the same time I wasn't head over heels.
That's why the three starts. Its a pleasant experience. I'm not crazy about it and I know I won't be rushing there again anytime soon. If I'm around, maybe.",-1
2,"I have to confess to being bemused by the great fanfare that accompanies Dishoom. I hadn't heard of it, but love Indian food so was more than happy to give it a try for a dinner with a couple of friends. We pitched up at 7pm, were told that there was an hour wait. Happily I'd had an afternoon snack, so didn't mind waiting but it seems to me that if you're going to make people queue for an hour then you'd better make damn sure there's something worthy of that wait at the other end. 
We didn't get to sit down and order until about 830pm, with nothing but a small glass of chai tea (which I confess, tasted like it had been made from PG Tips) to sustain us in the interim. On the plus side, our waiter was attentive and helpful once we were seated, making recommendations about what to order, almost all of which we took. 
Between three of us, we had the Pau Bhaji, which set the tone for the rest of the food, being of a mushy consistency albeit quite tasty with the plain rolls with which it was served. We also ordered the Prawn Koliwada, which turned out to be the tastiest dish of the evening in my opinion. they didn't live up to the waiter's description of them as spicy, but they were very well seasoned, and delicious, with a decent number of prawns for a side dish served in a central London eaterie. The vegetable biryani was fine, comparable to what one might get in a decent local take out. the black dahl was surprisingly stingy with the lentils and had a taste that was slightly reminiscent of Heinz tomato soup (I kid you not). 
The biggest shocker (apart from the roti we ordered which came as a wafer thin bread that was impossible to scoop and eat with - I've eaten my fair share of roti and never seen anything like that) was Dishoom's Covent Garden Chef's Special, the Haleem, a 'revered dish that journeyed from Arabia to Hyderabad in the 19th century, and was there elevated to art form'. It was described on the menu as l lamb, cracked wheat, barley and lentils cooked for hours then pounded and served with a sesame onion seed naan and a garnish of green chillies, fresh ginger, fried onions and mint. 
What we got was greying mush that I have subsequently described to people (with no small degree of accuracy) as reminiscent of the nutrient goop that people have to eat in post-apocalyptic societies. It didn't really taste of much, particularly without the garnishes, and it was difficult to tell whether any animals were harmed in the making of this dish (if they were, it was an unworthy sacrifice). 
to top it off, the Bombay Pimms (""The classic English quencher gone native with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, citrus and coriander. Fiery ginger beer, not 
lemonade"") I ordered tasted only of ginger beer, and not the fiery kind. 
Pleasant service and an exotic twist on the passing vogue for vintage interiors in no way make up for the crushing disappointment I experienced here. It's only the (slightly too noisy) ambience and the fact that the food wasn't bad so much as 'blah' that makes this a 2 rather than 1 star review. This is typical of the trend for taking cheap, tasty street food, prettifying it beyond all recognition (usually jettisoning taste at the same time) and then charging a bundle (the lamb goop was £16!) for the privilege. 
thanks, but no thanks - I'll be sticking to the bustling environs of Tooting or Southall in future.",-1
3,"OK Indian in Covent Garden.  I expected a lot more spice here.  The food was tasty but had no kick.  What!  I want spice and there was little.  Service good and I really enjoyed their own IPA though.  In sum, I'll try another Indian restaurant the next time I'm in London.",-1
3,"Meh...
Maybe I'm just a hard sell but my steak could have been more blue and the fries were semi soggy.  The latter was especially disappointing because they are supposed to be really good fries. They were even on ""the best thing I ever ate"" on Food Network as Bobby Flay's pick.
These were not the best thing I ever ate.
Like the New York location, it's crowded (even on a weeknight) so you should definitely make a reservation unless you don't mind sitting at the bar.
Would I go back in London? Probably not. There are better places to eat.",-1
5,"A fantastic selection of cakes, teas and juices. A nice place to enjoy high tea in a different atmosphere to the traditional english one.
 I went with friends and we enjoyed a cake and a drink eah, Staff were courteous even though we weren't dressed up to the nines, and the cakes were amazing. So much thought had gone into the ingredients of each one.
 Yauatcha is a real treat when you are out and about in London, even if you just stop by to look at the cakes in the window because you don't have enough money to stop in on that occasion!
 I haven't tried the dim-sun but I imagine it is as well polished as the rest of this chic cafe/restaurant.",1
4,"The dim sum here are in a league of their own, as are the cocktails. Creative alchemy seems to be in full force with the imaginative infusions and hybrids of flavours dreamed up and merged together with those cocktails. They are expensive but they are so worth it.
 I am yet to sample the cakes, but I plan to when I can afford to go!",1
4,We came to this place on a friends recommendation. We did not have a reservation but were seated immediately. They brought us menus and then disappeared. Finally i waved a guy down who admitted to being our waiter. He didn't say much just nodded a lot.  We ordered a £150 bottle of sake. That and the appetizers were wonderful. The entrees arrived and they were delicious. I gave four stars only because i felt the staff was stuffy and stand offish. The waiter broke a glass on our table and never said a word. To his credit he shook my hand when we left but i am sure that was for the 13% service charge he tacked on.,1
2,"After this last visit I think I've now given up on Ping Pong, it's overpriced, the service is rubbish and the food is mediocre.
Came here as I had an offer and even then I get I paid too much, the portions were small and the server pretty much ignored us. We didn't get any free refills on our tea and trying to pay the bill was a challenge. The only good thing is the food was tasty, just wish there had been more of it.",-1
1,"This avery good food quality but but & but people who manage the reception are not polite at all just now one of them said ""leave my restaurant ""for one of the customer .
Hope some one look after this problem in this restaurant.",-1
1,"Disclaimer: I grew up in East Asia, so my expectations may differ from the average Londoner when it comes to Chinese food.
 I've only eaten in Ping Pong once (the City branch), and that was more than enough. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that this restaurant has going for it is the ambience. The portions were small and the food was bland at best. Definitely not up to the standard of restaurants found in Chinatown even the not-as-nicely-decorated ones. The dishes were rather pricey too.
 While I did not try the drinks here, I'm told by an alcohol-loving friend that this place has some incredible cocktails.",-1
4,"I do think coming to Yauatcha means attempting to appreciate the modern take on Chinese food rather than vouching for its authenticity.  There's no way this swanky restaurant can be your traditional dim sum hot spot when it serves macarons instead of gelatin (oh you know the Chinese love their jelly) in its front display.
Keeping that mind, I booked a table for one on a weekday.  That's how I roll- a lone ranger even in restaurants serving dishes meant for sharing.  It was very quiet at noon, though I suspect the weekend lunch crowds are more painful.
Ordered the below:
Guava smoothie- loved!
Pork and prawn shui mai 4 pcs- your typical shui mai, served with a heftier price tag
King crab Shanghai siew long bun 3 pcs- skin was thin, soup was plentiful
Venison puff 3 pcs- loved! I couldn't stop eating this
Pan-fried turnip cake 2 pcs- turnip cake with a twist, I think there was egg in it
Roasted duck pumpkin puff 3 pcs- this looked better than it tasted, wasn't bad though
Sticky rice in lotus leaf 2 pcs- typical sticky rice
Macarons in the front display- interesting flavors (Chocolate Mint and Christmas Cake was my favorite) but a bit meaty
Overall I really enjoyed it here, but next time I would bring along several partners in crime and order the less traditional dishes.",1
1,"We went to this restaurant as a group of about 15 for my friend's birthday.
 Upon arrival I went to the bar and asked that I seperately order two bottles of expensive champagne and pay for them now in cash so as to keep them off the main bill. I wanted this to be a nice surprise for the birthday girl. They looked at me in a total state of confusion as to why I would want to do this. I eventually paid up and returned to the table.
 The champagne took 20 mins in getting to us, meanwhile I was trying to put everyone off ordering drinks so as not to spoil the surprise.
 The drinks eventually arrived and we ordered the food. The waitress was rude and uninterested. It took ages for her to take our ordering slip which we had promptly filled out. We each expected to make 2 or 3 rounds of orders but in the end it took 2 and a half hours for them to serve us just 2 dishes each, we gave up and I asked that the cake be bought out. Someone said they would deal with it. A few minutes later the rude waitress returned and asked loudly right infront of the birthday girl ""should I bring the cake out now?"" it was meant to have been a surprise.
 20 mins later and the cake hadn't arrived, I asked her again, but still no cake arrived. Eventually I asked the manager who said he would deal with it which he did. However, as soon as 10 members of our party (including the birthday girl) left for a cigarette, he bought out the cake... To an empty table!!
 Eventually we complained and only paid a fraction of the bill. But this wasn't the point. It took 3 hours from start to finish and we received very little food. It totally ruined the evening and we were all still so hungry that we ended up getting noodles on the way home.
 If I could, I would only give one star. Thoroughly disappointed, will never visit again.
 Also, food that DID arrive was average.",-1
4,"I would post a photo but it would have been of our empty plates. 
The place is huge, yet intimate. It's loud but in the best ways. The menu is extensive but everything we tried was solid. We went on a Saturday and it was busy but they have the most amazing bar where you can sip on some hand crafted cocktails and socialize. 
I was visiting from Southern California and would have loved to see a concept like this in our area. We will be back!",1
3,"Good food with decent service. You won't be sorry you came but there's probably some better Indian in london , they did have air conditioning during the heat wave in london while we were there. 
If you're nearby its worth the eat.",-1
3,If you're looking for an authentic dim sum experience it won't be here. They have a mix of authentic dim sum with some fusion ones they've created... but it's hit or miss! They have chicken cashew dumplings and the chili chicken bowl to be very salty and not spicy a all. Some wins are your basic har gau dumplings and we had the soy ginger salad that was pretty good! Service was pretty good despite them being short staffed and the atmosphere is awesome. I wouldn't recommend coming here for actual dim sum but I don't see myself coming back! Not worth the price.,-1
2,"Disappointing ramen experience here, far below par. Spicy tonkotsu doesn't even come with an egg (or was forgotten). The broth was cold and there was hardly any in the bowl, so we had to push down on the noodles and toppings to get any onto the spoon.",-1
3,"In a word, awkward. There is no other way to describe it. Was it that I was checked in for a near empty restaurant in the alley entrance? Was it that someone's job was to just open the bathroom door? Or that people seemed to be lingering around you at all times, just odd. 
I had no idea what I was doing with this menu and the waitress was little help. If you offer your help with the menu, I'd expect that you, well help. We began with salt and pepper squid and the dim sum sampler. The dim sum was the better of the two. My wife had the sea bass for her main and I had the Mongolian stir fry venison. I liked the venison a lot, but wish it had more veggies. They also do not have brown rice and they don't even include rice with your mains, which seems really nickel and dime. Good thing the food was great. Call that a 4 and the service a 2. On the plus side there is an impressive bourbon selection that included options you can't find in the states, Maker's black label anyone?",-1
5,"In the centre of London the theory is: the better the quality of the food, the more recession occuring in your bank account. And Hakkasan most definitely keeps that theory alive!
The food is Incredible [kindly note the use of the capital 'I' for emphasis!] The restaurant itself is beautiful - with the lighting transforming the joint into an almost intimate, high-end night cub by the evening. 
Perfect for dinner with the person you wholeheartedly adore and would rightfully spend a fortune over. Though I suggest large group of friends or students go for the cheaper alternative and head down to Cape Town Fish Market - equally delicious but a little more affordable and a little less high-maintenance [I mean that in the best way possible....I do - hence the fifth star! hehe]",1
3,"After all the hype and the excessive and constant queuing at all of Dishoom's venues, I had very high expectations for this restaurant, but it didn't hit the mark for me.
My friend was visiting me from the States and she really wanted to try out Dishoom after reading about it on a blog. Personally I despise waiting in line for anything but she was willing to go early to queue up, so I was sold! She showed up at 6 PM on a Wednesday and they offered her a table immediately, so I guess the lines don't start that early at the Shoreditch location. 
We tried the Okra Fries (spicy, crunchy, tasty), Prawn Koliwada (can you really go wrong with fried shrimp?) the Chicken Ruby, Paneer Tikka, and of course the 'house specialty' Black House Daal. Perhaps it is a red flag when a restaurant's specialty is an Indian basic as daal. It was good, but not mind-blowingly so. The chicken was okay but a bit spicy, and the paneer was hearty but again, missing the expected wow factor. We also ordered lamb kebabs which the waiter forgot to bring, but he was very sweet and apologetic and gave us a free dessert instead, so he made up for his mistake with the Memsahib's Mess.
In all the food was enjoyable, but I just can't understand why people would queue for hours for this place. London is covered in delicious Indian restaurants where you can get far more food for a better price.",-1
5,"Just blown away from this place. The food was awesome, the drinks were creative, and the service was excellent. We came here for dinner and ended up coming back for breakfast later in the trip. 
We ordered a feast the first night it was hard to recall all of it but we had a few rice dishes, a curry, cheesy bread, naan, fried okra, corn....to start. Those were all spot on! The star was this slow cooked lamb shank with this yogurt sauce that the waiter insisted we try. Hands down the best lamb I've had. Paired it with their in house beer and it just blew our minds. 
Breakfast was equally as impressive. There's just too much to recommend - come and you won't be disappointed.",1
1,Dim sum did not impress me this time at all. Very disgusting tasting. I have had ping pong a few times before but in other locations. I usually to the sum-days deal of the 21.95 all you can eat as eating there on a regular day is a rip off. After this experience of poor service and horrible food I will not be going back. Embarrassing how I took a friend and she hated it too. It's the worst to have to shell out good money for food you hate you just leave feeling ripped off and £30 each poorer as cocktails are a good £7 per cocktail. Never again ping pong.,-1
5,So great! I thought I was back in Japan...amazing place...very busy...shame that the people who work there are NOT Japanese!! didn't seem AS authentic in that sense!,1
3,"I went here about 6 months ago with one of my best friends who can speak Cantonese so that was very helpful for a start and because she'd been here quite a few times, she knew the best place to sit was higher up the restaurant. Apparently on the Ground Floor they're really rude to you - which was ironic as they certainly wouldn't have won any awards for being particularly friendly on our (the third) floor - and it is one of those establishments that is famous / infamous for being rude and that's part of the attraction for some people frequently the joint. Each to their own I guess. 
The food was delicious and the service okay, but it was annoying to be sat at a table with two pervy older men who sat and drooling over my friend and I for our entire meal and I felt particularly uncomfortable when she went off to the loo and I was left with them. 
When it the time came for us to pay our bill, it was annoying to be told that they did not take cards and that we would have to go to the nearest cash point. The waiter even shouted loudly, ""SHE (nodding at me) can go and get money out, whilst YOU (aimed at my friend) wait here."" We did this after saying, tactfully, how ridiculous it was that they weren't in the 21st Century and didn't have the ability to take card payments. When the waiter was being rude, this was when it was useful that my friend could speak Cantonese as she had a slight, let's call it, debate with the rude waiter. 
Great location and very convenient, just make sure you come armed with cash and attitude - and you're probably better in a group so then it'll just be you sat on your table!",-1
1,Do not support this business in any way. Terrible customer service and hospitality.  They must hate Americans in general. Extremely disappointed in my visit here. After a very large and generous 6 person meal...we went to meet friends in their bar. The bar was very empty and they did not allow us to stay nor have a conversation with our friends there for more than 60 seconds before they escorted us out to a back alley and treated us like trash.  Employees need to be re-evaluated and have an extreme superiority complex.  Boycott at all costs.,-1
5,"Impressively cheap! Even though the food is really cheap, they have very delicious roast pork and char siu! A plate of roast pork and char siu rice is only £4.50! The ginger and spring onion pork chop with rice is also very tasty! These two dishes are normally what I have with wonton soup as the starter! Inside  A DOWN TO EARTH simple interior! Quick service and fast food! Good for a fuss-free dinner before a night-out partying! A favourite everyday place to be!",1
4,"I was on a business trip to London in late March/early April that coincided with my 30th birthday.  My ex-pat cousins invited a couple friends and fashioned a nice, little, away from home, celebratory gathering for me at Hakkasan.
I'm not quite sure how my cousin found Hakkasan (She'd been once before, I think).  It's nestled in a corner down a handful of streets to tiny that in NYC (where I'm from), we'd call them alleys.  From the outside, you can tell it's perilously hip.  The clues are the lighting (yes, even from outside) and the bouncer-type folks at the door.
We were greeted once inside and invited to the bar for a drink while waiting for our reservation/table that was almost ready.  There's a coat check right there (always appreciated in the London weather).  The interior is darkly lit (but menus and such are still clearly visible), larger than one would ever expect (and very well populated), and still quite hip.
The bar service was quick and efficient and my prosecco was quite tasty.  Only a few minutes later, our table was ready and we moved with our drinks to sit.
The menu is quite extensive.  And with our party of six, we used it as an excuse to try a LOT.  We had 5-6 appetizers, 5-6 entrees, a couple of bottles of sake, and 6 desserts shared around the table (OK, the desserts were a little less shared because certain people had become territorial over their sugar by that point).  It's now July so I won't attempt adequate descriptions on so many dishes months later.  However, I remember some truly succulent duck (I LOVE properly cooked duck) as well as a host of other dishes that were creative and all nicely balanced-spice-wise.
Our waiter was attentive and had plenty of answers and suggestions when we asked for his thoughts on the menu (always a good thing).  He was present without being overbearing and a delight.  And one of our party members accidentally dropped a glass, breaking it.  The staff acted as if it was no trouble at all and it was cleaned up and replaced faster than one could blink.
My dessert was presented with a ""Happy Birthday"" beautifully written in cursive in chocolate on my place.
My only real qualm with Hakkasan is that they asked us to put our camera away.  I hadn't planned on snapping over and over throughout the meal (Those people annoy me too), but I did want a few shots since it was such a monumental birthday.  I guess that would disturb the hip vibe.
Hakkasan seems expensive, but I am American and everything in London does.  Was the price of the same number in USD as opposed to GBP, I wouldn't bat an eye.  However, I was treated...and even if I wasn't, I am happy to pay for good food on nice occasions.  Perhaps I will have another on a future London trip.",1
5,"Come here and let Bone Daddies walk you face first into a wall of unctuous porky tonkotsu! Pork bone soup might scare off some, but that just means MORE SOOOP for you, Gentle Yelper (I swear I can spell, but those O's get across something I can't articulate in words).
I've never seen such a broth. Milky white and as rich as it looks, I found myself basically scraping the bowl to get the final garlicky dribbles at the bottom before making an unhappy face that it was done.
The nitamago (ramen egg) is perfectly done, with a bright orange yolk that just oozes into the broth. The squiggle of dark soy sauce is indeed unnecessary for taste, but the colors, o the colors. The pork actually was the least interesting part, but I suggest paleo/atkins folks will be happier with the slices? The bamboo shoots are great for breaks between indulging in the creamy noodles, and be sure to throw in just a little chili oil to kick things up a notch. There's also a garlic press with whole pickled cloves, but even I as a garlic fiend didn't think this was necessary. 
The ramen noodles were interesting and not quite what I've had before in other places, but they do a good job of soaking up just enough broth without wilting away.
A bowl of tonkotsu will run you £11 + £1 something for service, but as a once-in-a-while treat, definitely worth it.
Big fan of the decor at Bone Daddies, with walls plastered with photos of the too-cool-for-gakkou rockabillies in Yoyogi Park. 
I'll definitely come back to try out the tantanmen or the tsukemen.",1
2,"This is the most disappointing meal I've had in a while. My friend and I were looking to grab a simple dinner in Chinatown, and when I looked up restaurant reviews, they were all around 3.5 stars out of 5 and I wondered how they could have all been so poor. There is nothing that is 4 stars or above. I've been here a few times to get barbecued meat or roast duck for takeaway, which somehow always managed to set me back £10-15, but it's well regarded for having the best roast duck in London and the char siu and crispy pork belly was always solid too. It's expensive, but on the bright side it's the same price to eat in, so that is probably the best option at this restaurant. The other items on the menu were outrageously expensive - the highlight was that plates of seasonal vegetables will send you back £9, when clearly the cost at the supermarket next door would be something like £2. We got stir fried prawns with seasonal vegetables (which turned out to be broccoli, not even anything special) for £10, but at least there were prawns. We also got the crispy duck with pancakes, which was nice because we could order ¼ duck, which you can't with the Peking duck, but the crispy duck was a dry, shredded, indistinguishable version of the normal glazed and juicy roast duck glory. I wouldn't recommend it. The table next to us got the Peking duck and I had serious food envy. Our last dish was the young chow fried rice. The disappointing part about this was that it was served lukewarm. The whole meal costs us nearly £40 in total, which is terrible value and you should definitely be able to do much better in Chinatown. I might come here for the barbecued meat or roast duck takeaway, but it's not worth your while to eat in.",-1
1,We stood in line for one hour for this. Everyone told me you must go. Seriously some of the worst Indian food I've ever had. Lamb chops were burnt to a crisp. Roti and naan were dry. The chicken curry Ruby which is their specialty is tasteless. The lamb biryani wasn't even edible. They are famous for cocktails. The bolly Bellini is sugar syrup. I would give this zero stars if I could. Horrible!,-1
2,"Pretty unimpressed.  This place is right near my office, and my wife and I always notice the line outside, so we decided to check it out one Friday evening.  I'd call everything ""okay"" and give it 3 stars if it weren't for the tuna.  
I generally avoid ordering tuna these days due to the general overfishing problem with bluefin, but my wife loves it, so we usually wind up with at least a couple pieces.  The ones from Tokyo Diner were outright bad. Greyish (should have been our first clue), tough, and distinctly fishy-tasting.  If I were running the place, I would have let people know that there was no tuna we were willing to serve that night rather than dishing out that mess.  I would have respected that decision much more.
It's also crowded, fairly noisy, and the service was so-so.  Not my scene.",-1
3,"Food is ok. Nothing to write home about. They charge for every little thing e.g pappad, rice. The entree are at a higher price range and they dont even include rice. Roti or naam coats about £2.50 each just to give an idea. Rice is also not cheap. The ambience and service is just ok. I dont't think I'll be going back.",-1
4,"In short: Delicious food, great interior, kind of slow service. But still nice staff. I passed by this place so many times, but never actually went in. On a Sunday evening I decided to change that. This is a modern and nicely styled restaurant. Part of the bar is an aquarium, seating is relatively low, it's just a bit different from most other restaurants. That makes it interesting. And the food was really good. I just realized that it even has a Michelin Star.",1
4,"When my boss heard that i had actually called up Hakkasan this morning and had got a reservation for tonight, he became all gloomy ... effect of the recession maybe, he says, gazing in the distance beyond me ... otherwise in the good old days you had to wait for days at least.
Reminder : Will tell him on monday not to worry too much. The place was packed with people. The fact that i was alone must have helped (why don't i have a friend in London who likes chinese food ? boo hoo).
I start with a crab meat starter. Tastes good ... a bit like calamari ... but nothing too special. But the main course was very good (i am proud of my choice). Mongolian venison ... soft, and very well cooked meat. It was lovely. Had it with the egg fried rice, which was rich and tasty. Is it my imagination, or was the light (rather, the lack of it) playing tricks on my eyes ? It seemed to me that they cook the fried rice only with egg yolks ... it was all yellow ... and did i mention that it was rich and tasty ?
The bowl contained a lot of rice, as the sweet lady serving me had warned. When she came to clear the table, she said ""wow !!! you ate all the rice !!!"". I spent exactly 6.2832 seconds trying to decide whether to feel proud or embarrassed. But i was too full to do much thinking.
I would have finished there and then. But those evil people going on around serving food and clearing the plates ... one of them sweet talked me into asking for the dessert menu. Can't give Hakkasan credit for the glorious sweet red sparkling wine that i ordered (didn't even know these things existed) ... but full credit to them for the sweet talk though :)
One star less because the place was too loud. I doubt if one can have a decent conversation here.
P.S: There were a group of arabs in a table nearby. Their glasses were being continuously refilled with wine without them even asking. If this can happen in a michelin starred restaurant, my boss has nothing to worry :)",1
4,"After a long day of playing a tourist it was a good oasis for Indian food and good drinks.
We had paneer tikka, chole batura, vada pav and pav bhaji. Pretty good food.
The drinks are nice though i did not like their house recipe for Old Fashioned. 
The place is hip with keen, friendly and engaging staff with decent mix of music.",1
2,"Well it's all very promising when you walk in. Dark opulent looking room with lots of nice decoration. Lots of space and very comfortable. But I'd say the food lets it down somewhat. It's not the most expensive but it's pricey enough to expect something a little bit better than what I got.
I was in a big group and it was a Tue evening. We ordered a lot of finger food starters, chicken wings and the like. All overdone and no care taken over them at all. The accompanying sauces weren't in the slightest bit vibrant or surprising. When I eat Indian I want something vibrant and surprising.
My duck masala main course was again perfectly edible but carelessly done. Very overdone and with a ubiquitous masala sauce. I tried two of my guests' food. The lobster curry was a little more delicate without being amazing in any way.
I would expect this sort of food in a decent high street curry house. But the prices are far greater than that so you're paying for the area and the room inside which is a shame when there's so much great indian food around at the moment. I'm lucky enough to live near Indian Zing in Hammersmith and the food there knocks the food here into a cocked hat at a much much fairer price.",-1
4,Best ramen joint been to in UK I don't think it's very authentic. Only gripe is went 2 days in a row second day was not as good as first so might have consistency issues other then that enjoy it,1
3,"A friend and I went here for the Sunday three course special. The service was impeccable, and all of the food was perfectly cooked. However, the dishes lacked imagination and complexity. The flavor profile was pretty flat. We're from Indiana and joked that their bland dishes would be perfect for the Midwest. Do not expect anything here like the creative dishes of, say, a Gymkhana or Buddakan.",-1
4,"PROS - When I was little, I was allergic to duck. I would break out in hives all over my face, arms and legs. My mom told me I would just keep eating and didn't care. Thank goodness I'm no longer allergic but even if I was, the crispy roast duck pancakes served here would encourage me to keep eating regardless. The three of us ordered the duck pancakes with a half duck and salt&pepper tofu (beancurd). The duck pancakes were delectable! The half duck was served in shreds to make it easier on us to make our own pancakes with cucumber strips and onion strips. We were given the duck sauce (looks like BBQ sauce) along with a trio of spices to fully customize our heavenly duck experience. 
The salt&pepper tofu was alright, but it was nothing special so I wouldn't order it again. 
CONS - It's a bit spendy for the amount of duck you get but Four Seasons know they are hot shit compared to other roast duck places around Chinatown so they are ""entitled"" to price their duck that way ;) So the problem lies solely with me and that I should get a higher paying job to eat more duck pancakes, dammit!",1
5,"Really great breakfast, had a bacon and egg naan roll. It was delicious and blended well with the cilantro and chutney. My only recommendation would be to have the bacon on the side as its taste is somewhat obscured by all the other flavours. Service was prompt and friendly, and prices were pretty reasonable too. I'm a fan and will definitely be back.",1
3,"Food is good and the portions quite generous - I liked the black dal and the chole chawal that I ordered. Both were nicely spiced and steaming hot. However, the service was a little inconsistent and quite pushy which is a turnoff.",-1
5,Good food! Good service! Nice atmosphere... Dimsums and the desserts are really good ... Enjoy !,1
4,"When in london, must try indian food as london is known for it. This was a must hit up place before leaving london. I must say the wait is pretty long so if you can go during off hours that would save time if you are on a schedule. As we were waiting we were able to order appetizers at the bar which helped with the wait. 
This place was one of my favorite eats during the trip. We had the bhel which was a little different but good, chole frankie which i thought was tasty, mutter paneer was good, chicken tikka was okay not my favorite as i have had better, and paneer tikka i believe which was good. 
The waiter thought that we needed one more dish but we said we wanted to start with this and if we need additional food we will order later. 
The waiter was great and helpful too. He tried to assist with providing suggestions. Overall a great place and you can tell since people are willing to wait to eat there.",1
3,I do not think they provide sushi in good quality especially compared with Japan. And it's a bit noisy at night. The sauce and ginger are too salty to eat with sushi. Not A good choice considering its price.,-1
1,Terrible experience. Seekh kebab overcooked and dry. Malai tikka had little flavor. As did the Kali Daal. Nothing even close to authentic punjab food. Stay away.,-1
4,"I liked their food but I didn't go crazy and it didn't make me want to return tomorrow. Here are the details:
One general observation - all dishes were underseasoned ranging from moderately to seriously.  That said, since every dish was made in house from scratch, I think is enough for the above rating.
- Singapore noodles - the blandest of all dishes I tasted.  Sigapore noodles need a (serious) kick and they tried to accomplish that by adding sliced red chili peppers.  Unfortunately, the peppers were as mild as they get... This dish has a lot of potential, but they need to fix the seasoning.
- Beef fun noodles - seasoned better than the above Singapore noodles, but still on the short side.  I liked the way the beef was prepared.  A classic dish that desperately needs a twist.
- Dim sum - good to very good, but also mostly neutral.",1
4,"I've been to all but one of the different Dishooms, and this is my second favorite in terms of food. But it has the best ambiance and service in my opinion. 
I came for dinner on a Tuesday for a party of 3, no reservation. Started waiting around 6 and got seated a little before 7:30. Wasn't bad, we sat next to the bar and had a few drinks. I got here reasonably early. Line definitely got worse as time went on.
We ordered chicken tikka, the special lamb dish (specific to this dishoom, okay lamb shank...tad dry), daal, naan, chicken ruby (this dishoom makes the best of this) and chicken biryanni.",1
3,"The wait times are ridiculous. You can hang out in the bar downstairs while you wait and grab some snacks but you can't get a full menu down there, though some dining tables are downstairs (you still have to wait all the same). Lots of interesting stuff to try and delicious Chai while you stand in line.",-1
4,Slipery floors but cheap and good quality. Kids will love it.,1
2,Very bad ramen. Very disapointing. The burger was beautifuk but it felt like eating a small burger at mcdonald. Pretty fade taste. wouldnt come back unless  it is for a quick lunch and there is nothing else open...,-1
2,"Riiight, I'm not sure where all these four and five star reviews are coming from. I'm a huge fan of good Indian food but this was only alright, average really. 
Maybe I was a little annoyed because we all ordered nan but only half of us actually got any. But there was an over-abundance of rice. I got a half a piece of plain nan and believe me, that is not enough. My veggie korma was only really korma inspired and lacked a depth of flavour. 
The service was far from spectacular  especially since our bill came to over £20 more than it should have been and we all paid a good bit extra to make up for it. Sorry Punjab, this was a fail for me.",-1
3,I always enjoy the food but it comes at a premium due to the name. It starts with white tea priced at £7.40 more than a cocktail in most places. The nice thing is that it's great for an extended lunch as you can order more dishes as you go and they are never in a hurry to get you out the door. The dim sum platter is great to share and leave room for the chocolate ganache desert.,-1
4,"Wow really loved the indian food here and their mango lassi! Their naan was absolutely perfect, and it vanished from the table a few times. If your in the area with your friends this place is a must for dinner... you won't be disappointed!",1
4,"Really love this restaurant. Like a wagamama you sit at tables with other people and get to enjoy the bustling atmosphere as it is always busy.
 Amazing dim sum with dumplings that look like clouds and taste even better.
 You do need to be a non-fussy eater and possibly lover of fish, as the menu is quite fish heavy as well as being dumpling heavy.
 Fresh lemonade with your choice of syrup/fruity flavour is excellent and the flowering teas are amazing!
 Really great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner. Even better if there is a bigger group of you!",1
5,"Omg I love this restaurant! Some of The best I've had in London. We ordered just about everything on the menu and everything was tasty!!! Definitely go with whatever the server suggests and try and much as you can! If you can't handle spicy food, then maybe Indian food is just not for you. ‍",1
4,Decent level of Chinese cuisine in London a different approach to the many premises lining the streets in China town this takes the cuisine of china much more seriously. Good for popping in for cocktails in the hidden away bar at the rear of the restaurant.,1
5,The food is good especially the lotus stems and shrimp stuffed mushrooms The seafood and tofu hot pot is delicious.,1
3,Went there after riding the London eye...mediocre food and drinks. Great environment though. But other than that everything was pretty run-of-the-mill...,-1
1,"One of the worst meals ever.  Located near Royal Festival Hall, this is a very happening spot.  Dim sum and swanky modern decor, the wait was long and the food looked good.  We had high expectations and the anticipation was exciting.  Our server was not very friendly and seemed shocked we did not want anything but tap water.  The ordering process is like a sushi bar where you mark your own list of dim sum.  We picked items and tried to flag our server down.  She comes back, took our order sheet, then a while later says they are out of a ton of stuff, crossing out several of our order list and other items....okay thanks.  We decided to stick with the remaining first and ended up adding one item (shrimp toast).  
The food took forever to come out and when it did, it looked pretty good but tasted terrible.  Sometimes the temperature was off (our first dish was the honey chicken on rice and it was partially hot and partially cold).  As my mom put it, the food got worse with each dish.  The duck spring rolls were mushy and bland, the beef lettuce wraps (a special) were just boring plain shredded beef with no flavor, and it was just so disappointing.
Unfortunately, it was pricey too, and we left spending way more than we should have for a meal that was barely edible.  Don't be fooled by the crowds and go somewhere else!",-1
1,"Terrible place!  I never ever take time to write reviews, but this place was so bad it has brought me here to write my first ever bad review.
They literally ruined our dining experience over water.  My girlfriend mistakenly ordered distilled water when she didn't mean to.  I remember the waiter framed the question in a way to deliberately confuse with only two options.  In any case, I am less shy than my gf, so I spoke up for her and let them know that's not what we wanted.  So they brought us regular water instead.
Then a few minutes later the waiter walks over just to argue with us about the water. Completely unnecessary.  I calmly replied like an adult that it must have been a miscommunication then.  The guy just crapped all over our mood with his negative tone and arguing.  I was dumbfounded as he walked away from the table with his disrespectful tone with us.  We spent the whole dinner talking about what a terrible place this is.  We waited an hour in line in the rain for this terrible treatment.  
The food is not worth it.  You're paying for the ambiance and experience which was bad.  Either they have bad staff, or they are pressured by management to upsell the customers.
Summary: Don't go here!  Better options elsewhere!",-1
4,"You always have to wait to get a seat here because it gets very crowded- you can only book seats if you are in a group of 8 or more. The dim sum is great and it is rare to find a place where this type of food is emphasised. They say that you should order 5 dishes per person, but I would say that three is more than enough, But it is nice that you can almost pic and mix and have a nice range of fillings. Or you can go all out and share with friends- the round table s assist this. I am a fan of the seafood dim sum, this seems to be the special one. The bar and cocktails are equally pleasing, but do come here for the food. Prices are pricey, so keep ping pong for special occaisions!",1
5,"We stumbled upon this place but after having heard rave reviews from friends in the past, decided to try our luck and attempt to get a table.  To our surprise we were told we would only have to wait 5 minutes and were given a table in the verandah at the back of the restaurant.  This area is a lot calmer than the main restaurant but still had a lovely atmosphere.  We chose five dishes between us, the stand outs for me being the Pau Bhaji and the signature Black House Daal.  We also sampled two of the cocktails, both were lovely and very reasonably priced (for London) at £7.50.  The bill came to £49.50, including service which we thought was very reasonable for such a lovely lunch.  Can't wait to return!",1
4,"Nice place with great dim sum.  The atmosphere is swanky but not over the top.  We ate downstairs with a cool sushi-type bar that felt swanky.  Service was reasonable and so were prices.  Not sure I'd proactively rave about this place to my friends, but there was nothing particularly wrong with it.  Food was quite good.",1
4,"Bone Daddies' steaming ramen ""hug"" (as the waiter charmingly put it) is lovely on a cold, wintry day! I am a ramen newbie and this was my first time having authentic ramen (Wagamama's doesn't count!) and I wasn't sure what to expect. 
We started with the salmon sashimi which was so pretty and delicious! It came with bubu arare (puffed rice balls, I've never had them before but I love them!) ponzu sauce, and coriander and was so so yummy! I am a big salmon sashimi fan and I think this was actually my favorite part of the meal:P
I ordered the tantanmen 2 ramen with chicken broth, which was one of the only two options without pork on the menu. I found this a bit limiting, but I'm told that in the future they will have some beef broth options. My friend got the miso broth and enjoyed it a lot. We also admired the cute logo of the place and the interesting name (it fits so well! what a neat place!)
When my tantanmen arrived I wasn't sure what to expect with my first real ramen, and my first impression was that it had quite a kick! The broth is spicy and much thicker and creamier than I expected. After a few sips I got used to the spice and enjoyed the intense flavour it gave the ramen noodles. I was skeptical about trying the eggs at first since I am not an egg person, but they looked so good sitting there with their melting yolks that I had to try it and am glad I did. They are as silky as everyone here is saying and the perfect ramen eggs. The noodles and chicken were good and the few random pieces of bamboo. I think for a first timer, I found the broth too rich and heavy to drink it all but I enjoyed the half of it I managed. 
The service was friendly and very helpful. The place itself is probably hipster heaven with a long line of cold people waiting to get into a very busy and tiny place. I am still not a huge ramen person because the broth takes getting used to, but it is comforting in this weather and I look forward to coming back another freezing day and trying the fried chicken appetizer too!",1
5,"I dream about this place and if I wasn't living an ocean away I'd go there every week. Their ramen is all superb, all of it - I hallucinate about their spicy peanut broth - and the broccoli, fried chicken and black sesame soft serve are all essentials as well. A must-visit for London ramen lovers.",1
3,"visited Balthazar London after a number of visit at Balthazar New-York - same menu, different currency! food was excellent, as expected, although in London they have quirky hours . Seemed that the pricing was significantly higher than NYC - Why?",-1
3,"Come here for the food, not for the ambiance nor for the service.
It's a great spot for a pre-theatre dinner if you order their duck.  You'll be in and out pretty quick and it's what they're famous for their duck.  Though their aubergine with minced pork hotpot and black bean beef ho fun was pretty good as well.
In terms of service, they operate like a well oiled machine. Notice the handsfree earpieces.  How many restaurants in London have you seen those in?  if everything goes well.  They'll seat, serve and get you out asap.",-1
4,"Frequented, my visits have always been pleasant and satisfying. The staff are fast, the food emerges pipping hot from the kitchen in minutes, and the casual environment makes it easy to jump in and out for a quick pre-theater bite--although it does get crowded with a long wait midday and at dinner, naturally. Price points are a bit high, but the quality of food makes up for it. The chicken karage is absolutely perfect. Marinated and just slightly battered, it makes for a great shared starter. The tender stem broccoli comes with a side of spicy orange sauce, which would make anyone adore green steamed yet cold-served veggies. The noodles are bit on the chewy/al dente side, but every ramen house has a different style, this is just Bone Daddies' I suppose. I'm also not a ramen fan per se, and usually stick to menu starters at ramen joints, so take my comment with a grain of salt. Beautiful presentation and an interesting broth, come here for a quick and tasty meal.",1
3,"Admittedly, being from Indian heritage, any Indian restaurant is going to have to punch well above its weight to impress me.
Dishoom in Shoreditch has a slight 'rough around the edges' interior style, and a lovely veranda area. And the staff are lovely - whoever did the hiring here definitely did a great job, as they all are personable, genuine and really go out the way to be friendly and make you feel comfortable. I already wanted to really love this place.
I ordered the Mango Lassi to begin with, as I do enjoy a good Mango Lassi. However, this one won the award for the worst I've ever had. Boooo Hissss. It was weak, and though tasted yogurty, the mango was lacking.
The lamb samosas weren't bad (and bonus points for the Gujarati filo), and the Pau Bhaji was yummy - I recommend that as a starter. The Chicken Ruby was also nice, albeit a bit on the heavy side. Overall, however, I wasn't blown away as the spice level was very mild.
I did appreciate the menu maintains traditional integrity, omitting beef and pork from the menu (not exactly staples of the Indian diet), which is more than can be said for some other Indian restaurants.
Overall, I would probably recommend Dishoom to somebody who wanted to sample Indian food for the first time, but I likely wouldn't eat there myself.. not because the service or setting isn't lovely, but because I don't feel the food was quite like home.",-1
4,"The dim sum is pretty expensive than other dim sum restaurants in London, but the experience at Yauatcha is topnotch. Stay for the wonderful pastries and sweet desserts after your meal, I would say that it is one of the best parts of the restaurant. Not keen on the fact that each table has a time limit of 90 minutes, but it should be more than enough time to enjoy your meal without feeling too rushed.",1
5,Prices are expensive but this is unique Chinese food in London,1
4,"Came here with a big group for dinner. Very cool vibe. I didn't think it was the best Indian food I had ever had, but it was very solid. Keep in mind that it is Persian Indian fusion and not just straight up Indian food. The naan was quite delicious.",1
3,"Husband and I ate there tonight based on the number of great reviews, however I have to say this place was pretty average and a bit over priced for the food you receive. The menu isn't very large and it's crazy that the bento boxes were about £16-19! I ended up eating some teriyaki chicken ( only comes with about 4 small to mid size pieces) and is £7.20. The chicken itself was pretty tasty but not amazing. I would have priced it at £4.50. Also since this doesn't come with rice I had to order it separate. The miso soup was a bit bland, I've had better. My husband had the katsu curry and said that both the curry and the katsu were very bland. The included salad was not the best. We've eaten at many Japanese restaurants that were better and cheaper than this one.",-1
3,"I was meeting a girlfriend for lunch and she wanted to go to Le Relais de Venise.  I was excited because it's in my neighbourhood and I've been wanting to check it out because I've heard great things about it.
Food: There's no menu.  They only serve steak frites and as much as you want of it.  They will ask how you would like your meat cooked.  They then start off with a simple salad, the steak comes in small slices, frites and a wonderful sauce that makes you want more.  Very simple.
Drinks: We ordered one sprite and tap water.
Price: 56.10 GBP for two people.
Ambiance: The restaurant feels like a true bistro in Paris.  It was very crowded and bustling for lunch.  It's first come, first serve and they will not seat your party until everyone is there.  
Service: This is why I gave three stars.  Here's where everything went wrong.  The service was horrible.  Our server was a woman who seemed like she hated her job.  She didn't have the time of day for us.  She was very unfriendly, curt, rude and kept bumping into my girlfriend's chair without even saying I'm sorry.  There was a table next to us that was empty and when they were about to seat two people she looked at the diners, said ""oh sh*t"" and then slammed down the cutlery and glasses onto the table.  The icing on the cake was when she was serving me the frites and dropped one in to my water glass.  She didn't apologise or even come back to replace my water.  I waited for 10 minutes, asked for a new glass of water only to find her very annoyed.
Would I go back?  Maybe.  I wouldn't rush back and if I did go back I would definitely not sit in the section of that server if she's still there.",-1
4,"Not big fan of this kind of food, but I gotta say it was a very good experience! 
The quality was good, and the price very reasonable!",1
4,"Wonky's, as Wong Kei has come to be known, is the John McEnroe of Chinatown restaurants. Rumour has it that Mr McE has it written in his contract that he has to throw a few tantrums when he plays on the senior tour, otherwise the fans would feel shortchanged. Well, people go to Wonky's for the cheap and tasty Chinese food but also for the drama and the slight adrenaline rush from the fear arising from any interaction with the staff.
Famous Wonky's phrases
""Sit down there!""
""What you want?""
""Share table!""
""You cannot be serious!"" Ooops sorry that was a McEnroe!
And if you can speak Cantonese, listening to the waitresses' comments about the customers can bring a wry smile or shocked horror to your face depending on your view of what customer service should be about.
Anyway onto the food. I find the ground floor a nice spot for a single diner and the single plates with BBQ meats or fried or noodles in soup tasty and good value for money. The cavernous multi-floor restaurant is quite frequently full and you may have to share tables, which proves that the old ones like McEnroe are still the best entertainers.",1
1,"Congratulations Yauatcha.  You managed to kill your reputation in one single swoop upon our latest visit.
We booked a table for our anniversary dinner WEEKS ago.  As requested, we re-confirmed the day before for 8pm. So far business as usual.
We arrived at exactly 8pm, and got our table downstairs as requested.
Upon ordering, our waiter seemed quite uninterested, and was almost 'bitchy' when I asked about a dish we had the previous time. Hmmm.
The music was extremely loud, even more so than previous times, which made conversation quite strenuous.  We overheard the table next to us complain about the same problem. (On a separate note, they were annoyed as well about getting their main course before their starters).
The food quality was excellent, as always.  Nothing to say about that.
HOWEVER .. when we decided to order desserts at 9pm (one hour after arriving, ordering, and getting our dishes), we were told that ""our table was booked only until 9:15pm, so it would be almost impossible to serve us desserts"". Wait. WHAT?
So we called the maitre d' to enquire about this.  He first started asking us if we were walk-ins.  Then proceeded to tell us that our reservation was for 7pm and we'd been an hour late. SERIOUSLY?  How UNPROFESSIONAL can one be?
If we'd been an hour late, our table would have been gone for 45 mins, since they have a 15min holding policy, so that excuse didn't fly! And not knowing we booked several weeks in advance, and then making us feel like it was our fault? NO WAY!
As said, the quality of the food was excellent, but the service is an absolute disgrace!
In the end, the desserts were on the house, but a situation like this should NEVER have occurred in a Michelin-star restaurant!
The whole experience left us leaving quite annoyed and bitter, and ruined what should have been a memorable anniversary dinner.
We'll give Yauatcha another try next time, but if this is the standard they're holding up now, it's bye-bye, never again.",-1
3,"Bone daddies is a modern ramen joint.  Ramen meets hipster.  Edgy.  
To be fair, I didn't have much ramen in london to compare this too, perhaps this is the best London has to offer?  Perhaps it isn't.  Either way, the tonkotsu broth and the T22 are the 2 most raved about in reviews, so that is what we went with.  The broth itself was very thick and heavy, but somehow lacking depth in flavor.  The ramens themselves picture perfect!  
Everything was fresh and the staff was excellent.  The drinks were quite delicious as well.  
The stools aren't the most comfortable to sit on, but perhaps that is so people don't stay as long as the wait does get quite long.",-1
1,"Super overpriced for incredibly small portions. Some of the staff here are light weight on the rude side. Not too sure how this place got a Michelin star. Their noodles here are very delicious. Silky texture and flavorful but not greasy. Their lobster XLB is good but the skin broke way too easily. I'm pretty picky with my XLBs. Flavor was great, but not the best over ever had. Overall I definitely will not be coming back to this establishment.",-1
4,"A stunning tea-house and restaurant, I've been here a number of times and have never failed to have a wonderful meal.  Which is great because this is one of only a few London hotspots that is both oh-so-trendy and consistently worthy of its price tag.  
I love being delighted by food, and Yauatcha gives a lot:  I fondly remember the venison puffs and shitake and duck rolls... and you'll write home about the ostrich dumplings.  
My only negatives:  (1) some items, like the duck pancakes, are no better than you can find elsewhere, (2) the service - kind but they often strictly enforce the 2-hour table rule (they once slapped our receipt down before we could order dessert).",1
5,"How has it taken me this long to review Bone Daddies?!
Good, god. I love this f*cking place.
I refer to Summer 2014 as the Great Summer Of My Ramen Awakening, and it all started with Bone Daddies. These guys were my first, and it's been a slippery, noodle filled descent into a full-on obsession. 
I may wander, I may experiment, but Bone Daddies has my heart.
And, with the news that they're opening in East London so near to my flat, it gives me yet another reason to never leave my Islington / Hackney nest.
Bone Daddies is London's best ramen, believe the hype.",1
4,"Dishoom was my first time eating Indian cuisine.  I really enjoyed the food and the idea of having a lot of small plates to share.  I went with one other friend and we ordered 4 different dishes and it was more than enough.
We got the Bhel which was delicious but has a lot of heat so only order if you love spicy food.  My favorite dish of the night was the Mattar Paneer- a lot of flavor and a nice kick.  
Definitely worth a visit, great ambiance, service and food.",1
4,"Popped in here late last night after reading about it in Chowhound.  Bone Daddies is a spartan but very compelling bistro with shared tables and very open vibe.  As other yelpers have alluded to, they specialize in ramen noodles.  I started with the fried chicken which was fantastic, not greasy and very crispy.  The white meat was tender and juicy; I would think of them as more chicken morsels than traditional fried chicken.  Then I ordered the tonkatsu ramen.  The noodles were perfect, not too soft, with a certain amount of bite.  The eggs were extraordinary and the meat perfect.  My only complaint was the broth had been reduced for 24 hours, so it more resembled a thin gravy.  Personally, I like broths a bit less thick, but it was still very very good.  The service was friendly and nice.  I'm definitely going back.",1
3,"This is a place with a really nice interior but, and here is the most important part you need to know about Clos Maggiore, when booking a table make sure you ask for one in the conservatory. This is the section in the back with the skylight and is definitely the best section to sit in, especially if you are taking someone out for dinner.
 The food was good but not the kind to blow you away. For main I had the roast chicken and I was not entirely convinced it was completely cooked. It is the kind of place you would go for good but not great food but a very nice atmosphere.
 Recommended for when you're taking someone out. Remember, conservatory...",-1
4,"So I have to start off by saying that I do not eat anything that comes from a 4-legged animal - which means I can never have ""traditional ramen"" in pork broth. Sometimes this makes it difficult to find amazing ramen as they don't spend time to make any kinds of alternative broth. Enter Bone Daddies. Their chicken bone broth is amazing. 
Top it off with bomb fried chicken & amazing cocktails and you have yourself an amazing place for dinner.
Might not be the best place for a date as it is a little noisy but if you're looking for some delish Ramen and a cool spot to pop into for a bite - this is it! You won't regret it :)",1
5,"This restaurant is great, as it is cheap for what it is. Michelin star, great food and we paid like 40£ por both. You basically eat dim sum, so you must like it. I would definetely recommend it.",1
4,"Duck: boo
Everything else: yay
We had the weekday lunch promotion (£30 for an assortment of dishes plus tea, for two) and it was amazing and so worth it!
Toilets have Aesop products. Legit.",1
4,The best way to find any other ramen soup places pointless and tasteless is to come here. Had the spicy miso one and I wasn't even bothered with the loud Hard Rock music. And I hate Hard Rock music ;),1
2,"Usually have a great meal at Tokyo Diner. Good Hoso Maki and spinach as usual. Problem was the Soba noodle soup and edame beans were drenched in salt/ soya sauce, the kind that gives you headaches after. I fear they might be adding salt based additives to the food now so will unlikely be returning!",-1
5,Really fantastic atmosphere with delicious food and cocktails. Not as spicy as I expected but still really tasty.  It looks like a more expensive place than it actually is and we found it be great value.  Long queue if you've not booked and the bar was really packed but I'd say it's worth the wait and the squeeze to get a table!,1
5,This place is fabulous.  Delicious.  Hip.  Did I mention the food is excellent?  Last time I was in the area they were closed for renovation.  Happily this visit they were open and we were treated to an excellent meal.  I will definitely be back!,1
3,"Quite busy. I came around 9pm. If you don't come for the service, but just for the tasty roast duck. Then you'll love it :))",-1
5,"Wong kei's is my favourite Chinese resturaunt and the only one I have visited more than 3 times.
Inside you can sit upstairs or downstairs and it seems like two different resturaunts visually. The food is fantastic and you really do get a lot for one dish so really great value for money.
You can spend about 5-10 pounds and be full.
I really liked the crispy duck, and they have some mean soups.
They provide you with a tasty tea while you wait and the service is sometimes quick sometimes a bit slow but it really depends on how busy it is.
 The selection of beer is not too vast but you are here for Chinese food not for the alcohol so that isn't too much of a bad thing. Inside is usualy quite packed but there is a great atmosphere in the resturaunt.
So overall probably one of the best Chinese resturaunts I have been to.",1
4,"They have two floors of modern dining space, a nice selection of vegetarian dim sum. teas, and cocktails.  The service was very attentive.  They were kind enough to warn me up front, and without asking that the chili oil was not vegetarian since it contained fish sauce.  If you've eaten at Yank Sing in SF, you will find this Yauatcha to be of similar quality with a better beverage selection and modern decor.  Definitely worth another visit.",1
3,"Great atmosphere, really good starters but just ok on the mains. The highlights were cocktails prior to dinner and the chicken pomegranate salad... the ruby curry was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  I would go back, but would probably just order a bunch of starters to share - if you want a good curry, stick to your favorite local or brick lane joint.",-1
3,"I'd bookmarked this place awhile ago and had been waiting for an opportunity to go here. Shopping with my brother on Oxford street today, provided that opportunity.
We needed a quick lunch before another appointment, so I couldnt relax and enjoy the chaat - paani puri / bhelpuri etc. We opted straight for the protein dishes.
The chicken lollipops were good, but standard fare. The agni fire wings, were mind blowingly spicy in a good way. But be warned - this is only for chilli addicts. You can't handle the spice otherwise.
The manchurian chicken was a let down, especially as it was served with a very thin sauce and plain rice (Its a very Indian Chinese dish, served almost dry and with fried rice) the taste was good, but it was a disappointment purely because of its name. They should call it sweet and sour chicken or something.
Brother enjoyed his bun kebab.
However, the only thing that really stood out for me was the hot chocolate with its lovely cinnamon notes.
Service was efficient and friendly. I might return to check out the chaat items, but for a meal, I'd rather go elsewhere.",-1
2,"Disappointing given the rave reviews. I don't think anything really impressed, and I kind of wish we went to a more traditional Indian restaurant instead.",-1
2,"Its a shame to give Ping Pong only 2 stars but its not for the dim sum, its for this branch. There are not enough staff, and the staff that eventually do server you are incompetent. The service is really slow and they never have anything left to serve you from the menu. There are better branches around london to experience the tastiness of Ping Pong's dim sum. I would recommend the branch at St. Katherine's Dock - It is quieter and overlooks the dock at Tower Bridge - Romantic!
Dishes to try, are everything! Ha ha! To be honest, you are really spoilt for choice, however, I would recommend:
Har Gau
Fish Dumpling 
Spicy Braised Beef Coconut Rice Clay Pot
Crispy Hoi Sin duck roll
Spicy Seaweed Prawn Crackers
Vegetable Won ton soup...
... and NOT forgetting Hot Sake.
Don't let the crappy service and experience at this branch put you off of going back to Ping Pong in the future. As a general improvement, I would like to see more staff and better opening hours for all Ping Pong branches as the opening hours vary due to the location.",-1
5,"If you like Chinese, you will love this place... and even if you don't like Chinese, you will do by the time you have visited here!
I must admit that I am not usually the biggest fan of Chinese, but I can honestly say that my meal at Hakkasan was one of the best meals that I have ever had. The food was absolutely out of this world. It's hard to put a finger on why it was just so good - but it really was! Tender, moist, flavorsome... just wow! I was really blown away.
Aside from the food, the service is good, the decor is Gothic nouveau and the pricing structure is certainly palatable. For those who have a little cash to spare, you can enjoy some delightful dishes that cost up to and over £300 a plate. For those that are on a tighter budget, you can go for the tasting menu at around £35 each. That is what we went for, and we certainly were not left feeling hungry at the end!
All in all, a superb restaurant. I wish I could give it 6 stars. I highly recommend it!",1
3,"Great food but slow service and the fact there's only one toilet to service too floors seems strange; especially when it wouldn't look out of place in a squat!
 I'd be back for the duck though!",-1
5,"We visited at 8 pm on a Wednesday night in late July:
A local recommended this Indian restaurant. I checked Trip Advisor and the reviews were great. We read warnings about long wait times. The restaurant does not do reservations and it's true you have to queue to keep your reservation. We arrived to find a long queue. I didn't want to stand in line but the friendly hostess assured us in 30 minutes we would be at the front of the line which means you can then go to the bar and get a digital beeper. While in line, they offered us a variety of complimentary beverages. After 30 minutes, we made it to the front of the line and graduated into the bar. There we enjoyed a few drinks while we waited another 30 minutes for our table.
Once we sat down, our service was prompt and friendly. Our Server, Grace, was super friendly, helpful and prompt. She strongly recommended the Black Daal. I must say, I'm not a big fan of Daal... But this was simply the best Daal I've ever had and the best dish of the night. We ordered a chicken Ruby dish... Awesome. Not too spicy but with a nice kick. We ordered the lamb Sheesh Kabob... Tasty but slightly dry. And a veggie salad and some roti. Absolutely delicious. The place feels fresh and hip and the atmosphere was young and professional. I can't wait to go back!",1
4,Amazing food & great service ! A must try if you are in the area. Recommend to book a table on the lower ground floor :) Awesome athmosphere & service minded staff :),1
3,"I came here during a weeknight for a quick bite with a friend. It was completely packed by 8pm so we randomly sat with a bunch of people (typical in this place). 
I'm Cantonese myself so maybe I have high standards, but I was shocked to find out that they don't offer the classic ginger scallion oil sauce with their white chicken. So instead I ordered soy sauce chicken over rice, which was really good but not enough meat to go with the rice.",-1
5,We are Asian. We eat Asian food. We live in LA and NY the Mecca for Asian food of all kinds. In LA we live near Monterey Park which is known for its Chinese foods. This place albeit pricy is really good. Now you can find high quality like this in the US but in Soho with a great ambiance you are not going to be disappointed. Plus they have a macaroon bar!  We came in with no reservations however I would normally make one. We had a kid and they sat us at the bar. Any younger probably wouldn't work but for any kid 5 or older it works.,1
4,"It was difficult for me and my husband to justify paying as much as we did for Chinese food, when we are so used to getting the real deal in Chicago's Chinatown (and for free from our friends back in Detroit) for the past five or so years. However, the innovative cocktails menu, the high quality of the ingredients in the dishes and the posh vibe made up for some of this hesitation.
We were pleased to see not only the long list of options for drinks but also very unique combinations of flavors, so we ended up splurging by ordering two each and sipping on each other's.
My husband, fellow Yelper Eliter Michal, has an obsession for cocktails with egg white. The U.S. mostly shies away from using it except with the New Orleans Ramos Gin Fizz. However, at Hakkasan there were at least four or five options that had egg white. He got one with a ""jasmine egg white foam"" that had pomegranate. Afterward, he went with a whiskey drink for contrast - ""Smoky Negroni."" 
I got a not-too sweet but very zippy martini called the Thea and was happy to see it was mixed with one of our fav Polish vodkas (Michal grew up in Poland!) - a hard-to-get bison grass variety. With a blend of sharp ginger, slighty sweet yet tart apple and lime juices, this drink was smooth yet strong. My second was a very refreshing Kumquat Mojito, a fruit I rarely see and never with mint and rum. I'm grateful for our server's suggestions!
Now for a quick run-down on what we ate: We decided to forego the preset menu because all the dishes looked too familiar yet too expensive to us. Instead, we opted to do family-style sharing/tapas-style with all appetizers (in order of what we liked best to least).
*Crispy duck salad- Props to our server for suggesting this, as it was our fav dish of the night. Duck has always been my fav protein and Chinese preparation (usually Peking BBQ) is my jam. I enjoyed these tiny fried morsels mixed with bright microgreens, which was just the perfect fresh complement to this decadent meat.
*Soft shell crab - amazingly tasty with right amount of crispies and seasoning, devoured quickly with hit of spice from red chili flake and curry leaf
*Turbot soup with mushroom (AKA wild fungus and goji berry) - flavorful broth with wild mushrooms not used to seeing.
*Fried aubergine (eggplant) and mushroom - surprised at how crispy yet light these were! A bit larger of a portion than needed though.
*Dim Sum Platter of shumai and dumplings (one with lobster, another with caviar/scallop/shrimp, another with crab and chives) - seems overpriced until you consider the filling but this one was not worth it to me because I'd rather just eat the filling if I'm paying that much.
For dessert, I was excited to see calamansi as that lime-like fruit reminds me of Filipino food, so we got the calamansi and chocolate ganache. It wasn't too sweet with the perfect balance of tart and rich, but it also was not too heavy or big to end the night.
Ultimately, go for drinks and a few apps to share for a special night out that won't break the bank (too much).",1
5,"Wonkey Wong Kei undoubtedly has a reputation for itself, whether it be good or bad, it's definitely a 'known suspect' in Chinatown. I've been here by myself loads of times, but I can't remember what food I ordered, or whether or not the food I did order was any good. The reason being, is that each and every time I've visited this canteen, some sort of commotion has taken place, which completely diverted my attention away from the food. And when I say commotion, boy do I mean COMMOTION.There are two notable occasions that stick in my mind. The first was this one time when I popped in on a beautiful summer's day, for a quick bite to eat. For those of you who haven't been there before, the downstairs street level is for single diners only. Groups of more than two, are seated upstairs in the sections that look more restauranty (carpet and wallpaper etc). But downstairs looks like a prison diner, a mess hall, a state school canteen kind of thing.So I was just sitting there, amongst an eclectic mix of diners (cabbies, minicabbies, students, oriental residents, workers from the nearby brothels, and this old aristocratic-like English lady who looked like miss Marple), when I heard a disturbance brewing at one of the neighbouring tables. There was some bickering going on between a customer and a waiter. So I turned to see what was going on. The customer was like a cockney type character, of slim build, in his 40's, about 5'9 with a demure 'The Sun' reader disposition about him. He may have been a cabbie. The waiter was a chubby, well-built stocky chap, in his twenties, who had short spikey hair and I think he was wearing glasses. So as I turned to figure out what all the fuss was about, I realized that it was regarding the dish that the customer had just received at his table. He started off in a friendly I didn't order this one, mate tone of voice, and the waiter contested with a firm yes you did kind of reply. It was a classic yes you did, no I didn't scenario, with each repetition increasing by a few decibels a pop, heading towards an almighty gut-wrenching crescendo. The cabbie character was adamant that he didn't order that dish. The dish in question was a 'duck fried rice'. Eventually, the waiter lost his cool, leaning over the customer, and with one sweeping karate chop hand gesture, sliced the air vertically down, right in front of the cabbie, and bellowed into his face, an ear splittingly coarse YOU ORDERED DUCK FLIED LICE!!!!!!!!!. Needless to say the whole restaurant went silent and turned to see the action. Miss marple started shaking her head in disapproval and I joined in with her, commenting on how rude I thought the waiter was, and how unnecessary his behaviour was. The poor cabby bloke was quaking in his boots, filled with fright, and shock, taken completely by surprise by the sheer audacity of this waiter's reaction. He just sat there cowering under the still airborne karate chop hand, which was still hovering around the poor guys face. Eventually, he came to his senses and managed to muster a bit of courage, replying to the waiter I don't need this s&%&! I'm not paying for it. I know what I ordered, and it weren't 'duck fried rice'!. And with that he stood up, still trembling from the combination of fright and embarrassment, and half heartedly managed to force a cocky swagger towards the front doors of the restaurant, turning around intermittently to issue a couple of 'f&$£ yous' to the waiter that had just ruined his day. How vulgar miss Marple said to me, as we both sat there in complete and utter disbelief.So that was one fond memory of Wong Kei. The second one I have of that place, is even more bizarre. It was one early evening, sort of like dinnerish time, when I was just passing by and couldn't help but pop in for a quick munch. So as usual I took position in the singles department, when I noticed a couple of giddy girls come in asking for a table for two. They were in their early twenties, sort of Essex secretary type girls, obviously having a little bit of a night out on the tiles. They seemed a little hammered. So they disappeared upstairs, and before I had time to place another mouthful of food into my mouth, another couple arrived, asking for the same deal. This time it was a couple of lads, both in their early twenties, basically the male version of what had just preceded them a few seconds ago. Two lads out on a bender. They too were ushered upstairs somewhere in the restaurant area. Then out of the blue, like say about ten minutes later or so, they all came flying down the chute, like human-laundry, one after the other, catapulted right out into the middle of the mess hall, all intertwined in some sort of brawl. They were fighting each other. It was the two lads vs the two ladies, if that's at all possible. There was screaming and shouting, ranting and raging, bodies flying here and there; it took me a while to figure out what the hell was going on. Basically, one of the lads was",1
4,"Still good although from a high point of being excellent, it does feel like it is on the decline. 
 
The food almost feels like an after-thought to the booze. A high-end version of pork-scratchings complementing the high-end spirits.
 
The décor looks aged but is well hidden due to the minimalist lighting. I feel it is on the slow road the mediocrity.",1
5,"Best dim sum I've had! We went here on my first day in London and the food and drinks were outstanding! 
We tried pork buns, veggie dumplings, prawn crunch, mushroom chicken over rice, etc. The only thing I did not like was the sticky rice.",1
4,Very classy and nice intimate restaurant.  The food is delicious and the staff is very professional.  For the quality of the food the service was exceptionally quick.,1
5,Best dim sum in London hands down. Everything is good and it has a great bar with lots of cocktail options. Trendy vibe for sure as well. A must.,1
1,I am writing the review for the first time for those who consider to visit here... The guy who served us very unkind... i would never come here again...we asked some questions and he seemed to be annoyed by our questions and gave scornful look..,-1
4,"T22 is perfect on a cold day when you haven't eaten anything all day and feel a bit depressed... in another word, this ramen is a perfect comfort food for the soul!  The service is attentive and all smile even thought it was a bit late.",1
1,Called for a reservation a week ago for 9 tonight and got turned away unless I could wait another hour...,-1
3,"wasn't bad nothing special
my friend and i had two set menus.
the prawn toast and crispy hoi sin duck spring rolls are really good
drinks are a bit on the weak side...
lovely mango pudding",-1
3,Bit formal but you know by the end of the night you feel you have been treated special.  I enjoyed it.,-1
3,"Brother-in-law mentioned this place has a Michelin star, so why not? Decor and atmosphere was on the too painfully hip side of things, especially in the loungy downstairs room where we were seated. Low tables and low padded chairs felt a bit like sitting at the kiddy table. Otherwise, I suppose you are getting your money's worth, as the tab will reflect the quality of the surroundings ;)
The large menu of overly flowery, fruity, asian-themed cocktails seemed to highlight their mixologists' importance, but didn't interest me much, especially at 9 quid a drink, but what do I know, the young gals at the other tables were having quite a few.
Well, the eats - dim sum and other Chinese dishes were executed quite well, with authentic, distinct and varied flavors. A number of interesting and unique variations on dim sum were pretty good, especially fried and pastry items, like duck pumpkin puff. Haute dim sum, I suppose. Didn't have dessert, but after reading other reviews, glad I didn't, as it seemed they used to do much better sweets. On the way out spied some plated asian BBQ short ribs in the kitchen that looked tasty, we missed out perhaps?
Almost 4 stars, but quite average service and the steep prices keep me from getting all the way there. Plus, I was getting such a pre-recession posh vibe from this joint, for dim sum and Chinese food, of all things, but maybe that's just me.",-1
3,"This is all about the scene. Can't remember a single thing about the food. Cocktails are good and wine is on the more expensive side. Dark, red interior, lots of glass, quite noisy, but great for people watching.",-1
2,The food was delicious but the tight small tables and poor service were a big turn off. I won't be going back - far too many great restaurants in London.,-1
3,I am honestly only giving it 3 stars because there was a hair in my food. I ordered the curry ramen which contains fried chicken. I noticed there was a hair so I was just gonna pick it out and when I did I realized it was fried in to the chicken. It was so disturbing that I couldn't really eat my food. And when I told my server he looked at me blankly and then walked away only to come back and say their chef was sorry. Still charged me for my ramen.... it's just frustrating when you don't make a huge fuss they don't comp your ramen.,-1
1,"Came here with a party of 4 just a few minutes past 10pm on a Thursday night. My family came from California and wanted to try Dishoom the entire trip. We were turned away at the door for it being ""too late"" despite the restaurant being open until 11pm. We could have even ordered take out but the door man told us to go eat somewhere else. There were 2 couples in line in front of us, it's not like we brought an army of people to feed. We went to Punjab down the street and they were very accommodating.",-1
4,"Had lunch with GF last weekend. Nice little Western feel Japanese ramen restaurant, and they served decent food. But being an Asian myself I would not say this is the best ramen I've ever tasted (among Asian standard to say the least). The price for starters seemed a bit too high too.",1
3,"When it comes to eating out i tend not to go for South Asian cuisine, reason being - My maa makes it better.
Anyway after all of the hype i went to Dishoom and i have to say i was not disappointed. 
However i would like to recommend this restaurant more for lunch and snack like cuisine.
I had the Samosa Chaat and Vada Pau both were perfect and i would have these again.
For main course I had Chicken Biryani and i have to say thats where my disappointment came from as it was not as rich as i had wanted it to be.
Nevertheless its off my list of places to check out and i would not mind visitng again.",-1
4,"Hakkasan remains one of my favourite venues. Yes it is expensive and yes you need to book but despite the location, the bar/restaurant is exquisite. Both the food and drinks are varied and delicious. I would however add that it is recently under new management and my last visit was disappointing on all fronts - but i am hoping that was a one off.",1
3,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon just as it opened, and there were plenty of tables available. I had the set lunch menu with 2 apps, 1 main, 1 dessert. For my 2 apps, I got the sashimi selection and tuna tataki; I got the teriyaki for my main, and there was only 1 option for dessert. 
Everything was fine and the service was not bad. It's not worth the price, but then again you don't come here expecting to eat the amount you pay for. I was worried the hosts would be very snobby but that wasn't the case. I'm giving it 3 stars because really the food and service don't stand out; I'm glad I was able to try the infamous Nobu but I probably won't come here again until I start earning my meager accounting salary.",-1
1,"The Ha Gau and Shui Mai is very good as well as the sticky rice in lotus leaf.
 But the lobster dumpling was below average 
The sweet and sour pork is not bad and it would be better paired with a steam rice but then I can't order and waste a full bowl of rice since the waitress informs me I can't take my left over food with me and I need to finished the food... 
Surprise how the management is able to put in the fine print re: disclaimer about food allergy, intolerance and any bespoke orders relate see can't be changed and even disclose about the VAT rate and  service charged of 13% but no where in the menu the management properly and appropriately inform or disclose no take out of left over... I failed to understand the policy and how the restaurant manage to operate without the consumer complaints",-1
4,"Obviously a great experience. Really enjoyed the food, and excellent environment. The wait time was a little crazy, but the chicken ruby is something I dream about. The black lentils were okay, as were the other little things here and there. The fried okra is also particularly memorable, and popular since it's recommended by a lot of the staff there. 
The sauce of the chicken ruby: perfection. The garlic naan: perfection. The biryanis were tasty, and all of their curries are prepared so well. The restaurant decor is consistent across locations, and offers a nice, upscale but not too in-your-face as it could be so you still feel normal wearing totally casual clothes.",1
4,Delicious food. You have to get the aromatic duck appetizer. Assorted meat with fried noodles was a tasty delight. Upstairs dining  is airy and spacious.,1

 Yauatcha was stunning. I was fortunate enough to be part of a corporate night out which included dinner at this restaurant. We entered the restaurant for our 7:00 reservation and had a short wait in the front shop area which is exquisitely designed and sells a selection of macaroons and chocolates in house. They are extremely tempting and a few in our party bought a selection to take home.
 We were lead downstairs to the restaurant which is a square brick room with a partially hidden kitchen, sparkly lights on the ceiling (sounds tacky  it isn't) and cut outs in the brick with faux candles. I can imagine what the room must have looked like at one time, and am very impressed with what they've done.
 The service was absolutely stunning, and I can hand on heart say it was probably the best service I have ever had especially considering we were a group. At one point the manager came to me (I was the organizer) and asked me how my food was. He then very specifically asked how the service was and to please tell him if there was anything. It was extremely sincere and very surprising. A colleague later told me that the reviews about their service on the website were very poor so this appears to be something they are working hard on and have completely turned around. This is impressive, and if you were ever put off from a visit because of this I recommend you visit. For the food I just asked them to bring us a selection to the table. It was brought in even intervals without any long waits, and the empty dishes were quickly whisked away. If we needed another glass or bottle of wine it was almost immediate. I couldn't believe it. We were all very impressed.
 The food was also very good. Highlights for me were the Beancurd Cheung Fun which I believe was beancurd and pork in a long roll, the scallop shumai with the most exquisitely cooked scallops, and the Ribeye Beef in Black Bean sauce. I didn't try it but was told that the Orchid Pao Chung (Orchid Tea) was amazing. They chose a wide range of dishes for us, and served a perfect amount of food. We didn't drink a lot (3 bottles of wine for 9 people) but it turned out to around £46 per person including tip which is fabulous.
 I can't wait to go back, and hope it can live up to my previous experience!

5,"When you go there you have to try ""barbecue spare ribs"" 
Little bit over the budget but you'll try one of the best restaurants in Central London. Definitely worthy to visit.",1
4,"Quite a nice ramen joint, in a fantastic location, and thankfully, is open quite late on weekdays.
I'm not in raptures about it, as I've had better ramen in both Japan and Australia; but as far as pork tonkotsu goes, I would come back for this one. The noodles were quite thin, but they were tasty and filled the bowl with deliciousness. And I'm pretty sure I added a couple of extras... It's not cheap, but it's not expensive for London. Give it a shot!
The apple cider was also quite tasty.",1
3,If I could I would give 3.5 for Roti Chai. Serivce and setting are lovely - we sat upsatirs in the casual area. Most of the food is good - love the aloo tikki burger and the paneer. Aloo Gobi curry is delicious ajnjd traditional but the Daal however was tasteless and watery. The need some roomali roti like Dishoom. The bread basket was a bit dry and to oheavy for the rich curries.,-1
4,"Darlings, I never got the big deal about ramen. You can get a packet for .99 cents so why would I go out and pay for it? I'm not a starving uni student. Well, Bone Daddies schooled me on what great ramen is- plus they have the best logo (did they stalk me? It's a girl sticking out her tongue!) & they even provide hairties, so you can get down and dirty with your ramen. Great cocktails and several locations to get your ramen fix. New fave.",1
1,"Very disappointing! We came here after several recommendations (and reading the positive reviews here), and found the food mediocre at best.  I had the crab and crayfish ravioli and the pork belly, and my wife had the crab and avocado starter and the beef stew special.  The crab in both appetisers was imitation crab meat, which was not mentioned on the menu and was particularly noticeable in the special.  The pork belly was dry and overcooked and the beef stew was virtually flavourless.  The two bright spots were the wine and the sticky toffee pudding (which in my opinion is good even when it's bad).
Granted, the prices are extremely generous, but considering you can get 2 courses and a glass of wine for £17 at places like Public House, I wonder if Le Mercury is really that good a deal.  
Maybe we just went on a bad night or maybe we ordered the wrong items, but will definitely not be returning any time soon, particularly with so many other great restaurants in the area.",-1
3,"I was rather disappointed with our meal in a restaurant with so many good reviews.  While our food was okay, it lacked consistency which is one of the themes for this restaurant.
Our starters were excellent and the preparation was flawless.  My wife had a chicken tikka.  I had an excellent Haddock fish cake.  Our entrees were not as good, my crab risotto was super salty and my wife's Haddock did not taste ""charbroiled"" and the consistency was mushy.  Our sides did not come out with our entrees and we had to remind them to bring them to our table.  Our second round of drinks showed up at the end of our meal.  We had two or three wait staff, not sure who was in charge.  So issue number two is the indifferent service.
Not a great review for place that gets good buzz in London.",-1
4,"Kind of hard to find or see, don't be deceived by the look of this place from the outside! It's a real gem on the inside, and one of London's top restaurants.
Although a little pricey (hence the four stars) and food portions a little small, it's still a great experience even if you go just once.
The downstairs restaurant has this amazing long fish tank IN the bar so you can gaze at the beautiful sea life while you eat.
The food is what you would expect Asian fusion to be, but not filling enough if you are a burger or pizza kind of person, so be expecting to spend more money than usual here.
The cocktails are delicious, and the puddings are renowned on their own even! People have come from outside just to get the takeaway desserts.",1
4,"Decided to check out the ramen scene in London, this one in particular given that it was one of the higher rated places.
Arrived around 7pm on a Thursday, there was a short lineup but people come and go quickly and we were in after about 15-20 min of waiting. It's more of a ramen bar than a nice sit down place. Very loud and lively, the locals seem to love it.
The staff were not that friendly imo. It wasn't very clear that we were supposed to wait by the wall once entering. We thought we had a spot already because it looked like they were gesturing us to follow the group in front of us. That was awkward. While seated, the waitress ran into my bf while walking through the aisle and didn't even say sorry, just asked him to tuck in his chair when it wasn't even his fault. No smiles given. It's definitely a little crammed in there. 
Anyways, the food. We didn't get any apps or drinks, just the tonkotsu and T22 ramen. The food came reasonably quick, around 10-15min wait. Tonkotsu had very standard ramen broth, on par with Ippudo in NYC. I thought I'd try the T22 because I don't have chicken ramen very often. It was delicious - and there are cock scratchings which added crunch. The broth got a bit salty after awhile though. They use thin noodles which I loved. Overall, very filling and moderately priced.
3/5 for service and 4.5/5 for the food.",1
3,"The service here is terrible! It's too bad because the food is actually decent. The pani puri and chicken lollipops were flavorful. The chicken curry and cauliflower veg dish were okay. Not super authentic but good enough for the price. 
I wish I could give them 3.5 stars. Good enough for quick Indian food, but do not expect anything from the service. It was some of the worst I've ever experienced.
If you want fantastic Indian, I would still go to Dishoom.",-1
3,Dim Sum is tasty and the cocktails are Fab. I went with a group of people the service was o.k.a little pricey so typical for Soho,-1
5,Thought this was great  had a twisted ankle when I went though so getting down the stairs was a challenge. Lovely staff let me use the lift  it was a goods lift though and I think it came out near the kitchen. Nice flavour and very good food,1
3,"London is known for having the best Indian food after the country India itself. When I visited London, I was with an Indian food fanatic who insisted on eating it as often as possible. After hearing about Dishoom and the wonderful reputation it had, we knew we had to visit.
Since Dishoom is so popular, it's well known that you're going to encounter a long line when you arrive. We had read reviews of people waiting up to 2 hours. My sister and I came prepared for the long haul. We weren't going to leave, no matter what. Luckily for us, we waited outside for about 45min (thankfully since it was pretty cold outside). We thought we had finally made it in, but then we were directed to a bar on the bottom floor to wait longer at a bar. I'm guessing Dishoom does this to get you out of the cold, and get some drinks in your system while you wait. We were called to our table about 15 minutes later.
My first impression of Dishoom was how busy it was. The restaurant is loud and filled with voices of people having a good time. Every seat was taken and the restaurant worked like a machine getting people in, feed, and out again. I thought the large restaurant with so many people was overwhelming. While it was a bit off putting, I took it as a good sign that this place is so popular and liked by people, that it's very packed.
To start the meal, we got the vegetable samosas, and the keema pau. Both were the highlight of the meal for me. The vegetable samosas were tasty, and the keema pau was just as good. My main dish is where I think Dishoom failed. I got the Dishoom Chicken Teeka Roll and it was pretty bad. The roll was very dry, there was hardly any taste to it. I have to say, after hearing such great reviews about Dishoom, I was really disappointed. I'm not one to believe in the ""you got the wrong dish"" mentality. I think every dish should be good at a restaurant, not just a specific one. My sister got the mattar paneer and really liked it. 
I wanted to like Dishoom because of the great reviews, but it just wasn't as spectacular as people say. The service was great, the atmosphere was cool (but overwhelming), and my main dish was lackluster. Would I visit Dishoom again? Probably. I would see if I could pick a better dish and enjoy it more (even though this goes against my usual judgement).",-1
4,"Hot on the heels, okay well two weeks after, of Yauatcha being sold by creator Alan Yau to a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority I decided to finally check out the dim sum on offer by the restaurant. The premium price tag on the dim sum has previously prevented us from treating this place as an every day dim sum dining experience but we thought we better get in to check it out before there was any change to the formula that has so far proven to be a major success for Alan Yau.
 Blue is the overriding colour when you first behold the sight that is Yauatcha. Upon entering the restaurant you will see before you an elegant brightly lit modern and cleanly designed room. I'm not sure if bookings are still essential but today at just after noon we were able to dine as walk-ins. We were actually taken downstairs today where there is still a theme of blue from the frosted glass that covers the kitchen and the chefs to the long aquarium running across the front of the bar filled with bright colourful goldfish but suddenly we were plunged into darkness - a Ping Pong-ish style of decor.
 The service is as you would expect in a restaurant of this calibre - efficient, friendly and accommodating. Upon first sitting you are presented with the drinks menu which is an almost overwhelming list of teas and wines. You won't find bottomless pots of simple tea here - not like the pots of tea you get at regular dim sum places at any rate. There's a large variety of blue tea, black tea, green tea and flower tea on also. Not to mention they also have a wide selection of iced teas amongst which I can recommend the Lime and Passion Ice Tea which is my dining partner had and the Melon Ice Tea - both of where were extremely refreshing.
 The dim sum menu features some of the regulars such as Har Gau, Shumai, Cheung Fun, and Steam Pork Bun. There were also a number of items I'd never seen before on a dim sum menu a couple of which we tried out including Ostrich Dumplings (quite delicious and self-saucing) and Baked Venison Puff (very similar to Barbecue Pork Puff but obviously with venison.) As the prices were quite high we couldn't be too adventurous but it would have been interesting to try other dishes such as Chilean Sea Bass Mooli Roll, Native Lobster in Black Bean Sauce, Wagyu Beef Cheung Fun, and Box Dumpling. We couldn't resist the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Ribs, which we also sampled when we went to sister restaurant Hakkasan. They weren't too bad but not nearly as tasty or fall off the bone as the ones from Hakkasan.
 The price tag for our one meal today would have bought us two meals at any other restaurant but it was worth it to check out the hype that is Yauatcha.",1
5,It was my first time trying this palace Ando would say that the food was amazing. I tried the chicken curry and naan. I would definitely stop by to this place where I'm in London.,1
5,"If their take out desserts are a part of the reason for their Michelin star, I can see why. Yauatcha was the last foodie stop I made during my trip in London as I was craving macarons. Unique Asian inspired macarons, yes please! Tip - this is a restaurant, so if you're just here for the desserts, inform the hostess and then make a sharp right to the display of desserts. You won't regret it!
I went with a bag of 6 for 9.80 pounds, which is pretty affordable given Yauatcha's status; they could have easily marked up their prices! The 6 flavors I chose were the coconut, matcha yuzu, apricot pistachio, strawberry, salted caramel, and the sesame. Extra star for the superb service - for my last macaron, I couldn't decide, so I asked for suggestions. The employee recommended the popcorn or the coconut, in which I went with the coconut. To my surprise, she then gave me a popcorn macaron just because! If a popcorn macaron sounds weird to you (it sounded strange to me at first), fear not because it was absolutely delicious! Definitely was one of my favorites! 
Although they were all really good, the other highlights were the matcha yuzu, the coconut, and the sesame. Basically just get the Asian inspired flavors! 
Also, these macarons come packaged in a cute little pink bow, making it a great gift :)",1
5,"We went here  for lunch a couple if weeks ago with our 2 year old son.  From the moment  we walked in nothing was too much trouble and the staff looked after us very well.  The food is incredible, you need to try the lamb  raan and black dhal,  I could eat it every day.  We also had chicken  tikka, raita and rotis,  all excellent.  Finished off with a kulfi  and the best chai  I've had since I was last in India.",1
3,"Ok food. Flavored are generally one dimensional, though well executed. Had the lamb curry good lamb flavor. Dahl was not very flavorful. Paneer kind of tasted like stir-fry. Super spicy. Too bad they don't box up left overs. Big waste.",-1
3,Service was very good but the food wasn't very authentic. It's definitely westernized Indian food.,-1
1,"I really wanted to write a 4 star review after my lunch several weeks ago but I can't...
The food was really delicious but 1/2 weeks after we had lunch at Dishoom they send me an email telling me (in a diverted but not subtle way)that they would love to offer me breakfast if I put a good review on yelp or trip advisor. It is a shame to do such things and I really don't understand since they have hundreds of really good reviews... 
Here I am Dishoom with my 1 star review!",-1
4,"Please note what what other reviewers said - this isn't the place where people push the carts around.  This is more a la carte style, which is a nice change if you want to avoid the loud and busy atmosphere of traditional dim sum.  With that being said, they have the best dim sum and the most creative drinks!  The ambiance is upscale, chic but laid back.  Perfect for a morning dim sum date.  I love the beautiful decor of Yauatcha, and the food matched the ambiance!  All the presentation was top notch and tasted heavenly.  My favorite was the sticky rice in lotus leaf! Don't forget to order their drinks as well - you won't regret it!",1
4,"We went here for a family dinner, without any expectations besides knowing this place is vegetarian friendly, we were stunned at how amazing the food was. 
The people were friendly and helpful, usually known to be pushy, they were polite and tentative. we sat down in these short seats, ordered a few drinks, which were well prepared. After ordering some amazing appetizers, we had a lovely dinner... much of it was small plates, the normal dim sum, just higher quality... One thing stuck out, it was the Wagu Beef item, it was almost like the flakes of a croissant wrapping pieces of wagu beef in truffle oil.... it was to die for! obviously we ordered 4 or 5 of these, but everything here tasted very good, this just won us all over. 
The bakery looks absolutely delicious, although the deserts tasted good, it was nothing amazing in our opinion. It did satisfy, but not to the exceptions left after the food. Great place to have a family dinner or dinner with some friends!",1
4,"I don't know when ramen became the 'trendy' thing in London (a trend which seems to have now passed because I'm so late on the review game) but I'm not complaining, always up for good azn food.
I haven't had the rest in a while but their T22's stellar (is it just me or is their noodles a little skinnier than it should be?) The chicken's more tender than you expect and not dry at all and you just need more of those cock scratchings (lol). 
Buttttt... The best best best thing about this place is its sides. SOFT SHELL CRAB. YES. That green chili ginger sauce is SOOOOOO GOOOOOD! I like ramen and all, but this is why you come back. This and their fried chicken. Yeah, there are a bajillion chicken shops in London but this is FRIED. CHICKEN. Fried chicken that tastes so good it doesn't even have to be crispy to win you over. By the end of the meal the last one right at the bottom of the little metal bucket maybe sitting in a little condensation still makes you go yessssshhhhh.
Apparently they now make their own gin up in Cambridge which is pretty cool. Their MAIKEN-ME (watermelon shochu cocktail) was a bit too sweet for my liking and not quite watermelony enough unfortch but mad props for the g&t!",1
3,"I had just eaten at Ippudo New York the week before, and Kanada-Ya in London a few days before eating here, so I feel like I had a pretty good base of comparison. I wanted to like this more, but I didn't care too much for the ramen here. I liked Ippudo and Kanada-Ya better.
This place didn't feel as authentically Japanese as Kanada-Ya did, and more of a fusion, cheeky-humor kind of place. I felt like I could be in a small ramen shop in Japan when I was at Kanada-Ya, but felt like I could be in SF or NY when I was inside Bone Daddies. This place is much more amenable for larger groups than Kanada-Ya. If you have more than 2 people, Kanada-Ya may not be a good fit, but I think Bone Daddies would be able to accommodate parties of 4-6, but not much larger. The wait is probably much shorter too.
I ordered the Tantanmen which has sesame, chili, minced pork, chashu pork and bok choy. The broth was rich and flavorful, but I preferred the broth at Ippudo NY and Kanada-Ya better. The pork here was a bit on the dry side which was disappointing - it needed a bit more fat in it. Normally, I have no problem polishing off a bowl of ramen, but I didn't finish this one. Noodles were fine, but I preferred the chewier / more al-dente noodles at Katana-Ya.
Korean Fried Chicken Wings - These were huge, and had almost too much sauce on them. I didn't find them really crispy on the outside, probably because there was too much sauce on them. I don't think I'd get these again.
If you're looking for ramen and want more options on flavors and more unique combinations / fusion, then this place is great. It's also good for slightly larger groups and/or if you want to have drinks with your meal. If you want a more authentic ramen experience, head over to Katana-Ya.",-1
5,"One of my favourite spots to eat in London. I've never been disappointed. The wait staff are friendly and the menu is absolutely awesome. 
Menu musts include:
Prawn and bean curd  Cheun fun 
Venison puffs
Pan-fried turnip cake
Sesame prawn toast
Stir-fry striploin beef with deep-fried dough
Stir-fry beef ho fun",1
5,"Amazing food and gorgeous champagne. Definitely too many people serving you but they're all incredibly polite and helpful. Decor perhaps a bit too dark... 
Genrally a fantastic experience but way too expensive!",1
5,"Wong Kei Restaurant is one of my favourite dinner place. I dine at Wong Kei at least twice a week as it is cheap and authentic. Normally, I have eel rice and Chinese tea and it will be about £5.50. Sometimes if I feel like it I will order some fried choi sum and wanton soup. It is a chinese fast food. The service is quick and they will try to get you out as quickly as they can to get more customers. Apparently they earn their pay based on the number of customers the get each day, hence the hurry!",1
3,Nay... the ambivalence is quite nice but theres only a limited selection of dim sums. I hope they can make the dim sums more authentic with more choices...,-1
3,"It's taken me a while to muster up the courage to write this review. Mostly just because I made a reservation 6 months in advance because that's how long the wait time is, so naturally, I was expecting to be blown away. But shoot, how can you not put so much pressure on the place and have your expectations high as heck when you wait 6 months to eat there!? Basically, what happened was I wasn't blown away, and I was sad because I wanted to be. But whatever, I'm going to write about it mostly just for myself because I'm strange and enjoy re-reading my reviews and remembering the experience. Also people may be interested in my point of view, but I really don't want anyone to be put off from going here because of me. 
The conservatory room is the one room that has the ungodly wait for it. If you want a weekend dinner slot, it'll probably be more like 8 months + for a spot. They have plenty of other tables in other rooms that you don't have to wait that long for, but I was all about the special room because it's awesome to surprise yourself on a  random weeknight in January and the prices seemed semi-reasonable for a wait time like that. So anyway LETS GET TO IT! 
We were welcomed and they took our coats and seated us. They put us at a table situation in the middle of the room. It's a relatively small square room and there are tables placed in the corners and side of the room, and then there's a round one smack in the middle. We were at that table and it felt sort of in the centre of everything, not terribly intimate, and we had to sit across from one another so he felt sort of far away from me. It also gave the waiters 4 different angles to approach us, which meant we were checked on a lot. All of these things seem very minimal, but I guess they began to add up over time. We thought it would be a super calm, chill, and relaxing evening, but because there were so many people to take care of us it was not relaxing. Probably 3 different waiters tried to take our order before we were ready. It's not really their fault, that's just what happens when you don't have a set waiter for a set table I guess. I also asked to hold on to the menu, and a second later, another waiter took it up, because that's what happens when you have so many people attending to you! 
It was also quite funny, because there was so much confusion around the tasting menu. We wanted to know if it was possible to order a vegetarian tasting menu and also a fish only one, and they got quite confused. One waiter had to get another to come over and then another came over which made me quite embarrassed thinking that this question wasn't that big of a deal. It also felt like everyone was looking at us because we were literally in the centre of the room. In the end they told us we could only pick 2 options of the 5 and it was to the point where we just though, ""ok, I guess we should just stop asking questions"". I still don't get how the tasting menu works. 
The food was good. We had the Spanish octopus salad and crab and salmon roulade for starters. The octopus salad had plenty of sausage in it which I was not expecting. Ok ok, it does say ""Pig's Trotter Croquet and young leaves"" in smaller print underneath. Derp. The salmon roulade and crab was very tasty. 
For mains we had turbot and the truffle pasta with a side of truffle mashed potatoes and mushrooms. To be honest those sides were totally out of this world and I would have been happy just eating those with the complimentary cheese puff things they give you. Their bread (especially the focaccia! is also delicious. 
I really did enjoy the truffle pasta, but wasn't a fan of the turbot. The room is very beautiful and I can imagine it being even more lovely during the daytime with all the natural light and lovely flowers. We enjoyed the experience but my biggest compliant would be we were ""too taken care of"". Which is a thing. I felt rushed and we were checked on too often. Of course anyone should come here to experience it for themselves. This was just my experience.",-1
2,"supremely average in every way. The sushi is bland, and as sign of a poor sushi place, has no yellowtail (hamachi). I also ordered udon noodles with chicken - the chicken was great, but the soup was tepid, and pretty average. I found the copy writing on the menu to be condescending (slurp your soup and open your mouth a little to take in air as you slurp - it improves the flavour.. (awful)). Ah, but the green tea is fabulous. I will not be going back",-1
4,"A great way of getting some of Alan Yau's quality food without the Hakkasan heart attack inducing prices. Most people talk about the ""funkier"" items like the venison puffs but I actually enjoy the more traditional items like the rice noodles and Singaporean chili crab which are tasty and (shockingly!) pretty authentic. 
Recommend sharing a pot of tea which runs least almost 10 pounds the last time I checked. Close out with the matcha macarons.",1
5,One of the best Indian restaurants ever! So sad this is located in London and no where near Chicago! I dislike Indian food but was so amazed at the quality of the food and the price! I cannot wait to travel back to London to eat here. Try to make reservations as people have been know to wait hours to get in!! You won't regret coming here while visiting London! Wishing I was there right now!,1
3,"its not as that great as it rated. the ramen was very salty. both my friend and i feel the taste of the soup sort of weird. its not that authentic and the environment was just ok. also, i feel theres no reason for the long quene but theres a huge line to wait.",-1
3,"This is the kind of place where I believe timing is essential to your experience. To me, it was busy and loud in all the wrong ways. Coming in on a Thursday night at 7:30PM, I immediately thought to myself that the noise level was way out of hand. Even though we were just three people at the start of the evening, I could not make out what the other two were talking about, even though they were sitting next to me. 
My grumpy mood might have been affected by my hunger, because it was soon forgotten as  the food and drinks finally arrived. In short, the dim sum was all in all pretty good. Not mind-blowingly good, but for the price I was more than satisfied. The dim sums are a bit ""fusion"" - far from any classic dim sum restaurant in Chinatown, but they cater well to a Western palate with safe choices like honey glazed ribs and the like. No boiled hen feet on this menu ...
Although you can't go wrong with the beers they serve, we definitely went wrong with the drinks. The mojito they serve, of which two of us ordered, was the worst I have had. 90% ice, very bitter, and not a hint of any booze in there at all. We ended up returning ours. We had a couple of others that seemed alright, among those a  passion fruit drink. All in all I just think drinks are not their forte.",-1
2,"Disappointing!  I had higher expectations based on other reviews. We ate in the downstairs restaurant.  We sat near the kitchen and could see all of the food coming out.  Everything looked beautiful. We couldn't wait to get ours and dig in. I only wish it was as good as it looked. The butter chicken had a nice sauce, but the chicken itself wasn't.  It was too soft and had no flavor.  It tasted  boiled. Everything else we had was just OK.  The service was poor. During our trip we ate at two other Indian restaurants in London. Both were better, and less expensive.",-1
5,"Stumbled on this gem by accident and it was a real treat!  As soon as we turned the corner we could tell we were in the right place by the aroma in the air.  Dont be discouraged by the lines, grab a drink, socialize with friendly gathering of people in bar area and prepare for an epic taste experience!",1
5,"Oh my goodness I'm soooo in love with Yauatcha. I don't think I was a fan of dimsum before I ate here and now I love. Love love love. Even if i can't pronounce the name.
 I let my friends order whatever the felt was right and they did a damn good job. Highlights were Salt and Pepper squid, Deep fried Quail (it was like posh KFC - fatty and sweet and brilliant) and the sea bass and crab dumplings were pretty amazing too.
 This is the best Chinese food I've eaten in London. There's a great atmosphere. It's buzzy enough to be fun, but dark and quiet enough to be romantic if you wanted to come here with your other half (and it would impress on a date as well - take note people).
 Cocktails are amazing. Huge. With flowers in and stuff. But you don't get drunk. You drink them because they're yummy. They do a ginger mojito thing which is great.
 I love it here. I really love it here. It's not cheap - drinks and dinner will set you back about fifty quid a head (although I reckon if you were a couple it would be much less as you wouldn't order so many dishes between you - maybe about £30?), but it doesn't matter once you're here. It's all worth every penny.
 Can someone please take me back there?",1
5,"Lauded as one of London's most romantic restaurants and just a short stroll from Covent Garden's Piazza, Clos Maggiore is a winner of a setting for a date. The accolades have as much to do with the restaurant's dreamily cherry blossom-filled conservatory as with the menu  which is gorgeous. As far as I can tell anyway: I've only been once and that was to sample their ultimate chocolate menu coinciding with Chocolate Week back in October (2010). The six course tasting menu was as intriguing as it is luxuriant - more a gourmet dining experience than merely a nice meal - and, when paired with their specially selected wines, yielded a delicious flight of flavour for contemplative foodies with sophisticated palates and a sheer delight for any palate otherwise.
 Service is exceptional, the location is convenient and the wine list rocks!
 I'm keen to return for a go at Clos Maggiore's regular menu. In fact, I've already made the rez.",1
2,"Overall, I was disappointed in my experience at Punjab, which has been recognized throughout the world as "" The Oldest North Indian Restaurant in London."" To be honest, I was saddened by my chicken tikka massala (which, to be honest, tasted more like an American chili than the classic dish I expected - waaaaaaaaaay too much cumin in this recipe). The atmosphere was fine, but nothing special, and the food was a bit overpriced for the quality. All in all, this was a rather lackluster experience with food that was average, at best. While Punjab may be the oldest Indian restaurant in London, it's certainly not the best - by far.",-1
3,"Extremely expensive, more expensive than America. Cool ambiance. Good service, good attitude, beautiful sighteseeing, a view to Hyde Park.  It was the most expensive almost 400 pounds for two. Around 8 plates and a bottle of wine.",-1
5,"Had dinner there yesterday with my wife and friend. Perfect Chinese food and amazing deserts. Definitely my go to Chinese in London. Don't miss the Duck salad, and prawn pastry thing in sauce. Take a few macaroons home, especially the salted caramel one",1
3,Nice ambience and service. Seated quickly. Food was good but for London standards was just 'ok'. Lacking salt all around and I'm not one who likes a lot of it.,-1
4,"I liked Dishoom, but I didn't loooove it. 
I love Indian food in general, and this was definitely great, but maybe it was that I'd come with inflated expectations (Dishoom came repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, recommended by everyone I knew), but honestly, I just thought it was good, definitely above average, indian cuisine.
The vibes of the place were great, the chai was tasty, the food was flavorful, but I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes to eat here. 
Everything I had was great, especially the Murgh Malai. This was definitely a table favorite. I kept seeing recommendations for the black dahl, but I have never been partial to dahl and this dish changed nothing. (If you don't like dahl, don't expect that you will like this, it does taste just like dahl.) 
Food was delicious! But again, I didn't think this was mind-blowing in any respect, and I don't think I really was exposed to any flavors I hadn't previously experienced at other good Indian restaurants. It certainly is worth trying, but it isn't worth a long wait.",1
3,"Overall a nice experience, but nothing to write home about.
Our table wasn't ready when we arrived so we were led to the bar. It took about 10 minutes to get the attention of a bar man to get a drink which was a bit disappointing. 
The food was delicious but the menu quite overwhelming. It would have been nice to get a bit of help/suggestions with it. 
The staff made a mistake with my friend's drink giving her a gin and tonic when she had asked for a gin and soda. They then insisted it was a gin and soda, however it unfortunately clearly wasn't and took quite a bit of insisting back that the drink was incorrect. 
The staff also take away plates before you've finished. Be prepared to grab them quick or unfinished plates will be swept away! 
Overall nice ambience and decor. Lots of choice of food. A nice experience but not amazing.",-1
3,"Ambiance:
Super busy and crowded. LOUD music, cannot have a conversation. Waitresses are friendly though and the service is good.
Food:
Fried chicken YUMMMM is a must must must.
Tonkotsu Ramen: The soup is THICK, but the noodles are super thin. More slimy than it is soupy.
The food is okay, but it's not worth the wait. 
I like a homey ambiance with my warm ramen, but this is more of a social bar-like feel. Not for me but seems to be a hit around London!",-1
3,Very good dim sum. Very extensive menu with ok prices for the area. Drinks are a bit watered down and expensive. Service could be improved as well.,-1
3,"So I had lunch at this place the other day. I had eaten at the one in New York before, so I had an idea of what to expect.
The very first part of the experience was the worst part. We got there and saw a line out front waiting to get in. Unfortunately, everyone had to wait on it, both large and small groups. This was a bit disappointing since sometimes a party of two can get seated quickly in a crowded venue. Anyway we waited and it wasn't the end of the world.
Once we got seated, everything was great. There isn't much of a selection here as I think the only things you can get as a main are steak and fries. There could be other options, but we were both quite happy to have the steak and fries.
Basically, the server just asks you how you like your steak and then brings you sliced steak and fries. It was quite good.
After the main course we had deserts which were also quite good.
Throughout the whole meal, service was great.
I would definitely come back here, just not at a peak time. It might be a good place for a late lunch as there was practically no line to get in when we were leaving.",-1
4,"We knew that this place had pricey dim sum but we decided to give it a go anyway and yes, it's an expensive meal but the food was quite delicious. Service started off slow but got better through the evening. 
My favourite dish was the king crab dumplings (the dumpling wrap was well made - not too thick nor too chewy) and the xiao long bao was very good (although Din Tai Fung is still the best in my opinion.. gosh we wish there was a Din Tai Fung here in London!!).
The cocktails were yummy and the desserts were beautiful. Overall it was a pleasant evening.",1
5,"Amazing in every way. I was blown away by the quality and variety of the dim sum and there were so many other things on the menu too! I can't even pick favourites- there's such a rich variety to select from. 
Our waitress was a spitter -what a shame. And those one armed chairs don't cater to big bums so they are a but annoying. 
Malgre tous, They had amazing little cakes for dessert. Oh what a delight! Go forth my children.",1
5,"It would have been easy to let the two hour line on a Saturday night or the ridiculous phone reservation system that kept me on hold for 10 minutes deter me, but I'm glad I didn't. (To be fair I DID see them bring out platters of drinks to the people in that two hour line.) When I got a reservation for lunch on a weekday, I informed the family, ""We're going to Dishoom now! Chop chop!."" 
We sat outside on the charming verandah that gives the illusion that you are sitting inside. (Another interesting decor element are the Crapper brand pull-above-you-to-flush toilets in the bathrooms.)
The samosas were excellent. I loved the addition of cinnamon and clove. Unlike some samosas elsewhere, these were wrapped in filo. The chana salad included pomegranate seeds, golden raisins, and chickpeas, and reminded us of jhalmuri.
The black dal is advertised on the menu as dal for people who don't like dal. I think that's because it's in a makhani-like sauce. We were told we needed it as a sauce for grilled items. After trying it that way I disagree that it's a necessity. I've had tikka lots of times without a sauce. The chicken tikka was very flavorful, clearly marinated for some time and nicely spiced. The gunpowder potatoes were really good and served with yogurt. The naan was fine. 
I was impressed that the children's menu was not dumbed down to only offer pizza and chicken fingers like at many places.. My kids had basa marinated in yogurt with Bombay potatoes (same potatoes as ours) and kuchumber, along with a choice of juice. They had fresh squeezed o.j.
They offered two types of chai - be still my (jittery caffeinated) heart. The regular chai was too spicy and a tad bitter, but I liked the spices. The chocolate chai was really great. I did notice when I got my chai refill that other than the cocoa on the rim of the glass and the whipped cream, it actually tasted a lot like the chocolate chai. Could the cocoa on the rim be masking the spiciness and bitterness? Either way, intriguing...
The food was all uniformly good. It was hard to decide on a best item. We decided it was on par with Sakoon (the husband gave the edge to Sakoon), an Indian restaurant in our city of Mountain View, located in Silicon Valley - another area with a large Indian community. So if you like Dishoom, now you know where to go in the Bay Area.",1
1,"We originally tried to make a reservation for a weekday. However, it was booked. Wow, an indian restaurant fully booked for a weekday. We had high expectations.
Actual dining experience was horrific. Food was bland. Informed restaurant management. Manager argued with us (the customers) saying the food was top notch and flavorful. Where does a  business get off arguing with the customer? Horrible. Will never go back and would recommend not to waste your money on this. There are too many other good indian restaurants in London to pay for this overpriced pompous food.
Also, may want to make sure your dishes are clean. What a waste of money.",-1
4,"This is a good option for groups consisting of people with different dietery needs. Dishes are marked gf and vegetarian, and upon request they will bring you a list of what's currently vegan. The location is nice too, and I can it's imagine gorgeous in the summer to sit outside!",1
3,"Ahhh. What went wrong?? Where was my amazing Indian culinary experience? After weeks of hearing about how amazing Dishoom was, I finally made it to Covent Garden. After 30 minutes in line (6:30 pm on a Thursday), we got a table. 
Between the two of us, we shared the Paneer Tikka, Gunpowder potatoes, Black House Daal, Paneer roll, and Mahi Tikka. Unfortunately, none of the dishes stood out in terms of flavor profile. Good, but not memorable. I expected the dark and deep flavors of the Black House Daal to mesmerize me, but it was served room temperature and more porridge-y. The Mahi in the Mahi Tikka was tender, but didn't contrast with anything, let alone the yogurt it was served with. I did get a lot of the charred, smoky flavor in the Paneer Tikka, but then again that was it. The Gunpowder potatoes were also disappointing. I didn't get the aroma from seeds or herbs at all. 
I really really wanted to fall in love with this restaurant. I think it must be the hype as well as the way all the dishes are described on the menu that makes you have higher expectations. Dishoom was just ok. I wouldn't return for the price.",-1
3,"Food was okay, but it was more a factory than a restaurant...
We came in about 19.10, ordered a soup and a main dish. 19.30 the bill was presented to us (which they took back with them). When i asked for the receipt i got a grumpy face and a not so friendly 'bye""",-1
5,"One of my favourite intimate restaurant in London - good food, good service and one of the most extensive (and all things considered affordable for London) wine list I know in the city.
 Their set lunch menu is great value.",1
5,"Simply superb. Portions are not pretentious, food is exquisite and service is impeccable.",1
4,"Food fab. Relaxed atmosphere. It has always been very busy whenever I have been and we can wait a while for a table. The tables are some what squashed in but in this atmosphere i didn't really mind. The toilets are clean and was fascinated to be able to see the men washing thier hands at the sinks!
Value for money.
Very yummy and will return time and time again.",1
3,"Highly overpriced.  If you're looking to get some great dim sum, I'd recommend walking over three blocks and hitting up Chinatown.  If you want a fusion experience with hit-or-miss dishes, you can give this place a try. 
You'll need a reservation, so be sure to make one online or by phone. 
Things worth ordering:
- Large Soup dumpling.  This is NOT the xiao long bao.  This is a small little pot lined with a dumpling wrap and stuffed with shrimp, scallop, and other delicious seafood bits.  The best part of this dish is the flavor of the soup that the dumpling is steamed in. 
- Shrimp cherng fun - The noodle wrap is very soft, yet not soggy.  The shrimp is also very fresh and crisp. 
- Turnip cake.  They prepare the dish a bit differently than the traditional style, pan frying the turnip cake with an egg.  
Things you can skip: 
- Shumai.  These are tiny and not very good. 
- Small Soup dumpling.  Xiao long bao.  The dumplings have a lot of soup.  One thing to note is that they stuff their dumplings with fish and pork, which is not common.",-1
2,"Pretty Disappointed with this place.  The service was decent and the staff was nice so I have no complaints there.  The steak tartare was pretty good.  Sad to say it was all downhill from there... I had the baked cod and my girlfriend had the lobster spaghetti.  While the pasta was properly cooked the seafood in both entrees was brutally overcooked.... Not just a little over done, I mean absolutely terrible.  At over 80 pounds for a lunch I would expect much better.",-1
1,"I was not impressed with
this restaurant, my boyfriend and I was awfully hungry and stumbled across this
restaurant which had a queue outside of it. Naturally we assumed this was a
good restaurant as many customers were waiting to go inside. The downstairs part was
very busy and a man came to take our names and told us it would be 15 minutes
before being seated. When it was our turn, we were told to go upstairs- as I
went up the stairs, I passed a door which looked like a staff room for the
waiters (little did I know) this is where we would be seated. A waiter opened the door
and took us to our table, the upstairs was crammed! And too close for comfort
as you could not have a conversation without everyone else hearing you!  The upstairs
was just jam packed with tables and chairs with hardly any space to move. Definitely
not a romantic place to go for dinner. The prices for the food
was double for something as simple as rice and stir fried vegetables, but that
is because it's situated in the middle of Central London. There was one thing that I
thought was highly cheeky! Was with our spring rolls they gave us a small bowl
of what looked like Soysauce- I dipped my roll into this and said to my
boyfriend This does not taste like Soysauce, it tastes like Leaperrins, Worcestershire
sauce, to which my boyfriend replied Ofcourse it is, because
they left the bottle next to the till behind you! I was shocked!- I'm not
asian but even I know that was a pure mockery especially to those who know Oriental
food very well. I would not go back there again! Unless you enjoy being crammed
into a sardine tin room!",-1
4,"This place has been very good for years.  Not cheap, but fun and young, stylish atmosphere.",1
5,"I was a bit apprehensive throughout the evening to come to this place and try the food here. It was our wedding anniversary and didn't want any thing to go wrong.
Oh boy! This place is amazing. It is not like any other Michelin star restaurant - there is loud music, fabulous drinks, dim-lit and you have to talk out loud. 
Away from the hustle-bustle of the street noise, we were led by a lady staff to the bar since our we were before time. The bar has an amazing collection and cocktails are delicious. After a wait of 20 minutes, we were taken to our table.We ordered a festive menu including dimsums, and salad, plain rice, chicken, prawns and honey lamb, and finally, dessert. The food were delicious, we enjoyed our time together. The staff is extremely good and they know how to make it special for their customers. Highly recommended.",1
1,"I visited the restaurant last night with a group of people 
I've been a huge fan of L' entrecôte for many years, I hadn't been since 6-7 years 
Service was poor, the waitress didn't speak or understand much English, the fries were cold and soggy, the meat was cold. We complained & returned the plates. Second time around they were a little better but nothing like 6-7 years ago. It was not worth the 45 min wait outside & I will never go back. So sad I always dined at the L' entrecôte  here and in Paris every time I visited. 
They have become negligent because of their popularity",-1
2,"Been to dishoom for many yrs and Shoreditch one a few times. Always the worst experience, the service and food quality. The Lamb chops that I always ordered are burnt in this restaurant, turned in totally black and not hot when the dish arrived",-1
5,"Came here for their Dim Sum Sundays as a way to celebrate turning in our dissertations and completing our Master's programmes. I'm super overdue in writing this as we came here last August and the menu has changed a bit. But it was the most perfect, delicious and relaxing lunch I've ever had. I can still remember it as if it was yesterday!
Besides the food I think a major draw of this place is the atmosphere. The restaurant is hidden away on a tiny side street and when you descend the dark stairs into a wide black-walled yet well lit room it feels very exclusive. The staff are very friendly and polite though I imagine more so when you have a reservation and know exactly what you're doing than if you just happen to wander in. Nevertheless we were well taken care of. We got a nice corner seat with a great view of the whole restaurant. And even though it started to fill up by the end of our meal, we had a sense of privacy the whole time.
I don't think my descriptions of our dim sum would do the food justice so I'll just say this; it was outstanding. Seriously one of the best meals of my whole life. I can't even decide which course was my favourite. Between the cocktails, the appetizers and main meal, to the desserts and the tea I was a huge fan of everything. And it was so beautiful! Nothing I enjoy more than food that is not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing as well. 
As far as I know this is one of many Hakkasan restaurants around the world. Now that I'm back in LA I can't wait to try the one here. I admit this is not a restaurant you go to when you're not a budget. But it's nice to splurge every once in a while. Treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience at Hakkasan. You won't be disappointed.",1
5,"Great vibe, excellent service and tasty food. We did have to wait about 20 minutes for a table on a busy Thursday evening but complimentary drinks were offered before we were led to the bar to wait for our table. We had a bottle of Pinot Grigio, a Bombay martini and a chili martini. All were very good. Once we were seated, we also tried the Dishoom beer which was very good. 
Along with a number of items, the standout dish was the lamb which was falling off the bone delicious. 
Decor is authentic and reminiscent of the old Parsi cafés in Bombay/Mumbai.",1
3,"Oh my goodness, the quality has gone down again.  After two months of  Vegan diet on weekdays and seafood diet at the weekends until our Easter on the 12th, we are back to eating meat.  I ordered my usual Cha Siu with Choi Sum, and the meat was thin and the portion of the meat was very small, it contained carrots and tinned straw mushroom as well; it used contain Cha Siu and Choi Sum only.  The quality of rice plunged; it just tasted like an ordinary long-grain rice and part of it was mushy.",-1
4,"You get a 45 minute booking at this place to scoff your grub and sod off.
Fantastic food though.",1
5,"We went here at 7:30pm without a reservation and there was a 1.5hr wait on a table for 2, so we decided to come back the night after. 
We arrived at 6pm to ensure we got a table (they only take reservations for 6 people or more). The concept is smaller dishes to share. Their food is SO flavoursome and fresh, some of the best modern indian I have ever eaten.
I would definitely go here again, simply delicious!!!",1
3,"Not mentioned anywhere on the menu, but EVERYONE at the table has to order the bottomless bellinis in order to participate. Otherwise, you pay for them individually (6.95) instead of the 13.00 upgrade.",-1
5,"great drinks, great food, great service
with the onset of non-smoking rules, this place has no flaws from my point of view,  it is well worth the money

5,"I'm guilty of not posting any review for Bone Daddies any sooner. I've been here many times and it's my go to Ramen place when I need a fix. I've been to this place since 2015. Bone Daddies has this really hip vibe, you'd think it's a cool bar but it's just really awesome how they made Ramen look cool. First of all, I've not been to a Ramen place that offers you bibs and hair ties (for ladies with long locks). That's really thoughtful. 
The area is smaller than most restaurants. There's usually a queue outside, but the wait is about 15-20mins depending how crowded it is. Its a little noisy, so it's probably not great for intimate conversations. The place is cramp, so you'll find yourself squeezed between people. It's generally not a place to bring babies or kids. Absolutely great for couples and if you're lucky, you might get an entire table for larger groups. 
I usually order the T22 Ramen with Chicken scratchings. It's probably one of my favourite. If you're not into pork all that much, there's that option for you. There are a bunch of vegetarian options as well. So you'll be glad to find a variety. Today however we decided to try something else on the menu:
1. Tonkotsu Ramen £11: Pork belly with Spring onions in 20 hours cooked pork broth
- If you're looking for an easy entrance and introduction to classic Ramen, this would be a good choice. It comes with two flavoured eggs and Bamboo shoots. I usually put in extra garlic and sesame crushed seeds to bump up the flavour. 
2. Curry Ramen £12: Spicy curry broth with deep fried chicken and jalapeño
- Anyone who likes chilli should try this bowl of fire. It tastes as spicy as it looks. Be prepared to have a cup of ice water ready. Also don't be surprise if you suffer the ""ring of fire"" the next day 
As with all good restaurants in London, there is usually a wait. But it's shaded and there's a heater outside. They work very quickly to try serve everyone their food. I've never been disappointed with their services and would definitely continue to come here.",1
5,"I have actually booked here 4 times over the past couple of years and had to cancel each time for various reasons. Finally with the family over from Australia it spurred to try one last time and am I glad I did! The dim sum was some of the best I have had anywhere! My father originally born in China agreed! 
Of particular note the Chueng Fun of any variety - There is something about a perfectly cooked battered prawn inside a warm blanket of steamed rice noodle that is ecstatic to the senses. Also the steamed lobster roll and Venison puffs and spicy pork wonton were incredible. I would love to say we made it through to some of the delightful looking main course dishes on the menu but we simply couldn't get past the Dim Sum menu. Next time it's a promise! 
Oh yes I failed to mention the desserts but sometimes pictures tell a 1000 words.",1
4,"If you come here I'd recommend you eat the BBQ'ed duck...I prefer it de-boned already, because that way I can indulge in it without having to suck the meat off of its natural scaffolding. I cannot say that any of the other dishes have blown me away, but typically what we order is a bunch of BBQ'ed duck (or pork), some rice (to soak up all the juices) and one or two orders of vegetable - I recommend Morning Glor, Bok Choy or Peashoots.
As for the decor and service of this establishment - this is your typical run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant with rather oblivious service and crappy decor...nothing to rave about. But I don't come here for these things...all I want is to tuck into my duck as fast as possible! 
Quack, quack...",1
2,"This is another ramen place in the area...  I think everything about this place is just off... but this is not far off from othe ramen places so please do not be discouraged to go if you are looking for ramen and you are in Soho...  I personally prefer Shoryu over here but that is just my personal preference - they are all technically around the same level, not so great but edible.
Try and see it yourself.",-1
5,Crazy delicious food and friendly attentive service. Come early to avoid the crowds as they don't take reservations. Don't miss the black lentils. I found the menu a little difficult to navigate so ask the waiter to take you through it and order to scale. The bespoke IPA is solid.,1
5,"Exceptionally good modern Indian restaurant. Only negative was the long wait (odd for a Wed night) - although, this is a sign of how popular this place is. Waited about an hour for a seat. They have, however, cracked the mystery of how to provide great customer service in a busy restaurant. From the complimentary chai shots served to those waiting in line to the knowledgable bar and table staff who seemed genuinely passionate about their roles, this is really a stand out place. They also have lots of vegetarian options and you can have a good meal for two plus drinks for around £35. Check it out.",1
1,"The food was fine, but if you are a tourist, check your bill carefully.  I was overcharged and thought that the bill was a little high when it was presented to me, but was in a rush to leave.  When I got back to the hotel, I had a bad feeling about the bill and checked the prices of what I ordered online.  Sure enough, I was overcharged,  It could have been a mistake, but I truly do not believe that it was.  Unfortunately, I paid cash, otherwise, I would go back to the restaurant to get my money back.  It's the principle,  I hate dishonesty.",-1
5,"The best Indian food l've ever had in a clean and contemporary restaurant!!
Would suggest doing family style if, as the plated could be easily shared.",1
5,"Very nice Dim Sum house and it also sells French pastries. The Dim Sum for the tasting menu very good, for £30/2person, it is kind of cheaper than outside. and it is a one star Michelin. Love it, love it.",1
1,"BE WARNED! THE WAIT STAFF WILL POCKET YOUR CHANGE!!!!!
Normally I would have given them a much higher rating but the service CLEARLY was soo bad I have to give them this low rating.
I had ordered the 2-person taste of Yua-Atcha- which was exceptional. HOWEVER the staff was quite rude about stating their policies(they ""never"" allowed take-away - not true) But the main sore point was the fact when the bill came, I paid in cash over the amount(did not have exact change) - now the gratuity of 12.5% had ALREADY been added to the bill's total amount. I waited and waited until finally asked where my change was - she looked confused and walked away. I then asked the manager for the receipt to check the amount I gave them, again he said NOTHING about returning my change. - NOTE TO ALL - BE VERY WARY - I think that they feel that they ""deserved the extra tips....I definitely will NOT be returning to their establishment!",-1
2,"Poor service and bland food. I'm pretty easy to please but neither the food or service could make this a place I would recommend. 
This is an overpriced tourist trap at the best. 
The French onion soup was bland. How does a French restaurant serve bland French onion soup?
Our fries were brought out 20 minutes after the rest of our food. 
So many better places to eat than this and at much better prices.",-1
5,"This place is awesome for so many reasons. Yeah, yeah, yeah the food is great but the entertainment is even better. Entertainment, you say? Oh yes, entertainment. It comes in the form of the wait staff here who make a game out of abusing the guests as much as they can without actually providing bad service. They're feisty, loud and over-agressive but if you know what you want to order you can guarantee that you're going to get it in a matter of seconds and it will be exactly what you ordered. ahunter summed it up beautifully as ruthlessly efficient. I ordered a Tsing Tao beer and it was in my hand before I even finished the last incorrectly pronounced syllable. Oh and it came with one of those old school pull tops. Awesome.
 The food is truly excellent and served in the traditional family style of throw everything in the middle and fight over it. It really made me feel like I was back living in Hong Kong. One of the most satisfying Chinese restaurant experiences I've had in a long time.
 Great location, great food, great service.
 WHATCHOO WANT?!",1
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had one of the best meals in recent history the other night at Dishoom in Shoreditch. For the quality of cocktails and food, in a city like London, the prices are incredibly reasonable. No wonder the place is packed (so be prepared to wait - it's worth it!).",1
3,"This is the little sister restaurant to the famous Four Seasons in Queensway. To emphasise the point, the word 'Queensway' is actually written in brackets on the restaurant sign. 
Four Seasons is famous for its roast duck. For my quick tutorial on the different types of duck in a CHinese restaurant, please refer to my review of the original Four Seasons in Queensway. I think the duck here is good but the accompanying soya sauce is a little sweet for my taste. They also offer it on or off the bone - it costs more to have it de-boned.
I find it fascinating to stand and watch the chef using his big cleaver with the precision of a surgeon to de-bone the duck.
So why one star less than the Queensway restaurant? The service here seems to have taken on the Chinatown shouting rudeness. At Queesnway, they never shout, even when it's stupidly busy.",-1
5,"Stellar!!!  We were on our last night in London in the area visiting friends and wanted a quick bite to eat before heading back to our hotel and upon searching for nearby restaurants, this one caught my eye.   I haven't had dim sum in a very long time and my fiancée was up for it so we popped in.  
We were greeted immediately and sat promptly, there wasn't much of a wait time until our server approached us and explained the menu and took our drink order.  Drinks arrived and we ordered shortly after.  It was no more than 3 minutes that passed that the food began arriving.  It amazed me to see that many people I the restaurant receiving their food so quickly.  
We ordered 6 dishes.  Pork puffs which were packed with flavor yet light.  Prawn crackers which had a nice tangy chili dipping sauce along with it. Crispy prawn balls which had a nice crunch and another great sauce paired with it.  Next up was the firecracker chicken roll which packed some awesome heat, not too much but just right for our palates.  Traditional xiaolongbao was next and there were delicious; seasoned just right and I wish I ordered a second order.  Lastly we had one of the specials which was Crispy duck bao... oh my word!!!  This was the absolute best!  The buns were soft and fluffy, the duck had a nice crunch to the skin and seasoned perfectly and the plum sauce accentuated everything just right.
The service was exceptional and the food was amazing.  This is a must try for any dim sum fan or someone who wants to give some delicious food a go.  Cheers!!!",1
4,"The food and service is very good. The atmosphere is a bit hectic -- very loud and and busy. Not an amazing experience, so it was a bit disappointing.",1
3,"I've been waiting to go to Dishoom for about two years. I had heard it was expensive and that better Indian food was to be (easily) had for the price. But ... I still wanted to go. A lot. 
When my mom visited - an avid Indian food fan and a girl who grew up on adventure books of the British-era India - I finally had a solid reason to do it.
We tried to avoid busiest times so we could get a seat out in the patio, which is fantastically outfitted to feel like 19th century India with lots of wicker and greenery and brass. We still had to wait about 10 mins but had a cocktail from the bar before heading to our ""seats"".
The downside to the eclectically styled patio is that the seats suck. Like royally. They *look* pretty cool and seem fun but the aren't fun to sit in and even worse to eat a meal from. Low slung and laid waaaay back, we perched awkwardly and uncomfortably on the edge the entire time. Ick.
Then I found out why it's so expensive - it's ""sharing plates"" These extortionately priced menu items can be found masquerading as tapas, and they are designed to get you to order 6-7 to share between 4 people at £10+ a pop. Boo. Plus our party didn't want all of the same things.
So we ended up ordering just what we wanted (4 plates plus I HAD to have some cheesy naan) despite the waiter pushing and pushing to order more, more, more!  Spoiler alert: we had plenty of food. 
Another crappy thing about sharing plates as that the kitchen use it as an excuse to send the food out whenever they damn well please. So my husband's sandwich came out 15 minutes before anything else. Sort of awkward for him to eat while we waited and waited for our food.
So ... add a couple cocktails each to the bill and we easily spent probably £150 or more. Yeesh. 
Nice atmosphere and nice food and glad I went, but certainly not desperate to go back.",-1
2,"I came here because of a recommendation from a friend in Los Angeles and thought my tastebuds were in for Nirvana.  The line out the door was a good sign, but sadly my hopes of finding Nirvana at Punjab was not so. I came here a couple times during my last trip to London hoping things would get better.  I did meet some nice people who shared a few of their dishes with me so I was able to taste more than I would have by myself - that's always nice!  There are some good things, but mostly I left with a poor taste in my mouth and bitterness in my heart. 
The service was consistently fair to middlen. Anytime someone comes to take your full order without suggesting appetizers or beverages it makes me feel like they want you in and out as fast as possible. Is this a fast-food joint?  No?  Then let me try to enjoy the experience you have to offer. 
I asked the server for suggestions since every chef has their specialty, but I didn't get any. ""Whatever you feel like"" doesn't sit well with me.
On my second and third visits I ordered different appetizers.  Each were very hot, tasty, fresh and perfectly seasoned with dipping sauce that add the right amount of ""kick-ass"" to your tastebuds.  The stuffed eggplant didn't seem to be stuffed with much of anything (it was cut down the middle and roasted), but I could eat roasted eggplant any day of the week and be perfectly content. 
The chicken Korma was like puréed baby food without any of the flavor or spices you might expect. No cashews, raisins, or any other seasonings you'd normally latch onto to please your palate.  Such a disappointing dish. They wouldn't let me order it ""spicy.""  I was also told that people have nut allergies, so I guess I can't have nuts at Punjab either!  I realize there are different styles of cooking, especially when it comes to south Asian cuisine, but I didn't enjoy the bland nature of this dish which I generally love and call ""my favorite"" at other restaurants. 
Here is what upset me the most and left bitterness in my heart:  I had already experienced different dishes throughout my stay in London at Punjab with a variety of meats, but on my last night I ordered a different chicken dish (my cardiologist would like this).  When I tasted the dish my tastebuds said ""baa baa baa"" and not ""cluck cluck cluck.""  It was lamb, again. I love lamb so I ate it anyhow and didn't complain, but as I was leaving the restaurant one of the owners said, ""I saw that you ordered chicken, but I switched it to lamb because lamb is better.""  I don't mind a prefix menu if that's what I'm ordering, but intentionally changing my order and NOT telling me is WRONG. If you want me to try something different, then give me a taste and don't force your opinions on me.  I was consistently asking the servers for suggestions and they wouldn't give me any!  I already had plenty of lamb at Punjab and wasn't in the mood for more, but I ate it, again. 
How would you feel if you ordered a cucumber sandwich and the chef said, ""I saw you ordered a cucumber sandwich, but what you really wanted was a BLT so I changed it...oh, and you're still paying me for it.""  
I'm generous with two stars.",-1
3,"Fancy a luxury night out? Well good for you, but Hakkasan is probably not the way to go unless you don't mind spending an extravagant amount of money on good (but not great) food and don't mind sitting in the dark or being restricted to a 2hrs stay. Having been awarded a Michelin star, Hakkasan does seem self-indulgent with bouncers at the door, service that opens the door for you, takes your coat and bags away from you and is there at your beck and call. All this and yet the entrance looks like it is the entrance to a seedy nightclub, the decor within is dark and simple as if to hide the fact that they couldn't be bothered to inject some vibrant colour into the place and the seating is not only not that comfortable but the tables a quite close together so it is easy to see the food the people next to you are eating.
Nevertheless, the food and drinks are inoffensive and packed with a good variety of ingredients that you may never have tried before, the staff are well trained, and when they cook a chilli dish they don't hold back.",-1
3,"Been a couple of times to Ping Pong, Southbank, as it has been convenient and not too expensive. Set menues is a good choice. Saves you the hassle of choosing and you get to try more stuff. The food is average - you definitely get better dim sum in Soho. One of my friends mentioned it all tasted more or less the same the last time - think he was right on that occasion. Service has been good.",-1
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy I am totally in love with this restaurant. I've never tried out any dim sum restaurants before and I was completely shocked to find that this place actually had good tasting food. From the ambience to the cocktails that were decently priced I totally recommend this place You will not be disappointed. Service was fast and my waitress was attentive and very helpful when it came down to explaining their menu. Overall I had a wonderful experience,1
3,"This french restaurant looks so warm, cosy and inviting from the outside and it doesn't disappoint. A lovely quality restaurant which is romantic and serves quality food and wine is quite a find in tourist ladden Covent Garden. The staff really look after you and the decor sets the scene for a romantic meal. Definately a place for a special occasion.",-1
4,"I wasn't that impressed when I went to the Covent Garden locale for lunch.  But I loved the Shoreditch locale for dinner.  The space is amazing--even the outdoor line that we waited on to get in.  Arriving at 7 on a Thursday with a group of 5 was a 1.5 hour wait.  But after 25 minutes and a small complementary Bombay Pimms we were in the bar.  They manage how many people can get into the bar area so it isn't too crowded.  We had great cocktails and a few appetizers to tie us over until we got to our table.  
The decor makes you feel like you have been transported and the food is really good.  The Black Dahl is amazing although it has more butter and/or cream than you can possibly imagine.  We enjoyed a variety of dishes and everything was good and we drank interesting cocktails. 
Service was good.
Be forewarned--it is a noisy bustling place AND our waiter told us to order about 15 dishes (3 per person).  I think we ordered about 10 and were stuffed, so don't over-order!",1
1,"Unfortunately, I can't say I had a positive experience. We ordered wonton noodle and a rice plate. The noodle was just okay, but the BBQ pork and duck on rice was terrible. The BBQ pork is supposed to have crispy skin, which was not the case. The duck was all fat. The portion was also very small. We will not come back.",-1
3,The line is about 1hour+ for a Friday night at 8:30PM. Place seats about 6 parties (2-4top) so be prepared to wait!,-1
4,"My husband and I stumbled upon this place by accident.  We were walking down Chinatown to find a quick bite to eat before going to the theater.  My husband asked a complete strangers if the restaurant was good. He said, this restaurant is known for it's rude service but the food is amazing. So hubby decided that this is where we would dine.  
Once insided, we were lead to the second floor and were seated with the couple we asked outside about this restaurant.  The male happened to be a local and his wife was was California.  This meal turned out great!!!  My husband has the wonton soup, I had the crab and corn.  For our main, my husband had crisply beef and I had the spicy aubergine. The service was quite good. We did meet several wait staff.  I thought they were playfully rude which I actually enjoyed.  
This was our first meal here in London.  We enjoyed the food, the service and our impromptu dinner dates.  A big PLUS was the theater (for Book Of Mormon) was just around the corner.",1
3,"Pretty good food. Pretty bad service. While visiting London I wanted to come here because of the great reviews. Unfortunately we came later on in the evening and our waiter was apparently ready to go. He rushed us to order, didn't refill our beverages, and didn't even check on us until he brought the check. We had to tell one of the other waiters to find our waiter for us. 
Since we were rushed to order and didn't get to thoroughly look through the menu we just ordered a few different tapas. Then he kept telling us to order more because what we had wouldn't be enough...it was wayyyyyy too much food! Some good, some just ok. My favorite was the okra fries. I devoured them! The prawns were pretty good just very spicy. I also liked the chicken wrap, basmati rice, and chicken ruby. The samosas were just ok. I didn't care at all for the potatoes. And I don't even recall the bread. 
This was my first time trying Indian food and I liked the flavors for the most part.",-1
3,"It may be a while since anyone eating here was greeted with the then-traditional, What the f~~k you want?, but this was, in reality, one of the things that marked Wong Kei's out ( along with communal seating, now a pretty normal feature  as a tangental comment you have to wonder at big chains like Wagamama taking a leaf from a famously rude restaurant's book). Which pretty much leaves it as a cheap, OK Chinese restaurant ( surrounded by cheap, OK restaurants).",-1
5,"I can image that I'll be here for lots of time in my following four years. Lovely Cantonese food that always remind me my hometown! I truly recommend this restaurant to you but please avoid a peak time, otherwise the service will be even worse :(",1
2,"For the prices we expected high quality. If not from the food at least from the service. However, our main waiter was rude and made us feel like he might spit in our food. The samosas were greasy and lacking flavor, the paneer pakora had been sitting in it's old greese and then reheated. Then the main course arrived and the rice was soggy, which is a sure sign of a bad Indian restaurant.  The kitchen should never have allowed it to come out. We had a Dahl and chickpea curry.  The chickpea curry was good but the dahl was barley editable. Had this been a 20 pound meal we still would have been disappointed but at 60 pounds it was offensive.",-1
4,"I'm always a little wary of China Town which really annoys me. I think it's because I always get lost and have had one to many bad experiences of all you can eat buffets served in a trough! I want to be one of those people that can navigate themselves round windy streets and no the best place to get Crispy Duck and any time of day or night. Alas, I am not... until now. 
OK, so there wasn't much street winding going on considering Gerrard Street is the main street in China Town but none the less I am now quietly confident I can challenge any China Town veteran to the 'best duck ever' stakes. 
I came to meet my boyfriend and his Mum here, the previous night we had had a fight, now I was running late and screaming down the phone because I was lost. The ambiance was not great. No matter, once I got into the restaurant the waiters were so friendly and instinctively poured me a glass of wine that I suddenly began to feel more relaxed. 
There was no pressure to hurry in this place which I think is one of the most important things. We were able to order our Duck and starters and take our time over them. The Duck was as good as I have ever had, really meaty, we ordered a half and we got a big half! 
After a leisurely start we were obliged to order mains, even though we were actually all full. Ordered was: Mixed Seafood and Noodle Soup, I thought this tasted like pond water but everyone else seemed to like it, weird! Salt and Pepper Squid, this was amazing. Best I've had in a Chinese restaurant. The batter was really light and crispy with just the right amount of chili's, there was way to much for one person but I didn't let it stop me. There was also Sweet & Sour Pork and King Prawns with seasonable vegetables. I presume these were also both delicious as I didn't get a look in. 
For the four of us with 3 bottles of wine, duck, starters and mains it came to just over Â£100.",1
4,great up scale chinese food.  really good execution on a lot of classic chinese dishes.  better value that Hakkasan,1
3,"I miss living in Japan. I miss it so much, this was my second ramen outing in one week. The first to Shoryu, the second to Bone Daddies. The atmosphere in Bone Daddies is more hip than a typical ramen shop, but it's tightly packed. Which means there is a lot of rubbing of butts...not as bad as riding the JR Yamanote line in rush hour in Tokyo, but pretty close. Though, the communal seating and bar seating is good for dining out by yourself or if you come with friends. Well, good luck finding seats on a weekend night if you have friends. The place fills up fast. However, I was seated within a few minutes since I was by myself.
I had the Tonkotsu ramen, and I have to say, I do prefer Shoryu's ramen...in egg, broth, noodles, the whole package. Bone Daddies is good, but I prefer Shoryu. Bone Daddies does have some fine, fine fried chicken (kara age).  Everyone around me was eating the soft-shelled crab, and seeming to enjoy it. And there were some cute waiters....just saying. All the waitstaff is really attentive and pretty fun.
The highlight of my outing was watching some chick curl up the ramen noodles with the chopsticks and the soup spoon like it was spaghetti. B****, please, that's not how you eat ramen!!! The hair ties on the table are so you can get you hair out of the way while you slurp it down! 
Well, in the end, glad I tried, but I prefer Shoryu's ramen, especially their egg. Price is similar, but I think Bone Daddies may be a few pounds more expensive. I wish I could put my finger on exactly why I prefer Shoryu, but I think it's worth trying both places for yourself.",-1
3,"The food is good, if perhaps a little over-priced. But this is all about the scene. The guys in black suits on the door, the squadrons of pretty waitresses, the ambience inside, and the people-watching. Get a seat facing the room or you're missing the point. 
For really authentic dim sum, go to Royal China or Top of the Town. But those won't be full of media bunnies in tight suits and short dresses, and you'll go home alone...
If you can't get a table, try Yauatcha, which is equally sceney and has arguably better food.",-1
4,"To be honest I don't know all that much about ramen, but I CAN say that this is delicious. I'm surprised we were seated so quickly on a Friday night, but hey no complaints there! The service was efficient and friendly, no complaints there, and the food came out quickly.
My friend and I both had the tonkotsu ramen, and I ordered mine with extra egg based on Yelpers talking about it. I'm DEFINITELY glad I ordered it, because the egg was delicious. The broth was delicious and rich, so rich I couldn't finish it in the end, though my friend happily did. There's ample noodles so although the price seems a bit steep for what it looks, it is DEFINITELY filling and worth the money. The only downside I have is that the pork could have been cut into smaller pieces instead of just laid in one sheet on top of everything - made for some awkward chop stick work!
On the table is garlic and a garlic press, as well as little bowls of chilli paste, perfect for both of us who like our food spicy and garlicky. You eat around a table communally with others, and although it seems a little tight there's enough space for everyone to be comfortable (unlike the awkward shoulder-to-shoulder seating at Flat Iron). 
I've been dying to come here after a bunch of good reviews and I'm so glad I did! Would definitely go again.",1
2,"My boyfriend and I had a pretty rubbish experience at this branch of Ping Pong. I'd eaten at another one of the chain's restaurants and had a really nice meal (although expensive for what it is).
 On this occasion we arrived around 5pm for an early dinner and everything seemed to go wrong, from terrible service, wrong drinks orders, waiting 20 minutes for the bill and having to endure staff arguing very loudly for all to hear. I took the feedback card home only to discover you have to hand it to your waiter... disappointed.
 Won't be going back to this particular restaurant although I am a Dim Sum fan. Food is lovely but just that bit too expensive to make it a favourite. Hopefully others haven't had the same problem with service that I had.",-1
3,"Smack on again Yelp, this place is !-OK. And that's it.  
The prices are on par for what you get, it's not expensive per se (we paid 25 pounds each for 2 beers per person and dinner), but that was made  Our German server was hot and cold -- he made some decent suggestions for our meal, but for some reason was unable to pull off little things like bringing water and utensils and had to be asked no less that three times for each of those.  It was slightly upsetting when the bill had a customary 12.5% service charge and we felt that the service had been lacking, but as this was a first meeting for the lot of us no one felt they should complain about it. 
Next time my friend, next time.  
Nah, who am I kidding?  With all there is for me to hit in London, why have a next time at a 3/5 restaurant :)",-1
3,Absolutely one of the best Japanese homemade food in London. I tried several other places this week because I really miss authentic Japanese food. Unfortunately many of them are not good enough. Food here is more fresh and authentic. Love their side dishes so I order bento very time. Worthy. Service is good today. One girl was very nice. But the cashier lady was distracted. Of course they should operate a no tip policy because there was no service at all( unless you consider ordering food is a service)Btw last month I also had a really bad experience with the old lady in the cashier desk. So arrogant. Never met such an Japanese in Japan. But well I love the food here so until I find some better options I still will come,-1
3,"Okay, very underwhelmed by the food here.  Came here by myself for dinner based on the generally positive yelp reviews here and not sure if I feel like this place delivers.  Started out with an appetizer of the amritsari fish, then had the main dish of acharri murgha with some plain naan, with a mango lassi to wash it all down.  Yes, food was generally tasty but definitely did not live up to the hype of the amazing quality of British Indian food.  As an example, the fish tasted like it was just thawed frozen fish fried with some spices.  Nothing was bad at all, and I had a generally good dinner, but nothing at all was special.  I've had much better Indian food in a number of restaurants in NYC.  Also, just as a slight aside, I think almost every customer in the restaurant was a tourist, which while not always indicative of anything, in the context of my lackluster meal, does not bode well for the quality of the food. 
That being said, I had no issues with the service of the wait staff.  Everyone was polite and attentive and I did not feel rushed out at any point.",-1
4,"A special occasion treat of a meal tucked away in an otherwise nondescript off-shoot of Oxford St.  You enter amongst some incense burning and down some stairs, so they do a good job of making it feel like you're entering a new environment (rather than the back alley that it is).  The other aspect that we immediately noticed was the abundance of service staff; it felt more like a hotel check-in rather than a restaurant.  Suppose that's what you should expect form somewhere with a Michelin star!
Ambiance was dark wood everywhere, but lighting helped with that and set a nice mood.  The star of the show for me was the black truffle roasted duck, which was bursting with rich flavor.  It's not going to hit the spot if you're looking for a sweet taste, but rather the savoury flavour hits you right away.  The sweet and sour pork was also prepared well and was a good price compared to most of the other dishes on the menu (though probably not going to beat your local takeaway).  It gave us pause like 'What's the catch...', but no ill effects to speak of to date.
Definitely an occasion restaurant as it's quite pricey, but the service and quality of food seemed worthy of a Michelin star.",1
3,"Ah, Nobu. I'd been looking forward to going to visiting you for so long.  Honestly, if I had gone here a few years ago when good food in London was hard to fine, I would have left this dinner with a full stomach and huge smile on my face despite the bill. My 3 star rating here isn't' because the food is bad - because let's be honest, great sushi isn't easy to find in London, but because the value just simple isn't there.  I wish I could say I wasn't disappointed but we left Nobu full on tempura, delicious sushi, dessert, cocktails, saki and a 200 quid bill and I couldn't help thinking of all the other places we could have gone and left just as satisfied for half the price.  
We decided to go to Old Park Lane as it was easier to get a last minute reservation (so no, not Berkley Square!).  Though Nobu is indeed right next to the Park, the view isn't what you would want or expect given the status of the restaurant and I was disappointed during a visit to the ladies' room to see how old and not-charming the walk down the stars was. These may seem like petty things to point out, but when you're paying top notch for dinner (and with comparable places now in London) this just didn't do it for me.
Sorry, Nobu. Maybe I'll like you better in NYC.",-1
3,"Deliciously expensive dim sum, it's worth it if you are celebrating something special or on vacation here in London but definitely not somewhere you can go on a weekly basis (well if you are rich then you can). Try it once at least
Go early or make reservations as the place gets packed quick. Also, service was pretty good, it got slow once we ordered but the initial order taking was prompt, they also were very helpful in elaborating what was in certain dishes as we had some special diet restrictions during our visit.
I can't remember everything we ordered but here are few that I really liked:
Tea: White Silver Needle Tea
Food:
Chive and Prawn Dumpling
Steamed Vegetable Dumpling
King crab Shanghai siew long bun 
Hot & Sour Soup with shredded chicken
So if I enjoyed it why only 3 stars, the slow service after we initially sat down it took forever to get water, then after we finally got to order, it took forever for our drinks to come (at least 10-15 minutes).  It was an unfortunately long and exhausting meal as everything took a long wait.  It took them 20 minutes to bring the tea and all the waiter could say is that he forgot to put the order in -- that's inexcusable considering the prices you pay to eat here.",-1
4,"Fending for myself on the mean streets of London for a few days, I had no idea where to go or what to eat. When I finally exhausted the recommendations of friends, I went in search of something undeniably delicious that I knew wouldn't disappoint me and I wound up in Chinatown, in a well reviewed restaurant, where they waste very little time on decor and atmosphere and they spend all their time on what's important. Roasted Duck.
Simply food. Walk in, sit down, order half a duck with white rice, sit, and feast. The skin was crispy and fatty, the meat was tender and plentiful. I could not have asked for more on a rainy London day.",1
5,"This might be the best meal I have had in London in ten years of visiting. Everything was fantastic: okra fries to start, the chicken ruby, black daal, grilled prawns, lamb chops & garlic naan. I would be surprised if there was anything on this menu that was not very good to excellent. Great location in Shoreditch, fantastic decor and vibe. Great bar upstairs, great service. We (2) showed up at 6:00 pm on a Thursday, waited in the bar for one drink, and by the time we left shortly after 7:00 there was a large lineup. I cannot recommend Dishoom high enough. I'll be back on my next visit.",1
4,"Visited a few months ago and it rocked, literally. A bad-ass asian spot serving straight-up noodle dishes by seriously tough staff with hardcore tunes blasting. We queued for about twenty minutes, but had a delicious cocktail while waiting. The Tonkotsu Ramen was amazing. Definitely worth a second visit, love it as equally as Ross Shonhan's other spot, Flesh & Buns.",1
2,"Food was just average. Bland spices. They don't have ""typical"" indian restaurant food, but the food I tried was bland. Service was mediocre at best, took forever to get check.",-1
1,"Reading the previous reviews I was ""warned"" about the rude waiters but did expect some decent food. I was underwhelmed, to say the least.
 We ordered the 12,50 set menu. The first dish was a mixture of deep fried assortments, which tasted all the same, the plate was lushly decorated with cheap deep fried sea weed. Obviously they do not change their frying oil a lot.
 The duck pancakes that followed were nice, but then again what can possibly go wrong in making these?
 The biggest disappointment of all was, however, the mains: 5 saggy dishes of very low quality food, all of them in sticky sweet sauces. They all looked like they had been prepared hours before and kept in a water bath. The fried rice was evidently done with powdered egg and the meat in the dishes was of very low quality, not to mention the watery vegetables.
 Neither was the food good nor was it cheap for what it was. We left feeling like we had eaten glue. This was the first time that a qype recommendation let me down and I was well embarrassed in front of my guests.",-1
5,"I'd like to give this restaurant 4.5 stars but that's not possible. First of all, I'm not sure why this is the most romantic restaurant in the world, it isn't. The service was good, but not compared to the US. The decor is very masculine. If you're really big on service then you may get slightly annoyed. They did some odd things. For example, if we were finished with a dish, one person would move it to the edge of the table instead of taking it.... our salad came after we had already been eating our entree... I don't mean to be knit picky but when you expect fine dining, you should expect fine service, and I was disappointed. 
We were given some butter with sea salt and small pot of biscuits, in addition to the bread service. We bought a bottle of the Foxglove Zinfandel and started with the Marcellin's Heritage Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit. To be honest, I thought it was just very slightly over cooked. About half of my portion was dry, but for the rest, I felt all the elements were really deliciously and elegantly put together. 
For our entree we both had the Oven Roasted Welsh Rack of Lamb and Chargrilled Belly. They first brought out the lamb to show us before it was plated. I found this step to be very Interesting and it allowed us to really smell the lamb and prepare our taste buds for the dish. This was absolutely delicious! And the best lamb I've ever had. I highly recommend this! It didn't have a strong lamb flavor so if you generally don't like super gamey meats, this is still really tasty! For dessert we had the whites chocolate mousse and fresh gariguette 'volupté' we almost licked the plate clean. We were given a complimentary plate of small bite desserts as well. 
I will definitely be coming back for the food.",1
2,"You get what you pay for. If you have low expectations or came really drunk, you will find this place reasonable or even good. This is not a place to bring your romantic date. 
Food was below average, my friend's fish dish came uncooked and sauce was a mess. My steak was not medium rare, and the shallot sauce was very questionable. 
I was fooled by good Yelp reviews and how busy the place was (and maybe also for candles on the table)... Wish I followed my intuition after I saw cheap paper table cloth, paper napkins and that crazy, badly designed cocktail menu on the table. I had to take it away from me because it was literally burning my eyes and ruining my appetite. 
The only thing I was happy about was the service. The server was friendly and that was about it.",-1
2,"This place was packed. Very loud and crowded inside. This is your American version of ramen. I did not like it at all. The fried chicken was okay fresh but after a lil while it didn't taste good. I guess that comes with fried chicken. 
The tonkatsu ramen was oily and the ramen noodles was not the regular ramen noodles used at authentic Japanese ramen bars.
I wasn't a fan of shoryu ramen venue but I prefer shoryu ramen over bone daddies. By far I loved Kanada-ya ramen.",-1
4,"Even though this place is known for its dim sum, it definitely brings a few twists to the entire experience. The atmosphere is so much more different to those you'd find not too far away in Chinatown, a combination between dark wooden panels, bright blue colours and a very colourful fishtank (I'm assuming filled with tropical fish).
 The dim sum is definitely of a much higher standard with some different twists including a number of dumplings with game meats in them. Of course, you will end up spending a little bit more on dim sum compared to other places, but it's great for something out of the ordinary.
 Their tea selection is also significantly different for those that want something other than the standard Chinese selection.",1
4,"Yuatcha was created by the same people who created Hakkasan. This is a more casual version, with dim sum served all day. I had the King crab Shanghai siew long bun (a variation of xiao loan bao). I didn't like their version really much, Hakkasan makes it better. I was excited that they had chicken feet in chlli black bean sauce here. The flavor was more prominent then normal chicken feet dim sum dishes. The best thing I had here was the prawn and beancurd cheung fun. It had such great texture and taste. The outside was soft dumpling texture, but the next inner layer was the asian churro texture (think chalupa) and filled with deliciousness. For dessert I had the warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelized pineapple. It was disappointing. So I bought some of their macaroons (yuzu chocoloate, coconut, green tea, vanilla, lemon, and chocolate) to go.

2,"Honestly, I don't think this restaurant is worth it. We booked far in advance (online) but were seated upstairs where it's very plain and boring. The server kept rushing us to order, ended up giving us the wrong table's order, and seemed very uninterested in checking in to see how our meal was going. 
I specified on the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary but they didn't do anything special. 
When we went downstairs after the meal and wanted to see the beautiful conservatory, the servers seemed very reluctant to show it to us even though it was half empty! 
The food was decent, service was mediocre at best, and the atmosphere is only nice if you get the conservatory. I honestly wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends.",-1
5,Been several times over the last 10 years and the quality of food has not gone down despite the global expansion. It is a bit over - priced but with a good bar and innovative food great to impress a date or if someone else is paying.,1
4,"I was not entirely blown away, and it was not the best chinese food I have EVER had... But it was pretty good and I still do recommend it. Maybe I was expecting too much. It is also not as pricey as you may expect. With cocktails, appetizers and main dish each, it was about 50 pounds.",1
3,"Very Sexy place! I would go for a special occasion.
Enjoyable dinning experience. Fun drinks to enjoy at the bar with friends or a date.
Food is great, but kinda pricy. If you just want to enjoy some delicious, quality Chinese/Taiwanese food, go to Taiwan Village!!!",-1
3,"Sat at the bar which I was happy to get as a walk-in on a busy Sunday.  But I don't recommend it. The bar is particularly uncomfortable mostly because the counter does not extend out enough to get your knees under it properly.  Also no hooks for bags and purses so where are you supposed to put those things? Wayyy down on the floor is where.  You will also be jostled by people waiting behind you as you eat. I had the fines herb omelet which was fine and came with a side salad that was unmemorable and an equally unexceptional pain au chocolat. All in all a big ""meh."" I might return and sit at a table and have something at which excel.  Maybe.",-1
5,"I still can't believe that I have never sampled the wares at Yauatcha. 
I've often wandered past the minimalist windows and admired their intricate and delectable delights, but until this week I had never set food inside this temple of simple but divine Dim Sum. 
Despite the decor making the place feel slightly like a hotel lobby bar, the food was sublime. We were being treated by a regular who steered us towards some of his Dim Sum favourites and we were rewarded with classics like a moist and savoury Char Sui Bao, the most perfect jasmine smoked ribs and some surprising but delicious 'venison balls'. 
Less awe-inspiring ,but all the while excellently executed, were the prawn and mango crispy parcels, the singapore and mushroom dumplings, but the pumpkin dumplings and superlative soft shell crab (you simply must order it) made up for it. 
The proof being in the pudding, the dessert here was always going to be outstanding. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed when we tucked in to our choices. Sometimes pretty asian versions of French pastries can be a delight to behold but a little disappointing on the tongue, not so at Yauatcha - everything we tasted was exquisite, as well as photogenic. So much so that we bought more to take away for 'tomorrow'...or maybe just a midnight snack!
Oh you should also seek out the mandarine and spicy chili fruit juice in the drinks menu - lip-smackingly good!",1
4,"At the entrance of Hakkasan you are met with two bouncer-esque characters who check your name on the reservation list. I'm not sure what their purpose is because there is a bar down stairs where you can wait for a table to become free when you don't have a reservation and also, when you reach the bottom of the stairs, you are once again asked for your reservation details anyway.
 The impact of Hakkasan is immediate - it is dark, yet shiny, with spot lighting on each of the tables and otherwise night-club lighting. The otherwise cavernous room is split into more intimate areas by large wooden poles which may or may not have been bamboo poles painted black. Its supposed to be a very modern take on the Chinese motiff. Unfortunately no photos allowed!
 The Hakkasan drinks menu was very impressive and contained a good balance of non-alcoholic and alcoholic cocktails not to mention a staggering wine list. When you check out some of the offerings its no wonder that people can easily spend hundreds, or even thousands, on one dinner here!
 The food menu was also fairly impressive, with diverse and sometimes unique offerings, but surprisingly nothing shouted EAT ME which is terribly unusual for me not to mention the fact that the prices were outrageous if not unexpected.
 To my surprise there was nothing on the dessert menu that we were interested in, even if we could fit more food into our very full bellies. Instead we opted for a second round of non-alcholic cocktails - very yummy.
 Overall Hakkasan is definitely a place to be experienced at least once but my recommendation would be to save it for a special occasion though if you're minted, well, I guess you could make it an everyday experience!",1
4,"I am torn.
My Chinese half says: ""WAY OVER PRICED!"" Literally double the price of eating at some places in Chinatown London. And more like 2.5X the price of dim sum in LA/Boston/San Francisco/NYC. This same half of me, usually hates nice, pricey Asian places on principal and prefers hole in the wall cheap stuff with good food over good/cool/any discernible attempts at atmosphere. 
My white side says: ""But, but... its pretty! And there are no chicken feet or weird innards to order around!"" Plus, my non-ethnic eating/vegetarian friends might actually try this. Did I mention that this side of me is also a HUGE sucker for anything chic Asian fusion-y? Plus they DO have some interesting, non-traditional dumplings to try... Ok?
Apparently my less practical side wins on this one. FINE. I'll pay double for your cool atmosphere, Ping Pong. But I won't like it!",1
4,"cheap ok food best out of all Chinese café , but remember its not Authentic Chinese food try one down street but wong kei price and taster way better",1
3,"It was good but honestly I am just as down with Punjab, where you can make a reservation and NOT wait in line for 45 minutes.",-1
5,"Really delicious tapas style Indian food. The venue has dim lighting and little corners a hidden booths to make the place intimate, but comfortable. 
The okra fingers were nice and crispy, the pau bhaji was one of my favorite dishes, it was full of flavour. The paneer tikkam gunpowder potatos, and chicken ruby were also super delicious. 
The least popular at the table was the masala prawns... but I think thats because we were all pretty full by the time they came out! The side of kachumber, rice, and garlic naan all perfectly complimented the dishes.
I highly recommend this place with a group so that you can order more dishes and taste them all! The server was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the dishes. I will defo be back next time I am in town.",1
2,"It had been a while since I last ate at Wong Kei. I didn't remember much of it so I decided to try it again recently. 
If you don't mind being shouted at, your not bothered about the service and just after cheap (but not amazing) food then this place is ok. Personally, I won't be eating there again.",-1
3,"Adequate French restaurant in Angel. There are many to choose from but if you want something cheap then this is ok. You do get what you pay for though.
 On the standard menu starters are £3.95, mains £6.95 and desert £2.95. There are always specials as well with prices going up to £10. Salmon was nice, steak was gross.
 Service was prompt but disinterested & I wouldn't return. I did in fact leave without leaving a tip because our waiter gave a bit of a mad serial killer impression.",-1
4,"OK, So like every other review here I'm gonna say that this place does FANTASTIC ramen. 
That out of the way, they do charge a fair amount, it's ridiculously loud, and the drinks are stupidly expensive.
But, the ramen, is, incredible. The tantanmen is probably my favourite, having been here a few times. The T22 is pretty good too, but doesn't quite live up to the peanutty, spicy brilliance of the former.
I gotta say the tonkotsu ramen was slightly underwhelming, but horses for courses.",1
3,"Chicken ruby - tender and heavenly. Heavenly tender. 
Paneer - too dry and too bland. 
Chai tea - nicely spiced, but could be larger. 
Chocolate mousse - ordinary and not worth the £5+
Pistachio kulfi - subtle and not too sweet. Like. 
Garlic naan - only 1 piece per person?!?",-1
2,"This is a trendy dim sum restaurant which doesn't offer authentic tasted dim sum. Good place for the experience, loved the ambience, and i just cant stop coming here because the place is tres chic. However, for real dim sum, u'uh, this is not the place to go.",-1
1,They can't even make proper xiaolongbao. How dare they call themselves a dimsum place??,-1
5,Cool spot. Great service and experience.  Dumplings are delicious and the atmosphere is fun and causal.  If you're looking for a comfortable setting for some nice Asian food; I'd definitely recommend!,1
5,"This was on my list of places I had to try and I'm happy that I did because it was absolutely amazing!
I've seen lines out the door at other Dishoom locations in London but this one in Shoreditch is more chill and in a really interesting kind of tucked away place. There are two areas to sit in and I chose to sit in the garden (it was heated even in the winter). The atmosphere is really comfortable and service is friendly and fast. 
When you go, you must get the cheese toast! It is kind of indescribable but slightly spicy and incredible. I also got the Chicken Ruby, which was really flavorful/creamy.  Their breakfast food looks really amazing as well, and would love to try it next time!",1
4,"This place is a fantastic experience, great food, near-comedy atmosphere and great great prices.
 Recommended to us by many of our family and friends, we just had to give it try. We'd heard the legends of rude and ruthlessly efficient service and arrived hoping to experience such.
 You definately have to give it a try if you are in the area, its cheap, cheerful and an experience not to be missed",1
3,"I must admit I've become disappointed in this establishment now. 
My mum was visiting for lunch and I missed their yummy perfectly cooked egg and thought I would take her there for a treat.
Yes it is lunch hour and yes it is busy but this is a ramen joint, you know, something where they have the broth pre-cooked and they just dump the noodles and remaining ingredients in to complete the meal?
We waited 20 minutes for the starters. We ordered soft shell crab and a pork/corn croquette. After 20 minutes I complained, I said where is my food? My lunch hour ends in 20 minutes! Waiter went away and then started serving other people.
At this point the starters got delivered. Flagged down another waitress and said I wanted to complain that the 3 different groups who arrived behind us got their STARTERS AND MAIN delivered before us. She explained our starters were fried so it takes longer.
What? Frying food take longer than regular food?
Ramen came with the original waiter. He explained because there was a big group and because it was fried it took longer. I said well then you should have told me frying food takes longer and I would've just told you to bring me the ramen first! He said he didn't know we were in a rush. Mate, I came here before, I didn't need to explain I was in a rush, the food arrived at decent intervals!!!!
I was speechless. It's lunch hour in the middle of Soho which is pretty much surrounded by working types yes? We are not in the suburbs here! I was too shocked to speak and my face must have given away a million words. He explained the croquettes were on the house. 
PAH.
Because of this farce the food tasted horrible and tasteless to me. I was in no mood to enjoy any of this. We had about 7 minutes to chow down the ramen and pay and leave. I was late back to work anyway.
I'm not coming back. Don't do lunch hour if you can't handle it. 
I actually just remembered the same thing happened to me at Flesh n Buns during lunch. My colleague and I ordered 4 starters and 2 mains. After 20 minutes we chased and 2 starters came. After 20 more minutes the other 2 starters came. We had 10 minutes to make main course and run back to the office. They didn't have a takaway licence. We ended up paying for 4 starters and eating instant noodles at the office. The place was empty mind you, it's not like they had a full house to cook lunch for.
DEFINITELY do not come here if you don't have more than an hour spare.",-1
5,"Oh the joy this place has brought me. Starters Okra fries dipped in magical batter and fried, Maatar paneer and Ruby Chicken, spiced lamb chops (amazing), rice raita and garlic naan. My stomach is so grateful for this meal of lovely perfection. Incredible service, efficient, attentive, timely. Add that with a great ambiance and beautiful decor. Dishroom has truly mastered creating a brand that is sure to carry on Long success.",1
3,"It's really challenging to cue for 1 hour when outside it's freezing. Fortunately they brought us a tiny glass of Chai Latte. When we finally entered they said we had to wait for just 20 minutes but it was a lot more. The food was good but unfortunately overloaded with coriander that covered all the flavors. There was a lot of noise. I didn't find it great as a lot of friends of mine said, it was not so bad. I don't think I'll go back there to have Indian food, I'll try something else. Try Veeraswamy instead.",-1
3,"I'm not sure how I feel about this place. I've grew up on dim sum and have had it in HK, Taiwan, China, LA, SF, NYC, etc. 
I went on a Sunday morning with a friend right before the afternoon rush. We got there about 12:30 and it was still pretty empty. Upon walking in, I felt disoriented. It was sleek and sexy and modern-- totally not what I expect from a yum cha place. They also have a macaroon display in the window, which I don't quite understand (since when did macaroons become asian?). 
Service: Pretty good, they tended to be above average for London standards.
Food: It's different. It's not bad. It's actually quite good. It just doesnt really look or taste much like all the other yum cha I've ever had. Pricey though-- 5 quid (at least) for a tiny dish with three siao mai in it. (But I shouldn't complain, since I wasn't paying). I have to say though, I'm pretty impressed with the tea. I can't remember which open we got, but it was light, refreshing, hot, and well prepared.
I guess it must be good since there were other Asian people there, but I still kind of like my old school yum cha/dim sum places better. The prices are really something else too. Call me a creature of habit.
That said, if someone takes you here for free, it's still definitely worth it.",-1
4,"We visited Four Seasons after hearing that the roast duck was good. We got the Cantonese roast duck, another clay pot dish and some tofu. All three dishes were great. The duck was especially good. It is pricey when compared to what we are used to in NY or HK, but the food was good enough to justify the higher price.",1
3,"Our experience was not a bad one... but when you're eating Indian in London man do you have a lot of competition so at this point the food needs to be damn good in order to have a high rating. The service was very good and the wait was not too long on a Saturday evening- maybe 15 minutes. 
Samosas were alright (I feel bitchy saying meh), and the prawn puri and king prawn bunha were also ok. They were slightly disappointing from flavour and temperature. Keep in mind that I've become snobbish when it comes to Indian food in London at this point. I did, however, love the cheesy naan. It's a very subtle light cheese inside the naan and adds a beautiful creamy and fluffiness. It's a nice Indian restaurant in a very good location but you can find much better (and much worse) elsewhere.",-1
4,":) 
The roast duck, roast pork, basically anything BBQ was great here. Came here for lunch and dinner and both times I left super full. 
Must try the duck, but I preferred the pork. It was great and so was the service. The prices were decent and the seating was ample. One of my favourites in Chinatown and the host is friendly.",1
3,"Some nice dishes (e.g., black cod) but I have three complaints:
1) overpriced
2) uneven service
3) celebrity ass-kissing
4) noisy
It is in some ways like all the other Nobus, that is fairly good sushi but more about the scene than the food. A long ways from the good old days of Matsuhisa on La Cienega in LaLaLand.",-1
4,"Came here with two fellow Yelpers on Sunday in a relatively quiet and deserted Soho. We showed up at 1 pm and there wasn't even a queue! We ordered the fried chicken and the chashu pork croquettes as starters, but the fried chicken didn't come until later and was served with our ramen orders, which was a little too bad. Both were very good though! They have a few ramen specials on the board, but I went with the classic Tonkotsu Ramen, which did not disappoint. I also love how the restaurant has garlic crushers on the table, because I definitely think adding one into the soup made a world of a difference. My friends ordered the T22 and they really enjoyed it too. And I don't know what they do to the eggs, but the yolks are bright orange and they sure look unique!",1
3,"Remembered fondly by a friend. Went last evening, great service, over ordered on anticipation. 5 of 10 items did not disappoint, 5 bland. Great drinks. Prices expected and overall worth it.
Companionship the best part.",-1
1,"We visited tonight (Friday 16th March) at around 7PM in a group of 7, having heard so much about the famous duck. I was well aware the place was run down, however didn't mind if the duck was as good as was said.
We purchased a whole peking duck (£38) and several other side dishes (Fried rice, Sweet & Sour chicken etcetera). The waitress was very rude from the off, asking us what we wanted after literally only just sitting down. When she did take our order she was very blunt which set the precedent for the rest of the night.
On arrival we all remarked how little meat there was on the duck and even double checked it was in fact a whole duck, to which she replied it was. The duck ended up being about 2 legs worth of (lukewarm) meat, the rest was just skin and a base of prawn crackers which were used to pad the dish out.
Waitress collected plates as people were still eating, poured most of the wine down the side of the glass/on the table, and didn't say thank you to any member of the party after paying our £170 bill.
TL;DR - Rude servers, expensive food, small portions. Would have rather paid £12 for all you can eat at any of the other generic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.",-1
4,"Great cocktails and very good food. A bit spicy, but hey, it's Indian food. Long line to get in around 7pm.",1
2,"Ping Pong is confused. I don't think this restaurant knows what it wants to be. The servers lacked knowledge and made more than a few mistakes during our time dining with them.
We both the Ping Pong sampler dish, which got us three dishes: a rice/meat bowl, a fried component, and a steamed component.
We were told to order more because the portions were small and we wouldn't be filled. Because they said this, I ordered a fried spicy chicken addition.
It was more than enough. We were both very hungry and ended up being full and ordered too much food.
The ambience doesn't match the look of the store. The music was light house music and it felt like someone was going to ask me to try to drop acid or something.
It was odd and the worst dining experience of my London trip.",-1
1,"After looking at every menu at each restaurant in ChinaTown in the rain late last night, instead of going to the one that closes at 4am, for some reason we went to Wong Kei cos I think we were enticed by the No service charge and no charge for chinese tea lol I know restaurants in Chinatown arent known for the service and value for money but my gawd the service I recieved in here was the second worse Ive ever had!! (The first was in a chinese cafe in Toronto but thats another story!)
 The waiter didnt write down the order, came back to check, repeated the order back to him, later came the dishes except for one, told him but not only did he give me mouth, we never even recieve the dish we ordered!! We didnt say anything after only because we didnt want to spend any more money in there. The teapot came with a streak of chilli oil on the lid, the portions werent big, food was greasy, the place was just dirty with food all over the floor. We didnt even dare to go to the toilet!
 When the bill came, the dish we ordered which we never got wasnt written down either...so clearly he wasnt listening and didnt care and gave me mouth about it! Needless to say, we did not give a tip, never going back even if it was cheaper than other places, the food was greasy I may as well had a kebab probably would have been cheaper and tastier! Next time we will find a chinese restaurant outside of chinatown.",-1
5,"I admit it was a selfish idea to bring my husband here for his birthday. We have both wanted to come here for ages but never seem to remember to, as its smack bang in the middle of Oxford Street/Tottenham Court Road. There is another Hakkasan in Mayfair but we wanted to try the original. We were staying at the Hoxton so we had a nice stroll to the restaurant for a pre dinner drink. Our table was ready for us so we had a couple of glasses of bubbles while we drooled over the menu.
So I'm incredibly greedy, especially so when it comes to eating Chinese. I pretty much wanted everything. My husband reassured me we would come again so that made making choices less fraught. 
So to start the dim sum platter and fried soft shell crab. The dim sum were a picture! Best har gau dumplings I've eve had. The scallop shumai was pretty special too. The soft shell crab was cooked to perfection, juicy and crisp.
For mains we had the claypot poussin, the black pepper rib eye with merlot and chilli morning glory with rice. The beef was incredibly tender, super tasty and I was sceptical about the merlot. The poussin was covered in an amazing sauce.
We were now faced with dessert. Part of me wanted to order more starters after seeing other dishes passing us by, in particular the prawn toast which looked epic! I always get food envy. I had a word with myself and we shared the apple tatin with coffee and jasmine tea.
It was a lovely evening and I can't wait to come back again.",1
5,"Loved the food , 5 stars. Service was slightly pushy. Overall wonderful dining experience.",1
5,"If you are looking for fine dinning & a very romantic place you definitely have to come here. We booked our dinner for our 10 year anniversary back in June. When I made my reservation the only slot they had was for 10:30 PM. Normally this would be ok w/ me however we had our son w/ us during the trip & being jet lag it would be horrible to try to stay awake to enjoy your meal. So a couple days before we departed for London, I phoned them to confirm our reservation. I was a bit hesitant to ask but I did anyways, and asked if they had any opening at all for an early seating and just my luck one opened up for the conservatory area by the fireplace! The whole experience was just amazing! The food, the wine, the complimentary dessert was delicious! All the staff from our waiter, to the host (who helped me get the earlier booking) were just impressive! The place was just beautiful & very romantic! I heard they do a Christmas theme decor in their conservatory, which would be nice to see. On the repeat list for sure.",1
5,"I absolutely loved the bacon naan during breakfast! I ended staying for awhile and so I also ordered from the lunch menu. I ate the black daal and it was delightful!
The bacon naan was good, the daal was amazing! You should definitely come for lunch or dinner. This place lives up to the hype!",1
3,"So... Most people will rate Kanada-Ya with 5 stars.
I would too. I honestly think this was the best ramen I had since I was in Japan. Better than my favourite Bone Daddies.
So why am I giving it 3 stars?
Well, when you go to Wagamama (yes yes it's a chain but it's a consistent and popular one) you get options for different meat in the ramen, and vegetarian options and such.
When you go to Bone Daddie's you also get these options, and you also have gluten free noodles if you so desire or require.
When you go to Kanada-Ya you spend ages queuing but all you can have is pork ramen. There isn't even a vegetarian option. Now this doesn't hugely bother me, but it does mean that I simply cannot go to this place when I am with a significant proportion of my friends who do not eat pork.
The friend who introduced me to this place told me that ramen is only supposed to come in pork varieties. But I guess she hasn't actually been to Japan, or she'd know this just isn't true.
So yeah, if you want a pork based Ramen, you cannot beat this place. It is awesome. But if you don't want pork, go somewhere else. I recommend Bone Daddies.",-1
3,"I went here with a big party and I was impressed with how patient and efficient the service was. The food was not great though - my crab starter did definitely taste of crab but in a way that made me wonder if it had gone straight from a tin to a plate. Pork belly was pretty good and the dessert was standard. I'm giving it 3 stars because of its incredible value even though 3 courses for £15 in London shouldn't be something of a miracle, unfortunately it is and so thanks Le Mercury for that. But really on food quality it's more like 2 stars, based on my one experience there.",-1
4,"Ordered the ""TANTANMEN 2"" which they warned was spicy - but was just fine. The Chicken bone broth is thicker than I was expecting, almost tastes like a peanut sauce. I wish it wasn't as sweet, but overall very delicious.
My colleague ordered the mushroom vegetarian, which I think I will try next time.",1
2,"People are talking about this restaurant and I can see a long queue waiting outside so I could not wait to try their Ramen. The menu is quite simple with only 3 items priced 10, 11 and 13. I order original tonkotsu ramen cost £10 without service charge which is a good price for a bowl of Ramen. However the bowl is so small and I literally can count 3 small pieces of pork. The soup is nice but I did not get it much as well as their noodle in such a small bowl. I complaint about this and the waiter said that's how everyone get it in here !!! 
To compare with other Ramen restaurant in soho, i do not think I will come back here as I will have better choices not too far away. And there is a new big Ramen restaurant coming soon just opposite this restaurant so I am waiting to see how long the queue will last.",-1
2,"Plumped for Le Mercury having never before been. Pack them in (with little room to move and waiters crashing into my chair) and serve it cheap is the name of the game. Decor is lovely and service efficient so expectations were high. 
The Brie starter was adequate however the Moulles was excellent, in a delightful creamy sauce which was swiftly despatched. 
The food went downhill when we received our main courses. The meat of both the Rib Eye and the ""special"" of the day, not veal or pork but thick slab of beef Weinersnitchel, was inedible and akin to chewing gum. We both left most of our mains and when we commented to waiter on quality of meat we were met with a ""would you like to order anything else from the menu"", implying we pay for another main. We declined, polished off our wine and left.",-1
5,"Ok ok I admit Dishoom is really good. I don't love that you know you're going to be waiting at least an hour for food, but, the food is actually really good.
We came here with some friends on a week day evening around 6:30 and waited about an hour. But within 15 minutes we were warm inside and able to buy drinks, and those cold 15 minutes we were offered chai and peppermint tea! So life isn't so hard after all.
Anyway, after the wait we were taken to a lovely table and super cozy chairs. I was really excited to sit in the front area! Our server was very attentive and friendly, and the food was delish. 
We had veggie samosas, lady fingers (fried okra), chilli garlic bread, mattar paneer (veggie curry) jack fruit biryani, paneer tikka and mashed spicy potatoes. Everything was delicious but I was especially blown away by the mattar paneer and the jackfruit biryani. The curry was especially creamy and flavourful, but the biryani was really the star because that jackfruit tasted so meaty and had the best flavour and texture! Yes please I'd definitely get it again.
And I'll come again and be happy to wait :)",1
5,"I've been to Dishoom both times I've visited London, and I can safely say that it's best Indian food I've ever had. No hyperbole in that statement - really and truly I've never had anything that comes close to their dishes.
The experience began with a worthwhile 1-hour (if not longer) wait, and at this particular location, their staff served chai and sherry for the guests waiting in line. That type of hospitality translated its way into every aspect of the dining. Before you're seated, you'll probably order a drink, and I highly recommend the Colaba Colada - pineapple and coconut-cream classic with a Bombay twist: a little coriander, chai syrup, lime juice and dark rum. 
When we were seated after just under an hour, we dove head first into the menu and ordered an array of items:
-Dishoom calamari: a take on classic calamari, perfectly crispy with some delicious Indian spices
-Dishoom chicken tikka: their version of tikka masala but in a spicy marinade as opposed to a thick sauce; perfectly hot and packed with flavor
-Sheekh kabab: spicy lamb kebabs that were out of this world, especially with their raita.
-House black daal: paired really well with the basmati rice and the plain naan
When I tell you that every single item I had was perfect, I'm not exaggerating. I wish they came across the pond to Boston because it's going to be an expensive commute for me to fly to London when I'm craving authentic, unparalleled Indian food.",1
3,Frantically busy even at 6.30pm in the evening before the evening rush...we ordered a couple of ramen before heading off to the theatre. Quick and simple...not sure if it's the best place getting your money's worth as a ramen alone costs around £12 and the ingredients and soup base are pretty standard...nothing special.,-1
1,"Bad service and food! If you want real dim sum, just go into Chinatown instead.
We went for a friend's birthday on a Saturday afternoon. The manager was really rude to our party and did not seem to want to help.
The food is presented nicely but is nothing special.
Very unlikely to ever go again.",-1
2,"To say it's hard to get a booking is an understatement. I had to wangle a reservation from someone in the know for me and my friends.
PROS:
- You might see a celeb.
- The bar waiting area is very nice.
- The starters. The Venison Sausage Rolls was flavoursome and tasty. The Crab doughnuts. Now these were raved upon by many upon research and they are OK.
- They have some lovely house wine (so much so we continued to drink another bottle after)
- We sat at a table but the area where the chefs cook you can sit at.
- The Garden as you enter. Sat outside after eating and enjoying over hearing conversations amongst the rich.
- It's situated in a lovely area of Marylebone. Right opposite one of my fav places to unwind (Monocle Cafe).
CONS:
- The tables all feel a bit too tightly compact to one another.
- It all feel a bit stiff. Maybe it feels like the place to be seen rather than a place to go eat well. And I really couldn't wait to dine at somewhere Nuno Mendes was head chef.
- The eggs Benedict. Biscuit instead of muffin. I really would prefer a posh English muffin than an American dry biscuit. Disappointed to say the least.
- The Lobster Scrambled Eggs. Was horrible in all honesty. One way of ruining an expensive ingredient with one of the most simple. Avoid.
The problem with places like this is that the 'buzz', 'hype' and 'reputation' sometimes proceeds itself. And for those prices and mark up it is not worth it in terms of value. Unless of course you saw David Beckham or some world star perhaps... ;)",-1
3,"31/3/14
Okay.......... Was thinking to change this to 4 stars or not after finish eating my bowl of noodle while waiting for my add on side order hakata roll to come.
Reason to add a star:
1. Ramen still as yummy. I ordered hakata tantan ramen. Nice n spicy. Still loving their chicken kara age.
2. They change their table n chair to proper table!!
Reason on holding back:
1. Table was quite oily and sticky. the stuff that I taking up from the table keep sticking on table which make me think about the hygiene of this consider still new ramen shop.
2. Our sushi didn't come after 20min...... Ask for a waiter to check if they did place the order if they didn't then is ok we ready to pay. He went to check n come back telling us ok Cancelled now!! -_-!!
Okay....... 
2013
Have been looking for an authentic japanese ramen shop for quite some time. Heard bout this restaurant for quite some time and finally we get to try it.
When there around 8pm on a weekday with my friend. No queue. Got seated once we were there. Their table and chair seems to be slightly lower. The chair is like those low bar chair kind.......Not comfortable type. Clearly they do not want their customer to be too comfortable and stay too long in their restaurant.
The day we went we they were giving out free sake for customer. I ordered their house special bone soup roast pork ramen (I think it call tongkotsu). It was yummy. I like it.  We also order 2 sides fried chicken and the green bean edamame. They serve the bean with brown colour rock salt which make it look special. They do give a free side which is vinegar cabbage.
Would give a 4 stars if they have more spacious space and comfy seating for  what the price they are charging their customer.",-1
5,This is probably the best meal I ever had ! Worth every penny ! Not a cheap place but if u had to choose where to spend some cash ! Don't hesitate at all . Every single meal ordered was to die for ! Every dish tasted superb ... I can't explain enough how good the food tastes . One thing for sure ... it's the best food I ever had .although I travel a lot! So far it's my number 1 . Thank u London,1
3,I've been wanting to come here for a while so I was really looking forward to the experience. I ordered an appetizer salad as an entre as I wasn't expecting many vegan options so that was fine. Our table ordered a few bottles of wine to share and we had a really great time. Chiltern is definitely more for the experience (the decor is beautiful and the staff are amazing) than for the food but most of my friends thoroughly enjoyed what they ordered as well. Glad I got to come once but I'm not sure if I would come back.,-1
5,"Easily one of the top Dim Sum restaurants in London. Service isn't as good as the food, but when it is this good you can forgive them. Been going for years and years and plan to keep going.",1
3,"ended up in this restaurant on a hot, sunny and busy saturday afternoon during the summer when there was a culture festival going on on the south bank. 
it wasn't our first choice at all but it was super busy everywhere else. 
the place was nice inside, really trendy will cool round tables which i like so you can see everyone. the menu is interesting will the tick boxes and the little pencils so you circle what you want, it's fun but it's kind of gratuitous - like being cool and being simple, though actually it's kind of annoying in a big group because no one could decide what was going on! maybe a smaller group would have been easier. 
then the reason why this is only 3 stars is because even though yes the food was alright it was very expensive and tiny portions. not cool with me! but hey! That's london!",-1
3,"This is an old school, attentive, formal and fussy french restaurant. Initially I found it all, including the staff, a bit over bearing, and just too formal for my liking. I also thought they seemed a bit unreasonably annoyed with us as two of our party were very late. However I think they did warm up to us, or perhaps we just warmed to them.
Our party was too large to sit there, however smaller groups of four of less can sit in the light and very pretty 'garden' area underneath pink (and surely artificial) blossoms.
The a la carte is not available on weekends. There's a three course set menu only, which actually makes financial sense given that it includes half a bottle of wine.  On the set there were only a limited number of dishes I could order due to my fussy diet - there were many dishes that seems ok on the surface and then on closer inspection were stuffed with shellfish and pork (things I do not eat). I ordered a very delicious gazpacho soup, followed by an intense and tasty duck and a very interesting nougat glace for dessert.
I came out of lunch clutching my stomach for over consumption of so much rich food over three courses (not including the really yummy foccacia at the start!). Overall it was good and I did enjoy it, but the restaurant was just a bit too traditional in attitude for my liking. 
It was also a bit of a shock to find out they actually charged on the bill for the seemingly complementary petit fours served at the end. We were so full at the time, we could have very easily skipped them. Very cheeky and underhand Clos Maggiore, very cheeky of you indeed.",-1
5,"Ok, my favourite ramen place in London! 
Love the deco, very low key, casual. The ramen are great. 
I wouldn't got for a starter for 2 reasons:
1. ramen are big and filling, plus so good, you don't want to have to leave some behind 
2. They are a bit small in portion for what you are paying, which was disappointing
Service is great, super friendly.",1
3,"Felt like we needed to have Indian for dinner!! There was a little bit of wait to get in but it wasn't too bad. 
Ordered the butter chicken and naan for myself! I felt the naan was a little dry and the butter chicken and lacking a bit of a kick that you usually get with the spices. 
Service wasn't too bad. Our only complaint was one of the waiters had knocked down my friend's full bottle of beer and didn't replace it. We had to ask him to do it. 
I think I had high expectations based on other reviews I had seen. So I found Punjab to be average.",-1
3,"Service was spotty and staff. A bit rude. The 3 stars are for the fantastic garlic chicken and naan. The chicken tiki masala was ok, nothing exceptional.",-1
1,"There are so many great places to eat in China Town, I would give this one a miss and try any of the others. I was expecting Bayswater quality food and was was let down once again. It was bland and basic nothing exciting or even that tasty. The service was probably the most appalling I have seen. After we finished our main course we were asked to leave so that they could seat other people! So not the place to catch up with friends, because you won't be sitting, drinking tea, or having a chat after dinner. I made sure there was no tip left after the service we received.",-1
2,"Never in the history of Dim Sum have such small parcels of food been so expensive to eat for so many.
I made the mistake of going here with the family on a Friday evening with no reservation.
They found us a table quickly to their credit as the place was rammed. The service, despite the pace of the place was commendable. Fast, friendly with no fuss. 
My biggest complaint was the food: way too expensive for what it was. 
As a steamed dumpling fiend, the chicken Shu Mai hit the stomach in the right place and in truth, there's something here for all tastes. Thing is, though there's lot of different things to eat, there isn't a lot to eat.
Call me old school but i like to have a lot of Dim Sum on a few plates, rather than half a dozen platters holding three so-so parcels each. You'll eat but you won't be getting satisfied any time this side of the Rapture. 
Ping Pong's all a bit too sanitised and lacks surprise. As for the drinks make sure you actually receive liquid rather than a tumbler full of ice.
 
Considering that there was no alcohol involved, the best part of one hundred pounds for a meal, after which i felt hungry again wasn't a good advert for the popular chain.
The saving grace i guess was the location, on London's perennially busy South Bank but you can't eat a view can you?",-1
3,"We had such a mixed experience here that I wish I could rate food and service separately.
Food: 4 stars. The dim sum came out as it was ready, and it was nearly as good as the dim sum we had in Chinatown in Seattle. The Char Siu buns in particular are not to be missed. It was all hot, tasty, and in good sized portions. 
Service: 1 star. Absolutely appalling. We were ignored for about 15 minutes, then caught the attention of the very friendly waiter for the table next to us. We asked him about how ordering works, and as he was getting ready to take our order, the grumpiest man alive came over and brusquely asked what we wanted. It was clear that he was meant to be our waiter but had been nowhere to be seen for 20 minutes. He took our order and stomped off. 
Things did not improve. Dishes came out in a timely manner, but it took us flagging down the friendly waiter to order a second round. Hot water for my tea arrived 10 minutes after my dry flowering tea ball. We ordered steamed buns that have broth in them (and are served with a spoon to catch the broth), but no spoons were brought over. We had to use our soy sauce dishes instead (serendipitously, our soy sauce was empty so we hadn't used the dishes yet). 15 minutes after we asked for our cheque, I again had to flag someone down (a host) and ask for it again. It came, and I spent 10 minutes waiting for the grumpy waiter to look at us so I could get him to bring the card reader.
All in all, we spent most of our visit being totally ignored by our waiter, who was incredibly unfriendly. We were pretty frustrated with the automatic 12.5% tip, as well, as he definitely didn't earn a penny of it. 
We enjoyed the food, but because the overall experience was so poor, we won't be returning.",-1
3,"I love ramen. I live in NYC and try any new ramen joint that opens. When looking for places to eat on my trip to London I came across Bone Daddies. The photos looked absolutely exquisite. 
The scene is rock 'n roll. Hectic, loud music, hip waiters running to and fro-and packed. 
My wife and I started with the tuna sashimi with citron dressing and fried chicken. Both, where so incredibly salty that they were barely edible.
For Ramen, my wife ordered soy sauce and I the tonkotsu. For sure when they arrived, they were the most beautiful bowls of ramen that I had ever seen. Unfortunately the flavor didn't match the esthetic. While they were very good they would certainly not the best Ramen. They both lacked something. The flavors were off.
The ramen definitely not bad at at. It's just that the whole scene is style over content.
The one thing that we both thought was fantastic was the soft serve black sesame ice cream. 
______",-1
3,Went here for lunch and got half soy chicken rice and Malaysian ho fun. The food was decent and I have no complaints except they charge for Chinese tea which should be a staple. They were also skimpy with the rice and charged a ridiculous price for white rice - over £3 per cup.,-1
5,"Whenever we Come to London, we Come here.  Service and the meals are perfect.  We onay nerde to have diabetic deserts.",1
5,"I don't think they need any extra help getting any more business considering that the lines often wrap around the building. Wonderful food, great value for what they charge. Go early so that you don't have to wait as long.",1
4,"Although the restaurant is small, slightly squishy & the line out the front looks daunting the food is well worth the wait. Great vibe, service and for soho I was amazed with how great the price is! Best Ramen I've had in London. Only 1 option available for Vegetarians!",1
2,"So the trouble with Ramen in London is that most of the ramen places are still predominantly offering Tonkotsu based ramen with pretty thin noodles. I think the reason why they do this is due to the local palate and familiarity with this type of ramen.
However, I'm afraid my favourite ramen is made with a miso/chicken based soup with a much thicker noodle with lots of fresh bean sprouts, spring onions, bamboo and sweetcore. Ideally served with a nice strip (not a slice) of fatty oily cha shu pork on the side.
It's a good place to visit and the atmosphere is pretty vibrant (it's in Soho!). I guess the owners haven't dared to venture too far beyond what the local customers are familiar with. One further example of this is that a popular Japanese drink, calpis is not on the menu but can be ordered as a cocktail?!
Okay, if you ask them very nicely they will serve this for you but I guess it's just too foreign for them to want to list it on the menu. Overall, the place is not bad for a bowl of ramen if you're desperate but I honestly have had much better (and cheaper!) in other countries.
Sadly this is a common trend in London where foreign palates needs to be adapted to the local established expectations. It's more a comment on the lack of adventure and acceptance of exotic flavours of Londoners.
Maybe I need to reset my own expectations in order to really enjoy what this place is all about.",-1
1,There is a reason you dont tip. Worst service in chinatown and that's pretty bad. Cheap meal does not make up for the rudeness from the polish and japanese staff. Avoid this place it has gone downhill.,-1
3,"I used to go here a lot in my teens and the banter from the staff was phenomenal. I went here again after years of absence and now sadly it seems that Wong Kei's unique selling point has gone and it's no different to any other restaurant in Chinatown.
The building itself is pretty big so I've never had to wait for a table and I've been after London protests when numbers are higher than normal.
The food was ok but not amazing, certainly not better than any of the restaurants that surround it.
If you need a guaranteed place to eat, especially if you're a large group then this is the place to go but other than that it's nothing to write home about. Bring back the banter!!!",-1
3,"Ramen is not bad but side dishes are bad! Chicken karaage is made of white meat, very dry. Why not try red meat? Seaweed salad has a whole bunch of other things in it. Can you just serve a simple seaweed salad? And no wasabi in it please.",-1
3,"Nothing special, and I still needed to wait in line for 30 minutes.
I hail from San Francisco where we have a very competitive ramen scene. After eating at Kanada-Ya, I have to say that if this is the best that London has to offer, I feel really bad for people who live in London. 
I decided to come to Kanada-Ya at the last moment, so when I got there about 15 minutes after they opened, there was already a line of about 20 people waiting to get inside. I waited about 20-25 minutes and was allowed inside. Because we were given menus while waiting in line, before I even sat down, I placed an order for the tonkatsu X ramen with noodles cooked hard, umeboshi onigiri and the chicken karaage. I figured that if I was only to come once, I was going to order everything I wanted to try. 
The food came out relatively quickly. The chicken karaage came out first and was the highlight of the meal (that's sad considering that the ramen is supposed to be the highlight). It was crispy, very well seasoned, and the dipping mayo was very good. I highly recommend you order this when you are here. It was a reasonable portion for the price. 
The ramen came next. I prefer the thicker ramen noodles, and these were the thin kind. The broth didn't taste very special. They claim that this broth takes a really long time to develop, etc., but it really doesn't taste like 20 hour (or however long) broth. There were no complex flavors that you would come to expect from a broth that took so long to make. The char siu was pretty good, but when I eat ramen, I expect the broth to be the highlight. 
I don't recommend the umeboshi onigiri. I grew up eating umeboshi and they give you the large, cheap, sour kind, not the expensive honey somewhat sweet and sour kind of umeboshi. Sure they were big, but definitely not worth the price. But honestly, what did I expect from a place that specializes in ramen.
If there is a line for this joint, I recommend going to the Ippudo across the street with no line. There is no reason for you to stand outside in the freezing cold (if it's winter) for 20-30 minutes to eat a bowl of subpar ramen. My friend did try this place out before me, and suggested I not go because this was nothing special, but I didn't listen to him because I just love ramen.",-1
2,"Wong Kei. The best part about this is the name which let's be honest is a bit hilarious. Especially when your aunt keeps saying it in a slightly northern accent. She was raving about the Singapore fried noodles here and since she was the woman of the hour, we went.
The place looks like a canteen on a large scale. Not to worry, I thought, the best Chinese places tend to look unimpressive as they care solely about the food. So I said to myself (no I didn't say ""Self""...I mean who actually does that?) that I'd judge it on the food alone with just a bit on the service.
The service overall was pretty good, barring a slight issue at the beginning where they refused to put two tables together (there were roughly 15 of us in the group). Why you ask? No, not because they were too busy or that they didn't' have the tables (they were about half full at best and could easily seat 100 covers), but rather because they ""just didn't do that"". A bit of an odd response for a restaurant to have as I'd imagine keeping 15 hungry diners in a half empty restaurant is a pretty good idea business wise. So we had a mini-standoff between several angry Indian mums and 2 Chinese guys...needless to say the mums won.
Anyways, finally seated together, I get left with the dubious honour of ordering for the group (as seems to happen more often these days...). Naturally we got several portions of these Singapore fried noodles along with a selection of meat dishes and a roast Peking duck to start.
The duck was alright but by no means up to par with that for the Four Seasons (the lovely restaurant in Queensway or Chinatown not the hotel). It has some decent flavour but too much of the fat had been rendered away leaving the meat just a tad dry. We also ran out of pancakes quite quickly and couldn't get the attention of any of the waitstaff to ask for more.
The meat dishes we had ordered (the typical staples of Westernised Chinese dining) included beef in black bean sauce, pork in oyster sauce and chilli, cashew chicken, and grilled eel. The eel turned out to be a popular favourite despite not being the melt in your mouth bbq eel I had expected. It was grilled with the skin on and a light flavourful sauce. The skin was too rubbery to really eat but had done an excellent job of protecting the tender meat within. The rest of the dishes could not distinguish themselves from the average Chinese takeout but were satisfying in general.
Finally, the Singapore noodles. I love my aunt, but I don't know what she was on about with these things. They tasted a bit bland and limp and lacked any of the fiery bite of other such noodle dishes I've tried nor did it have sufficient variety in texture to be appealing. They functioned just fine as a base for other dishes but then again so does egg fried rice. Overall, very disappointed in this but that might be due to the hype as well. 
Thoughts: It's cash only so be sure to bring a few notes. Price wise it's pretty decent with the whole meal coming up to around £10pp (which in true asian fashion was fought over with each adult trying to pay for all of it). You can BYOB but they will charge you a corkage fee of £3-5/bottle that they see. So bring a case of identical bottles, just open one, and switch out the empties for a full one whenever the staff aren't around!",-1
1,Yelp shows 11 pm close we showed up at 10:30 and were rudely turned away. Awesome customer service !,-1
5,"OK been here a few times and wish I had more money to be a regular.
 We went for cocktails recently and chilled watching the beautiful poeple at work bring. Went for drinks and had these amazing cocktails. The drinks were amazing.
 I had the Lemongrass cocktail and as its one of my favourite ingredients to cook with in alocohol it is even better!
 Left with a box of macaroons and reliable as ever.
 I have eaten here a couple of years ago and will eat again soon as soon as the purse strings have opened up!
 We are planning to go back again in a few months for dinner.
 Just go.",1
3,"Many years ago, my dad told me I could get good Indian food for no more than £10 pp. Well suffice to say not here you can't. From previous experience I was expecting overpriced food, arrogant service and a somewhat standoffish greeting at the front desk. In the main I wasn't disappointed. The food however is very tasty, interesting flavours, so compliments to the chef and to 2 of the many waiters that served us.
My favourite dish was the livers, which were exquisite. 
Why did I come here again I hear you ask? Because my other half needed to tick a box. In fairness it's the wine that really bumps up the bill, so next time I might just stick to tap water!",-1
4,"Agree with most of the reviews here that say that the waiting staff are comically rude.
 This is a typical Chinese canteen - a no frills experience on the inside, but the food is excellent for the price.
 I thoroughly recommend the Cold Roast Pork and Duck on warm rice - real bargain and generously portioned.",1
3,"** Cash Only ** 
This place is decent - large menu and food quality was pretty good.  Not the best Chinese food I've had, but also not the worst.  Service isn't that great (poor actually) as others have noted.  If you want a quick reasonably tasty meal, this place will fit the bill however.",-1
3,"Food: Meh. Ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, naan, garlic naan, and basmatic rice. So, I thought chicken ticken masala was tandoori chicken in a tomato cream sauce. Well, this was very dry chicken breast that was never tandoori chicken in a pretty good tomato cream sauce. Like I said, meh. But basmatic rice and naan was really good.
Service: Good. But who cares if the food is meh.
Atmosphere: Clean, classy, formal.

 For his birthday this year, The Peanut Gallery chose to be taken to Hakkasan. I can only guess it is no coincidence that the papers announced the next day that it is the most expensive restaurant, per minute of dining, in London. Uncanny. Hakkasan seems to be one of those places  you'll either love it or you'll hate it. I'm firmly in the love camp. Soaring ceIlings, dim lighting and dramatic, dark wooden decor reminded me of Buddakan in New York. Unlike in New York, where great grub and a spectacular setting often go hand in hand, it's so rare in London for such a fabulous fit out not to mean the food is complete rubbish. I have heard rumours of too cool for school service and door bouncers  there's NOTHING I hate more. Although they're glamorous with some gorgeous kit for uniforms (I'd wear those blue dresses on a night out) we found service at all times to be efficient, but quite friendly and helpful. I suppose the area when you first walk and face the line up in could be a tad intimidating. It feels like entering a night club and you have your name ticked off a list before you even step inside. But we quickly warmed up to it with a few martinis at the bar (lychee for me, classic for the birthday boy). It's fun place for some great cocktails, even if you don't stop for dinner. Once seated (for our strictly 2 hour time slot of feeding  we arrived early to linger at the bar for a while first), we started with prawn toast and a duck salad. The large, bulbous sesame prawn toasts are in a different league to anything I've had in a long while. They're fleshy and sweet, topped with sesame and served with a side of fried seaweed and enoki mushrooms. (£13.50) The crispy duck salad mixes moist strips of duck with crispy fresh greens, pomelo, pine nut and shallots. Very nice, if a tad forgettable. (£19.50) Our main serving of roast duck with Chinese herbs is soon pronounced by TPG, serious duck addict, to be the best he's ever eaten. It's full juicy, fatty flavour is spiced up by some generous seasoning, and the texture of crispy skin against moist juicy meat is spot on. (£21.00) Moist chunks of peppery, stir fried, rib-eye beef with merlot come spilling from a delicate, spindly nest. Again, big flavours and execution is just right. (£18.80)Desserts are artistic creations. Naturally, TPG has the warm coconut rice pudding with mango caviar and black sesame crunch. I have the gorgeous buttermilk bavarois with blood orange jelly and fresh blood orange. (£8.00 each). Both are stunning, with interesting, indulgent flavours  a party in your mouth. Hakkasan, under chef Tong Chee Hwee, has held a Michelin star since 2003. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is buzzing. Yes, Hakkasan is expensive  expect to upwards of £50 per head for food, and prices can of course soar if you get stuck into the cocktails or the wagyu (there's pair of £58 wagyu dishes). However, you can experience the glamour and some great Chinese food for a fraction of the price if you go for dim sum. It's fresh, interesting and the flavours pack some serious punch. I'll be back.",1
5,"Live this place, amazing vibe. We were happy to wait at the bar for a table as the cocktail list was superb. Food is fantastic, lots of small share plates so you can try a bit of everything and the traditional curries are superb too. Highly recommended!",1
4,"I came to Dishoom with a group of 11 people and can honestly say that I would love to go back pretty soon. 
Firstly, as our group was for 10 I telephoned three weeks in advance to make a booking. The only time slot they could give us was 5:45 which wasn't ideal but, given the popularity of this restaurant, I took. 
The staff were all very pleasant and helpful on the phone, and when I called a week or two before our reservation to ask if they can add one extra person onto the booking, I was nicely amazed that this wasn't a problem at all and done straight away by a chirpy sounding lady on the other end of the phone. 
When we arrived we were quickly seated, skipping the big queue outside. Kind of felt like VIP, actually. Perhaps the waiters came over a little too quickly to take orders as we felt a bit rushed to decide and order. 
The food came out in a good amount of time and I found mine delicious! None of that stodgy Indian food you usually get in other places, this food was light. The portion sizes are smaller than you would expect but it was enough to make me nicely full without giving me tut opportunity to overeat. 
Unfortunately not everyone else in our group felt the same and some ended up ordering a second thing to fill the gap. One person did comment that apparently they could taste that the meat was cooked separately to the sauce and added after, which I personally thought was nit-picking but oh well. 
The food is quite pricey for the portion sizes you get which I feel lets this place down. In terms of value for money, I guess it's lacking but it's pretty obvious that this is a place you wouldn't come to if you're on a tight budget.",1
3,"Thanks to Katie B for organising the Unconventional Breakfast : Iranian / Indian Edition at Dishoom
The one thing that they've got right in trying to bring a bit of Bombay to Shoreditch (I shouldn't really embarrass Nava by mentioning that she went to the Covent Garden branch!) is that they've got the right smell. I'm not sure what they're pumping into the restaurant but in concert with the ceiling fans, it did have the right atmosphere
Fortunately, our party only consisted of 9 people as they wouldn't allow Katie to book for more than 9. For the record, the restaurant wasn't busy, which brings me to one of the bugbears about our visit. The service was slow. Despite there being lots of servers and them walking past our table continuously, it was hard to get anyone's attention
The best thing I tasted was my rose and cardamom lassi. A unique combination for me and it was delicious
My bacon naan was nice but in my book, it doesn't really deserve its spot on Time Out's best 100 dishes in London last year. The akuri I ordered was at least Indian in that the scrambled egg was spicy
A most pleasant way to have brunch with fun Yelpers but only 3 stars for the food and service",-1
3,"Dishoom is solid, but certainly overhyped. Make sure you have a reservation, or be prepared for a very long wait. The interior was great, unique touches and fun elements from India, and the service was also excellent. The food itself was good, middle of the road. 
Overall, good, but over hyped. Great interior and service. Naan bacon roll was tasty but nothing too special, same for the paneer tikka. I'll be back to try a few more dishes, and the ambiance and concept are nice enough that this place warrants multiple visits.",-1
3,"Dinner
Very modern Indian place. I wasn't particularly impressed with food as I wasn't familiar with Indian.
It's not cheap considering what you get but the feel you get is something you'd like to pay for.",-1
5,"Great food, great service! amazing dim sum. I myself had not tried dim sum prior to yauatcha. but ive tried quite a bit after that and this place sits right on the top. the vegetable and chicken dim sum is to die for! 
apart from that, they've got the most amazing vegetable fried rice and desserts too!
should definitely try this place out!",1
5,"In spite of the name, this is a great French (not Italian) restaurant in Covent Garden; expensive but worth it. Good intimate décor (especially if you like foliage), amazing wine list and very good food. Fantastic rabbit starter; very good meats. Pleasant service but could be more attentive. 
Ideal to impress the in-laws or for a romantic dinner.",1
3,"Why is everything in london so expensive... Came to london for a vacation, mid week through our trip of course I start to crave asian food and whats better than a hot bowl of ramen?
Shoryu specializes in tonkotsu soup base which is my favorite.  They have different option for the thickness of the broth.  If you are used to eating ramen def go with the rich broth option as their regular broth was a little on the bland side.  I love the egg as its the perfect yolk consistency.  Service was pretty good also, very fast and attentive.  
While the noodles are pretty good here, it is hard to stomach the fact that I spent almost $100 US dollars here for 2 bowls of ramen, 6pc gyoza and an icecream dessert.  It cost like $30 for a bowl of ramen and $5 to add just an egg...if you are a local then definitely check out this place as their ramen is pretty good but if you are travelling from NY i would say to skip it and save the $.",-1
5,"I love this place! 
Great food, fun drinks, and an amazing atmosphere.  The design was thought of from top to bottom and it all works together for an amazing experience.  
For a quiet afternoon out on the patio or a night out with friends, it's always a wonderful time.  I will be back again and again...",1
3,"I confess that even though I read mixed reviews of Chiltern Firehouse and didn't really have high expectations of the food, I still wanted to go in the hope of meeting Kylie (Minogue) there.  Alas it was not to be and I left sans Kylie as a new bff (her loss obvs).
Firstly, the staff they hire are all gorgeous and friendly.  Our waiter had the most beautifully perfect set of teeth combined with a great French accent that we all couldn't help but gaze into his lovely smile.  And our Sommelier was just charming.  The wine she helped us choose was a perfect match to our food.
The food was a little disappointing.  I ordered the crab donuts, steak tartare, and Grilled Iberico Pork for mains.  Crab donuts were okay but surprisingly not very much crab.  Steak tartare was definitely the highlight as this was served with a deliciously spicy smoked sauce that made the raw beef sing.  Iberico pork was very disappointing.  While the pork itself was perfectly tender and tasty, the accompaniments were a green, sour, slushy mess and did nothing to enhance or compliment the pork.
For the price we paid, I wouldn't rush back in a hurry.",-1
3,The food here was mediocre.   I have had high quality fusion and indian and this place was simply ok.  Had a number of the appetizers and nothing had the flavor or taste of San Francisco.   My main course was the fish which was ok too.  The ambiance is great but the food is less than the ambiance.,-1
3,"This is a very fashon restaurant, is a meeting place for celebrities and it boasts of a superb design, inviting cocktails and a very sophisticated Chinese food. The dishes are well decorated and food is exquisited. The restaurant has soffused lights that create a night atmosphere, I find it very romantic! Maybe the atmosphere is too formal and staff are great! I go there once a month and always experiance a good service!",-1
4,"This restaurant is extremely popular, had good ambiance, food comes out fast and while waiting for a table they serve complementary drinks. They also have decent prices. However, the food is only decent but not amazing and I had to wait 1.4 hours to sit down, although I could order drinks and apps at the bar after waiting 20 mins. I went on a Wednesday night.",1
2,I LOVE Indian food and was excited to try this restaurant. I always order Chicken Tikka Masala at new places so that I can find out how it ranks to my favorite places. The dish was not very good so unfortunately I will not be back!,-1
2,"The food is great. The noise level is simply intolerable. It was so loud that every guest at very at every table had to shout, so the noise level was off the charts. They sat us under a big dome which is the WORST architectural feature ever for a restaurant. I hated every minute of this experience (excluding the delicious food). Install some baffles, and I'll be back. Until then, I'll avoid this place.",-1
5,Excellent on every aspect - dont forget to try the macaroons,1
3,"Gimmicky and a little clumsy. Overall - a pleasant brunch experience. 
The seats on the veranda, whilst lovely to look at, are generally either too high or low for the tables, making a lengthy stay uncomfortable. The seating inside is much better, though the restaurant is quite gloomy for a sunny Sunday brunch. 
Despite having ample staff, the service was very slow. Our drinks and food orders were incorrect, though our server was very apologetic and happy to rectify. 
The food was pretty good though, and that is the most important! Inventive and reasonably priced. We came for the brunch menu, and enjoyed our tapas style selection. I also highly recommend the chocolate chai.",-1
4,"I like the Four Seasons.
Always packed, always a queue wating outside and always a lot of chinese guests.
The roast duck, cantoese duck, BBQ Ribs and soy chicken are delicious. 
The prices are moderate but they charge a compulsory service charge.
Service is chinese style, not overfriendly but efficient.",1
5,Best Indian food in London. I go at least once a month. Pork chops are great! So are samosas.,1
5,"Named one of the 50 best restaurants in the world by a respectable survey,  this place is another of Alan Yaus burgeoning and incredibly popular outposts of Asain gourmet cuisine, Hakkasan must rate as one of the best eating experiences in London. The style is opium-den decadent and the food, although expensive, is mouth-wateringly good and worth every penny. A fun extrovert crowd adds to the allure. The cocktails are out of this world, get any that has lychee, as are the extraordinary desserts. Hard to find, tucked away down a back alley, but once you're there you won't regret it.",1
5,"Excellent meal..  Didn't know what to expect but definitely not your typical curry in a hurry.  Chic dining room, cool vibe.  Waitress was super friendly, attentive and knowledgable.
Best description would be Indian tapas.  Everything is made to share and super tasty.
Highlights were the chili cheese toast, the lamb kabab and the daal.  Would definitely gone back often if I actually lived in London.",1
5,"I love their all you can eat offer on their Dim Sum Sundays. It's bottomless dishes (selected ones only) with a complimentary cocktail if you arrive for 12pm. It's perfect for a big party get-to-gether...no faffing with the bills and you can also order whatever you like, however much you want. We also were left alone to enjoy our menu without the pressure of feeling like you are being watched or needed to give your table up for someone else. It's one of my favourite places to go and chill out with my mates whilst enjoying some decent dumplings.",1
4,"Lovely looking venue, and the best Indian food I have ever had. Booking in advance is essential!
Recently went to Dishoom for a friend's birthday so we were in a relatively large group, so service was a bit slow but I don't think smaller groups will have this problem as other tables were replaced with new customers quite quickly. The food was fantastic and quite while priced. The cocktails on the menu were a bit expensive (London though...), and the chaijito tasted like a regular mojito so maybe go for post-meal drinks in another restaurant/pub in the area. 
The style of the restaurant is influenced by colonial era India and a portion of the bill is used as donation to feed children in India. Definitely will go back on the future!",1
4,"How have I not reviewed Bone Daddies yet?
As a vegetarian this is my go-to ramen stop, offering an alternative to the predictable miso broths. 
Bone Daddies often has a queue, in my experience Sunday lunch time is the best time to avoid this. Music is a little loud, and the high-stall seating doesn't make me feel so inclined to stay here all evening. Bone Daddies will always be a bit of an in and out affair for me. 
The uname-rich vegetarian mushroom broth at Bone Daddies is a solid veggie alternative to the traditionally meaty tonkotsu. At around £10, the price is a little steep, but this is Soho. The mushrooms in this broth are delicious, though on my last visit I got only three pieces of tofu. Inconsistent but delicious.",1
3,"HOW COME MY PREVIOUS REVIEW IS NOT SHOWING??
 anyway, 
Just wanted to say...
 I wonder if NOBU uses MSG in their food OR SAUSES. I keep getting a migrane EVERY SINGLE TIME after eating there. I DO NOT have food allergies and I do not drink alcohol. If I ask the metre'd, I'm sure they will say that they don't use MSG... I wonder...?",-1
5,"One of the best Indian places I've ever tried  they don't have your typical tikka Marsala but they do have a chicken ruby that is a MUST TRY. Great for one person and doesn't come wth rice so you have to order that separate but I'm salivating at the thought of how delicious the sauce was and how the chicken was perfectly cooked. 
The ambiance is super cozy, feels sort of like a den and it's dimly lit and nice for a date or even a bigger party. I love that they're open about later than a lot of other restaurants in the area. 
The front door was a bit confusing (or maybe I'm directionally challenged) but once we found it, the restaurant was the highlight of my night.",1
5,"I am a regular at this restaurant and I must say it is for a good reason. The food is absolutely delicious. Although, it can be a little pricey. The service is excellent and the interior decoration is very good. I simply love the setting.",1
2,"Great in theory...poor in practice!
I should have known that something was wrong when I saw that not a single patron, server or chef was Indian. While the menu screams of the promise delivered by authentic Indian street food delights, the reality is that you end up with deep fried chicken and bland, watered down colored sauces masquerading as spices.
What is really shocking is that people pay so much money to stomach not just the poor excuse for food but the pollution and congestion around Oxford street as well.
My advice, find the place the local Indian people frequent to find real Indian food. And avoid this tourist trap like the plague!",-1
1,"Just to clarify this review does not reflect the quality of the food but the service of the establishment. Although we had a reservation at 5:30 on Saturday 4th Jan we decided to not dine there solely based on the level of service provided. We reached Veeraswamy at 5:20 and were told by the maître d' to wait outside on the street till the restaurant opened. When asked whether we could wait at the long seating area where a couple was already waiting, we were told that the area would get crowded although the sofa at the waiting area could seat at least 5 more. We went down and immediately after another couple walked up. We waited to see whether they would be told the same. But to our surprise they were not asked to wait on the streets as they never walked back out. When we went back to ask about that the maître d' acted as if he was not sure what we were talking about. We decided at that point not to dine there and went somewhere else. To me this is a first and quite discriminating and in most parts of the world would be considered racist as we were the only people of Indian origin who were waiting at that point of time. I was also surprised that an establishment of such stature have such disappointing service. To be fair we were contacted after half an hour but by that point it honestly felt because they had an empty table left. The food may be fantastic but if the service is this bad I honestly can't recommend it to anyone.",-1
4,Super fun and flavorful modern Indian place.  Definitely come early as lines are long and they don't take reservations.  We sat on the patio on a beautiful summer evening and enjoyed a huge range of dishes to share. Cocktails are also creative and refreshing. I can understand why Dishoom locations are so popular!,1
4,"I simply love dim sum and I will go all out to try different venues and types of dim sum. This is an amazing place for dim sum another of Alan Yau's creation! Good things never come cheap, so expect about £40-£50 per head. However expensive, the exceptional food is well worth it! The interior is quite charming, dark and modern opposing to the usual Chinese restaurant setting. It provides quite a pleasant twist from the mundane which complemented the unusual ingredients for some of the dim sum selection as well. The variety of tea leaves available is huge including hand rolled ones as well!
One downside of this restaurant is the service. The place is constantly packed during peak hours and the number of waiters / waitresses is insufficient to cope with the crowded, very often you will need to wait for quite a while before being served!",1
5,"i'm from a very Asian area in the USA and there are two Chinatowns near my house.  I eat Chinese food all the time, yet this is by far the best roast duck I've ever eaten.  Hands down.
duck in London is better than most other places because they are naturally leaner.  the duck was roasted well: crispy skin, scrumptious taste/barbecue, lean indeed.  the renowned sauce which is a well protected secret is the best roast duck sauce i've ever had.  it's not too salty and has a tad of sweetness to it.  the roast duck dipped in the sauce is heaven in my mouth.  the sauce over rice is also great.
the only downfall is that after a while, the duck gets really oily and the bottom of the box/plate is drenched in oil.
the barbecue pork is also extremely delicious, also one of the best i've had.  great marinade/barbecue taste.
the roast pork was slightly salty (but then again all Chinese roast pork is).  the skin had a great crunch to it.
i was vacationing in London for a few days but i had to come here twice!
i ordered the food to go both times.  the cashier/waiter was friendly and helpful the first time.  but the cashier/waitress was gruff and very rushed the second time.  but i still give this restaurant 5 stars for the best roast duck in the world.",1
5,"Excellent Oriental Lunch for £30 in a unique colonial ambiance! Dishoom serves Indian and Iranian excellent dishes that are perfect for share. We got the Chicken Ruby, which was amazing! In addition, we got the Iranian lamb dish, which was also great (a note for the cook: the lamb was just a little bit dry) and the daal, superb! Including two naans, we paid in total 30 pounds. Reasonable prices and excellent plates served in a really beautiful restaurant with colonial style in the heart of the trendy neighborhood of Shoreditch. Do not miss it in your next trip to London!",1
4,"A special dinner place - the food is upscale Chinese, and very tasty. I tried the salt and pepper squid, Fresh Water prawns (spicy and great) as well as some pork and chicken dishes. The real star here is the bar. I have never seen so much elaborate care taken to make a martini - careful attention to ingredients - misting the vermouth, entertaining just to watch. Good whisky selection as well.
Very hard to find without a cab driver's knowledge!",1
4,"I saw a guy here asking for an itemised bill and being told to suck a duck. He started bleating about 'but in a restaurant...' The waiter shouted 'This not restaurant, this eating house!'
Sums it up.
One of life's reliable pleasures is going here by myself with a book and eating duck noodle soup (brought out within a minute of ordering it - 1.5 minuets after walking into the place) and slurping down hot, free tea.",1
5,"The pork-bone broth is mighty and meaty; rich in all the best ways. Good bowl full of other tasty goodness too; just enough meat / veg to go with the ramen and broth.
The T22 was excellent too; a markedly different experience and less intense... but lovely all the same. The cock scratchings are a must regardless.
Kara Age is tasty too, and the cocktail / beer / sake selection is good too. Yet to be let down by a choice I've made here.
Also like the atmosphere. Ramen is not a civilised or pristine thing to eat; nice to have a loud, noisy and chaotic place in which to not feel at all self-conscious about slurping and generally diving in.",1
3,"It was a good experience.  We've been curious to try this place, but every time we check it out, there's a long line outside the door.  Oddly, it wasn't that busy around noon on a weekday.  By the time we left though, there was that long line outside again.  The service was pretty good.  The food was not bad.  Maybe, I overhyped myself about this place.  It sure is popular in Covent Garden, but I would eat here again if someone else paid :) Otherwise, I wouldn't crave it.",-1
3,"Bone Daddies is okay. My friend and I both got the tonkotsu ramen. While the broth was okay, I thought it could have used more flavor, and I thought the noodles themselves were pretty basic. The pork, however, was great!
I think what it comes down to is this: Bone Daddies is more of a trendy, hipster spot than an authentic ramen joint. Great if you're looking for the former (this is the kind of place where your menu comes on a clipboard) but a bit disappointing if you're looking for the latter. Maybe they make up for it with the free hair ties?",-1
4,"As a Cantonese girl I had extremely high expectations of this place. And I have to say, the dimsum was the best I've had in London, quality-wise. Mmm we ordered all the classics and my boyfriend's favorite was the venison puff. For me, loved all of them (although the vegetable dumpling could have had more flavour). Price-wise over-the-top and I would have preferred to sit downstairs because upstairs the tables and seats are strangely really low. So book way in advance for this.",1
2,"We dined at this restaurant after freshly arriving from Paris to London for the first time.  We looked for good Indian restaurants on Yelp! and this was a well reviewed one.  We had a 20 minute walk from the hotel to this place and decided to stop for a fruit juice on the way (my wife was starving and it was hot).  As soon as we got into the restaurant, one of the server rudely said ""No outside drinks allowed"".  And then continued to tell us that we can go drink it outside and come back.  When I say rudely, I mean he was kind of ordering us and making us feel uncomfortable as if we just sneaked a drink in at the Movie Theater.  So that was a bad first impression.  
The Menu looked good though.  Much more choices than usual.  I ordered Kadai Chicken with Garlic Naan and my wife ordered some Yellow Daal with Chappati.  The Daal, Chappati, and the Garlic Naan were good.  The Kadai Chicken, on the other hand, was really bad.  I could barely bite into the chicken it was so hard.  
After our first bad impression, the service was not bad.  I think it is important to treat your customers with respect and ""ask"" them to ""please"" refrain from bringing outside drinks instead of ordering them and making them feel uncomfortable in front of other customers.
The food that was good was average.  The food that was bad really takes the rating down another star.  And the outside drink incidence takes down another star.",-1
1,"The worst service I've ever encountered!  Not only did they charged us for food we didn't ordered, but they cursed us out in Cantonese when we told them about food we didn't received!  When we complained about the service, they threw the change on the table and said bye bye, in a nasty, condescending way. Don't come here!",-1
3,"the food was great. it was definitely expensive, but the food and atmosphere is worth it for a special occasion. however, i knocked it down a star for the service. it was bad. i experienced this across london. you expect such a nice plan to have excellent service, and it should for the price, but it didnt. it was very gluten free friendly, so points there including a special GF appetizer for me. hardly any GF dessert options though. i'd give it 3.5 if i could, but i was so annoyed by the bad service i chose 3 stars.",-1
4,"Cakes on their own are happily affordable, but price is bumped up when it's dressed up as a dessert. Impressive place to take someone for dessert. Smart without feeling overly formal. 
However, the tea system is strange- I've never been to a Chinese restaurant where tea is steeped first and then put in a teapot with no leaves..",1
5,"Really love this place! The food is so tasty, just great. Recently I went here 2 times in one week. Both time we had the menu taste of Hakassan with a perfect cocktail. Expansive but worth it.",1
1,"beyond terrible. I would give it 0 starts if I could. The service is unbelievable, well...there isn't any. They sit you at a table then disappear until you physically have to get up and hunt one down. Everything we ordered on the menu was out of stock, the restaurant was full and people all around us were being told they didn't have this item or that item, even the tea, I was told they'd run out of jasmine tea. Took an hour for the food to arrive and it was insipid and cold and tiny portions. The bill was incredibly bad value for the food and service we recieved, in fact we and many others around us refusedd to pay the full amount. They even had the cheek to add a 10% service charge which amounted to £5.50, for service which we never recieved! avoid at all costs.",-1
5,"Update: We enjoyed our meal on our second visit, but this time at their Mayfair, Berkeley Square location. Much nicer people, and good service and not rude door bouncers. Perhaps the Hanway Place staff should take note.",1
1,"This place is the definition of hipster. Meaning that although the cuisine is international, unless you are young and trendy looking, don't count on decent service. 
My partner and I were initially seated in the veranda. Mind you, it was 31 degrees outside and their definition of insulation included a few random space heaters.  The veranda was half empty, although there was a long line out the door.  As we didn't feel like eating dinner with our coats and beanies on, we asked to be moved inside. Clearly we should have been more specific, as we were then moved to the loser basement space for those of us apparently not cool enough to be seated in the general restaurant area. Again, we were seated in a subpar, half empty dark area away from the general crowds. This was disappointing, as we were looking forward to enjoying the restaurant experience, including the ambience. I echo the sentiments of other yelpers that although the food is pretty good, the service is too cool for school. If you're not a hipster, expect to be treated poorly.",-1
5,"Really don't understand the people who compare this to some San Francisco dim sum. This is a completely different league of its own and yes I have tried sf dim sum, Sydney/ LA/nyc /Hong Kong/ Dubai /Auckland ... . This is not about size or price and Americans always make everything too big. if u want that then go to a supermarket and microwave at home.  Yauatcha is simply some of the best dumplings I ever ate plus fantastic combinations like the soft shell crab with curry almonds or fried squid with oat. I never tried the meat here so not sure. Only seafood or veggies and it's all been excellent quality . No msg or frozen prawns reheated and soaking in cheap oil like most restaurants in most china towns... This is simply high end fantastic quality. As for the friendliness of staff , that's perhaps the only issue... But hey I'm here for the food... U don't get Michelin stars for bad quality. And the truth is most Chinese restaurants serve cheap fast turnaround food. Not here",1
3,"Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but it was more like dim sum fusion.  I knew it wouldn't be like the traditional dim sum I'm accustomed to because it's so expensive, but something's were just done better traditionally. Example = har gow. Sticky rice was really good. The pork belly with truffle was super super fatty. The crispy aromatic duck was really dry. The macarons are to die for. I tried the toasted rice, pistachio, passion fruit and the caramel. All very good.",-1
1,"What an incredible disappointment.
This was possibly the most pompous and underwhelming restaurant to which I've ever been.  
The problems started with our cocktails, which even after requesting they not be made sweet, came out as if they were made with tablespoons of sugar.  Gross.  The waitress' condescension began here, by the way, with her arrogant proclamation (when we ordered) that the drinks were not made anyway but perfectly.  Yeah, whatever. They tasted like drinks teenagers would drink.  Amateurish.
Our appetizers were a mixed affair.  The herb paneer was excellent; the softest cheese scented with nutmeg and cardamom.  The crab cake however was dry and flavorless, it tasted like chewing seafood sandpaper.  How do you screw up a crab cake?
At this point, 20 mins later, still no water as requested when we ordered our drinks.
Our entrees arrive.  Again, a mixed affair.  The chicken tikka was good, not great; a solid blend of sweet and smoky spices.  The saag however was dismal, it tasted like spinach run through a blender and slopped on a plate without any seasoning. It was inedible.  My wife's veggie platter was so-so, a couple dishes were good, the aubergine was poor.   
But at least our water now had arrived! Small victory.  But at the end of our meal pretty much, accompanied by an apology from our waitress who blamed the bar. For the 30 min delay -for water.  Nice.
Last, and this would fall under the insult to injury category, we asked for the remaining food to be packed to go except for the spinach and aubergine, and requested the addition of a naan. I then had to hear a lecture on how naan is not meant to be taken away and how would it rot in daylight or to another's touch outside the restaurant and (this part is no exaggeration) the chef gets very mad if patrons do takeaway. 
Are you fucking kidding me? I couldn't believe how arrogant and pompous this waitress was.  Who cares what the fucking chef thinks, it's a piece of naan! 
Please pass this on to the chef and to the owner: if the food was as made carefully and service as half as polished as you manicure your inflated sense of ego, you'd be getting more than 1 star.  And put a Kevlar vest around the chef's delicate heart and tell them the spinach and crab cake sucked ass. 
So many other places we've been to like Roti Chai and Dishoom outclass this place in terms of food quality and service, skip this place and spend your money elsewhere.  What a waste of time, money, and patience.",-1
5,"Hands down, among the best ramen I've ever had.
It's really hard for me to say this, especially because I am notorious among my friends and family as being obscenely picky when it comes to food. But I have yet to experience a ramen that could match or best this place. Even Samurai Mama's in Brooklyn, Minca in Alphabet City, and the best Japanese places from the East Village, San Francisco, and Los Angeles were nearly as good as this place.
The one catch - it is expensive. And crowded.
However, there is something to be said about walking into a Japanese spot when you're not anywhere near Japan and seeing that it is packed with all the hip young, tattooed Japanese urbanites, Japanese yuppies and bankers as well as smiling young Japanese girls with their big cameras and little purses. This is the place for you.",1
1,"At first I thought it's a good place to bring friends there, showing them Japanese food style, but the problem is I only ordered one set but the restaurant charged me extra one , that's 22pounds! And no one remind me there is something wrong with that!",-1
5,"This is a fabulous place to eat. Gorgeous and atmospheric interior and delicious food. There are definitely lots of people there who are there to be seen but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of food beautifully prepared. Only thing is that it can be a tad on the expensive side, so it's a great place to go as a treat/for something special.",1
2,"2 stars for ambience.
0 stars for food.
Crab stuffed donuts l, first were NOT donuts more like hard bun.  Crab nonexistent ~ lots of egg to cover fact no crab!! Way too much mayonnaise.  Do not order these.
Tempura Aubergine was tasteless served cold, and sauce was ""supposed"" to be miso.  Did not taste a drop of miso.  Very bland sauce.
Chargrilled Padron Peppers, were NOT chargrilled, hot, tasty.  No salt, a whispering of ricotta salata did not give any additional flavor.  They needed Maldon salt, but cold and watery they were.  Very disappointed in food.
Burger quality was poor, overcooked tough meat. Fries were warm, but tasted perhaps frozen from restaurant supply??? 
Just mediocre foods  at best.
Then to make matters worse a bearded bartender was extremely rude to me when i was taking a photo of bar, which was empty!! He said ""you can not take photos!  Such a stern rude voice, and i did not understand, so he repeated quite rudely again.  So he then says hotel policy, i relied i understand.  But why was i treated like this.  How was i to know?  No signs, no clue... so perhaps the next time he interacts with guests like this perhaps a softer voice, a nicer approach and not such a horrible glare.  I almost left.   In a way i should of considering the food and rude bartender.  Waitress was adorable sweet, soft and kind mannerism.",-1
2,"Just returned from this restaurant.  This is a fun upscale place with mostly quite good Chinese food.  Close to 200 pounds for a rather light meal for 3.  We ordered drinks and food.  Was slightly taken aback when soup and appetizers arrived before our cocktails--but didn't think much of till our mains arrived before the rest of the appetizers and grew cold before we got to them. The dim sum plate was above average and very pretty to look at. The taste was good, but no where near as good as you'd find at a place catering to a primarily Chinese clientele.  The reviewer who said the har gau were the best ever has probably not eaten many. The cocktails were quite sweet even tho the waitress had told us they weren't.  The duck salad was very good;  the sweet and sour Berkshire pork was so-so: the pork not crispy an the accompaniment heavy on the onions with a few bell peppers.
When we finished they offered us dessert.  We chose some tea and while we were drinking it, we were asked to vacate the table-another party was waiting for it and there was a 2 hour limit!  So that was the reason for the slapdash service--they wanted to turn our table.  When I complained to the manager he said this was a policy of the restaurant, that we had been informed of when making the reservation (I didn't make so perhaps) and that we'd been called to remind us of that (an absolute lie).  The crucial point is that at no point when in premises were we informed of this and we were offered tea and dessert when we didn't have time to drink it.  Also,  I couldn't help but notice that many of the people seated near us had been there when we arrived and didn't seem to be under a curfew.  The manager did English Officiousness very well; giving a sh-t, not well at all.  As much as I enjoyed the classy, fun atmosphere and some of the food,  I would never go back.  Food 3.5.  Atmosphere 5.  Management 0.",-1
4,"First off, the service is here is crap, if it is existent at all. Surly waiters dump your dishes down, never bother with requests for tea refills, and give you your bill before you've finished eating.
 But fortunately, that's the worst of it. By persevering, you'll enjoy good food at a low price. I normally get the duck rice or the 3-meat rice, which is good value considering the amount of meat you get. But I would advise anyone coming here not to order any of their wet noodles, which can be fairly bland.
 Food comes quickly too, so after some grocery shopping at Chinatown, here's a place you can go before running home.",1
5,"Pants-wettingly expensive dainty plates of cute, asian perfection. With macaroons.
 Yauatcha is deserving of all its credentials, and is an oasis of calm cleanliness in a particularly filthy bit of Soho. It's mind bogglingly expensive though, with no real set menu, so you can really rack up the bill if you're not paying attention.
 I have been in to pick up macaroons, since they're nigh-on perfect for London. Go for lunch if you can persuade someone richer to pay for it, otherwise just go for tea and cake. It's lovely.",1
3,"We never had steak and frites before and you would think that we would head over to Paris first to try it.  Hubby found this place on Yelp and since it was close to where we were heading, we decided to give it a try anyways.
The servers were mostly all french hence the restaurant's name and even though we came right around lunch time, we were able to be seated fairly quickly. 
Just like most of the reviewers, steak and frites is the only thing on the menu.  You let the server know how you want the steak to be done and in a few minutes, you see them bring over trays to the counter and our server started preparing our dish.  
I thought it was interesting that after we were finished with our first dish, she came back again with the rest of our steak and frites to replenish.  It makes us feel like we were in a buffet but then realize that it was just the rest of our steak.  I think I would've been fine having them give it all to me at once but I guess it's the experience.
Most of european restaurants now bring over a portable credit card machine to finish the bill transaction which is good IMO.  Definitely cuts out alot of CC fraud if any.  Although I can't say the same for this restaurant since we felt like we were robbed of our money when the bill came out to be $70 US for lunch.  That's the most we've ever paid for lunch and frankly, I think I would've been ok with a croissant sandwich in one of those takeaway restaurants. 
So yeah, doubt we'll ever come to eat at this place especially when the pounds are so dang expensive compared to euro dollars now.  Oh well, live and learn. =D",-1
3,"Fuel up and go
A great place to go if you are on a budget and also if you are very hungry ! The food is good and plentiful and complimentary jasmine tea is given (tip: when you want a refil leave the pot lid open and it will be efficiently re-filled). The drinks list is limited but reasonable priced. I've been going here for years and the service doesn't really change... it's quick and efficient but don't expect pleasantries. You don't get a choice of where you sit (either which level or table). Mostly you end up sharing one of the large circular tables with other diners. Taking this into account I have never had a bad experience here and it all adds up to a quirky dining experience. The decor is basic but varies from floor to floor, I think the best room is the first floor by the window if you are lucky enough to be told to go there !",-1
5,"This is by far London's trendiest place for Chinese. Walk past the bouncers and down the stairs into a decadent dimly lit lounge. It's definitely a hot scene so be sure to dress the part!
Usually places like Hakkasan are more about the vibe and B-list celebrity spotting than the food, however, that is so not the case here. I went to Hakkasan last month for a friend's birthday. We had an elaborate tasting menu, which annoyingly had to be vegetarian, but was still quite the feast. 
One tip, if you do the vegetarian tasting menu---some fake meats are clearly better than others. The black pepper vegetarian chicken and surprisingly the fake pork (or what tasted like vegetarian pork) were divine. I never had such tasty vegetarian food, seriously and I've been to Saf! The fake shrimp on the other hand had a less desirable gelatin texture though the sauce was great for my rice.
For drinks, the cocktail and sake menu is extensive. There is a fantastic and slightly eclectic range of house martinis---get the cucumber saketini. 
This isn't a proper review unless I also describe the toilets, and specifically the tiny woman who guards the door to the facilities. She is as diminutive as the door is massive. I'm still not sure how she can sense when you have left the toilets and how she musters the strength to open the insanely heavy door. Bizarre comment, I know, but check it out yourself! Everyone who went to the toilets commented about the WC attendant.
In summary, if you are in the mood for some tasty and very very scene-y Chinese look no further than Hakkasan.",1
3,"Michelin rated, so you must have high expectations. I'm not saying that they weren't met, but they weren't met with the friendliest staff.
For a party of four, we ordered: (with prices in pounds)
1. Char siu bun - 4.80
2. Steamed vegetable dumpling - 4.20
3. Lobster dumpling X 2 - 9.80
4. Spinach dumpling with prawns and cuttlefish - 5.20
5. Wild mushroom dumpling - 5.60
6. Venison puff - 5.20
7. Aromatic duck (half) - 29.90

10. Hand pulled noodles with mushroom
Desserts
1. Exotic pandan - passion fruit, mango, coconut and pandan - 8.90
2. Chocolate lux gateaux - milk chocolate, golden raisins, liquorice
All in all, it was a good dining experience that was close to the office. The total bill came out to be $375 USD. Not my cup of tea for basic dim sum. I'd much rather shell out 1/4 of that price at a hole in a wall.",-1
4,"My mother was in town recently and we all went out for a final dinner at Yauatcha. 
The Food was delish. Simply presented, but every mouthful was an experience. To quote my boyfriend: ""the food was blindingly good."" The food came out in a well paced manner where we were never waiting for food, nor did we feel rushed, even though we had a return time on the table reservation. Our Waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable. 
The room itself was open and nice enough - not unpleasant, but not somewhere you would want to hang out for an extended amount of time. not to mention the music was a bit thumpy, although the chairs were so low that my ankles hurt from being cramped. It actually was so uncomfortable that i had to half take off my heels under the table. 
Im rather glad i didnt see the bill. i have a feeling it was not for the light of pocket.",1
1,"Awful from head to toe. How are you even related to Hakkasan? More importantly, how do people rate you so highly?
The short version: chaotic mess of a service, blaring music, Wagamama-level food.
The longer version: We arrived a couple minutes early for 8pm reservations for my birthday. There was already a queue--of people who had reservations. We waited 40min to be seated, and meanwhile there was no place to sit, no bar, no apology, just a harried-looking man at the front desk looking panicked.
The waitress who took us down plowed ahead at speed, clearly feeling rushed; forget the fact that heels + slippery stone stairs down into the basement =/= me sprinting after you, lady. She essentially abandoned us at our table, leaving us to find the coat check ourselves.
While the upstairs is fairly quiet and chill, the basement is like a bad nightclub. The music was so loud and so repetitive in its beat (imagine the stereotypical nightclub scene from the last show you watched: it was like that) that we couldn't hear our waiter. The seats are super low; neither of us is particularly tall, but we felt like we had our knees up to our chests and were sitting in kiddy seats.
When our waiter finally found us, it was to plunk down the chintzy-looking vinyl-bound menus and run off to see to another table. The menu had plenty of overlap with Hakkasan, so we were fairly hopeful that the quality would be similar, especially since (if I'm not mistaken) it's Yauatcha which has the Michelin star. The waiter kept cutting me off, and so my partner ended up ordering everything. Forget asking questions; he either didn't know the answer or couldn't be bothered to find out.
The first cocktail tasted like turpentine, and the waiter apparently had a hard time understanding why it was a problem. It wasn't a matter of a cocktail that wasn't to someone's taste; it tasted like pure (and cheap) vodka rather than something that cost as much as a main.
Once that was (begrudgingly) replaced, the appetisers started to show up. Everything was decidedly lacklustre, and we kept comparing the dishes to their parallels at Hakkasan--an easy thing to do considering that many of the dishes literally just had ingredients swapped out (ie, duck 'pumpkins' vs lamb 'pears'). Our food arrived fairly fast, but was shoved onto the tiny table in a haphazard fashion, and someone placed the hot teapot right within easy burning distance (and knocking-over distance) of my elbow, meaning I had to kept avoiding it.
Forget getting our waiter's attention for anything: he was too busy juggling six other tables, carving duck tableside, etc. By the time we managed to catch his eye, we were informed that half of the desserts were gone as options and we were pretty much over the ridiculous noise of the place: screaming at each other to be heard is really not how I anticipated spending my birthday evening.
I really, really wish that the Michelin rating of this place was revisited, because not a single part of our experience warranted a two-star rating on Yelp, much less a Michelin star. And the price they charge for this sub-par /everything/ is down-right embarrassing.
If you want faux Chinese food, noise, and dismissive service, go to Wagamama and save yourself a hundred quid.
Oh, and as a bonus, we got to watch a fish dying slowly on its side at the top of the bar-side tank. PETA would have had a ball.",-1
3,"Summary:
+ A Japanese canteen, that's exactly what this place is 
Overall: 
This place is a Japanese canteen. A canteen in Japan. Canteen japonaise. 
I don't know what else I can add. 
The food is definitely authentic. Their food is kind of comfort food that would be served in a canteen. (For the third time. I won't say that again.) Their food is decent but not special. To use proper foodie terminologies, they are ""hmm yummy"" but not quite ""OMFG! You gotta try this sXXX. This is f-ing AWESOME!"". 
 
The restaurant is very small and it's right at the heart of China Town so it gets packed. 
I have never been impressed by their staff, though. Most of the time they are rather blunt. I thought all Japanese people were nice and polite. 
In one of my recent visits, I overheard two waitresses chatting quite loudly at the back (in Japanese) for quite a long time. Maybe it wasn't the busiest time of all but it doesn't feel right. 
But they can get away with it. They are at a prime location with high visibility. The food is decent. So there is enough influx of tourists (they are one-off transactions) and locals who need a quick and filling meal. 
I will still go back for the high cost performance. I only care about food.",-1
3,"oVery busy and famous ramen restaurant, still have to wait after 10:00 in the night.. ordered the signature ramen and soft shell crab, it was not bad, but little bit disappointed because the taste not as good as o thought",-1
2,"I used to here all the time for roast duck, unfortunately I think the standards here have dropped a bit.
Obviously service is never great here, so I come here just for some comfort Chinese food. I've been twice recently and the food is not as good as I remembered
Perhaps it's because I went towards the end of the night, so everyone's tired and the choice cuts of meat are gone. The roast duck I was served was extremely fatty, some pieces were 80% fat, 10% skin and 10% meat. I like fatty duck but this is pushing it a bit
Also, the egg noodles in my soup was a big block, all stuck together! I am quite sad writing this as I have no idea where else to go now!",-1
3,"My boyfriend and I have never had Dim Sum before and many of my friends were ranting and raving about how incredible Ping Pong was ! Being we were near Southbank last night, we figured we would give it a try. The food was absolutely delicious, but the service was a bit poor. There had to be over 5 waiters waiting on our table. We ordered from the set menu for 2 and the food did not come in order. It was crowded and a Saturday night so of course it is going to be busy. At one point we thought they forgot about us. We got complementary tea and coffee from them for being so patient. 
I would definitely go back but I would like to try Ping Pong in a different location to see if I have a different experience !",-1
5,"you NEED to eat here! Just went today and it is absolutely amazing all around. As for drinks, the chai tea is delicious, as well as all the virgin alcoholic drinks. All the food is absolutely delicious, likely the best indian food I have ever had. The atmosphere is wonderful, a Bombay experience! We loved it, absolutely would recommend.",1
5,"Intimate, romantic restaurant with outstanding service an amazing wine list  and really excellent food. 
If you enjoy fine French food then this is one of the best French restaurants in London. If you are a wine lover then it might be the best. 'Nuf said.",1

4,"Woah this was good. My friend ordered the kimchee ramen and I had already bought a veggie pot pie so I didn't order anything. This place was packed and I could see why. The ramen was the bomb! Not salty, not oily, not bland, not cheap on ingredients. All was great about this dish and it was not expensive either. The waiter was friendly and the customers had so much energy. You won't feel lonely here if you are a solo traveler.",1
3,"Not a meal for the sustainably minded, that's for sure. Only the popular fish get any attention at this celebrity luncheon spot. And wow this place is expensive! (£60pp for lunch). I will say that the food and drinks were really nice. The bar serves a surprisingly subtle bloody Mary with wasabi and tankatsu sauce. I'll definitely be making this one at home, so thanks for the inspiration! 
Sadly I couldn't justify spending £32 for their signature black cod with miso. Instead I had a Latin spiced ribeye over rice, which was a delightfully spicy riff on the Japanese meat over rice dishes like katsudon and unagidon. On the more traditional end, my lady had the prixe-fixe sushi lunch, which featured only the highest quality designer fish (like bluefin and wild salmon). The hand rolled maki (the lady called them Japanese tacos) were particularly delicious. 
The low point for me was cultural... while the excellent service made me feel like I was getting my money's worth, it's make me wiggle when all the servers yell ""irashaimase"" when customers walk in and there's not a Japanese soul in sight.",-1
5,"Monsieur and I went to Clos Maggiore for his birthday earlier this year. It had been recommended by a friend and was number one in several categories on a restaurant website, so we gave it a whirl. The evening was an absolute dream. The waiters were warm, professional, courteous and efficient without being 'in your face'. The ambience was comfortable; an interesting blend of traditional and modern. The food, however, was what we were there for and was nothing less than divine. The scallops were seared to perfection, a pure taste of the sea, and the black-legged chicken with spaetzle and snails was unusual and so packed with taste-bud twists that my eating automatically slowed down to allow the chance to properly savour each mouthful. 
Prior to arrival, I'd e-mailed the General Manager of Clos Maggiore to warn them that we were celebrating a birthday. Completely discreet, the waiters didn't let on that this fact had been passed on until the very end of the meal, when Monsieur's dessert was presented with a lit candle and Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce around the rim of the plate. 
Since then, we've been back once and experienced another perfect meal. We've also booked ahead for two family occasions over summer. Take it as read that this place is definitely worth the splurge. Keep an eye out for their deals, too, which are so good that you almost feel as if you're robbing the restaurateur.",1
3,"Doubtless, I was more impressed when I was there the first time, 1967!
Now I don't like the - much praised - ambience and atmosphere of this place very much. It has coulorful lights like a cocktail bar.
A third of the food impressingly good, a third of standard quality and the last third boring in taste.
The prices are really high and are not justified.
 The service is polite and tries to be really good - not always successfully.",-1
3,"Where to begin on Yauatcha? I want to give it 5 stars, as the aspects that were good, were excellent. But the bits that weren't good were pretty darn poor. It's worth a visit, but probably not a return - unless you're coming back for dessert. So, can we say three and a half stars?
I've heard mixed things about the staff, but I have to say we didn't have any problems. They were very nice, accommodating, etc. Our main waiter was a bit hard to track down so we ended up waiting a bit longer than we would have wanted to order some things, and one of the staff tried clearing away a plate while someone was still eating off it, but other than that, it was fine. 
Foodwise, the wagyu beef puffs and chinese chive and prawn shumai were big hits, and we ordered a second round of each. I loved the scallop shumai (but be warned: I burned the roof of my mouth and am still feeling it a day later). I didn't try it, but the beef shumai ws a big letdown for everyone at the table, as was the pork and prawn shaumai. I don't think we finished either order (which says something, as the portions are quite small - 3 pieces of beef shumai, for example, when you'd get 4 for the same price at other places). 
I had the seafood dumpling soup, which was very very good. I loved the broth (and they served it with a bit of sauce to put in, which really made it taste incredible. But, again, price is a concern: £6.70 for a tiny tureen of soup with one dumpling. 
We also got a couple of mains to share: the quarter duck and the stir fry pepper chili seafood with asparagus. The duck was alright. A bit dry, but decent. The seafood dish was a definite disappointment. The scallops and shrimp were cooked very well, as was the asparagus, but the dominant flavour was salt. It was a really shame, as we loved the seafood-based chili sauce they put on the table with the shumai, and hoped the seafood chili dish would be just as good. The jasmine rice we got with it was a tad overcooked, too. 
For dessert we got a raspberry delice to share, which was amazing. Imagine a bit of lychee surrounded chocolate mouse shaped like a rose and covered in a velvety raspberry coating. So rich and so beautiful. And definitely something to return for - everyone absolutely loved it. The rest of the food? Well, most of the dim sum was a hit, if that helps?
Overall cost was £170 for four (though with only two ""main"" dishes) which included 2 beers and 2 harder drinks (vodka/whiskey on the rocks, no cocktails). For that price I would have thought we walked out stuffed and/or overwhelmed with how good the food was. We did neither.",-1
5,"je te amo! (since the name of this restaurant is half French half Italian, I'd have to express my feelings for it the same way).
It apparently has the reputation of being one of the most romantic restaurants in London, and indeed it is! If you are lucky enough to get seated in the conservatory area, you'd find yourself in a midsummer night's dream kind of surrounding. 
I went with a group of 5 and we were seated outside of the conservatory, but that's okay, we are just a bunch of foodies looking for our next favourite dinner spot. It was still a very classy setup: leather couch, white table cloths, sparkling silverware and very polite (and funny) waiters. 
We ordered the tasting menu. The foie gras appetizer was amazing, and I loved the asian flavoured glazed duck . The peanut butter parfait was interesting, for me it was delicious, but I can see how some people wouldn't like it if they don't like peanut butter. 
Our waiters and sommelier were all super helpful, and fun to chat with. 
In general I enjoyed dining here very much and would definitely return here. Hopefully I can book a table within the indoor garden next time!",1
3,"Indian-influenced fine dining in Old Westminster Library, Intriguing enough! 
A large business group looking for a nice place to eat, some of us wanted Indian food, others don't really eat Indian food, so this place seemed to be a very happy compromise -- haute cuisine with a hint of Indian flavour, exquisite presentation, and gracious service. Not to mention the uniquely interesting location and interior decoration that other Yelpers have already commented on. 
The food is quite tasty, albeit not authentic (the restaurant website uses the description ""Beyond Authentic""). Amongst the dishes enjoyed by our group, there were tandoori breast of Anjou squab pigeon, skate wing, sea bass in goan curry sauce, Hyderabadi style lamb. The menu is not extensive but it changes frequently, if not daily, so the desired outcome is that you will always find something interesting enough to try. 
The price is quite reasonable for this type of establishment and in this area of London, especially if you can get there during the time that set menu is being offered (2 courses for £19 or 3 courses for £22). 
All in all, a nice place to go to for its location/ambience/service and Indian-influenced fine dining. Obviously don't go there if you are looking for hardcore authentic Indian food.",-1
4,"Nicely soft and delicate ramen with well-flavoured soup. The decor of the place is good and the music and atmosphere vibrant, however it is a tight squeeze and the drinks are quite pricey. As long as you don't mind rubbing elbows with the person next to you and perhaps bumping into the person behind you from time to time then this is a good stop for a noodle fan.",1
2,"It's been years people told me to come here, to experience their wonderful steak and their wonderful sauce and their wonderful whatsoever.
Did I finally do it? Yes. Did I enjoy it? No. Plain. Simple.
As Everybody else said (and I mean every other 136 reviews), one choice salad, steak, fries. Stop. Strange, I was prepared for it, ok, Cool.
There is ALWAYS a queue in front of the place, on the weekend it could last for more than an hour, maybe even two. Luckily the place is REALLY crowded, otherwise there would probably a queue from there to Westminster. Ah when I mean crowded I mean SERIOUSLY crowded. I'm slim and I spent my whole time squeezed up in my seat, basically if you are more than 90 kg you'll have serious issues in finding a place here.. Maybe you are filling the place too much, you damn french business with an italian name!?!
Ah BTW, this is a french place with an italian name where most of the waitresses are polish, we had peruvian beer and english steak. Funny, for a place pretending to be french. Whatever.
Now, the meal: first is the salad, well, wow, IT'S A DAMN SALAD WITH WALNUT AND WALNUT OIL, get over with! I mean why should I even care in having such a thing? It's just a basic salad, no preparation, nothing: the pieces are even a bit too big for a salad, and there is nothing interested in it.
Then it comes the steak. Drum rolls, trumpets and bla bla. Well, nothing special. I mean seriously NOTHING SPECIAL.
The steak is good, but not that good (Wanna experience a serious steak? go to hawksmoore, THERE YOU'LL HAVE A DAMN STEAK). It comes as a ""tagliata"" (don't know the english name, sorry), basically it's already cut in slices, which is a very dangerous thing to do, as the meat will be cut somewhere and then put on the plate (actually it makes two movements after, from the cutting board to the tray and from the tray to the dish). Result: dry steak of course, as every bit of juice has been left over the two past surfaces. I mean there are serious errors, and they are making the strong points over that, how is it even possible!?!
Yeah theoretically the dryness of our tortured piece of meat will be covered by the sauce. Now, the sauce is said to be ""the best part"". No it's not. It's a bit blend, basically it's just a fatty buttery sauce with mustard and pesto, that's it. No inspiration, no soul, no feeling. Just the usual blend sauce you'll find next to the roast in any self service in every hotel in the world. Ouch.
I don't even want to speak about the fries, they are just fries, whatever. My dog can prepare it. And I don't even have a dog.
So why the two stars!?!?
RESURRECTION
INSPIRATION
HERE COMES THE DESSERT.
Yes baby, bring it on that juicy profiterole! Aaaah the profiterole , you bloody bastard! awesomely sweet on the inside, deliciously bitter on the outside, a real chocolate sauce covering splendid bigne' filled with creamy gelato. Awesome, just DAMN AWESOME.
If this place will even allow me to have just the profiterole avoiding that piece of boredom before, it'd deserve 5 stars. No, it'd deserve 6 stars, 7 stars, at least a galaxy.
LONG LIFE TO THE PROFITEROLE. HALLELUJAH.",-1
2,"Since my last visit here, the Wong Kei has certainly not lost none any of its endearing charm. To be fair, there was a little less ""throw it at you"" on this ocassion but trying to engage in conversation with any of the staff proved to be a rather pointless task.
Anyway, food is just about ok, it could be my age but all the dishes seem to be merging into one another. 
Had it not have been for some ridiculous ""one way pedestrian"" crowd control system on Chinese New Year, we would probably have ventured further down Gerrard Street.",-1
4,"I didn't believe fine dining dim sum could be done until I popped the shrimp & chive dumpling in my mouth and was immediately taken by surprise by its balance of texture and taste. With this particular dish, the green wrapper was delicate but held its own against the sweetness of the shrimp and distinct flavor of the chives. One bite of this little parcel didn't take me back to a different time or place, instead it created its own unique experience. 
Yauatcha describes itself as a dim sum teahouse but I have only known it for its beautifully designed desserts (it's hard to miss their display of carefully lined goods that welcome you into the restaurant as you enter). This time around we came for lunch as I was curious to sample Michelin star dim sum.
It came at a price.  For £125 we also sampled lobster dumplings with tobiko caviar, king crab dumplings, striploin beef with enoki mushroom cherng fun, spicy pork Szechuan wonton, sweet potato mushroom mei-si rolls, two pots of tea and sake.  I have to say I was impressed, not just by the creativity of the pairing of the food but by how well it worked. It certainly isn't a place where I can frequently dine but I'll be coming back when I want to try a fusion of something old and new done right.",1
5,"I am not an afficienado of ramen but Bone Daddies has provided my best experience (by some distance) to date.  It was not all plain sailing as I had to work past a pretty significant queue to get into the restaurant itself.  However, once inside, everything was spot on.  The decor was funky with stools jammed into every conceivably place which made for a cosy atmosphere.  This said, without cramming in all this seating, I dread to think what the queue was like.
The ramen itself was the real deal.  I opted for a special, the Sour Pepper Ramen, with roast chashu, karaage salmon, grilled spring onion and an egg.  The broth was perfectly judged with its deep spicy flavour providing a solid base for its accompaniments.  Indeed, the broth was so lovely, I would probably have been satisfied with this alone.  Of the accompaniments, I loved each delicate flake of the salmon and the perfect texture of the egg.  However, the best aspect of the dish was its variety.  Every bite brought another delightful taste senstation.
On the side, I ordered some edamame beans.  Served warm with a good slug of salt, these were lovely, if not the most original choice.  Looking at the other reviews now, I suspect that the soft shell crab might have been a better option.  I look forward to doing just that on my next visit.",1
4,"Cheap, incredibly quick service, great food, waiters that don't speak a word of English - just what Big Dave wants at 11.00pm after a night out on the beers. Big Dave recommends the shark fin soup... JOKES.",1
4,"After hearing so much about it, I finally made it to Dishoom.  I came for an afternoon snack on Sunday.  It was quite busy (as seems to be the case with all Dishoom locations all the time ..) but I got seated immediately as a single diner.  I sat on the front deck, which had plastic sheeting pulled down and heaters to make it feel indoors.  The classy decor (carpeting, couches) made it actually feel more like a living room than a deck.  Quite elegant in fact.
I ordered House Chai and Pao Bhaji -- but they had run out of the chai (?!?!?).  Instead I had Darjeeling green tea.
For both, the quality and quantity were wonderful, and quite reasonably priced.  I especially loved the 3 chutneys which I added liberally to the bhaji -- chili, coriander, and tamarind (?).
Service was fairly good, if a bit delayed -- I ordered some extra Pao (fried bun) which took too much time to come out.  Also took some time to get my receipt and finally pay.
Loved the atmosphere, loved the food, missed the masala chai , and could do with a little more attentive service.  Will def be back to try out more on the menu!",1
5,"This is probably the best Dim sum house in London where you cannot get wrong. Asian speaking!
The decor makes the dim sum experience more contemporary and allows to have dim sum for dinner which is totally cool!! Skipping that, the food is totally proper, fresh and tasty without that disgusting oversalty-msg feeling one can get from asian restaurants.
Expect to pay a little more than places serving defrosted dim sum but totally worth the money.",1
1,"Horrible services! This is the worst British restaurant we have ever been to. We have been to many different places, from Michelin star to local pub and no one is more arrogant and rude than this place. We have been sitting there for about 10 minutes when everyone is working around us and no one even stopped to even offer a water. Finally we put our order in and still no water and we have to keep asking. My little girl is too tired to walk and otherwise we will walk right to there. There are so many great curry places in London - with food so so and service like this, skip it and you will find much better places!",-1
3,"Went here on a Sunday for a late lunch and was seated immediately. Only the street kitchen was open which was fine by me, I was looking for a cheap meal anyways. I asked the waiter what are the favourites, he recommended the railway lamb curry and this chicken burger. Menu seemed much bigger than what was advertised online. The chicken burger was really good, interesting flavours and didn't really taste like anything I've had before. The railways lamb curry (which I've seen several people recommend) was not my favourite. By no means was it bad, it just wasn't that amazing in my opinion. Mind you, I was extremely hungover and Indian food may not have been the best call to help cure the hangover. Also a little dissapointed in the lack of naan but this might just be the street kitchen and the dining room does normally serve it. Service charge is included in the meal and I left there spending under 20$.",-1
4,"Delicious menu with a good array of seafood, red meat and poultry dishes. Style is French / Italian. Homemade bread was fantastic. Ambience is cosy and service is generally good. We have eaten here a few times and not been disappointed.",1
5,"I absolutely love Hakkasan!
I only visit on Saturday afternoons as they have a EXTENSIVE and very TASTY dim-sum menu for lunch.  I personally believe it is the best I've ever tasted.  To top it of they have stunning cocktails to compliment every dish.
The venue is spectacular and the staff cannot be better.",1
5,"Great place for dim sum... I've always wanted to try it and went a couple of weeks ago. While I have eaten many a dim sum in my lifetime, this was truly exceptional - from the creative and refreshing of traditional dishes, to the high quality of everything, including the steamed dumpling skins.
 Its definitely more expensive than what you would pay at other good dim sum restaurants in London, but in my mind it was also still worth the money.

5,"So, there I was, thinking I should really leave my 100th review for 100 bar in Piccadilly, but a) I haven't had time b)If i could, I would give 100 points to the tonkatsu soup in Bone Daddies. So there.
After a particularly gruelling day sitting on pews that were so uncomfortable during my stay as a juror, I wanted to take advantage of the fact that I had a free evening without work. Decided to call my friend, 5 minutes, ramen agreed. bam. done. 
Turned up at Bone daddies before 6, which is a good tactic of our tbh. We rarely ever go for late dinners because well, we live far out. Tonkatsu ramen ordered. I skim-read a few reviews and was impressed, and I was not disappointed. THE SOUP. OH GOD. SOUP IS MADE OF DREAMS. Rich, Buttery and had OH-so much depth. Combine with the silky eggs. JUST. SO.GOOD. 
Ramen, was alright but I was too occupied by the soup and the eggs. 
Apparently, Timeout said that dinner for two would be approx £60. (SERIOUSLY, kids don't know how to thrift.) We had two beers, two ramen + service charge and it was £34. and we left full and satisfied. IN YOUR FACE.",1

3,"It's crazy how quickly this little restaurant fills up at night, but I'm not surprised given the prices of the food. Starters are all £3.98 and mains are £8. For starters my partner and I ordered the lobster & crayfish ravioli and the fried calamari. The lobster and crayfish ravioli was a bit overpowered by the dill stuffed inside and wasn't amazing. The fried calamari is horrendous and I can make better at home but for not even 4 pounds a pop I guess I can't complain. I ordered the duck, and it was very overcooked, but the flavors were good. The garlic mash is delicious. My boyfriend had the lamb and also said it was good but overcooked. I would probably return and ask them to cook everything a bit less than they normally would. The price is terrific and a 5 min walk from my flat, so what's not to love?
If I could I would rate it 3.5 stars",-1
2,"I'm kind of disappointed at this restaurant. First, I waited 45 minutes to eat ramen at around 9pm on Saturday night. They say they are recommended by Michelin in different years but I don't seem to find them on the Michelin website. I tried the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. I'm so disappointed. The soup is not think, the meat is bland, the egg is bland. They say they marinate the pork and egg for a long time but they don't taste like that. The takoyaki is different from the ordinary ones as they are deep fried. So it's crispy outside. It's £6.9 for 5 pieces but in each one, there's only a tiny piece of octopus. The rest is just dough. It doesn't worth the price. It doesn't worth the wait.",-1
5,"Incredibly beautiful restaurant. Perfect for a special occasion. The food, the service, and the ambience are second to none. We ate in the conservatory, and it was worth the advance request. We ordered the pork loin and the duck - both were delicious, not too fussy, every bite wonderful. We could not make room for dessert but were given the petit fours of the house, which were just perfect.",1
2,"Used to be one of my favourite place - just went for lunch and shocked by how bad the food has got to... Maybe the chef left?! Or regular chef was on holiday as I went between Christmas and new year's. Food was all somewhat cold and just horrible texture and flavour in most dishes. Very disappointed. The have taste of yuacha between 2 and 6 on weekdays - best deal ever so if you want to try..  Am sure you will walk out satisfied... Otherwise, you will most probably walk out thinking you had overpaid.",-1

The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable with their recommendations. I have read the reviews regarding service. Our waiter was vet attentive and provided us with great service. The pricing is also quite reasonable.
The desserts are amazing. They are ok display and can be purchased for takeaway. 
I would definitely recommend this fantastic restaurant.",1
2,"I had heard about Roti Chai through a friend of mine who had nothing but rave reviews for the restaurant. Many months later, I finally get the chance to try it... And am completely and totally underwhelmed.
When I got there, I had no idea there was an option of upstairs vs downstairs dining, and that the menus would be different depending on where you were seated. It was only after placing my order for banana chips and lamb curry did I find out about the dining room, where it seems there is a more extensive menu - and perhaps more satisfying dishes because I, personally, did not enjoy my dinner.
It was ok, and nothing more. Neither of the dishes I ordered were anything to write home about, and the service - while attentive - lacked personability (as if my waiter was only there in body, going through the motions). 
I may give this place another chance, based solely on the rave reviews it's getting for its dining room menu... but Im certainly in no rush to go back anytime soon.",-1

There were 4 of us and we left the vast majority of our food and we were 4 hungry people!!!  There was a 40 minute wait in between the starters and the main, without explanation. The starters tasted as if they were pre-cooked and frozen and the mains had virtually no spice at all.  We weren't asked if everything was ok with our food but we're served the bill without asking and then questioned as to the fact that we opted not to pay the service charge when we paid, which in a our years combined and in all the countries we've visited we have never experienced that before. THE SERVICE CHARGE IS OPTIONAL FOR A REASON AND BY LAW IN THE UK!!! Good service may have asked what we were not happy with! This was NOT GOOD SERVICE!!!

3,"Nobu is a must when in London - especially in Mayfair. Get a reservation, save your pennies and come enjoy this place. Of course, know what you're getting yourself into (I say this a lot): it's busy, loud, trendy and rather expensive... but it's fun and the food is delicious. I'm a fan - and definitely over the other Nobus in London.
Get a drink at the bar first then sit down and order sushi, but also order some of the hot entrees. The black miso cod is a must, and the sea bass is a nice add-on. Ask the waiter about fresh specials - the fish is all very fresh but they usually have specials which shouldn't be missed!
Have fun here - I miss it!",-1
1,"Pretentious, overpriced ""japanese"" food. I mean seriously, black cod with miso for 42 quid!? You can get this dish in most family style japanese restaurant for MUCH less. The fish here is supplied by Atari- Ya in Bond street, which has some of the cheapest sushi/sashimi to be had in London, so here they decide to pretty much destroy the natural flavour of the raw fish by adding all sorts of crazy sauces... (easy way to cover up if the fish isnt the freshest)
""Chocolate Bento Box"" is basically the most widely available american dessert-chocolate lava cake. Its put into a bento box with green tea ice cream... pretty much tastes like every other lava cake out there.
Save your money and go somewhere else.... ANYWHERE else. You wont see any japanese go anywhere near Nobu, with good reason.",-1

There's a big 'but' unfortunately - the price. With the cheapest wine over £30 and a really nice Duck dish also more than £30, this place is really taking the p*. Fantastic food, ridiculous price - poor value.",1
3,"I am a big fan of ramen and am always up for discovering the best shop around town. There are two Shoryu around Piccadilly Circus, which is a highly touristy area, so I am already a bit suspicious. 
Though a gong is rung every time a customer comes in or goes out of the shop, it doesn't make the place more Japanese. Maybe most of the servers are not Japanese or the restaurant just doesn't have the coziness which is typical of Japanese ramen places. 
I went there for lunch, so I just ordered Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu which is their signature ramen. Anybody who is into ramen knows that the broth is what makes or breaks ramen. Their broth is ok flavor-wise, but nothing really jumped out at me. The toppings include pickled ginger, fried shallots and black wood ear in addition to the usual roasted pork and egg. Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen but that's it. 
Shoryu offers a lot of side dishes ranging from sashimi, pork buns to chicken wings, which are not food you would see served at an authentic ramen shop. Call me all fashioned, a good ramen place to me should have just a few options of ramen and limited number of side dishes. Shoryu seems to be a Japanese restaurant that caters mostly to tourists and serves all sorts of Japanese dishes, one of which happens to be  Ramen. If you are looking for great ramen place, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you want some decent Japanese food in the area, this is not a bad choice.",-1
4,"I came here on a bank holiday around 5:30 and managed to get a seat right away with my mom. But we got lucky because I don't think anyone was seated long after that and there was a huge lineup outside. 
I got the curry ramen. I thought it was pretty good. The fried chicken managed to stay crispy and the broth had really good flavour so I didn't have to add anything to it. I also was sceptical about the noodles since some of the reviews weren't so great but I thought they were fine. They were ramen noodles! Didn't find them chewy, hard, soft or too big. The peppers were interesting and didn't do much for the dish in my opinion 
My mom got the tantanmen ramen. The soup was a little peanuty and she thought she didn't get enough meat, but other than that it was good
We were sitting right at the window and since there was a line up people were constantly watching us eating which was a little weird for me but, can't really blame the restaurant though.
There were some other ramen that I wanted to try so I would go back 
I didn't take pictures as it was quite dimly lit and they wouldn't have turned out
Shoutout for the great service though! Even though it was crazy busy the servers made sure to come over to us every so often to check up on things and managed the line well",1

1,"Met a friend here this August, expected a tourist trap given its location, only to find them trying not to be even that. Their claim to authenticity is in their lack of customer service for anybody non-white. Food was mostly horrible, and I do not use the word ""horrible"" lightly. Only the uninitiated will find this close to Indian cooking. Unfortunately, we are spoiled by Delhi's Gulatis, Karims and any number of choices in SFO bay area.
Our meal started with Dry Kebabs that were dry and reheated. Excess of food coloring in CTM and shrimp was rubbery. Their Daal and recommended veggies(we had eggplant) were particularly bland and undercooked. Naan was ok..All in all looked like it was cook's first day at work. Servers were more interested in upping the check and getting us to leave even though we over ordered for six. Do not waste your time and money here, London can do better.",-1

Apparently a trip to London is not complete without visiting Dishoom - if you're in the area I'd definitely check it out (there's a few locations around London).
Came on a weekday afternoon for lunch and was seated right away. The decor is rustic with a mix of contemporary - not like your typical North American designed Indian restaurants which was unique. I really liked the vibe here - not too loud with bustling kitchen sounds and aromatic Indian food being prepared. There's cut-outs of articles on the wall and marble tables...it's quite aesthetic I have to say. 
I wasn't too overly impressed with the service, in fact I would say that's what takes away part of the stars for my rating. The waiter was questioning whether I knew Indian food (I definitely do, ahem)...in any case the food arrived swiftly. 
I got the matar paneer which was a curry made with soft cheese (tofu like texture) and the naan t accompany it (costs extra) and my friend got the biryani. The paneer was delicious and definitely had authentic flavours (can confirm authenticity after having paneer in India a few months back). However, this place was quite pricey for lunch...I'd go back occasionally if it was in my route. For the price I'd expect much better service and a more unique menu instead of standard Indian fare. 
In all not a bad experience and if you're in the area (Trafalgar Square) definitely venture in!",-1
3,"While this seems to be the ""happening"" spot on a busy weekend night, I've definitely had better Punjabi food. The waiters and manager were all very nice, but took a long time coming around. I did like the old photographs from Punjab on the walls, and it was nice to hear a familiar tongue in the middle of London.
Be careful if you're planning on going with a big party on a weekend night - this place is very busy and they may very likely not have enough space for you if they don't take reservations.",-1
3,"So before I go too far with this review, and before you stop reading it (as presumably you're aghast at only 3 stars), bear with me.
I hail from a part of Sydney with one of the highest concentrations of Indian population & restaurants in the country. Subsequently, I'm used to very good Indian food, from all regions of India. And when I say very good, I mean excellent.
Right, now that that's out of the way...
I trust Yelpers implicitly. I've had so many fantastic experiences by following Yelp reviews wherever I travel. Subsequently, I'm a little curious as to how high a rating Dishoom got. Don't get me wrong - it was all good. There was nothing bad about the meal I had. It's just that there was nothing stunning about the food I had. Maybe my expectations were too high as I had to wait almost an hour to get in. Maybe I'm just used to a different style of Indian food (maybe the food in Sydney was adjusted to local tastes?). Maybe I just got there on a not so good night? Or maybe my taste buds were just off?...
Regardless, if you're after a good feed, this place will give it to you. It was definitely satisfying. But then, balancing that with the price and the wait, maybe there's somewhere else you could go, for better food, less coin, and less of a wait?",-1
2,"Heard so many good things about Bone Daddies and I am always in search of good ramen in London... honestly, quite disappointed.  We ordered the tonkotsu ramen to test out the broth.  How disappointing! The broth was very bland, it doesn't taste like the 20 hour pork broth it claims to be on the menu.  It's also covered with a lot of oil.  Just a reflection of what a long way we are from having authentically good ramen and an appreciation for proper ramen here.  The only good dish we had for the night was the pork bones, covered with a sweet sesame sauce, it was delicious but the portion is a bit on the small side.  Then we also had the black sesame soft icecream, which was ok but a bit too sweet.  They really should work on their broth.  Now that I  have gone to the holy trinity of ramen - bone daddies, shoryu and tonkotsu, i have to say tonkotsu is the most balance and has the best broth.  Still a long way to go London!
I did notice at Bone Daddies that they provide you with rubber band to tie your hair up while you are working on your noodles, a nice touch!!",-1
2,"We arrived for one of the first servings of the evening at 5:45pm. The waiters were friendly and understood we wanted a quick meal before our movie. 2 steaming bowels of noodles arrived in about 10mins. My Tantanmen arrived with its inviting reddish chilly oil floating on the surface. The menu does say bok choi, but ONE leaf??? The one slice of charshu pork was deli-ham-thin like everyone has mentioned. Broken cashews gave a nice crunch to the chilli pork mince that packed a nice punch of heat. The broth was tasty but don't let it get cold as you'll soon feel the pork fat start to coat your mouth.
My wife had the Tonkotsu Ramen which is her benchmark test of all ramen bars. The 20hr pork broth was seriously rich. Too heavy for my liking, but you can always order something else.
I think I'm missing something here. This IS a noodle bar. And this is where it failed miserably. Hidden underneath all the nicely decorated and flavoured ingredients lay the pitiful existence of a small portion of ramen noodles. They had a strange floury taste, like eating a raw pancake. I don't think they were undercooked either since they were close to turning into a very post-al dente gloopy mess. £11 will get you quality ingredients, but not a great serving of noodles.
Its all most likely paying for a fancy burger but the only think to compliment is the lettuce and ketchup!",-1

5,"As a ramen junkie from New York, I've been traveling around the world looking for great bowls of ramen. I've been happy with the recent boom of higher quality ramen in the cities across the world, and traveling through London, I've been very impressed so far.
I have heard Bone Daddies being compared with Kanada-Ya as the best ramen in London, so I had to come by and try it out. I stopped in at around 1:30 PM on a Wednesday, and there was no queue to get seated.
The space is bigger than expected, and seating was comfortable. They have a decently sized cocktail menu, some Japanese beers on draft, and a fairly impressive shochu and sake selection. There are sesame seed grinders, chili oil jars, and fresh garlic (with garlic presses) at each table, which I really liked.
I ordered a Cambridge G + T to start out, which is a tailored gin with Japanese botanicals served over ice with a bottle of Fever Tree tonic and a lime wedge. It was refreshing and great on this boiling hot summer afternoon.
For my starter I got the fried chicken, which is prepared in the Karaage style. It was decent, but just a little drier for my tastes, and some of the cuts looked weird - not uniform chunks, so perhaps the thicker pieces came out juicier if they cooked at the same time? It came with some lemon, but due to some of the pieces being drier than others, I would have preferred a sauce, perhaps a tonkatsu sauce or something? The seasoning was good though.
For my main, the star of the show, I ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu ramen, which is my personal favorite style. Born in Hakata, tonkotsu ramen, or ""pork bone"" broth ramen is usually very rich and served with straight and thin noodles, since the broth sticks very well to the strands. It was absolutely perfect here, thick, rich, and absolutely perfectly seasoned. The broth had a nice layer of mayu black garlic oil at the top, and was topped with a nicely cooked marinated soft-boiled Clarence Court egg, scallion, bamboo, garlic chips, ginger, and bean sprouts.
The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the broth was absolutely perfect. I pressed a clove of garlic and put some ground sesame into the broth and quickly finished the noodles. I was still hungry, so I ordered a kaedama (extra noodles) and more bamboo. It came out very quickly (within 90 seconds), which is a great sign of a ramen kitchen, and I finished every drop of the broth.
The bowls are fairly priced here and they don't nickel-and-dime you for each additional topping like some places do, and the service was on point. I highly recommend this ramen joint to anyone who likes ramen in London, and I'll definitely be back here whenever I'm in London!",1
5,"Probably one of the best and most authentic ramen places in the UK. The price is well worth what you get. I had the privilege of coming here a few times, at first by accident and then I was hooked. 
I love the rustic interior design, although a little bit crowded it has a great personal feel to it. The waiters here are all pretty cool as well.
My favorite dish here and what I recommend you all to try it the Tonkotsu ramen.",1
5,"Situated on one of the crappiest streets in London, honestly the market is a dive, is a gem of a Chinese restaurant. It's stylish design stands out amongst the fish-sellers and spread over two floors you should always manage to get a table, though it's advisable to book for large parties.
Food wise there is a wealth of choice, from gorgeous dim sum to set meals. The drinks menu also offers a wide choice but the main attraction, for me at least, are the beautiful desserts that they have. Glorious creations beautifully presented and, though at £4.50 each, they are a bit pricey one bite will assure you that it's worth it You can also by desserts to take out which is perfect for any special occasion or indulgent snacking.
As stated, prices aren't cheap but not overly extortionate either. Service can be a bit slow considering the wealth of staff that they employ but on all occasions I've been there staff have been very helpful, offering suggestions to compliment choices rather than to run up the bill.
Definitely a place to try",1

It's better if its just a bar for a drink...",-1
3,"We came around 5 pm for dinner. Did not need a reservation but the restaurant was quite busy. Filled up by around 6. 
For two, we ordered the veggie samosas, garlic naan, chicken biryani and 1 lamb chop. The veggie samosa were very well seasoned and on the sweet side. The biryani and naan were nothing special. The lamb was tender and flavourful. Overall the meal was just average and did not live up to the hype. 
The portions we ordered were enough for us, but may not be enough if you guys are really hungry.",-1
4,Really enjoyed the spicy pork Sichuan wontons and the xiao lung bao as well as the kai Lan. Service was great. Overall great experience we will be back!,1
1,"So I was with someone who's been here before and after a rather long debate, this place seemed to be one of the few places that are open late (up to London standards that is). The ambience was nice and the decor as per the usual ramen bar (no Bone Daddies rockability theme here).
The food seemed rather adventurous for a ramen place - an interesting mix of flavours with funky names. 
It did take some time for it to arrive at the table (especially given the fact that everyone was leaving by the time we got there).Anyway, pretty good food, matching that generally offered in London. I've ordered the Tokyo Shoryu.  The broth was fine, the noodles tasted rather good and he toppings were OK, just your typical japanese inspired out-of-the-tin vegetables with meat. Soft shell crab was rather soggy, but I wasn't expecting any miracles here.
What was excruciatingly horrible was the service. 
Yes, we turned up late and our food was late. However when I discovered a hair in my food I got extremely upset by the fact that no one had the courage to come to me and apologise/offer a refund as they usually do in such places. I hadn't touched more than half of my food and no response - extremely unprofessional and definitely not what one would expect from such a central London location. 
I saw the floor manager who was only able to offer an apology and had the service charge taken - something that I found rather disrespectful for both the staff and I as the service was generally good.
I don't know if I'd go back - possibly I'd try the other branch but this place needs to invest more on customer care.",-1
5,"been to this place a few times on special occassions, and have loved everything about this restaurant. Great food, service and atmosphere, and above all an awesome place to eat for romantic couples!!",1
3,"A nice restaurant which is decorated contemporary in style. For example, the sink in the toilet is like a garden water feature!
The food though was just ""OK"". Nothing special to the normal dim sum you can have in any Chinatown whether its in London or elsewhere.
Also, its very expensive for what it is. Luckily when I went I didnt pay and the person who paid had a voucher he got for his birthday.",-1
3,"We came here on a Wednesday evening for dinner. For a party of 6, the wait time wasn't bad at all - probably only 5 minutes? Anyway, we were seated pretty quickly, which was nice. One thing to note is the seating arrangement felt pretty cramped - separate tables were really close to each other, which made things a bit more uncomfortable.
Since I'm not an expert on Indian food, I let my friends pick our dishes since we were going family style. I think we went with a Chicken Tikka Masala (apparently a classic), Acharri Murgha, Karahi Paneer, and another paneer dish that I've forgotten. For sides, we ordered 3 garlic naans and 3 butter naans. The food took a while to come out, but when it did it all came out at once. Maybe for that reason the dishes weren't as hot as I would've liked them to be, but it was still warm enough.
I'm not the biggest fan of cheese, so the paneer dishes weren't my favorite. I did, however, enjoy the Chicken Tikka Masala! And the other chicken dish was alright, too. The garlic naan was pretty tasty, but it was a bit too oily for my liking. Overall, I thought the meal and experience were just ok - nothing special, but then again maybe that's just because I'm not a huge fan of Indian food to begin with.",-1
3,"Dishoom has opened down the street and going by my first visit there tonight that is a cause for celebration.  Inside it's relaxed and surprisingly spacious  : carefully old- fashioned with dark wood, bentwood chairs and ceiling fans - bit self-conscious but not annoyingly so. I could have done with fewer of the mock-cute Indian-style signs but maybe that's because I get to see enough of them in India. And anyhow, it's the food that matters, and this was by and large terrific... Try the crispy deep-fried okra, and an extraordinary version of the Welsh rarebit (chilli-ed and yummily runny),  really nice chunks of grilled paneer and marinated peppers. Next time I'll give the veg samosas a miss (undistinguished) but all the rest really hut the spot. Shabash!",-1
5,"Food was just amazing, tried a lot of the good recommendations from Yelp reviews, and yes, you have to HAVE to have the jasmine tea ribs. Was just the best thing that has hit my taste buds!!!
There was a tofu dish that was just amazing too, and chilli squid was really tasty.
Heard about this place a lot and finally ventured in. Restaurant itself not amazing, bit too clinical for me, but when you're I good heaven you don't notice it!
My waitress was pretty useless at recommending anything, kept saying well if you like it then it's good, thanks for that useful tip!
But was a great lunch and kept me full for hours!",1
4,Went to this restaurant for lunch with work. We had heard great things about the duck and rice and we all ordered this along with vegetables. Very tasty and excellent service from the staff.,1
5,The restaurant is beautifully decorated. Our server was very attentive. The cocktails are strong yet still taste good. Everyone says this but they have amazing dim sum. The crispy duck roll is really tasty. The grilled Chilean sea bass in honey was the best fish I have ever had. The stir fry Australian lobster was good (but maybe not quite worth the hefty price tag). All in all great experience.,1
2,"I'm staying in London for a few months for work and I decided to treat myself with perhaps the food that I miss most back in LA -- Ramen. 
Bone Daddies seemed to have some of the best reviews out of all the ramen places in London, so I checked them out first.
I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and was pretty disappointed. The broth was overly creamy and was lacking any rich tonkatsu flavor. The noodles were not springy and were thin and slightly hard. They did give generous portions of the sliced pork, which was nice, but even the pork was average.",-1
1,Terrible service! Food wasn't delicious and even their signature roasted duck was just mediocre...wouldn't come back again,-1
5,This was fantastic. The service was great and menu was really fun. Great cocktails as well. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I was a big fan of the Jackfruit Biryani.,1
5,"Really great place for date night with the wife. All the dim sum was absolutely outstanding; I do have to admit that having dim sum in a fancy setting and not being served by an extremely waitress is somewhat alienating :) 
Anyways, my highlights were the Szechuan Pork Dumplings (cheap and very good), Prawn Chengfun (I know it has beancurd but yes it tastes awesome), Wagyu Beef Puff (awesome beef taste). 
Will most certainly come here again if I am in London and you should do the same...",1
4,"Great for groups. Modern, underground space. Long bar. Sexy feel with a very Asian sense. A bit like Spice Market in New York, but less kitsch. Food was tasty. Not the best / most authentic Chinese, but everything was full of flavor and nothing dissapointed. Will go back.",1
3,"The red snapper appetizer was awesome, but the rest of the main course was so-so.  Definitely not the best Indian I have had. Pricey.  Service is ok...the indian server from Mauritius serving me was attentive though very busy. Nothing to write home about.  Everyone crows about how great Indian food is in London....not thus far.  :-(",-1
2,"Average. The ramen is decent, but far from impressive or fantastic. Tantanmen2 was okay. Soup was pretty oily and strong, but you can hardly taste the chicken broth and its essence. Noodles was cooked fine, not overcooked or undercooked. Portion was big. The eggs were great, but sadly for mine it was submerged under the oil, ruining the looks and the taste of the egg yolk.",-1
5,"Wow. I mean, WOW! I am blown away by this place. It's not a secret that I love dim sum and I mean really LOVE IT and I've eaten a lot of it in my time but I have never had dim sum like this.
We arrived and seated straight away, our coats were checked and the waitress came over with the menus and some water. I do love it when restaurants do that without you asking.
We ordered a lot of food and when asking the waiter if he thought that would be enough, he kindly and honestly said he thinks we'll be full after the duck but he'll keep everything written down and ask us how we're feeling once we've  had the duck.
We ordered so many different types of dim sum but the real stand outs were the venison puffs, the char sui cheung and the pulled chicken dumplings but they were all amazing!
The duck was also fantastic. Beautifully cooked, crispy on the outside and pure meaty bliss once forked. I love the crispy bits! :) 
By the time we'd finished the duck we were stuffed and I'm so glad we didn't have the rest but I'll definitely be back to try more!
They also brought me a birthday macaroon which was a lovely touch!
It was a birthday meal I will always remember and I 100% agree with the decision on it receiving a Michelin star. Just wonderful",1
5,"This place is amazing. I loved every single dish I got here, we ended up ordering 3 more dishes. The mango lassi was super good too! We ordered the garlic naan, the yogurt (raita), Black daal, chicken biryani, chicken tikka, vegetable samosas, and last but not least the chicken ruby. Seriously everything here was sooo good. I would definitely recommend the garlic naan and chicken ruby! Order the rice on the side and you're good to go. I already miss this place!",1
5,"I looove love love love love Dishoom!!! 
drinks check!
food check!
service check!
I am a fan! The Okra fries superb! loved the mix of Chutneys. I had the chicken ruby which was a fabulous curry. I took some left over home to my husband who is Indian. He loved it and now wants to go with me next time!
 The only thing I would recommend to Dishoom is to put more curries on their menus as there are only two curries. Everything else is more dry style think grilled or Biryani (rice pots). I am not a fan of Biryanis I find them to dry. 
Chaijito was very yummy which is an indian take on a mojitos with mint, coriander, chair syrup, ginger and lime.",1
4,"Came here on a cold, blustery day and the hot bowl of ramen hit the spot!
My sister, cousin, and I all ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen.  In retrospect, I think I would have preferred one of the other choices because of my preference for thinner broth.  Despite the thick broth, the ramen was absolutely delicious.  It tasted fresh, with tons of flavor.  The only topping I added was chili oil to make it spicy.
We came late in the afternoon, so we had no problem with getting a seat.  I have heard it can be difficult to get a table for dinner since they're so popular.
One last thing I have to mention... I love that they provide plastic bibs and hair ties to insure clean eating!",1
3,"This is my second time here for dinner. I won't say the food isn't good but what I can say is the service is really a DISASTER! 
One girl who served at our table always put on a shit face and was very rude. We had four people here and she was keeping pushing the table to my friends side which made them really uncomfortable, and she didn't say anything about that. Apart from that, my friends went shopping afternoon so they had some big bags, in case that those would block the aisle, they saved their belongings temporarily at the cloakroom. When we about to leave and asked staff to get the stuff back, one girl just stared at us with very disgusting face and chose to ignore us.
So, if you want to experience this kind of world standard shit service, please come here, I bet you've got little temper to lose here.",-1
1,"Yelp profile notwithstanding, a telephone call confirms that Roti Chai does not do take away. :(",-1
4,"A beautiful display of cakes enticed us into the Chinese style restaurant. There were so many to choose from and I was grateful that we weren't being rushed into a decision. We settled on a citrus based cake, which was made with grapefruit and lemon. When the server brought it over it looked almost too beautiful and intricate to eat. 
We also ordered a pot of jasmine tea which tasted just so perfect. It was light, floral and fragrant. 
As we weren't eating a main meal they seated us at the bar, which was fine. The place is beyond stylish and feels like when you're at your best friends parents house and they've seated you in the guest living room, and your kind of too frightened to move in fear of breaking some expensive antique. I digress! 
Visit the toilets, the basin is a piece of art work in its own right.",1
2,"Ping Pong puts the dim in dim sum.
While I wish I could credit this, um, lil' 12 location establishment with a winning game of tasty morsels of steamed delicious, it was more like a continual back and forth match of disappointment. Nothing was absolutely terrible, but first there was something off with drinks, then service, then texture, then service, then salt, then service, then, then, then... and so went the head shaking evening. The meal was just uncomfortable, even with fantastic company. 
I take it back, there was point of absolute terribleness: the toilets were disgraceful. It's the first time here in London that I've felt the word ""toilet"" aptly described a bathroom.  
Shame too, because I was the female Ping Pong champ throughout school. I have a deep love for the game.  Guess you just didn't come to play.",-1
5,"Oh Dishoom. 
How I do love thee. 
This is the type of place where you want to lick the plates clean. Where you purposely order too much food so you can take some home for later (if you can stop yourself from gobbling it all down that is). A benchmark for not just other Indian restaurants, but almost all other restaurants against. 
Consistently amazing. Sure the no reservations thing can be a pain, but take that in stride and go on less busy times (when you'll only have to wait 30 min instead of 2 hours). Go to the bar, have a drink or 3, and ogle the awesome decor. It's seriously gorgeous. 
And the food. I cannot get over it. The daal is maybe even better warmed up the next day. I don't care that it's vegetarian. It's made from dreams. Also the greens with chilli and lime. And the naan. And all of it.",1
4,I stupidly ordered wrong but the nice guy on the phone gave me the noodles i wanted AND let me keep the wrong order. 8/10 will come again but very expensive in  comparison to other local Chinese takeaways,1
5,"I went last night for a meal I had pre-booked since last year. I chose this because of all of its famed reviews, reputation & such. Clos Maggiore lived upto the hype. Oh so very very well.
I had got the Conservatory room, the one its most famous for. However I wouldn't have minded either way. The other parts of the restaurant seep charm and grace. The food and service is second to none and never have I felt so special and cared for. I saw other reviewers saying they never got the conservatory and frankly, was it because I booked ahead? was it because we ate at 7pm when it was quieter, or was I lucky? Not sure. We were a couple and it was almost as if that room never had a table bigger than 2-4 anyway. Mostly it sat couples.
The food is to die for, im getting hungry again just thinking about it. I was tempted for the taster menu but we felt we would both have a starter, a main and a shared desert with coffee & Petit fours. 
Certainly it was pricey but it was a special anniversary meal that was worth paying for. Thoroughly recommend the place and want to go back asap!",1
5,"Came in for lunch, same menu as dinner but shorter queue. They stop takeout orders after 5pm.
Okra fries, crisp spiced bites, had to fight off my husband for them
Lime lamb chops, I felt they were over charred but my husband really enjoyed them. Sprinkles of pomegranate seed adds visuals 
Chicken ruby was highlight for me, rich creamy curry with tender chicken pieces...scoop with Bhatura (puffy fried bread) and enjoy 
Black daal, hard to describe to flavor but good, thick black lentil soup. 
Hip vibe and super friendly serve. Outside veranda seating available.
(Written by husband)",1
4,I came across Yauatcha soho on a walk throughout London. The first time I got a few macaron. They were excellent. The next day I came for dim sum brunch. The venison puff was amazing. The dim sum was good overall. But a bit pricey. Better to go with a group and try one of the tasting menus. Beautiful space. Good service.,1
5,"Get ready for some surprising news: Hakkasan is awesome.  Does that just blow your mind?   Well, it just us.  The only surprising thing really, is that it only has 4 stars currently.   What more do you want from a Chinese restaurant?  I guess maybe it's the price that puts people off, which is admittedly eye watering.  However everything is near perfect: food, ambiance, service, drinks.  All from the top drawer.  
Here is a top tip for you: go for lunch.   The tasting menu is £38 and you get dim sum, a main, sides, a drink.    What could go wrong?",1
2,"Our experience @ Nobu London was pretty disaster.  Don't worry about Nobu London, there are better high end sushi restaurants in London.  Just look at the picture I uploaded, the sashimi was pretty unappetite, the toro are fat toro but it wasn't a very nice piece and presentation was just so so.  I had been to other Nobu & Matsushiha in Beverly Hills, by comparions Nobu London was a disaster.  Services was ok, it was very slow and under attended during our visit but it doesn't bother me too much since I am very busy checking out all the high fashion people.   Seen and be seen is the only positive star I can think of.   Don't worry about the bill, it's expected you are weathly to dine there, 100 pounds per head minimum, we wasted closed to 300 pounds for 2 there and I wasn't rich, it was a mistake !
BTW, how come only people from the US write about Nobu London, no one from London writes about them.  Either they know it's a place to avoid or this place is really a trap for tourist ... especially from the US of A.
:-)",-1
2,"I... 
I honestly don't get it. 
After visiting bone daddies last week,  the high praise is pretty startling to me. I absolutely love ramen, and though I've spent a few months in Japan eating tons of it,  I'm no snob. I've slurped my fair share of 89cent pre-packaged block ramen and know that hey-- there's a spectrum. 
From what I'd read from others regarding ramen in London,  they don't really come close to the authentic fare,  but are still incredibly delicious. So when I saw that bone daddies was super hyped here and other places online,  I was actually really excited (despite the overwhelmingly hipster vibes). In the end,  I left disappointed. 
I had the tonkotsu ramen, hyped for a punch of that 20 hour deep, rich porky flavor, but instead I got an over salty (and trust me,  I loves me some salt) bowl of mediocrity. I can't speak for any of the other dishes,  but really... Even the crazy blaring music wasn't enough to distract me from how lacking in any depth of flavor this was. Like some basic stock and noodles. It was nothing special, so for the price, I didn't feel I'd gotten my money's worth. I've still yet to try some of the other recommended ramen places in London,  but as of now,  I definitely opulent rush back to bone daddies. 
Two stars because the egg was perfectly cooked,  edamame delicious,  and asahi flowin'.",-1
5,Yum! If you like dim sum then you'll love ping pong. Such a yummy dining experience. Ok so it's a chain. But the foods good the cocktails are great. Price is reasonable and it's great to share dishes with friends or have to yourself. Give it a go. Oh and they do all you can eat on a Sunday such a good deal.,1
1,"DISASTER.  What's the deal.  I know it is Chinese New Years but does the restaurant have to have an unannounced 20-30 minute long interruption with two unsmiling guys pounding on drums and banging their bells loudly?  It felt like the place was taken over by crazies and the staff just stood glumly as the session went on, and on, and on.....  A quick New Years ritual of say 60-90 seconds would have been great.  But to hand over a place full of paying patrons to a bunch of crazies was a really bad idea.  We walked out of our (early) evening reservation as we had ordered wine and had been trapped, getting nothing served, while holding our fingers in our ears due to the noise!
Management blew it big time as I'm never setting foot inside the place and it used to be a favorite.",-1
5,"Lovely place, ambient interior, excellent food! 
Had The Big Bombay breakfast, an good Indian take on a British classic. Love their Chai (refill for free) 
Not my last time here. Love it!",1
5,Came back another time with my hubby. Food was awesome. Service was super fast.  Can't wait to come back again!,1
4,"This is my second visit to a Ping Pong and I'm glad to say that the food was as good as I remember.
The dim sum, while not matching up to what I had in Shanghai, is reliable and the restaurant itself seemed easy enough to just rock up and get a table.
In the evenings the staff seem pretty rushed off their feet so you really have to be patient when vying for their attention!",1
4,"Came here for dinner the other day and gotta say, the food was quite good. Had the duck which was really tasty and the meat was really tender. Also had some veggies (up to standard with most Chinese restaurants!) and a fried tofu dish. The food was great and by the time we were done with our meal, there was a queue out the door - that should tell ya something!",1
3,Ramen and buns are okay. Service was prompt. The price is reasonable compared to london standards. They add a service charge to your bill. Come here early as the place gets packed after 6pm.,-1
2,"Food was excellent but the chef was clearly overtaxed on a Friday night, leading to delays in food arriving. To make matters worse the owner and his wife, gruff white haired elderly couple, arrived and were served their food immediately, bumping me and other customers back (my entree didn't arrive until an hour after ordering).  Owner then curtly refused to take anything off the bill though his own meals had preempted the paying customers.",-1
4,"I had the fried chicken and tonkatsu ramen.  The chicken was really good.  Perfectly crispy and not oily at all.  The ramen was also very good but different than what I'm used to.  I've never had such a rich broth.  I liked it, as the flavor was very deep, but warning it's much more filling than typical ramen!  I only ate about half after having the chicken.  I liked the concept of the egg (hard boiled but the broth somehow infused into it) but found it a little too salty.  I will go back again and make sure I'm super hungry this time.",1
2,"Flavors were off.  This place is overrated.   Felt like I was in an Indian Cheesecake factory.
Not impressed.... don't know what all the lines and rave reviews are all about??!",-1
4,"We arrived at 8pm on a Friday. I was worried about a massive queue but we were seated relatively quickly (albeit along a wall!)
We shared some fried chicken (tasty, not greasy although nothing too amazing). We both had ramen. My friend had the miso ramen which she loved - better than Koya!  I had the tantanmen ramen. I love spicy food but found that the heat overwhelmed the dish a bit but that said, I still loved it. In addition to the pork mince and one measly leaf of bok choy (um, couldn't they have upped the ruffage a bit??), there was also a soft boiled egg, peanuts and what I think was bamboo shoots. All very tasty!
I'd definitely go back to try the rest of the menu.",1
3,"Always enjoyable. BUT, prices are steep for what you get and the dim sum is merely acceptable. The stuff they serve in China Town is far superior. I do like Ping Pong's cocktails though and often go just to sample them before moving on to dinner elsewhere.",-1
4,"Wong Kei is great!
Decent portions of food at very good prices. Cash only but good for a group as they have big round tables.
The service isn't great but you almost go there for that, as it adds to the experience as long as you're expecting it!",1
2,"This place does not deserve the ratings displayed by other patrons. I am a globe trotter with a very eclectic palate and have tasted Indian food all over the world. I did not mind the 1 hour wait and in fact appreciated the warm tea they served outside. The only reason I come to an Indian restaurant is to enjoy some good desi food. This place is a huge disappointment! They need to change their chef or teach him how to cook Chicken Tikka Masala(Ruby). It tasted of uncooked tomatoes and the spices were not throughly cooked.The next dish we tried was a biryani and God help us.  It only made me miss the countless other decent biryanis I have had in my life time. 
I think the hype is initial and will die down once the audience finds out other better options!",-1
4,"Ridiculously amazing tonkotsu broth, esp with chili sauce added to it. Rich, thick, delicious. 
The soft boiled egg could have been cooked a little less so the yolk could have added to the creaminess of the broth ie orenchi in Santa Clara, Ca.
The noodles were not my fave; too thin and did nothing for the broth.
I regret not ordering extra broth...
The karaage fried chicken was delicious too.
Don't be deterred by the long lines- come alone or with one other. 
Big groups at the tiny restaurant would be ridiculous anyway. 
Groups of 6 were made to wait in line for 90+ mins while we waltzed in after a 20 min wait.",1
4,"Staff serving baby shot glasses of warm sake to the people on the queue was a sign of good things to come.
After about 25min on a Sat night I was seated with some strangers (I was by myself) and was ready to order. They didn't have anymore of the cocktail I wanted (sour ginger) so I got an Ume Shower which was too sweet for my taste but ok nonetheless.
Then, the ramen.  The broth was something special and really made the dish.  The meat was skimpy and blah compared to ramen I've had in other cities and the noodles themselves fell a little short, too.  Although you get a solid serving of noodles, they don't taste much different than regular angel hair pasta. However, the goodness is in the flavor combo - between the thick, robust, savory broth and the perfect combo of toppings this ramen was totally delicious, special, and worth a try.
if i have time while i am here, i'll come back and try another ramen!",1
3,"Hakkasan is one of those places that always makes top 10 lists, so this year for our anniversary, we thought we would try it. 
I tried the dim sum platter, and my favourite was the shimeji mushroom dim sum which was the best flavour of the night for me. The other dim sum were decent, but nothing really stood out and one amazing piece of dim sum doesn't qualify the entire platter.
The chicken corn soup was also not impressive, I have had better at Good Earth. It tasted mostly of chicken and not much else.
The pepper rib eye beef was really good though and had a lovely peppery aftertaste. I really enjoyed the tender pieces of beef and the yummy sauce they were in. The deep fried prawns were a bit too sweet for me, but my husband really liked them.  We also ordered Hakka noodles, which were thin noodles with great texture but very little flavour at all. They would be great to mix with a spicy sauce-y dish, but on their own they are pretty bland.
I was excited about the Michelin starred food and although everything was good, nothing really blew me away. It was like going to a good concert but with only low volume music. Perhaps if I had ordered more in a big group I might have been more impressed. The restaurant itself was nice, stylishly dim, but nothing special.
I have heard that the service is iffy, but our server was nice enough, although I was a bit worried that she was a robot sometimes. They even sent us a plate with happy anniversary written in chocolate and a scoop of lovely sorbet with graham cracker-y goodness, and we really appreciated the thoughtfulness.  I enjoyed the beef but I don't know if it's enough for me to go back, unless I was in a big group and could try a lot more.",-1
5,"Amazing restaurant!
The food was very special, a feast for the eyes.
Highly Recommend!",1
4,"Having been here a few times, I thought Yauatcha finally deserved a review.
Yep, you guessed it, It's a positive one!
I thoroughly enjoyed each visit to this restaurant for a number of reasons. The service has always been impeccable; especially on my last visit where glasses of water would appear on our table as if by magic. Our waitress (each time) was only too happy to explain some of the dishes to us as they were vaguely described on the menu. Our food always arrived promptly and of course tasted delicious! 
The decor is beautiful inside leaving your jaw ajar for the first 10 minutes as you take in the surroundings. Plus, the dessert display upstairs makes it incredibly difficult to resist!
After tasting a variety of dishes on the menu with each one as mouthwatering as the next, I know I will be paying yet another visit for my dim sum fix as the menu is quite large I (and you) want to try everything.",1
2,"Tonkatsu Ramen broth has been pretty salty the last two times that I've been here. You need water to help you finish the ramen. 
Pork ribs - not much meat to the bones!
I really wanted to like you Bone Daddies but fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...well you can't get fooled again.",-1
3,"There's a lot of talk about this place and it's Michelin star. On eating there, you would only imagine it's there for the service as the food isn't anything special. Well apart from the fabulous Beancurd and Prawn Cheung Fun.
Whilst it offers al the usual dim sum fare that you'll find in Chinatown on the a la carte menu. There are more special and better presented unique Dim Sum such as the Shanghai Blues restaurant in Holborn which offers similar fare with live music
Also value is pretty poor. The tea is by the pot and super pricy. Don't expect refills here. Dishes start from around £5 upward. Service aside, there are much better options when it comes to food quality and wow factor.
Expect £30-40 per head.",-1
3,"Luckily I managed to get to Ping Pong in time to avoid queuing, though having to wait at the bar for a table allowed us to enjoy one of their delicious freshly made cocktails which really were very tasty.
 Not knowing what to expect we went for a set menu (Dumpling Fix) which gave us chance to try several of their dishes for much better value than selecting individually, which would work out fairly expensive as most of them are around £3 each compared with the £11.50 we paid for 8 dim sums as well as duck spring rolls and pork puffs, and a mango pudding.
 It was the first time that I had tried dim sum, and I'm not sure it's really for me, though I certainly did not leave feeling hungry with dish after dish being brought to us.
 Definately worth a visit, even simply to determine whether you're a fan of dim sum or not.",-1
4,"Delicious ramen, fast service, but one of the waiters was in such a hurry he pushed my partner and I around a little. Would definitely come back.",1
4,"Hello London, good to see you it's been awhile.  Slip into Hakkasan for my first meal of the visit...HELLLLO London, I like your style.
There are two ways to look at Hakkasan.  The first could be your cynical side, observing Hakkasan is basic dim sum and chinese fare prepared exquisitely well.  Could I reconstruct the tastes at 1/5 of the price in LA via an afternoon crawl across the San Gabriel Valley?  Of course.
But, much like people, there is something to be said about a restaurant that knows what it wants to be, and has a personality to back it up.  Huge diversity, perfect drinks, and good service make it an easy recommend.
I have learned very few lessons in life other than the most essential (Always bet on black, never fight a land war in Asia) but a 3rd Hakkasan has confirmed is 'When confronted by Ostrich on a menu...order every damn time"".  It never fails, their version is an amazing balance of heat, sweet, and saltiness over rice.",1
4,"We picked this restaurant based on ylep's review.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  We didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was very busy, but the hostess seated us pretty quickly.  We order a bottle of white wine based on their recommendation.  It was priced fairly.  I had sea bass and my daughter had duck, both entrees were excellent.  The wait staff was very attentive and the decor was intimate/calming.  I would definitely go back again.",1
3,"Yauatcha is like its desserts - pretty on the outside, above average on the inside. 
Ambiance is great - it's trendy and modern with blue aquariums enclosing the restaurant. The food is pretty good but is pricey for what you get.  I ordered about 8 dishes total for 4 people and we were good in terms of quantity.  The meats we ordered were on the sweeter side. Shu mai comes in 3s which is a problem for groups not in multiples of 3s.  
Yummy to my tummy:
Prawn & Bean Curd Cheung Fun (Excellent contrast of soft and crunchy)
Spicy Softshell Crab with Almond (I could eat the entire bed of spicy almond)
Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs (Meat falls off the bone! Sweet ribs but not so messy)
venison puff (good pastry but sweet meat)
King Crab Siew Long Bao (one of my favorites - soup dumpling! The brothi inside is tasty)
Meh - wouldn't get these again:
Pork and Prawn Shu mai (meat could've been anything - this came with 4 pieces)
Chive and prawns (bitter, wasn't a hit with my group)
Crystal Dumpling Wrap with Pumpkin (fried spring roll)
Desserts were aiiiite. 
Raspberry Delice - chocolate raspberry cake. Prettier than it tastes
Lychee rose - a lot of things going on, 
Coffee Mascarpone - my favorite of a creamy dessert with hint of coffee
Gianduja Lemon - not a fan of chocolate and lemon",-1
5,OMG. Going back again ASAP. Okay so had to go back before leaving. Such an experience we had to go back while in London! Absolutely fab!,1
3,"Perhaps the most authentic Japanese restaurant in London. I do not find the food as cheap as some reviewers implied, unless you are ordering from the off-peak deal. Misato, another Japanese cheap eat not too far from Tokyo Diner does cheaper food at larger portions. Tokyo Diner serves decent Japanese food but unfortunately not memorable. However, I do like their no-tips policy. Coming from Asia, I don't particularly agree with tipping, especially under pressure. Will I be back? Probably.",-1
3,"I have eaten here twice for breakfast and once for dinner. Once, I got the Akuri eggs, which were super tasty with just the right amount of spice (not too spicy, not too salty), served with a side of grilled tomato and two little buttered buns (~£7, 4 stars--5 if it had been a little warmer, as it was a bit cold upon being served). The house chai I got with another buttered bun was also quite good--I mean, the chai was excellent (5 stars), though the bun itself was just another buttered bun, and like some other reviewers have said, it wasn't my favorite thing to dip into the chai. Maybe it would be better if the bun had a sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon? Either way, you can get a chai for £2.50 or a chai with a bun for £2.70, so no harm there. Plus, the chai is limitless--which, if you have an attentive server, may be filled without you even asking, but if you get an inattentive one, may never be filled even if you ask three times (both situations happened to me). Either way, for under £10 for a meal in a sit down restaurant (whose ambiance is chic via a distressed style of decor layered with a bit of humor in the signage), it's not too bad, even if the portion on the eggs leaves you a bit unfulfilled (even if you steal some breakfast lassi from your friend--which tastes more like banana than anything else (2.5 stars)).
The second breakfast I had there was the Bombay omelette. I had just had an apple, carrot and ginger juice (~£4, 4.5 stars), so maybe the ginger took away my sense of taste, but I found this omelette to be not only overcooked and therefore dry but quite flavorless save for two bites that had a piece of hot pepper in them (~£7, 1 stars). This dish came with one grilled tomato and ""fire toast"", which is really just thick cut white bread toasted on the grill, which leaves blackened stripes on it, and buttered--3 stars. Along with this dish, I tried some of my co-eater's bacon and egg naan. I will say that, aside from the Akuri I had gotten previously, this was stellar--5 stars for sure. I mean, I don't eat a lot of bacon, as the fat kinda grosses me out, but if you look away while biting into this, you'll taste so many different flavors all at once--the smokiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the chili, the creaminess of the cream cheese, the spice of the chili... It's absolutely wonderful, though for £6.50, realize you get a rather small serving and probably need to order something else if you want a heartier breakfast. (Same portion warning goes with pretty much anything other than the Big Bombay, unless you are the type that typically stays full from a couple of eggs and pieces of bread.) I also tried his Kejriwal (£4.90), which was two eggs served on a piece of toast with a bit of chili and cheese. I thought my bite of this was rather interesting. It had a nice bite to it from both the chili and the (sharp cheddar?) cheese--4 stars.
When I went for dinner we started with a couple of drinks and the pau bhaji (£3.90 for a tapas-like serving). It had a quite nice flavor, says this American, but could have benefited from a bit more veggies in the sauce and at least one more bun for dipping (3.5 stars). My Indian co-eater that night said it also needed more peas in order to be more authentic. As for the mango (and fennel) lassi I was drinking at the time, it was quite sour and was therefore nothing like a lassi I have ever had except one made by my friend once--using a mango that was not ready to be cut in fat-free plain  yogurt. I'm not sure how Dishoom makes their lassis, but at about £4 a glass (not bottomless!), they are not what I would expect--which is sweet and addictive. My Indian co-eater agreed. The bowl of black daal we split over a serving of basmati rice was presumed to be the star, but honestly was pretty blah. I found it smoky, if not a bit burnt, rather than rich and decadent like this buttery lentil dish normally has been for me. Plus, the smoky hid the Indian spice that I love so much. For a girl who dislikes bbq, this was an unhappy choice in spicing (~£5, 2 stars). Given this dish was not the star, there was now an opening--which was filled by our dessert: Memsahib's Mess (£5.20). This dessert was a bit on the small side for its price, but was BIG on flavor. From the super sweetness of the crunchy meringue to the creamy cream to the superb rose undertones, it was absolutely wonderful. Not overly rich, but sweet enough and exotic enough to really stand out--5 stars. 
Bottom line: I think there are some dishes that are excellent and some that are okay and some that are plain poor, and though this ambiance is excellent and prices are in line with the rest of London, the servings of certain items could be improved. Combined with inconsistently good (or poor) service, I think 3 stars is really the perfect description of this place. I would recommend trying it, but giving feedback to your waiter if you are not happy so you can order something else then and there...",-1
3,"I found this place on Yelp after craving sushi late night after a long day working and not wanting room service.
I opted for the sashimi set at 11:40pm. They close exactly at 12:00am and no yelp, they do not offer take away... 
Sushi was typical but not exceptional. As the other reviews say, the place is run by Japanese and is a good place to stop by but not anything special.",-1
2,"It isn't really Japanese. Everyone from the wait staff are Eastern European. I doubt they speak Japanese. I could barely understand their English. The food isn't really Japanese, except they use soy-sauce.  Okay food richly decorated.
The salmon tar tar is just soak in plain soy-sauce. Yuck!
It is loud. One cannot carry on a conversation. Every time a customer walks in all the wait staff will yell out something that could almost be confused with a Japanese greeting (いらっしゃいませ). At least they did it with convictions.
I would skip this one if you are look for food instead of an event.",-1
5,"This is my first try of a michelin-starred Cantonese dim-sum restaurant, and it did pass my approval because the dim-sum was as good as the best I've had in Hong Kong and China. 
The quality of the shrimp dumpling especially, which for me is the best way to judge the quality of dim-sum ingredients, was incredible with its translucent skin and natural texture. The white bread of the barbecue pork bun was soft and light. 
Even though the prices are exorbitant because you can pay 1/4 of the price for the same quality in China, in London this will the best it gets for quality dim-sum along with a great atmosphere.",1
3,"3.5 stars for me.  The food was good, but nothing special that would make me want to come again.  Had the Chicken Tikka Masala, samosa, vegetable curry.  Garlic naan was blah. I dont know why this restaurant was so busy, but there was definitely a crowd.",-1
3,"Cute bistro on New Oxford Street with a great value dinner menu (just under £20 for two courses, £15.50 for an entrecote steak, frites and sald).  The interior is pretty quirky and it definitely exudes that family-run feeling that few places in London possess these days.
I went for the entrecote option (rare) - I thought it was ok, although noticeably tough.  The flavour was decent though, and the chips were good.  However, whilst eating, I just couldn't help but think of Le Mercury in Angel which has a similar MO and is simply fantastic (and cheaper).  However, I will return here at some point and try some of the other dishes on the menu as I'm aware that the entrecote item may not be treated with the same respect as the other dishes.  Update forthcoming...",-1
4,"I was positively surprised to find the setting, the food quality and variety are better than what I expected.  Of course, there is a price tag for this.  Avg nearly $80 person after currency conversion, without any alcohol.  
Three downsides:
-no high chair for kid, so not suitable for toddlers
-no designated servant, it feels like everyone serves every table.  So some request may be lost 
-no leftover take-out: we first under ordered and then over-ordered.  At the time we get the check, we were told that there is no left-over takeout.  So be careful when you order",1
5,"Loved this place! Great food and drinks, moderate prices, wonderful atmosphere.",1
3,"Large dim sum menu and this place was recommended to us, the decor was nice and very trendy.  It looked like a nice place to grab a drink, with 2 bars, one in the back and another in the basement.  The dim sum was good, but not great, and you're paying mostly for ambience... I ordered the Pippa Tofu simply because I thought it was named after Pippa Middleton, only to find out that's an actual dish, either way it was very good and probably my favorite of the dinner...",-1
5,Was in London for a few days and this restaurant came highly recommended. We first went to the Covent Garden location were the line was pretty long. So we went to the Shoreditch location which was closer to where we were staying. No wait. Food was amazing (definitely order the Dal) and the service even better. Staff let us use their phone to hail a cab. Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to London.,1
3,"Great food and great service, slightly expensive but the food tastes great. They do have early bird menus which are good deals but is limited to certain times.
Great atmosphere and friendly staff",-1
4,"we sat in the main dining room...not the conservatory which was disappointing but they tried to get us in. i made the reservation like six weeks in advance. we dressed up in suit/dress but we saw people in there with jeans fyi. 
the food was all very good, not amazing, not terribly expensive compared to ledbury/heston/clove club.
the main purpose of this place is the atmosphere. your stomach wont feel dissapointed, but it wont be the best meal youve ever had. if you go you need to book very far in advance to get conservatory.",1
5,"Hubby and I were hungry and happen to be by Chinatown around dinner time one night in London so we stopped in here after seeing a long line here the night before . We wanted to see what the hype was. We noticed they have multiple locations with the first being open since 1990, so we knew the food had to be good. I also double checked on Yelp and noticed most of the bad reviews were non-Asian or complaints about the restaurant, service, or tip. Aka, good food? Im down! 
The entrance and ground floor is tight but we managed to be lead upstairs to our table. I am glad they gave us a bigger table for our winter jackets, shopping bags, and room for the food we ordered. 
We asked what were some of the best sellers and ordered two dishes to share. Plus an appetizer of xiao long bao. 
The xiao long bao was meh, skip it. 
We also ordered the crispy aromatic duck and lobster. The duck was extremely good. The lobster as quite good as well, but not a good as impressive as the duck. The duck I highly recommend getting when visiting here. Next time I will get the traditional roast duck as it has been deemed by the Financial Times as ""the best roast duck in the world"" lol. That probably means at least in the UK it is the best. 
The waiter does speak Chinese and English so no worries if you cant speak Chinese. 
This place is pretty traditional from the food to experience. Dirty, small, dingy restaurant. Waiter is pushy and cranky (what Chinese adult/parent isnt lol). Plating is traditional (plopped on a plate lol). Table side service for the duck. The only thing I didnt do is get a hot bowl of water to clean my utensils lol. 
You do have to pay for rice and water. Oh, and I think I spotted 20% automatic tip. 
*For my fellow Chinese : Every Chinese person is showing face so wear nice clothes- service is better then - hint hint. 
This place offers great authentic Chinese food. Get off the high horse and get passed the ambiance/cleanliness, plating, service, cost, etc. and enjoy the good food they have to offer. Its good. It why you go to a restaurant at the end of the day....to eat. Visit and enjoy the Duck!",1
2,"Distinctly average.
Cramped seating (downstairs anyway), average-tasting food, a bit expensive, so-so service. With so many other restaurants in Chinatown, I can't see myself coming back. My advice is to only eat here if everywhere else is full and you can't be bothered to wait.",-1
4,"Delicious dim sum, but not so good as to justify the price. You are definitely paying for atmosphere. The presentation of the desserts is remarkable.",1
4,"If you know what to expect, then this place is great. It's not like the old days when part of the attraction was surliness of the staff, but you are still herded in and sat with strangers around the big tables (a friend of mine was once sat on the same table as Noel Gallagaher). 
The food is good, arrives quickly, and is cheap. It's not the place for a nice relaxing or romantic meal, but if you want to get off the streets and have some good cheap food with others doing the same then it's great. Here's a tip, try talking to the people you get sat with, most times I've met quite a few interesting people.
If you can't use chopsticks you will have to ask for a fork, and the constant free teapots of Chinese tea are a big bonus!",1
5,"I really like Hakkasan, but you have to take it with a pinch of salt. Ultra-trendy, its the place to be seen enjoying contemporary Asian food. So don't get hung up on the posers, cos you're going to miss enjoying some of the best asian food in london.
 I love the setting - a subterranean dining space, accessed from a dingy alley off Tottenham Court Road. Hardly a salubrious neighbourhood, but it heightens the effect of entering such a trendy space. Dark, moodily lit, black ash furniture is all counterpointed with the occasional spot & neon blue lamp. The bar area boasts some comfortable sofas & an impressive drinks menu.
 Once you're seated service is attentive, especially as you start to realise that the restaurant holds a lot of covers. To be honest the food is well executed but there are no signature dishes. Unsurprisingly its expensive, but not overly so.",1
5,"Gorgeous food & great service.  This place is such a treat - glamorous, cosy, frivolous and as expensive as you want it to be.",1
3,I went there for a dinner with my husband and first thing I didnt like was sharing table with 6 other people. I was hoping for privacy but ok I guess thats fine. Theres was just a lot of other empty tables and I dont think few groups o f 8 would come right after. The server was very rude and rush me a LOT! Luckly the food was very very good so I belive thats the most important part.,-1
4,"Yes, it hit the spot!  Great dumpling and Asian menu.  
Highlights:  Delicious dumplings and noodles cooked perfectly,  Ample quantity to share, Easy to make reservations, Reasonably priced, Great customer service and Nice big dinning area.
Can improve:  We had an issue with the dessert, our waiter raved about the chocolate pebble and then told us that they had sold out.  So we ordered another chocolate option and it was horrible.  But the table next to us ordered their chocolate pebble 5 mins after we were told it was sold out, and they amazingly got theirs.  I shared the incident with the manager who was happy to remedy the situation and give us one for take away.  The chocolate pebble was amazing but it ruined the experience a little.  When you are celebrating a birthday and the dessert is a downer then it ruins the evening.  Our waiter did not even acknowledge or apologize.  Second issue I had was that we had some food left over and they would not offer take away.  No matter how fancy the place, if I pay for something then you can't tell me that I can take it away, plus I hate wasting food and would rather bring it home to finish or donate to someone who is hungry outside than have it go in the trash.  
Benchmark:  They are really good and come on par with Ping Pong.  I like this place better.
Dined in April 2016 and will return.",1
5,"Modern Chinese restaurant (think Mr. Chow).
*not allowed to take pictures here* oops!
Directions:
You can't get dropped off right at the entrance of this restaurant because its a very skinny alleyway that leads to it. If you get dropped off of Oxford St., walk down Hanway Place and when it forks stay to the left. Go all the way down and the restaurant will be on the left at the end. Go down the flight of stairs and be greeted by a bouncer. 
The inside of the restaurant is all trendy asianed up. It is actually huge downstairs. I came here for dim sum.  All the items were a modern version of the traditional dim sum (no chicken feet here :( . The best dishes to order are xiao loan bao (I don't know the english name, but if the server doesn't understand you they are steamed pork dumplings that come with the ginger and vinegar sauce on the side). *Also when eating these dumplings, you need to let the soup inside drain out before you put it in your mouth or you will burn your tongue.* I'm not really sure what I ordered, I just asked the waiter for the most popular dishes. Here is what I didn't like: chicken soup and duck egg rolls. The pan fried chicken and shrimp dumplings were okay. I had this sea bass something dish that was interesting and would have been better if there was more sauce. If I go back I would probably skip the dim sum and go straight to their main dishes.
Okay, again with the desserts in London. Amazing! I don't know what my friends dessert was called, but it was soooo good. It was shapped like flan, but was more like ice cream and came with something similar to peanut brittle on the side. It seems like every place I try, the desserts get better and better. I decided to go the healthy route and ordered an exotic fruit platter (warning its huge!) If you come here, please save room for dessert, its the best part.

5,"Extremely tasty dim sum in London! I have tried so many dim sum restaurants in London - most of them in Chinatown or Soho and for me, this is the only one that really met the mark.
Came here with my husband and in-laws for Friday night dinner and we were all very happy with the experience. Highlights of our meal were the shrimp dumplings - amazing - I could have had an entire meal of them, the crispy duck pancakes (the duck was so perfectly crisp and tender) and the stir fried rib eye, which had the most beautiful flavours. We also had delicious Singapore noodles and a fantastic shrimp dish that I can't recall the name of. The calamari and prawn toast were tasty, but not a must-have and I wouldn't order them again.
Good wine and cocktail list and a great selection of virgin cocktails (bonus for me as I am pregnant!).
Fabulous meal, great service and lovely surroundings (I love the starry sky ceiling). We will definitely return again soon.",1
3,"I'd really give this place a 3.5 stars if I could.
I've passed by this place so many times and finally stopped here for lunch the other day.  They have a pretty good variety of items on the menu - and I went with the katsu curry.  I thought it was good but it didn't get me excited enough to give it 4*s.  The age dashi tofu is really good.  I'll have to go back and try some of the other things on the menu.",-1
1,"It took me a long old time to get around to visiting Hakkasan and frankly had heard nothing but great things about it so was all set to enjoy a leisurely 'Thank God it's Friday' lunch with my oldest and thank goodness richest friend....the idea was to eat, drink and make very very merry indeed whilst catching up and generally having a rip roaring old time.
 Oh Dear! Despite many many glowing reports about firstly the amazing ambience, secondly the amazing cocktails and thirdly the amazing food, it was a disaster....the cocktails were really average, the food was so ludicrously overpriced for tiny portions that it was laughable and we were one of only 4 tables occupied in the whole restaurant, given the above I'm really not surprised...maybe it's passed it's sell by date...maybe we were just unlucky....but it was really disappointing and so stupidly expensive that even 'The Millionaire' baulked at the bill....this from a man who thinks nothing of paying £500 lunch for two....if he enjoys it. My advice? Go to China Tang instead.",-1
4,"If I wasn't such a style slut I wouldn't rate Hakkasan as highly as I do. The interior is dark and decadent. It's been rated no. 19 by the San Pellegrino top 50 restaurants in the world. Amidst the almost black browns and dim lighting, snooty staff glide through the restaurant. 
It's not a place you can linger in as you have set times to eat and get out. Yes I am rather cynical about it all. 
The vegetarian dim sum is delicious. One day I'd like to have the luxury of experiencing the menu with no concern for budget but for now I will stick to lunch time starter menu.",1
1,"The place tricks you into thinking you're going to get the same good in the upstairs restaurant. 
If you want the authentic stuff, they have it in the bottom floor. Unfortunately, we waited an hour for nothing in the street food menu. Came here from the states because of the reviews.
Going to Dishoom. They have the same menu throughout and worth the wait.
They even charge service charge on drinks we got earlier. We didn't end up eating there.",-1
4,"Great atmosphere, decor offset the tasty, but quite small dim sum.
This was my first time at Ping Pong. I planned to have a quick lunch armed with my newly registered Ping Pong Loyalty Card, Email for a free cocktail and booking for the Super 8 Menu. The Super 8 menu consisting of a chicken rice pot, tea of your choice, won-ton soup with dumplings, and 5 pre-selected dim sum pieces.
I opted to sit outside as it was a nice day. It was a little breezy, but every table has a heating element above it, meaning you're not left shivering in late September. I would imagine these would be ineffective when the weather drops below 15 degrees.
The staff were pleasant, but there seemed to be a lot of confusion around my cocktail voucher, and to be honest the waiter was clearly new and picking things up. First to arrive was my cocktail. This was a ginger passionfruit crushed ice cocktail. It wasn't very good. Next my complimentary prawn crackers with assortment of dips. Note: you'll need a ping pong loyalty card to get this, but it's free! These were okay. 
The dim sum arrived shortly after, and I was left slightly puzzled. Normally when I dine chinese, I expect the soup to come first, followed by rice then everything else. I didn't know whether to pick at my tiny dim sum pieces or wait for the soup and rice pot to arrive...after 5 minutes I decide to tuck in. The dim sum was obviously made in house. Both the taste and shapes made it obvious. These weren't your run of the mill production line dim sum. But also left room for skimping on the size. The only one adequate size was the chicken/prawn one. The rest were far too small. If I was paying around £3-4 for 3 pieces I would most definitely be disappointed. However in the context of the deal and extras, it was more than filling. 
As I polished off 2 of the 5 pieces, the Lychee Red Black scented tea arrived. The aroma was dazzling, and the taste wonderful. Full of flavour and silky smooth without any bitterness. Beautiful. Then finally the rice pot and won-ton soup came. The soup was strange. Tasted nothing like the wonton soup I'm used to and was surprisingly sour. The wonton dumplings were great. Quite large and tasty. The rice pot was the highlight of the meal. The oyster based sauce full of flavour, and plenty of chicken and lots of chinese black mushroom (a delicacy). One of the best rice pots I've ever had. The dipping sauces included chilli oil (all oil, no actual flakes :/), and chilli. The special sauces as a loyalty card holder included chilli black bean sauce (delish), sweet and sour and sesame hoi sin sauce. They were pleasant, but really only the chilli based ones worked with dim sum.
So in all, the decor of the place really impressed. Somebody really though about the experience visually. Unfortunately the food (in respect to the dim sum) is below average and the order dishes arrive is a little random. Two things that wouldn't take a lot of effort to improve. Otherwise it has all the small touches I appreciate. Unprotected wifi, loyalty card scheme, lovely interior, unique tea blends. Lets see the major food points fixed, and this place would be an easy 5 stars.",1
3,"High end in many ways: decor, service and price. Food just wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped
Green Prawn starter (3.5/5) - it was a good size prawn but there were only two. It tastes fine
Patiala Shahi Raan Lamb shank (3/5) - it was huge and cooked in a puff pastry. The meat itself was tender but not very flavorful. The sauce was nice but still not as potent as I was hoping for.
It's possible my mistake was not getting a more curry based dish. 
The service was fantastic. Not sure what it says about me that I would have preferred Dishoom",-1
4,"Top-shelf ramen with great flavor in the broth and tender noodles as well as a diverse selection of toppings to be added a la carte or at the table. I am told by friends that I made a big mistake here by not ordering the Korean chicken wings or the fried chicken, although the salmon tartare with crispy lotus root chips and a ponzu oil flavoring was dynamite as well. I would definitely go back, although I would make sure to try the chicken next time.",1
4,"Great place, great food, great buzz... Back For the second time this week. Need I say more?
They don't do reservations so 1 to 1.5 hr wait to get in and longer to actually have a table and get food, but it's worthed. Be persistent :-)",1
3,"Okay food; tried chicken, lamb and aloo gobi; appetizer section was larger than entrees; seems like a casual appetizer place more than a serious food place.",-1
5,"This is truly the most romantic restaurant i have ever seen. The articles are right. The most memorable meal I had in London - from the high level of service to the exquisite food to the jaw-dropping romantic atmosphere. If you are a couple in love, this should be at the top of your restaurant bucket list. If you are a solo or group foodie, then dine in their well appointed dining room surrounding the romantic conservatory so that you can enjoy this fine meal without the sappy lovers swapping gazes. 
I'll start with the food because it cannot be overstated how much attention was placed to every taste detail. Even the salad left you wondering - how do they do it? Salad shouldn't taste this good. Get the salad.
I ordered the burrata with marinated beets - totally odd composition to me, but the chef pulled it off. As beautifully set as this dish was, the taste was better. Flawless. Get this one too.
For my entree I ordered the line caught cod. Bonus points to CM for the line caught fish. The flavors were subtle and enjoyable.
We had to get on to our show, so no time for dessert, but I could have stayed in that restaurant for hours drinking the fine wines they had available. I was impressed with the sommelier who did not suggest the highest priced glass of wine. He chose the perfect pairing for my entree.
Not only was the sommelier on point, every person from the hostess to the bread boy (?), the waiter to the manager was above and beyond knowledgeable and kind. Patient with my questions about the food and request for pictures, this team could not be thanked enough. I wanted to hug everyone there.
During our meal this woman showed up dressed in cargo pants and flip flops asking for a table here. The manager was nicer than I would have been but politely told her that the conservatory (where the flowers hang) books 6 months in advance and she could not be accommodated. I mean, you can see walking in that this is a very nice place - and you want to be sat looking like you just came off the fishing pier? Whaaaa? Who does that? Have some respect for yourself and the people who are all in there dressed nicely for a formal meal and t he proprietors who are trying to create a romantic ambiance. The moral of this story is make reservations far in advance and dress appropriately.
I am not a poet, as any words I could compose would fail to do justice to the flower heaven that has been created here, so look at my pics. I am lucky enough to have a very romantic boyfriend who takes me to many romantic restaurants, but Clos Maggiore is unique and will forever have top billing in my mind and heart as the most romantic restaurant. Save up and go here.",1
3,"supaaah late review. Mind you, this is from a few err..months back. It was for the UYE unconventional breakfast series. The second one featuring indian style breakfast. Thanks Katie B for organising it!
I get it, it's sunday morning and the wait staff just don't want to deal with a massive party. They've probably had really rough nights, but not even a smile? A fake screwed on one? No? okay. The food wasn't great. I loved the flavour of my chai chocolate but, it actually arrived lukewarm. Is that supposed to be a thing? I don't get it.
The sausage naan roll was okay, it wasn't stellar and it needed alot of the asian style jam/chutney to make it easier to eat! 
I just didn't warm up to you Dishoom (pun unintended), it wasn't exciting enough, for an unconventional breakfast.",-1

4,"Whilst in london for a weekend, a friend took us to yauatcha in soho. When we walked there, she stopped and said we are here... We just looked and thought really?? It doesn't look like a restaurant outside though through the window we could see it was a bakery.
We hadn't made a booking so they gave us a table for three people and said we had two hours.
We ordered various dim sum, which are quite expensive and only really a treat, rather than somewhere you would go every Sunday like we normally have done in Birmingham!! The waitress told us we had ordered enough as they don't do take out boxes! Okay we got told lol 
Some of the dim sum was nice and some were too unusual for my taste. It is stylish and an Instagrammers heaven ! My friend paid so I don't know how much lunch cost! But must been expensive though we only drank water and green tea.
The toilets are downstairs and the sink is like a Japanese garden with slate steps. See my photo!! There were only two out of I think six toilets working which I think isn't acceptable especially as they didn't put up a notice on the doors. 
There is a bakery with some gorgeous desserts which I wish I had tried but couldn't walk round london with them as takeaways. There's always next time!!!",1
4,"If you're after a cheap place, decent food and a good serving size, Wong Kei ticks these boxes. My usual orders are the pork porridge and black bean aubergine on rice. This is a no frills place, I've never had to wait in line and always walk out full.",1
2,"I went here with a friend excited for an awesome meal since it's a Michelin star restaurant. However, the quality was not as good as we expected. The dimsum was not very authentic. It tastes quite bland, actually. I'm very open for fusion food but this is not even fusion. It's just like eating chinese food cooked by someone who does not know anything about chinese cuisine. Plus, portion size is quite inconsistent. Some dishes are incredibly small while some other dishes were so much bigger than expected. Service was quite slow and the waiter keeps forgetting our requests. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to others since it's quite expensive as well.",-1
2,"I'm quite bemused by all the positive reviews for this place. Took a date here and was somewhat embarrassed at how poor quality the food was. For Angel, I was expecting better.",-1
4,"I've been told this is one of the best roast places in London. It is really good for roast duck and soya chicken. I've tried the crispy pork and BBQ pork too, but I have had better back home (Melbourne). That said, it is one of the best roast places in London Chinatown. I buy take away from here regularly and I've come here to eat with a group of friends a few times. It's a good place for a large or small group as you can order mains and share amongst the table.",1
3,"A friend recommended this place to us as one of the best ramen places in London. However, he did warn us that Asian food in London does not compare to that of the Bay Area. That said, I can say that this place is hit-or-miss. Some dishes are amazing and some are just bland. For example, I ordered the kimchee ramen while the others ordered the tonkatsu ramen. My ramen was bursting with flavor and good, but the tonkatsu was the opposite. The people in my group complained that it was one of the worst that they had ever tried. There was no seasoning at all. They had to add soy sauce or black oil to spice it up a bit. Disappointing. With the appetizers, order the fried chicken and skip the pork and corn croquettes. Again, one was perfect while the other one needed more. 
The restaurant is located close to Chinatown and I would have totally missed it if I walked by. The place is small so be prepared for a wait during meal times. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They had us come in from the rain and sit on stools until there was a table available. 
Remember that compared to almost every other currency in the world, the London pound is pretty expensive so don't expect this place to be cheap.",-1
5,"When I was in high school and living in Surrey, we used to travel into the city by train on the weekends.  Since the food was so cheap and we were all broke, Wong Kei (Wonkys) became a staple in our lives.  It is so refreshing to see from Yelp reviews that nothing has changed.  They still treat everybody like shit and the food is still good and cheap.
I will never forget being seated with a group of total strangers the first time.  The man said, ""you sit here"".  I sat.  A minute later, I told the same man that there was a noodle in my spoon (hoping to get a clean spoon).  He shook the spoon, knocking the noodle to the floor and said, ""here"".  These are the reasons Wonkys gets 5 stars in my book.  Unforgettable memories.",1
2,"I don't want to sound like a food snob, but I wasn't expecting much from an English ramen place. However, I'm happy to say that Shoryu was a pleasant surprise! I saw a bunch of people waiting on line to get in but they were in parties of 3+ so I decided to go in and put myself on a list in case there was one. Turns out there is no list, the line is 'first come first served' but because I told them that I was just two people, we got to skip the line. Lesson: don't just follow the crowd. 
As per usual in London, it took a million years for them to take our order of a beer, cocktail, the tan tan ramen and the Dracula ramen. The cocktail, which was just soda and plum wine, wasn't very good. But, the ramens weren't all that bad. The minced pork ramen (£10) was pretty much liquid fire for me, but my boyfriend managed fine. The Dracula ramen (£11.90) had a richer broth that wasn't spicy and was really good when I added some rice vinegar to it. Good spot if you're looking for a change from the fish and chips, but I don't need to go back.",-1
3,"Loved the salad and the ambiance was nice, however I found the steak... disappointing. 
After all the reviews I was really hoping for something special, but it was just, ok. The green sauce was very nice, however it wasn't something I would go out of my way to get again. Woke up this morning feeling a little queasy from the amount of oil on the fries as well...
It's a shame they don't do the salad with some of the steak slices on top for £10. That would be something I'd come back for. Otherwise... it's off to try the next steak place!",-1
5,"I'm not sure why, but I enjoyed Yauatcha a lot more the second time around.  We sat in the basement area again which has a dark and NYC-type of feel (if that makes any sense?).  
Two dishes that blew me away...
1. Venison puffs: Outrageously amazing.  The pastry is light and flakey and the filling is sweet, savoury, and just perfect.
2. Chili fried squid: Coated in slightly sweet, fried oats... It sounds odd, but it was such a delight.
I will certainly be returning for these two dishes!",1
2,A pleasant interior with nice dimmed lighting. My gripe is that every dish is laced with heaps of cream and butter. Why o Why can't french chefs cut back on the cow and just let the freshness of ingredients shine through? I'm tempted to give it a third star as the cepes were delicious and that New Zealand Viognier 'The Wingwalker' an exceptionally delicious white wine.,-1
5,"ok, its true Wong Kei has a very bad reputation - but people who hate it simply don't know how the restaurant runs:
- its a ""no-thrills"" restaurant, its cheap - you can't expect customer service!
- to eat here, just follow the following rules:
1. if you by yourself, grab a chair and sit - they will come find you with FREE tea!
2. if you're with a friend (so 2 of you), just say 2 or put 2 fingers up (the right way round of course), they will say go upstairs or downstairs (most likely downstairs - they have a system!)
3. the more people, the more fingers
-they speak good English, Cantonese and Mandarin!
- when you think their rude, you have to realise they work extremely long hours, don't earn much and don't expect to be tipped like Americans! so cut them some slack!
I love this restaurant not because their food is amazing - its so so and CHEAP! - but because I don't have to worry I'm eating alone, I can relax alone - everyones about their own business - everyone sits with everyone, sometimes you talk to strangers if you feel like it, or just keep to yourself - here you can be yourself and don't worry about being judged.
Conclusion: Cheap! and maybe cheerful (if you've done the right thing!)",1
3,"Maybe I was just unlucky, ordering the wrong dish... I couldn't eat more than half - it tasted weird. The bread had little gnats flying on it too and was too hard, like it'd been cut up hours before. 
I like the ambience of the place though, and the waitress, though she seemed stressed. I hope she gets a vacation or something good soon.",-1
4,"Fantastic food, excellent for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Definitely order the black lentils and the ruby chicken. A bit pricey but well worth it. 4 stars only for service - we were forgotten about multiple times and had to flag down many servers to get our orders in .",1
3,"The best parts were the service and the naan. It's a bit of a tourist trap, but almost everything in central London is to some extent, so I can't fault it for that- plus I'm no local either.
After years living in Singapore within a 10-minute walk to Little India for my weekly Indian fix, this was my first taste of classic British style Indian food. I had to try a chicken tikka... and it was ok. I've now been there, done that. Meh. The black dal (Grandad's dal) was ok. And so was the lamb korma. All around average. 
So far in London I preferred Dishoom more, however it is a much more modern restaurant. I opted to take the in-laws here, to Punjab, as I knew it was more traditional restaurant (quiet, good service). Not a bad place at all, but with all the Indian places in London, I'll try somewhere new next time for something more authentic, unusual or innovative.",-1
5,"First time in London and eating Indian food. This place was amazing. The wait was a little excessive (you have to wait to get a pager, and thats when the real wait starts) but during our wait for the pager we were offered some tea/shots which was nice! After receiving our pager, we waited by the bar. There's a really cool crowd that attends, the food came out fast! Def recommend the lamb and you HAVE to have the Garlic naan. Delish!",1
2,Slow service with many mistakes - during a slow period too. Not a huge fan of their modern interpretation of ramen - broth was too thick compared to the extremely thin noodles.,-1
4,Normally I prefer my ramen to be traditional but this place was an exception! I really liked my spicy miso ramen- it had just the right kick and flavour without having to overwhelm you!,1
3,"I'd say this is slightly overrated. I would give it 3.5 stars and for the price, would prefer Dishoom.
Flavor wise, the food was good, but it didn't exactly match the price tag. Unless you include the shaved gold that was added on top of our meat. 
Our service was also a little strange and left a lot of awkward moments between us and the staff member. Rather than providing guidance on the menu, the waiter kept insisting we get XYZ, which felt pushy and unresponsive to the table's taste/needs.",-1
2,"So many good eating choices, keep looking. The menu was not very exciting. The food was so full of pepper, it was inedible. The cheese plate looked like it was sitting around for a while. The bread was delicious. Servers were busy, the nicest person in the restaurant was the guy who took our credit card.",-1
5,"Absolutely loved this place. It was super crowded but still, the service was extremely nice, polite, helpful and fast. 
The atmosphere was great, interiorly is cool, DJ was amazing, but it was definitely loud and wouldn't be a place to go for a calm, private candle dinner. Also not a place for kids (in the evening) at all. 
The food was great and there were some extraordinary pieces we loved. 
Drinks were really good. The bathrooms were clean and had nice hand cream available. 
We later had a problem with the credit card and my bf had to try and call his bank, then walk to the next station for cash and then that didn't work and then I paid with my card. The whole ordeal took probably 30 min and none of the servers got impatient or rude. 
100% recommend. You can eat late night here and then move on to the bar down the street for a fun night.",1
5,I used to go Bone daddies regularly. I don't any more because my partner and I we pretty much foodie on the run and have this mission not to go the same restaurant again within a short period of time. But I have to say bone daddies does the best soup (?) I believe. Ramen king!,1
5,"Chinese food made so beautiful. 
good dim sum. 
We made a reservation on the same day. The service is good. the environment is very comfortable. Not stiff at all. Good for family",1
3,"Very good katsu curry, but nothing exceptional. If you enjoy having the traditional Japanese katsu curry, this is your place! I also read on the menu that you can get an extra-large portion of rice at no additional cost. 
I really enjoyed my food. It has been a while that I just had a katsu curry without anything fancy or the chef hyping it up. Good tasting and fresh :) It reminds me of what a katsu curry originally taste like.
The place is nicely decorated to look traditionally Japanese, so very simple. They do try to maximize the space as much as possible, so I felt like I was having lunch with the people sitting at the next table. Perhaps this is part of the appeal. 
If I am hungry in Chinatown and unsure of where to go for a sure-thing good tasting meal, I would certainly return. However, I would not travel just to eat here.",-1
3,"food was good
service was good
ambiance was small quaint and beautiful!
very romantic.
I personally find the food over rated and expensive.  
I do enjoy fine dining but when it is worth the money!",-1
5,"The first time I ate in this restaurant was in 1979 when they were in Blue post alley. The menu stayed the same for many years and it was finaly changed in 2000 something. My favourite dish was always 114 (Singapore fried noodles) and 112 (Fried Quai Du). I went in after the menus changed and the numbers were removed. I asked for a 114 and the guess what? I got Singapore fried noodle. I was soo pleasedI felt like a veteran coming home.
I have not been there for 5 years or so and I am hoping that the numbers have come back in the meantime. As for the service it used to be:
One? you sit here (ground floor)
two? go downstair (basement)
other numbers upstair (any of the other floors)
glass table tops so the plates would slide across, generous portions and excellent prices.
Strangley enough, the Lido around the corner had exactly the same menu, but at about 25% higher prices. Thankfuly that is now gone.
For chinese clients, there used to be a chinese menu that had a number of items not available on the english menu. I am curious if that is still the case.",1
5,"trendy chinese restaurant, great food, great decor, great cocktails at the bar, quite pricey though, 200 pounds for dinner for tow must be the norm, the food is beautifully presented on the plate and melts into your mouth",1
4,"Posh Dim Sum. It's a bit of a weird concept to get your mind around, like Richie Rich having a McD's in his mansion. Dim sum for me as always been that lazy, slightly hungover, still in pajamas, meal that I'd dragged myself out of bed for on a way to sunny Sunday. Although, now that I've grown up and somewhat matured in the last 5 years from college, I suppose posh dim sum shouldn't be that surprising.
Anyways, on to the place itself. Two floors, both classy, the top being probably better for brunches due to the natural light whereas the lower ground has a starry sky effect ceiling which I could see be perfect for late night drinks or a date. The top floor does have the benefit of the dessert and pastry bar which has some truly mouth watering options on display (which unfortunately I couldn't have as I gave up desserts for Lent). 
We were downstairs this time, and quickly seated by an attractive hostess in a very comfortable booth. Given that I had cycled 40 miles before noon, the soft cushioning was a very welcome feeling to my sore buttocks. Tap water was requested and quickly received. I think it says something about the high standard to which a place holds itself when even the tap water is served in an elegant stemless flute, perfectly chilled but not cold, with a lemon garnish. They have a selection of teas and smoothies along with an interesting cocktail list. I opted for a lime and passionfruit jasmine iced tea which I could have happily sipped all day except for the fact my glass ran out and I was too busy fighting for food (it's still dim sum no matter how posh) to order another one.
Foodwise, everything was tasty but a few things stood out. The char siu bun (roast bbq pork in a slightly sweet steamed bun) was delightful with rich tender pork in a sticky bbq sauce stuffed inside a bun so light it was like eating a cloud...filled with meat. The pork and preserved egg congee was a great comfort food and made me want to make a massive batch for myself (must add it to the weekend plans) although it was just a tad too bland (even for congee). We had the usual array of prawn and pork dumplings. They were good, but nothing to brag about. The scallop dumplings were terrible as the scallops were far too overcooked so I wouldn't recommend that.
As most reviews indicate, the venison puffs are another quality dish. The meat filling is good, but the value is in the sweet puff pastry that surrounds it. It seems a bit odd, but the combination of the gamey venison and the sweet flaky pastry is brilliant. I wonder if I could make it by adding honey to regular puff pastry?
The final winner was the jasmine tea smoked spare ribs. The ribs were cooked to perfection and the meat literally fell off the bones. The sticky hoisin and bbq sauce was literally fingerlickin' good and the tea added a mild smokiness to the dish that demands to be added to anyone's bbq repertoire.
Other thoughts...hmmm let's see. The waitstaff are interesting and it's a bit hit or miss if you get a good one or one you can barely communicate with. The majority speak fluent Chinese (which is helpful when you have a Chinese speaker who can order) and that's always a good thing in a dim sum joint. They have a weird policy where only your waiter/waitress can serve the food from the tray to table so you may have a few minutes where you can see your food next to the table but they won't give it to you. Pricewise, it's expensive (I paid £38 and wasn't left hungry but not stuffed as usual either) and only about half the dishes seemed worth the price. I'm hard pressed to say this would be a better dim sum spot than Ping Pong's £20 all you can eat deal on Sundays, but it's a place to treat yourself to some unusual items.",1
5,"Going to London, I was super excited to eat good Indian food. I asked a friend who recently traveled to London where to go and she immediately recommended Dishoom. The restaurant itself is beautiful and in a really great area of London. We originally wanted lunch but we got there during brunch time so we ordered a couple breakfast items and then waited till lunch to order more. For breakfast we ordered the bacon and egg naan roll. It came with this delicious chutney-type sauce that was excellent. It was a really, really awesome dish. The lunch items we got were also delicious!! Best Indian food I've ever had.",1
2,"Anurag was super excited about this place, having seen it on Andrew Zimmerman. I honestly really wanted to like this place. The place is very small and cramped, and the service was pretty poor. Even in the tiny place, the server didn't make eye contact and we had to flag him down several times. When the server did make his way to us, he was very bent on overselling dishes to us and had us over order, honestly. 
The food was very average. Other than the kaddu poori, which made me think about home (which was something we grew up eating), everything else was sub par. The naan/ roti was too hard and the Kadhai chicken was not great The daal was also very bland.
I don't know if we came at an off time, but our experience was sub par and I won't recommend it/ come back again.",-1
5,Love the ambiance! Exceptional food with great service. Came for the lamb samosas and okra fingers and ordered so much more. So many options great for vegans.,1
3,"After multiple friends recommended Dishoom to me as the best Indian restaurant in all of London... I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I expected to have my mind completely blown, never to be satisfied by the masses of mediocre Indian fare again. Suffice it to say that my expectations were a wee bit too high.
Although even the cabbies said that London has the best Indian food in all the world - better even than India herself... meh. I've honestly had better. 
The menu is definitely interesting with some fusion and inventive options. I think I would've liked more flavor though in all the dishes I had there.  
I bumped off a star for being underwhelmed, but still a great meal can be had here.",-1
3,"Ordered ramen and the karaage. Broth was pretty good, noodles were good, and the pork chasu was decent. The egg was cold and overcooked and lacked the richness I've come to expect. 
The chicken karaage was relatively bad -- greasy with very little breading, not enough crunch. The sauce served with it was good though. 
Next time I'd go for the ramen only and skip any other dishes/sides.",-1
5,"We had the opportunity to go for our 25th anniversary. From the time we walked In the door until we left, we were totally treated like special friends. My wife and I both had the chefs tasting menu and had the paired wines. The sommelier was spectacular and explained the wines to perfection and each one was perfect for each course, 5 in all. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone for a special occasion or for a spectacular meal. One of the best!",1
5,"I think it's my favorite Indian place in London! It was my second time in Dishoom but first time at their Shoreditch location.
The restaurant is nice, I like the atmosphere. The service is good and fast, good advices and the staff is really friendly.
we ordered different dishes to share: Bhee, vegetable samosas and murgh malai as starters. Then, as main dishes, we ate the lamb biryani, the chicken ruby (a recommendation from the waitress and it was awesome), black dhal and some roomily roti.
Everything was really tasty, full of spices and delicious. We ended up super full as usual !
I finished with a Masala chai, perfect as the rest of the dinner.
I really love this place, the only bad point : the queue to get a table as they don't take reservation for less than 6 people",1
3,"The server was awesome and the atmosphere was great! Really tough to find something I could eat with gluten, dairy and soy allergies though. I also don't like spicy foods, so I really couldn't eat the one dish I ordered. This place isn't a good restaurant for me, but seems like it could be good for others.",-1
5,"I have a confession to make. I have a major dim sum weakness. So has my sister. So it only made sense that her birthday dinner should involve cakes that look so pretty it would be a crying shame to defile them by eating them (we didn't take much convincing though, no arm-twisting required) and guzzling our collective bodyweight in har gau and venison puffs. Don't do what I did and do a last minute booking (sister decided to change plans on my a day before) or you'll be put upstairs, which is very nice but not quite as pleasing on the beautifully designed basement floor. It's always packed to the rafters from Thursday onwards too, which is great when you want to have raucuous conversation with someone you've not seen in ages, without offending anyone. The service is ultra efficient and attentive. They even top up your tea for you.
 My view is this: Yauatcha is a treat for the special people in your life. So far the only people who have been taken under my steam are my mum, my sister and an ex with whom I am still friends. So if I take you to a place with a blue glass wall, you've got to be doing something right! I acknowledge the fact that the aforementioned statement is unavoidably political and likely to result in 300 odd- demands from my facebook friends to take them too, or risk being de-listed. I'll take you all when I'm a millionaire. I promise!",1
2,"Yes, the food is decent (though not spectacular by any means), the ambiance is great, and the service is competent, but the prices simply aren't justified by any of the above. I've had just as good or better food for much less money, served with much less pretense.",-1
5,"A friend recommended that while my husband and I took our honeymoon in England to have dinner at Clos Maggiore. Our dinner at Clos Maggiore was not only the best of our 10 days in England, but one of the best of our lives. The atmosphere is so romantic and intimate. The service is of the highest quality. And the food is just divine. Don't skip on ordering the truffle mashed potatoes.",1
2,"When you wind your way up the stairs of Wong Kei, you'll realise that this sprawling plaza of a place is truly labyrinthian and equally the stuff of food based nightmares. 
The food as you may know, is not really Wong Kei's selling point, as much as it is a masochistic tourist attraction; the town's hottest perturbing immersive theatrical experience you'll ever go to or like surprise speed dating for sadists. 
Normally when entering a restaurant, a server will acknowledge your party and seat all three or two or four of you at an accommodating table. Here you'll be shoved into any seat anywhere, separated from your group like Nemo from his family and left to flounder and eat awkwardly in front of strangers, four flights away, up into an adjoining space in what seems like breaking into or being smuggled into an open-plan office block/ come restaurant floor next door to sit with said random people, whilst you're left to recount your steps and your experiences thus far. 
On being escorted away from my dining companions, I'd have lost my mates if I hadn't grabbed a discarded prawn cracker at a nearby table and left a Hansel and Gretel-like trail back to them. 
So, I ended up joining an adjoining end of table, table. On my own, within waving distance of one of my friends, but I had to muscle in on another couple who had been lucky enough to sit together. 
It took sometime to get a waiter's attention, but it didn't take long to realise that the couple I'd been proffered to give my services to as a third wheel and Capering Gooseberry, had not just been stuck for conversation, but were simply too frightened to ask for; water, a napkin or anything else you'd usually expect at a restaurant. 
Finally a waiter, dashed to my attention. 
""Drink?""
Just as I flicked my eyes down to the menu to enquire, he was off. Fed up by my too long split second hesitation. 
The food came quickly, in fact when it did arrive it almost hit the linen before the plates did. 
""Noodles"", my waiter announced. *Slam* ""Chilli Beef"" *Slam*. Down went the bowls, whilst before they hit the table, the broth defied gravity remaining in mid-air and began cooling from the gust of wind created from the clipped turn of my waiter's back again.
He'd gone! Thank Christ, but I'd still not ordered my drink. I saw a couple of my friends separated over on two other tables making perplexed gestures to me in nervous fits of laughter. I thought they were having a good time, but I was to discover their waitress did not linger, who's laconic tone implied she too could give even less of a rat's rear about my or their whining on about being thirsty. In the end she abandoned herself from their table for mine, offered me a drinks menu and rolled her eyes so hard I thought it'd affect the gravitational pull of the moon.  So I did the darnedest of things and ordered what was to be a flat sodding cola. 
Well, if you must hanker for Anglicised greasy run of the mill Chinese food, go here, go simply for the terrifying experience and GO ON, GET OMLETTE AND CHIPS I DARE YOU!",-1
3,"I guess this is your place to go if you're craving ramen in London. BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLACE ELSE. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit because there are a few ramen joints nearby. But this place is by far the most crowded. Holy smokes, there is a line that wraps around the block around 7 PM. Heave only knows why. Maybe I have been spoiled with ramen from Japan, maybe I have been spoiled with free ramen at the office, maybe I have been spoiled since my bf can literally eat ramen everyday, but this is just not ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu broth and it was pretty plain. Tell me how a pork boned broth that has been stewed for 16 hours can be bland? Beats me. We also ordered 2 orders of the fried soft shelled crab, popcorn chicken and chinese broccolli. Firstly, the sauces accompanied with the appetizers are all a bit weird. Perhaps because the British love mayo? Everything was mayo based..broccoli with mayo? For the love of god, wwhy?!?! Nevermind that, I also ordered corn as an addition to my ramen and it was this smoked corn. Kinda cool, but didn't vibe well with my ramen. Think of grilled smoked corn bits in your flavorless ramen. You taste burnt corn. Need I say more? Save your 15GPB.",-1
5,"Amazing dim sum and consistent quality between locations.
Cocktails are delicious -- recommend the mandarin mojito!",1
2,"Despite problems with the reception staff, not the waiters, the biggest issue here was that the food was distinctly average. We went for the £40 Dim Sum Special for 3 people, and every plate was no better than average. Crab salad fine, but watery crab, dim sum dry and not flavourful. The crispy duck was crispy only because it was overcooked, and its pancakes too sticky and thick. It's a lovely room, but I was amazed to read afterwards that it has a Michelin star. Taipan in Milton Keynes is a far better dining experience.",-1
2,"Mmmm this place takes the cake in how to create a hype, not much to write home about.. Dresserts aren't bad though",-1
4,"Best dim sum I've ever had? No, probably not. Fun and enjoyable afternoon with good company and tasty food? Yes, definitely!
On arrival at Ping Pong, I was nervous that the table that I'd booked for 10 people late last night online via the Ping Pong web site would not be available since I didn't receive an email confirmation. But I need not have worried since as soon as I arrived and asked about ""my reservation for 10 people"", we were whisked upstairs to the lounge/bar/dining area. I have been to this branch of Ping Pong once before, but hadn't realised that there was an upstairs area. However, I was very pleased by this as a) there was only one other group upstairs besides us; b) it was much quieter which allowed us to chat to our hearts' content; and c) the sofas were much more comfortable than the benches downstairs albeit slightly lower. At this point, a big tick for Ping Pong's technological advances and wise decision about seating allocations. 
We ordered our drinks (all choosing fancy teas of varying fanciness - my favourite of the ones I tried was the lychee and ginger iced tea cooler, which was very refreshing) and settled in to analyse the menu. Another tick for Ping Pong on a special occasion for the wide range of teas that we don't normally have when we go for a traditional dim sum meal.
The girls chose a selection of dim sum for the group, which the boys promptly tripled... The food arrived quickly and was served hot and fresh. The flavour complemented each other well - I love Ping Pong for the variety of unusual combinations (like black prawn dumplings). My only criticism is that the steamed dim sum were a bit too sticky, which meant the skins broke and the contents spilled out. We were also slightly disappointed that they did not have cheung fun on the menu. But decent quality food all in all. 
We also had desserts - the Ping Pong sampler, which I won't describe in detail as it would spoil the surprise - but each mouthful was was delicious and only made you want more. I'm glad I managed to squeeze in dessert!
Overall, we had a great afternoon - great company and lots of food. However, I think it is over priced (in my opinion, you can get much better traditional dim sum at a very reasonable price), but you do get the more unusual/fusion combinations (like scallop and shitake dumplings, duck spring rolls or seafood pastries). That said, we got what we paid for - a slightly different, very relaxed lunchtime gathering of friends.",1
4,"The name and address threw off the cabby for a minute. It's not the ""Four Seasons"" we normally think of. I was with a coworker and we were looking for something we didn't have locally. It was time for Duck that wasn't Americanized.
To start we have the best Hot and Sour soup we've ever had. What a great start. Among a couple other dishes we ordered the whole duck. We should have only gotten the half duck. There was a LOT of it. It was very good.
It's unfortunate Chinese is going through a down period in so many markets because it's not all the generic meat and veg in a brown sauce when done right. They did it right tonight.",1
1,"Ping Pong is an abomination. Never have I been more outraged with an eating establishment. Here's why
1. Fake Chinese food - ingredients, seasoning and executions are poor imitation of Chinese style food
2. Dumplings are flat with small fillings
3. Tiny servings
4. Inconsistent timing. First dish served, wait. 2nd dish served, another wait. The remaining dishes served simultaneously. Either served single dish back-to-back or everything together.
5. It's winter where hot noodle soup would have been a popular order. Yet all such dishes have been struck out of the menu, why?
6. Expensive
£70 later, 2 adults + 2 kids left hungry
Dim sum is a well-regarded specialty cuisine that Ping Pong fails to deliver, don't come for the food",-1
5,This was an accidental find using Yelp. The service and food was impeccable. I had their Sunday three course selection with wine. It is out of this world. You need to stop by! A reservation is highly recommended.,1
4,"We had been meaning to go here for weeks, after reading reviews on this website and comments on Twitter.  We got there and waited in a line for around 40 minutes, but it didn't feel too bad because we had expected this.  While we were part of the ""inside"" section of the line, we could order a couple of drinks which was great.  I was already a third of the way through my pint of Asahi by the time we sat down.  Having a drink also makes the waiting period pass more quickly.
The signature dish is the tonkatsu ramen (£11), so we ordered one each.  It really is excellent: the creamy broth is packed with flavour and I liked the noodles and the eggs.  The pork was tender too, but I only got one piece in mine.  We also ordered sides of fried chicken (£5) and softshell crab (£8).  Both of these were nice, but the chicken was a bit dry.  The service was friendly and personable.
I was happy with the experience, but it was on the expensive side.  This place won't suffer for that, given the high popularity it has at the moment.  I am pleased to have been here once to try the excellent ramen, but I would be leaning towards visiting one of the other good ramen restaurants where there is not such a long queue.  Then again, it could be worth a trip during the quiet time of the week (whenever that is).",1
2,"I really like this restaurant,  the food is amazing and the service is friendly.  The prices are reasonable and the decor and atmosphere are both great. 
The waiter when we were there personally recommended one of the wines, and it was lovely to see some of the diners chatting to each other at different tables,  like it's a place to be socialable and actually talk to other people - something which is very special when you see it in London. 
I couldn't give this restaurant a higher rating though because of its 2 star hygiene rating by Camden council,  I don't really understand why such an otherwise amazing restaurant would take such a lax attitude to food satety but it isn't a good sign. 
Hopefully they'll take it on board and try to improve as it's otherwise a wonderful independent restaurant in central London, a welcome alternative to so many identikit chains.",-1
2,"Food is okay. Butter chicken ... Meh ... It's alright . And then . Well . Food quality is alright ! It's just the staff Is the reason I downgraded this review from a 4 to a 2. To begin with, in 5 mins , the same waiter asked 3 times : are u ready to order . ( as if I am in his way if I don't ) And when I asked for recommendation and asking what the indian dishes were ( I was searching on my phone earlier ) , and then he fucking took my phone and then did some tapping ( hard!) and then satisfied himself with what he found as a "" bangai"" food pic and then threw my iPhone 6s on the table ! Basically he has used my phone without my permission and Hey ! Throwing it back ! That was raging !! And then when we ordered , me and my friend said one only even after he said it s too small for both of us, and we said no, and when he confirmed the order , he just was like : 2 naan yeh ? I was like ONE !!!!! And then he asked what we want to drink and we don't feel like ordering any beverages but just tap water . He shot this look of "" order so little !"" At us ( at this point , it is pretty subjective ) . Anyways . Got through the end ... And then once they quickly cleared the table , there stood the dessert menu and when we said no , next thing on table was the bill, even we didn't ask for it. We didn't touch the bill for like 2 mins cuz me and my mate were chatting . This staff interrupted and was like : everything alright ? There are people waiting outside . We were very upset by the service . Probably won't go again .  This kind of fast food restaurant is not what we look for and customer service still trumps commercialized food ! Even fast food allows u to sit for awhile. And besides , had better Indian food around the area .",-1
4,"A true oasis in Central London! A taste of the Mediterranean in WC2. A favourite place to escape, great food and drinks.",1
3,"My review is base on the variety of dim sum items and the creative dim sum dishes offer.  Price wise is steep but very upscale restaurant and nice display of desert which was eye catching.  This is one of the few restaurant where we paid $150 USD just for dim sum.  We ordered the smoke tea ribs (good), har gow (good), chicken feet (good), pumpkin duck puff (sold out) ordered crispy duck rolls (ok) instead, spicy pork wontons (ok), chinese bbq pork steam bun (ok), king crab dumpling (ok), and sieu long bao (very good).  We also ordered steam rice but it didn't come when our dim sum arrived we have to asked for it twice to get.  Service was ok, not great.  Overall, it was good upscale experiences when travel but we will not go here for our usual dim sum fix.",-1
2,"My god. What does everyone see in this place? This has got to be some of the worst Indian food I have ever tried.
Not 1, not 2, not 3, but ALL 5 of the dishes we ordered were drier than the Sahara desert. So dry that we had to treasure the extremely stingy (half a shot glass) sauces that came with our starters, so dry that we had to ask for extra sauce that never came, so dry that we had to choke the food down.
Now I can forgive the dry samosas, or even the salty fried okra, but lamb chops are supposed to be juicy and packed with flavour damn it! Also one lamb chop on my plate was medium while the other 2 were well done, how does that even happen? Half of it was inedible fat anyway.
The worst I have to say was the paneer tikka. Paneer is supposed to be drenched in sauce not slightly grilled and slightly seasoned. With plain basmati rice, my friends dish practically tasted like nothing. 
On the plus side, the atmosphere is cool and buzzy. And the prices aren't crazy expensive. Well.. maybe they are for the quality of food served.",-1
1,My first and last visit. I was hoping to taste some interesting and good dim sum. But instead we got soggy overcooked stuff. Ginger lemonade or iced tea (not sure what was it) wasn't good as well. Service was really slow but the restaurant was not busy at all. Staff was just walking around like there were on holidays. We have specifically ordered one menu because of one dish which they didn't have. Which would not be a big problem if someone would actually tell us that they don't have it. Almost received bill before last dish arrived which we had to ask for! And of course our bill didn't reflect the food and service. I am really surprised that this place is still open.,-1
4,"Just reviewing the tonkatsu ramen.
Yelp Japan score: 3/5
Yelp UK score: 5/5
I've travelled to remote suburbs and small towns in Japan in search of specific ramen joints, so I like to think I know a bit about it by now. And this is a decent bowl. I don't know what some of these other reviewers were served, but mine was pretty good - and so far the best I've had in London (and will likely find until Ippudo opens).  
Noodles: A bit overcooked... they should be firmer, but this is likely a local market compromise. Next time I'll ask for firm noodles.
Broth: Very good. The black garlic oil is great too.
Egg: Perfect. As good, better, than any I've had before. Order an extra one.
Charsu: Decent. I prefer it thicker, but fatty and good. 
Needs: Some ginger or something pickled (besides garlic) to cut through the richness of the broth. 
Tip: Please don't wait for your 'soup' to cool off. Ramen is about the noodles - firm noodles being sucked up coated in hot fatty soup. Slurp them, it's ok, you're allowed to slurp ramen and it cools them a bit so you don't burn your mouth to much (a little burn is part of of the experience - don't worry, you will heal). As well, letting the noodles and soup cool off, this is like being served a burger and then waiting for the melted cheese to coagulate first. Wrong, wrong, wrong. (Sorry, watched this happen a few times here.)
FYI: The price. I know it's London and ramen is still new and trendy, but £12.38 a bowl is steep. This works out to ¥2101 or $20.46! Ouch! Tokyo is supposed to be the most expensive city in the world, but this same bowl of noodles would cost you only about ¥800-900 or £5.40 even in the most expensive parts of Tokyo. (I know, supply chain and all that. But still... Cheaper in Tokyo!)",1
5,"Best Indian I've ever had. The menu had a little bit of everything...the spicy lamb chops were dynamite, but surprisingly, the calamari and okra fries stole the show!
The staff were super friendly, and out waitress offered up a great, inexpensive wine recommendation.",1
4,"I went here cos I had heard they had some of the best scallops in London. Pre booked a table easily with a weeks notice. They phoned me up 2 days beforehand to check that I was still coming which was good. 
Arrived at the restaurant and the staff were really friendly. Sat down and was offered water and a Cucumber dish with 3 difference dips. One was really hot (chilli type dip) another more of a sweet and sour type and the last one I think was soy sauce. Ordered our drinks but had to wait 45mins for it to arrive which was the most annoying thing of the evening. First dish arrived which was the Venison puff, tasty bits of meat in a pastry with sesame seeds on top. Had to wait around another 15-20 mins or so for the next 3 dishes to arrive, scallop shui mai which was delicious, lobster dumpling which had a hint of ginger. Last one was Champagne scallops which was also nice. We then had to wait another 20 or so minutes for our beef in black bean sauce and rice and noodles dishes to arrive. When they came, only the rice and noodles arrived and we had to wait about 10 mins for the beef to turn up. By the time it came the noodles were cold. Shame, because the beef was really nice and soft!!! Didn't bother ordering desert because we couldn't be bothered to wait again and we had already been sitting on the table for nearly 2 hours. Asked for the bill (waited another 10 mins for it)
The food was top notch, staff really friendly. Only thing that stops it being 5 stars was all the waiting about. Would give the place another go just to see if the waiting about was just a one off!!!",1
3,"Food was good- had the venison puffs, prawn cheun fun, szechuan wanton, somerset lamb and noodles. 
The atmosphere is very loud, we couldn't hear each other across the table and as a couple we got seated on a table sandwiched between parties.
Service was good, but food was very slow coming.... one dish at a time.",-1
3,"We ordered a few dim sum dishes, some main courses and sides all for the table to share. The Char Siu Buns (£4.20) were a bit low on filling but the small amount there was tasted delicious. The Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumplings (£5.60) were impressive as was the Pan-fried Turnip Cake with dried shrimp (£5.50) - an often overlooked classic. To round off the dim sum we had a portion of Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf with chicken and dried shrimp (£5), which was pretty authentic.
On to the main courses we ordered Stir-fry Double Cooked Pork Belly in chilli sauce (£11.30), Thai Style Chicken with mango, papaya and chilli, coriander (£13.80) and a side of Spicy Aubergine, Sato Bean, Okra and French Beans with peanut (£12.90), a portion of Beef Ho Fun (£11) and a pot of Jasmine Rice (£2.20). The pork was decent, but nothing special. The ho fun at Yauatcha wasn't as good as places like Phoenix Palace or Gerrard's Corner. The chicken however was a revelation! Crispy, zingy, fresh, stunning - it was a shame we had to share it!
Being a birthday meal, there was an inevitable dessert with a candle and a bunch of staff singing ""Happy birthday dear ______... Happy birthday to yooooou!"". My brother had gone over to the dessert counter on his way to the bathroom and picked out the Apple Pie (£8.50). Pretty cool dessert with a mousse on top shaped to look like an apple.",-1
3,"I had such horrible service here which is why I am only giving it 3 stars although the food was a strong 4. 
Service: Took several minutes to get our order taken. Then when we were ready to pay, there was a staff member talking to another staff member on her break at the table next to us. Completely ignored us although we tried getting her attention. Finally got the attention of our waitress (the only one serving the whole place), to ask a question about a discount we had. She gave us an explanation then walked away for another several minutes when we had to flag her down for the bill. Again, staff seated to our left acted oblivious. I don't know how they run a business here.
Food: Very tasty, full of flavour and good portion size. I enjoyed my Dracula tonkatsu ramen. It was hearty and delicious. 
Verdict: I would return to another place gladly, given this poor service doesn't extend to all their locations. Clearly they have good food, they just need to work on hiring good people.",-1
2,"There's nothing really much to say about this place. Everything was pretty mediocre. The atmosphere, the service, and the food were all very average. Me and my friend were close to running out the door after having been served our drinks, but our morale enforced us to stay put!
The only thing bringing my star rating up a notch is my passion for Japanese food, and well.. I suppose I did get to eat that (as unsatisfying as it was). Plus, I needn't pay for tip, which saved me change for a post pick-me-up.",-1
2,"Well beyond its Use-by date.  Decor is tired.... threadbare dirty carpets and worn furniture.  Food was also a huge disappointment. I love Indian cuisine .... but you can walk down any suburban UK high street and get better than this. Having visited India several times, with a name like Punjab, I had especially high expectations of the tandoori dishes...again a huge disappointment as the meats had none of the smoky charcoal flavor one expects from genuine tandoor cooking. Moreover the ""curry"" dishes had no depth of flavor and all seemed to have been microwave reheated as they were delivered to our table within less than 2 mins of ordering. This place is trading off a long past reputation.",-1
5,"This is easily the best Indian food I have ever had.  I cannot even fathom what it would take to make me think otherwise.
We had a group of six including two non-endian food eaters who had been converted by the end.  Our host ordered for us and between the paneer, chicken tikka, dosa and sauces we were excited by every bite.  The Naan was perfectly cooked and they paid great attention to the authenticity.
The cocktails were out of this world.  Each one was exceptionally balanced, well thought out and perfect for the evening.  Their bar staff had a lot of fun making the cocktails and you could tell with the theming and concepts behind them.  I highly recommend trying as many as possible.
If anyone from Dishoom reads this, please open a location in Washington D.C., it is going to get very expensive for me to fly to London every time I am craving Indian Food.",1
5,"I've always been skeptical about chinatown in London when it comes to food, because I've always been let down - until last night. Oh man - this is hands down the best duck in London - crispy, yet juicy, and the sauce is insanely good. Definitely recommend. Don't go if you're looking for a romantic ambience or a trendy location - but if you want no-frills, delicious duck, then get down there. It's incredibly reasonable, too.",1
5,"Second time at ping pong, first time in the one in the southbank centre... second time is a charm because I have just found out they do a all you can eat dim sum sunday menu for around £20!!
 the first time I didnt like it because I spent to much money and left hungry, but now im in love with this place and their extensive menu! cant wait for next sunday! loved the drinks... I had some non alcoholic drinks ie.. the Lemon and Lychee, and iced teas such as the lemongrass and passion fruit and lime... I loved them all. The lemongrass was amazing because it wasn't overly sweet and quenched my thirst and felt less sugar infused. All the dim sums where amazing im getting hungry just writing this.",1
4,"An truly fine local favorite. 
Meandered in as a lost tourist and found the food reminiscent of that in Southern California 626 area. 
The duck is an absolute must. Tender, flavorful and perfectly balanced. While in most Cantonese joints, non speaking guest will often get the ""bad pieces"" Four Seasons knows no such concept and every single piece was fantastic and no survivors were left on our plate. For our family of four, the half portion did just fine.
During your menu selection be sure to look around at what the locals are eating, we did so and were not disappointed",1
5,"Finally made it to Bone Daddies! The spicy TANTANMEN (with sesame, chilli, pork mince, bok choy) is unbelievably tasty. The noodles were cooked perfect, broth was intensely flavored and I especially liked the creamy soft boiled egg which just took the whole dish over the top. The salmon sashimi starter was served up like little popsicles on a stick and was fun to eat and melt in your mouth delicious.
There were just two of us, so the wait was only 5 minutes which seems like we got lucky based on the other reviews. Even though the place was packed, the service was really friendly and attentive. 
The food, the vibe, the service are all great! Can't wait to go back.",1
4,"After seeing pictures of the gorgeous desserts they offer, my friend and I popped in for dessert. The raspberry delice, amongst other beauties, was shaped like a rose. It tasted as good as it looked. Having a sweet tooth, I have eaten a lot of dessert in London and I have to say that this is my personal favourite. There were also hand painted london fashion week macarons, which had glitter and such decorations on flavoured shells. Also superb. I'm giving the place 4 stars as I have not tried any of their savoury offerings, but cannot recommend them enough in terms of dessert!",1
5,"It is 11:45 am and Wong Kei restaurant is already brimming with custom. This place seems so authentic I could swear I was in China. The servers are abrupt, yet organised to a level most people could never reach. Strangely for the location there seems a distinct lack of tourists, yet this large eatery is full of people who seem to know exactly what they want. I am watching people sit and receive their meals within five minutes. My beef ho fun and egg fried rice takes a little longer. I've kept myself busy with the free pot of green tea every customer gets, so I don't mind. Once I start eating I slip into noodle heaven. My ho fun is excellent. The chilli's are hot, the peppers crunchy and the beef tender.
I know some people will not like the random seating, but I enjoy sitting with strangers who are there for the same thing, a good, quick and tasty meal. This is not the kind of place to bring a date, but if you want a great meal in your lunch hour, I can think of nowhere better than Wong Kei.",1
4,"This isn't usually the kind of place I go to as it's waaay out of my price range, but I was fortunate enough to win a meal for two here. When I won the prize it said meal to the value of £200 so I thought I'd have trouble spending that amount, but the reality was that it was all too easy! A reasonable meal for two plus a bottle of wine took us over the £200 in the blink of an eye so this is somewhere to come if you have more money than you know what to do with, or if someone else is paying.
 Hakassan is in a maze of alleys behind Tottenham Court Road tube station and screams trendy from the Mitchell-brother-like bouncers on the door to the slate walls on the way down the stairs to the underground restaurant.
 The food was absolutely wonderful - the dish I enjoyed most was Mongolian stir-fried beef which was truly melt in the mouth. You also get the entertainment of watching the beautiful people - it's like a different world to the one I usually inhabit.
 Only downside was that the restaurant seems to limit diners to 2-hour sittings. The couple on the table next to me ordered more drinks after their meal and were cross-examined by the waitress about how long they were likely to take to drink them!
 Definitely worth a visit if you're feeling flush, but only if you can eat quickly!",1
3,"What can I say about Nobu. First of all, the name carries a lot of weight and you expect nothing but the best when you make the decision to eat at Nobu. They have an international reputation the maintain. 
I met a friend of mine here for cocktails and dinner on a Friday evening and was not at all surprised to find it very busy. I was on an unexpected visit to England having just returned from Borneo and was very happy that nobu could take a reservation on such short notice. 
The service was pretty good, not great but it was very busy. The food was as well good but not fantastic. I have had better sushi at a ""hole-in-the-wall"" in Hawaii and for fraction of the price. The drink menu was on point and their cocktails were quite good.
All in all not the best Nobu I've been to and not the best sushi I've ever had but it was pretty much what I expected from Nobu London. I wouldn't make this my first stop next time I'm in London. I'm not saying don't come - just look to other options before you decide.",-1
5,"""Best roast duck in the world"" by FT, and in my view, best I've had outside Hong Kong. Delicious yummy roast duck with tender meat, crispy skin well marinated with herbs, a highly recommended stop in central London near Leicester Square and West End. Casual eatery, brusque service, real attraction is the world class roast duck!",1
4,Great food. Great service. Great management. 4 stars due to a vegetarians unfriendly mistake. But it was addressed and taken care of in the best possible way. If it wasn't for that - 5 STARS,1
5,"Delicious dim sum! Very trendy decor. Great service. 
Favorite dish was a shrimp wrapped in crunchy bean curd then wrapped in a noodle. Wish I could remember the name, but if you ask the waiter they will know. It's clear everyone knows it's a specialty. 
The only let down was the sticky rice. It wasn't bad, but It was just ok; nothing special. A little fishy for my taste. 
The other star was desert! Don't miss it! We had a strawberry dish. Maybe strawberry mouse? I'll post a picture.",1
5,"Honestly the best Indian food I've ever had. It's a little pricey, but worth it! 
I came on a Friday afternoon and had NO wait! I had:
- the unlimited chai tea (tasted lovely, not too sweet and not too much spice) 2.50
-prawn koliwada 6.20 .. id say pass on this. For the price the spice wasn't the best
-house black daal 5.90 must try with garlic naaan! 2.90
-chicken ruby 9.50 my favorite part of the meal!!! The chicken was super tender and the sauce was full of flavor.",1
3,"Cash only.
Cheap Chinese food. They almost pride themselves about being rude.  Waiter looks at me and says, ""dap toi, share table!"" 
I was lucky enough to sit next to someone who's mentally unstable.....fun...entertaining. He was talking to himself the whole time!
I don't care. Craving cheap Chinese food... And yes, I'm sick of fine dining.
Had duck over rice. Blah. 3 stars only because I didn't get sick. £5.50 which is cheap, considering I've been having £40 meals all week.",-1
3,"Nice French restaurant right outside Covent Garden.
The steak tartar I had was authentic and perfect.  But the pre fix menu was just ok.
Steak was about 4 oz and was cooked well done.  Not much flavor this the need for brown sauce. Cream brûlée was freaky but the crust was thin and clearly pre made.
Romantic place but brasserie quality you find in Paris.",-1
3,"Cinnamon Club is a stunning venue. It is set in what looks like an old library where the tables are surrounded by huge bookshelves. There are also potted trees throughout the restaurant which give the place a lovely feel.
 The food is a fusion of Indian with Modern British ingredients. The food is very good and service is attentive and friendly. This place is expensive though and a meal for two without drinks would be £100 +",-1
4,BEST beef black bean chow fun.  Every time I'm in London I have to eat here at least twice.  The toffee apples are also pretty delicious. It's always crowded so the seating can be uncomfortable but it's all worth it.,1
2,"The ambience is unique, with open courtyard in the middle of restaurant letting in sunshine and plenty of flora decorations.  A true attention grabber attracting lady patrons. 
The food is more of rural French cuisine with too much sauce and oil making these dishes not becoming of fine restaurants. The over-emphasis on sauce and oil appear to overwhelm the less quality raw materials used. I had to return the halibut I ordered because it was NOT fresh (has ammonia taste, my partners duck breast tasted like liver somehow but we did not return it.) Service was good though as my food was replaced with another choice promptly and with good attitude.  
With so many choices in this neighborhood...why?",-1
2,"Was pretty disappointed with our experience here. Firstly, I know a lot of Chinatown restaurants aren't pretty at the best of times, but the basement here really is pretty basic. 
Food wise, the actual food wasn't bad, although I realise now that we stupidly ordered crispy duck when we should have gone for their famous roast duck...oh well. The real problem was that should have come first but instead they brought out our brisket stew, with no rice, so it went cold while we waited. Then the pork we ordered actually arrived cold, and had to be sent back. Duck arrives at this point. We ordered more rice but that never turned up (nor on the bill, which was something). Overall, very poor service and I think that's the first time I've ever had to send something back to the kitchen to be heated. I would hesitate to come again, even though I'd like to try the proper duck!",-1
3,"The queue can be a bit long and then they make you wait at the bar for quite a while. Overall the food is good, not excellent. The service is always excellent and food arrived quickly. I would highly recommend the house daal.",-1
3,"This is a fantastic place if you are going on a date or having a business meeting but terrible if you are planning on having a meal with your family. My parents wanted to go for dim sum and I thought of trying somewhere new so a friend recommended Yauatcha after reading raving reviews about it on Yelp.
Everything about this restaurant screams modern and trendy from the design of the menu to the ambiance. Looking at the restaurant from the outside in, you would have thought it to be a cafe to enjoy a hot beverages with  a variety of desserts. Traditional would not be a word that I would use to describe this establishment. Even Debussy, Clair de Lune that was playing in the background was given an upbeat electronic remix. I didn't mind the music as I thought it was fitting to the surroundings but I really didn't like the seats. I am about 180cm tall (5'9"") and found the seats to be awkward and uncomfortable to sit in as the chairs seemed to be lower to the ground than usual. 
Anyway we order a selection of dim sum and waited for out food to arrive. The dim sum was good but not amazing especially when you factor in the price. In comparison to a typical Chinese restaurant in China town that severs dim sum, you are paying anything between £3 to £5 more. Safe to say that you are paying extra for the aesthetics appeal. It is also worth noting that you don't get free refills of the Jasmin tea. So overall I would say I prefer dining at more traditional Chinese restaurant than a modernised one hence the 3 star ranking that I gave but whenever I need to wine and dine some one then this would be one of the places that I would consider bringing them to.",-1
4,"I've now been to this restaurant twice and I've never been disappointed.  My first experience was for dinner.  A co-worker had highly recommended the dim sum and it was absolutely delicious.  My favorite were the ribs.  Being from Chicago, I'm a huge fan of ribs and these were amazing.   
My second experience was for lunch with girlfriends.  Three hours later, 12 dishes ordered and 2 desserts -- we called it a successful outing.  Their cakes are beautifully made and as tasty as they look.  I recommend the violeta (sp?).",1
3,"The restaurant setting is lovely and the lighting is low. The dress is casual, however when we were there it was definitely on the more dressy side. The menu is fairly straightforward with a lot of chicken thigh dishes. The minimum charge is 40 pounds per person as stated on their menu. The food was food was good, but not exceptional. Though this may be the oldest Indian cuisine restaurant in London (90 years), it is not the best Indian cuisine restaurant in London.",-1
3,I had a good experience at this restaurant. It had a nice atmosphere and the food was good. They ran out of the beer I wanted to try and that was a small disappointment. The food was good but the menu was small. My Indian dish was a chicken curry. There was too much ginger in it and it made for a spicy but not so tasty combination.  Overall it was good and i would probably go back.,-1
3,"Busy place on a Friday evening in a bustling neighborhood. Saw the great Yelp reviews and stopped in for arguably my fav ethnic cuisine. First impression is that it's a bit more Westernized (and full of white people) than the places I usually frequent. Open mind nonetheless!
All I can say is the veggie samosas are among the best I've encountered. Flaky, potato-y, peppery, hearty, and perfectly spiced. Wow. Pairs like a champ with the tamarind chutney. And def go for the veggie version -- the lamb simply doesn't work as well.
Ordered the chefs special Haleem, which arrived at the table surprisingly quickly. Creamy lentil base offered some contrast with the spice-rich additions, yet the depth simply wasn't there. And I found the plain naan a superior match to the included poppy-onion naan. Solid, yet unremarkable overall. And certainly not worth £16.50.
Going with 3* here since 3.5 isn't available and I suspect this place is overrated. Based on my limited (read: singular) experience, I'd venture elsewhere for truly great Indian cuisine. But if you're in the area, pop in for an order or two of veggie simosas: you won't be disappointed.",-1

 Sometimes, when one needs comfort food on a lazy Sunday afternoon, only dim sum will do. And as if to prove that comfort and style need not be mutually exclusive, there's Yauatcha. (There's also my new Massimo Dutti heels, the mildly glam-in-an-officey-way exterior of which belies a sensible, I'm-on-the-wrong-side-of-30, cushioned inner sole. But I digress.)
 Yauatcha is a modern dim sum tea house with a refined air and a Michelin Star held firmly between its chopsticks. Formerly owned by Alan Yau, it proves to be surprisingly good value (say, around £25 per head) - particularly if you stick to dim sum and tea. Although I caution that the bill does start to stack up if you opt for larger dishes and wine.
 The ground level, where we enjoy our lunch time dim sum, feels bright and fresh, with shades of blue and a large fish tank lining the entrance. Downstairs, is more dimly lit and clandestine - a popular option for the evening crowd.
 We start with some roasted blue tea, the Fuijan Wuyi Yan, Shui Xian (£4 per pot), which we chose on the basis that other options are more expensive and our waiter tells us they all taste fairly similar. It's rather bland, and doesn't really improve with the food. Choose another one.
 Dim sum comes in sets of 3 (reflecting the number's association with good luck and the word ""alive"" in Chinese superstition, but often resulting in heavy negotations for me and the TPG.)
 The beautifully presented scallop shui mai (£7.50) is a treasure-like bundle of juicy scallops and prawns topped with gleaming jewels of roe. The winter melon dumplings look like pudgy carrots, but are an enjoyable taste of Thai winter melon, black fungus, straw mushroom and gong choi (£3.80).
 The sticky rice in lotus leaf with chicken and shrimp (£4.80) is good (but not the greatest) but then the char sui bun (3 for £3.50) is fantastic (a must) - and also great value compared to the lesser morsels you might get for around the same price in Chinatown.
 We steer off the dim sum menu to try the Szechuan seafood claypot (£17.00) - a fresh and colourful mix of prawns, (slightly too chewy) squid, peanuts, mushrooms, snowpeas, baby corn and chilli. TPG was more of a fan than I, but possibly because I think this a dim sum haven for me and I'm reluctant to diverge to the larger dishes unless it's for something extraordinary.
 Our warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelised pineapple (£7.50) is absolutely gorgeous, even if the pineapple was a little hard to negotiate. Handmade chocolates and macaroons are also on display - I tried a selection of 4 chocolates for £3 which were reasonably nice but no match for the pudding.
 One possible hitch to any long, lazy, Sunday afternoon plans you might be hatching is that we were warned our table had to be returned after 2 hours - although no-one policed that once we sat down. We paid around £30 per head for our meal.
 Yauatcha comes with my seal of approval for dim sum with a touch of glamour on the side. I was so impressed, that I've already booked us into Yauatcha's big brother, Hakkasan, next month.
 My only regrets are that we missed the bulging, glistening har gua dumplings and the blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing, both of which we had to suffer through others enjoying on the next table. As if we need another excuse to go back.",1
3,"Visiting this Indian tapas place today for dinner. A lot of has been said about Dishoom, and many reviewers have praised the food, while the food was good I found the place to be a little too busy and warm for a June afternoon. The cocktails were average at best and the service while friendly, seemed a little bit scatty. The lamb chops and tarka dhall were delicious as were the Bombay potatoes and biryani dishes. i'd go again, as it's easy and convenient and the food is of a good standard, overall a good experience..",-1
4,"Having been pulled into the ""Ramen"" fad, I have heard mixed reviews before coming here. The person I was with had been before and was unimpressed.
We were greeted by a friendly waitress that seated us and served by a keen waiter that went through the menu enthusiastcally. 
The food (from a westerners pov) was good!! I had the spicy option and it was a little too hot... I can generally enjoy a moderate heat level. My companion had the Tonkatsu and was pleasently surprised. 
Having been to Tonkatsu in Soho a few times, this place definitely competes but gets a few extra points for the condiments included like garlic and seseme seeds that Tonkatsu charges for.",1
5,"Perfect place for afternoon Dim Sum! Light, easy and flavourful delicacies made for everyone. You cannot not enjoy Yauatcha!",1
4,"This restaurant was a delight. Both service and food were exceptional. The ambiance is unusual with an interior garden but the effect is terrific. The wine list is also exceptional.
 Although Clos Maggiore is not cheap, it is still excellent value for money when compared with many of its peers.",1
5,"Amazing ramen! Definitely the best ones in town, and their starters are amazing too! I got there as soon as they opened, the whole place was full in 10 minutes! Definitely worth it though.",1
2,"I was pretty excited to come here because of all the great reviews but it was just ok. There was a huge line and it was crowded but I don't understand why.
 The menu is just steak and fries with no variations at all. My husband didn't like it at all because the steak just tastes like the sauce, and he is a fan of the true taste of the steak itself which a good chef can bring out. He also didn't like the sauce that much. I like sauce more than he does so I didn't think it was so bad, but it still wasn't anywhere near as great as these reviews make it out to be. It was just a steak that was slathered in an okay sauce and as long as you like that sauce you'll be fine, because that is what everything tastes like.  Not bad but nothing special.",-1
3,Authentic Japanese ramen corroborated by someone who's lived in Japanese their entire life (me). Slow rotation is why I couldn't give it 4 stars. Definitely worth a visit.,-1
3,"Michelin star yes, but amazing food? Not necessarily. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough, but I'd prefer to pay for Ping Pong's all you can eat on Sundays and save some cash at the same time. 
Don't be mistaken, the food is good, just not good enough to justify the price or the hype.  Two definite must trys, however, are the duck and any of the chocolate desserts!",-1
4,"Best value Chinese you can find.
Always a seat available (because it's freakin' huge), food comes out fast, quality is low - but good, and it's CHEAP.
Service isn't as bad as it used to be.. (think older London tour books talk about how terrible the service is...)",1
5,"Surprisingly good choice as a place for lunch. A cross between British Pub food and so-called Indian street food, though there were plenty of standard Indian restaurant food options. The surprise had to do with the creative menu, offering sandwich-like options but with an unusual mix of flavors and ingredients. There were only 2 of us so our ability to sample the menu was limited, but our entrees -- a chick pea salad with nuts, grains, pomegranate, and more, and a grilled chicken 'wrap' along with a shared bowl of the recommended Dahl -- were fabulous. Service was friendly and very responsive. As others have mentioned, this restaurant is very popular. We arrived near the end of the lunch hour (1:30), to a busy restaurant, but were seated quickly.",1
4,"I used to come here a great deal a few years ago. I have eaten here a few times, but I much prefer the experiences I've had just propped at the bar enjoying their delectable cocktails. Yes, the cocktails. I only ever come here specially to drink them. The bartenders are very professional, where making the drinks is almost a form of art. And the ingredients used are only ever fresh ones. I also always order their prawn crackers, which are the proper sort, tinged in a dark orange colour, served generously in a large bowl.
However, the prices for the food are much too expensive, almost too much for Chinese food to be honest. But despite this, it is delicious. In all, it is worth a visit just to bask in its amazing interior and to gorge on as many cocktails as possible!",1
1,We could not eat here. We saw a tray of noodles used as a door stop to an outside entrance to a walk up to sidewalk level. All the dirt and soot from the street could land on the food. Ugh.,-1
3,"Hakkasan has an atmosphere and decor that any celebrity would love to be caught in. I thought I may have accidentally wondered into Buddakhan. The woodwork in the dining room is unbelievable. If you have read any of my other reviews you could guess that this is not my type of restaurant. 
Dim Sum starter was ok but took about five minutes to cool down enough to put in my mouth. Crispy duck rolls somehow managed to not be greasy without being dry. However they were bland and needed the sauce served with them. Sha cha seafood toban was bit uninspired. 
I'd never come back here.",-1
3,"Luck was in our favour when we visited Dishoom and we were told it would be just a 15 minute wait and that we could order some drinks at the bar while we waited. Our drinks hadn't even been made by the time we were whisked away to the front section of the restaurant which was more like a cosy living room (complete with Christmas tree) than the rest of the restaurant which was more formal. I was very surprised that we were given two sofas with a coffee style table to sit at for just the two of us as they could easily have fit four people on it.
We'd originally planned to get brunch but were too late so instead had to choose from the all day menu instead. The choices are pretty varied but since I couldn't have my original choice of their famous breakfast naan rolls I decided to recreate something similar with chicken tikka and a cheese naan which sadly wasn't anything to write home about.
My dining companions's meal arrived fairly quickly but it took far too long for mine to come out after it to the point that her food was starting to get cold from waiting. In fact the service was really poor overall, I had already almost finished my drink by the time my main course came out and the second one I ordered didn't arrive until after I had finished eating.
I wasn't going to have pudding but I was very intrigued by the Memsahib's Mess which was basically Dishoom's own version of Eton Mess made even more amazing by the addition of rose syrup.
I'm so glad I did as it was divine and made me want to return and give them a second chance given all the many positive things I'd heard about them before going. Maybe I'll check out their new branch in King's Cross instead.",-1
3,"Amazing food! We had a bit of a wait, but there is a nice bar area to order drinks and small plates. Service at the bar was excellent- bartenders were very attentive. The biggest problem arose once we were seated. Our waiter was incredibly absent and negligent. When we asked for things... Like water... He didn't bring it, and every time he walked by, he didn't even check in to see if we needed anything. The only thing that saved our experience was another waiter, who really picked up where our waiter left off. The other waiter managed to handle all his tables, and bring us water, take our wine order, and check in regularly to see if we needed anything. 
At the end of the meal, I was more than happy to tip, but I strongly felt the tip belonged to the other waiter- not ours. Our waiter did nothing, he clearly had other tables he favored. I used to be a waitress in the service industry, and my belief is no one is entitled to a tip, you must earn it. So, I did not leave the ""optional service charge"" on my bill, and I instead gave the tip to the waiter who actually took care of our table.
I was out the door of the restaurant, when our assigned waiter chased us down to confront us as to why we didn't leave the ""optional"" tip. I was shocked, and he followed up with the manager would like to know. I should have asked to speak to the manager, or just emphasized that the tip was OPTIONAL.... But instead I went through the reasons I did not leave a tip for him, and why I gave the tip to the person who actually took care of our us. I was just in such shock- I have never been chased out of a restaurant and interrogated as to why I did not leave a tip.  That waiter spent more time chasing me out, than he did at our table the whole night.
I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, and if you get seated in a section with a good server, you will have a 5 star experience!",-1
5,"I went there with 5 friends to celebrate Bday. We had a lot of different starters, mains and deserts. Food was amazing service too. Place is quite expensive. Dinner for 6 without wine £600. I will definitely recommend this restraunt and will get beck there one day ;-)))",1
1,"This is probably the worst Chinese restaurant. The waitress is so rude. The service is really bad. What she wants is for customers to leave fast, which she makes it really clear to us. I know it is rush hour but she lets us share a table with a group of other customers. We did not enjoy our lunch there as the atmosphere is uneasy and awkward. 
As for the food, the sour soup is really really bad, slimy and disgusting and cold. If you want the real Chinese cuisine, do not come to this place as it is so not representative.",-1
3,"Having looked at many of the reviews I felt an urge to put fingers to keyboard. I lived in Marylebone for sometime and was always very surprised by the ques of people waiting to eat here. If you are a steak fan and looking for great meat this is not the place to go. The meat is ok, covered in a ""secret"" special source that I managed to knock up my kitchen 2 days later to as near as perfect. The service is ok, but they are a high volume restaurant, dont expect to stay to long! They do, what they do, very, very well but I still dont understand the endless Ques! What is more surprising is that directly opposite you have what is widely regarded as the best fish and chip restaurant in London, the Gun hidden behind the high street and the Autre Pied 2 mins away, which in my book knock spots of this place.... Oh and its not that im ignoring the providores its just that if you dont want to Que for dinner then I wouldnt go (sunday breakfast used to amazing, then the papers ran an article on it and you now Que for hour to get)... Start at the Prince Regent and have great night in my old manor!",-1
3,"The atmosphere at this restaurant was probably the highlight of the experience.  you could tell a lot of thought went into the decor, which was very modern.  The service here was just okay.  Our waiter was a little bit weird about letting us hold onto the menu after we ordered.  
As for the food, it is ""fancy"" dim sum.  I didn't really feel the price premium was proportional to the improvement in taste or quality over more typical dim sum restaurants.  I ordered the spicy pork dumplings, which were not really spicy and the pork filling didn't have a lot of flavor.  The three mushroom cheung fun was probably my favorite.  The roasted duck pumpkin puff was very cute in the way it was presented, but I didn't think the combination was the best texturally inside the fried rice exterior.
All in all, I think the price premium is mostly for the atmosphere and not necessarily for better food quality.",-1
2,"As I write this review, I'm reading the ones on the side, and I really have no idea why people are giving this place such good reviews. Either a) they don't really know good dim sum or b) they love spending money. Now I didn't walk in expecting much, but Yauatcha is everything that is wrong with Asian food in London. It's thoughtless and almost insultingly Westernised. Like honestly, if you're going to do dim sum, at least keep it somewhat fresh and relatively cheap. That's the whole point....",-1
3,"This place is known for its Roasted Peking Duck (with pancakes) and it was excellent.  The hot and sour soup was also delicious, however, the seafood udon did not have much flavor.  The service here is pretty rushed (most is in this touristy part of town).  While the duck was a bit pricey for the portion size, I'd come back again but skip the udon.",-1
3,"Tried both the tonkatsu and t22 and really not that impressed. Their broth had a weird spice in it with a strange taste. Not that authentic compared to ramen I've had in Japan and in New York. Softshell crab was also passable. Pork croquettes were the only highlight of the night and were worth getting. I'd recommend going to Shoryu a couple blocks away if you want a better ramen experience. The wait time is about the same for both places, about 15-20 minutes for you to get seated. Shoryu has more of an Asian crowd whereas bone daddies has more of a hipster crowd with asian fusion style to it.",-1
5,"FABULOUS
This is a truly great restaurant. The style of food is called ""Modern Chinese,"" and as that implies they take liberties with the classic style and present avant-garde dishes. I went with my granddaughter for their Sunday brunch and we both enjoyed a wonderful meal. One of our favorite dishes was the Crispy Duck Salad, but we also liked the Steamed Dim Sum Platter and the Fried and Baked Platter. The Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs and the Grilled Chilean Sea Bass were also excellent.
We left very happy and well satisfied with the meal and the value as well.
Any complaints? Well, to be completely honest, the service for us was merely 4 stars. No one waitperson took responsibility for our table and the appearances by various individuals were impersonal with rote presentations. Although the servers were rather pleasant and no doubt knowledgeable, we had no Asian servers and they seemed to be mostly Eastern European with heavy accents that were a bit difficult to understand.",1
2,"What can I say? I'd walked past this place a few times and read about it when searching for good ramen in Soho and I have to say I was pretty disappointed :( The place itself was cool, nice ambience, good decor, clean, good location.... Was quite promising when we came in, but.... The food was average... Bummer. As a general measure when I get ramen, I always try the tonkotsu... If the place can make a good flavoursome clean tonkotsu then it's gotta be a bangin' place... Sadly the only thing good about this tonkotsu were the thin yellow noodles.. The broth was way too fatty and 'creamy' in a not so nice way as the flavour lacked depth and seasoning. You have some egg in there and a couple of slices thin pork. For the price you pay and the lack of real tonkotsu flavoured broth you're better off going to a Shoryu chain or even Wagamamas and that's saying something 'cos they're average too. The food also came out super fast which was a little concerning. Service was inconsistent depending on staff. Hmm... I feel bad to give them a dull review but... Maybe I'll come back and try something different...",-1
1,"My hubby and I came here because of how many good reviews this place has. When we walked up to the restaurant it looked very nice but noticed there was a long line waiting outside (not a good start since it was very windy and cold that night). A lady came up to us to let us know it'd be about 1 hr wait and although we were pretty hungry we decided to wait. 
Outside looking in we could see a long row of empty tables, which we assumed was for a large group who had reserved (funny I saw a review that said they don't take reservations...hmm?). We waited about 30 min outside. We then were lead downstairs to wait inside at the bar for another 20 min or so until we finally got seated upstairs. Looking around we still noticed the long row of empty tables with no group.
The food honestly was not the best. I liked it but back in FL I've had much better Indian food with wayyy tastier garlic naan bread. Our server was very nice but didn't check up on us as much as we would've liked (that could be a UK thing though, since we are from the US the servers are always coming up to ppls tables to check up on them). The drinks were good though(1 star for the drinks)
After about 10 min of us at the table finally we see the big group come in to sit at the long empty row of tables. I'm pretty sure everyone that was waiting outside in the cold could've sat at those tables and been done eating by the time that group arrived. I've never been to a restaurant where they reserve your table for more than 10 min for your group to arrive and have waiting customers outside in the cold. Even with all that I wouldn't have been so annoyed if only the food was to die for but it wasn't. It really wasn't all that great.",-1
4,"Very impressive-first time I had visited a Michelin Star  restaurant and did so with work in a big group of about 30 of us. They deal very well with us and the service is always spot on. Amazing fragrances in the lobby, dark atmosphere and exciting place",1
4,"The foods and ambience were very nice and modern and I did not feel like I am in the Chinese restaurant as I saw almost none of Asian waiters nor waitresses. 
Again, foods were delicious but portions were a bit small compared to its price so maybe everyone will feel a bit overpriced. However, that's worth it as I enjoyed the modern atmosphere there.",1
5,"Dishoom is one of the best Indian Fusion restaurants. Remember the word fusion, and that's what makes this place absolutely unique. A hint of the retro Bombay right in the middle of a very hip Shoreditch. Every single dish we tried was absolutely delicious. It's a bummer they don't have pan (beetlenut leaf - traditional Indian refreshment) but that said this place is lovely. Do visit even if you don't like Indian food, and don't forget to order a Thumbs Up with the fried Okra to get you going.",1
4,"Yauatcha is a really nice place to come for special occasions.  Their specialty juices and cocktails are all very delicious and look very fancy.  I have only tried their dim sum here, and it is good, but I am still not convinced it is the ""best"" dim sum I have ever had.  I am still searching for the best dim sum in London!  The next time I come here, I hope to try their main dishes as opposed to their dim sum, because the main courses look phenomenal!  I will say in their dim sum category that the cheung fun and spicy soft shell crab are really really tasty.
Their desserts are both beautiful and delicious.  The last time I was there, I ordered the Raspberry Delice.  It was one of those desserts that are ""too pretty to eat""...but I ate it anyways.  Great texture, yummy flavour and was plated beautifully.
Overall, Yauatcha is a nice place to celebrate a special occasion if you have some money to spend.",1
4,"Really delicious, interesting, flavorful food--too bad about the snotty front desk staff who was so painfully slow to seat us (and nasty while doing so) during a chilly, brisk day when all we wanted was to hang our faces over a nice bowl of something warm and aromatic! 
Stay away from the regular curries you're used to and order everything else--you won't regret it and if you want confirmation, order a curry and you'll see it's the only thing left over while every morsel of dal, biryani and [___insert all other items on the menu__] is GONE at the end of your meal!",1
3,"As far as London food goes, I can see why this place is hyped. It has enough uniqueness going for it, and Asian foods are trending pretty hard right now. But as far as Japanese food goes in particular, I'm a snob and very much an isolationist. I want my dishes simple and authentic. Not a huge fusion fan either. And I want my tastebuds to feel the sensation of being transported to the land of the rising sun. 
With that disclaimer out there, if you want an original experience, sure, hit up Bone Daddies. But if you want an authentic experience, you won't get that here. This is big-time, hipster noodle fare.
- The noodles are frozen. You can't customize the consistency and they cook them pretty soft here (firm should be the standard). They're also crimpy to the max. T_T
- They don't serve rice. At all. No rice. Zero.
- Tea is from a packet.
- They don't have togarashi. Seriously? 
- No vinegar either.
- The broths are not so much flavorful as they are intensely spicy. If spicy broth is your thing, then by all means, jet on over here for some indulgence. But I prefer rich and full broths.
The milky / creamy broth in the tantanmen was very interesting. I've never had it like this before. Or with peanuts. Or with chashu. But with very little ground meat in the first place. Hmmm. I ordered it without the extra chilies and it still had a crazy bite to it. The tantanmen 2 is even moreso, veryvery spicy.
I'll end this on some positives. 
+ Their karaage is good as far as fried chicken goes, but no need to go crazy for it, guys. 
+ Kudos on offering black sesame and kinako flavours for dessert, but those dishes were too diluted for one to truly appreciate such unique tastes. Less subtle, more concentrated, please.
+ Fresh garlic!
+ Their bamboo had a good crunch and their eggs are cooked perfectly.
+ Hilarious bibs on request, haha.",-1
1,Awful service. Poor customer experience and utter lack of customer care. Arrived at 11:15 after calling ahead to be told that the kitchen would actually not take orders after 11:15. Awful.,-1
3,"Tried the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu and though it was alright. The broth has flavor, but felt like it was watery. I am comparing it to the ramen I had in California which was pretty flavorful. The ramen noodle itself wasn't anything to right about.
However, I also tried their Shoryu buns and I would recommend it to anyone who goes there. The meat is pretty tender and flavorful. 
Having only been there once, I would give this place another try. Maybe the chef was having a bad day.",-1
1,"""Good evening and welcome to Nobu London..."" Yeah, right! I didn't feel welcome at all.
At Nobu London you can reserve a table, but for a maximum of two hours. This is the new generation of fast food. Literally.
""Would you like some *something unintelligible*?"" Some what? ""Oh, you haven't been here before. Eh, what do you usually like to eat?"" My sister says that she likes spring rolls and tempura maki. ""Nice, something more?"" We actually have to ask if it's possible to wait for the last one (me, I came a few minutes late) before ordering, and maybe have a look at the menu.
When I arrive they start filling up our glasses with water. That we pay for. You take one sip and they're all over you filling up your glass again. And again. And again. ""Do you want another one?""
So, food then. We decide to order a wide range of sushi, meat, green beans and spring rolls to share. After giving our order she suggests ordering a main meal for each of us as well, because it won't be enough. We have to convince her that we'll start with this, and then see.
Ordering a couple of beers and a coke as well. Beer is thrown into the glass with no control, I've rarely seen that much foam. And they continue filling up all the time. Just to get rid of it. So we can order some more.
And now the food starts arriving. First some sushi. At least the food isn't the worst I've ever tasted. That's something. Moving the last piece of sushi from the plate, and they're all over us again removing the plate. It happens again, and again. They even ask if they could take out those we haven't finished yet.
We're kinda wondering if this is a comedy show with hidden cameras. At least not a restaurant where you have to pay £3.50 for rice in an espresso cup, and where a dinner for three adults and a child, without starters or dessert, costs £160. Remember that we ordered little food. Yet we were all satisfied. We would like to have some dessert, though. But not here.
Paying was an exciting process. Just by putting the credit card at the table we got the bill, and seconds later the payment machine. ""Insert your card here, please"". We had to persuade her to let us look at the bill first. No option whether you wanted to pay the service charge or not, even though the bill stated this opportunity.
Before leaving for dessert at Hard Rock Café I had to go to the toilet. Straight forward, to the right, in through some doors who made me wonder if I was heading toward a submarine or space ship. Then down some stairs and through a couple of corridors. Oh, there it is! If you're a man at least, women has a few more stairs to take.
After doing what I had to, I went to wash my hands (of course). Oh, another Nobu-employee. Thanks for showing me how to turn on the water, I wouldn't find out myself. Yeah, I know how soap dispensers works as well, thanks dude. And even before I got the soap off my hands he stood there with the towel up in my face. If I want another one? Does it look like I would need another one. Don't think so. And then you want money? Here is a pound, hope you're happy!
So... finding my way back is the next mission. I wasn't aware that I came here for a labyrinth adventure, but that's how it turned out. After taking some stairs, I try a door. Oh, hi dude. ""This is wrong way"" We take one more stair before trying again. Old flowers, meeting rooms and an elevator. Guess it's wrong again. After walking up and down the stairs trying some doors we found our way out of the labyrinth.
Finally out of this place we're heading down the street for a dessert at Hard Rock Café. At least we're welcome and we can even sit as long as we want.
Spare your time, money and irritation. You're not welcome at Nobu anyway.",-1
5,"So many people recommended this spot to me and I'm glad I went - really great and unique food!
I visited here twice for breakfast and really enjoyed my experience:
Kejriwal - such a unique and tasty plate of eggs and toast , but with a twist...everything tasted fresh and I loved the balance of spices used to make this fantastic dish. As far as I know, this is a one-of-a-kind dish and you have to get this when you're here.
Chocolate Chai - this is a really good blend of chai and dark chocolate...the drink was spiced with the perfect blend and the chocolate adds another layer of uniqueness to the drink. It wasn't too sweet and a perfect drink to start the day.
The service was good and attentive...there's a reason why people rave about this place!",1
4,"Okay so saam bo fan (3 bbq meat combination over rice) in NYC won't cost nearly this much, but hey, it's london, and where else can you get this kind of tasty food for £7. 
Don't be silly, get the 3 meat combo (roast duck, roast pork, soy sauce chicken). Use the ginger scallion sauce... all of it - mix it in your rice!
We're going back tonight.",1
5,"Excellent food. Excellent venue. A good experience, with amicable staff. Just wait to get served. But try the spicy lamb chops for sure.",1
5,"Just the sort of place we love. Relaxing, romantic, good service, reasonable value. I'd heard this was the most romantic place in London. We didn't get to experience the outdoor area which looks like a fairy tale in pictures I've seen but it was most certainly romantic indoors! The low lighting, wood, reds and greens make for a beautiful decor and the menus are indulgent enough for any special occasion. It's quite hard to book a table but we ended up walking in spontaneously on a Wednesday night around 8pm and had no issue sitting straight down. We took the seasonal tasting menu which is reasonably priced at £55/pers (without wine). The five course meal was delicious, portions are not very big but by the time we'd finished we certainly weren't hungry. The food is rich, flavours very well brought together and produce of great quality. There's no particular risk taken on the food associations - foie gras/duck and fruit, fish and chorizo... But sometimes traditional is just right, especially when you are out for a classy date. If you're not a pudding person please don't skip this one - it was the culinary highlight of the meal. Loved it, looking forward to going back. Would probably try a la carte next time or go back when new season kicks in on the tasting page. Or maybe even try the veggie tasting menu...",1
5,Fantastic food fantastic atmosphere fantastic service. We arrived at 9 on a Wednesday and waited less than 30mins for a table but found a seat at the bar. The squid was delicious. Highly recommend!,1
2,"I had heard that London had some of THE best Indian food outside of India.  Living near Little India in Artesia, California there's a lot of good ass Indian food, so I had to compare the Indian food in London.  
Punjab seemed like a good candidate.  After getting lost a few times with the damn directions on the Yelp iPhone app, we finally found it.  It's near Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus, but we kept getting turned around.  
Punjab is a very nice, classy restaurant. The wait staff were friendly and quick.  There were a lot of people eating there too.  Good mixed crowd and even some customers of Indian decent were eating there, so it looked promising.  Nothing on the menu really jumped out at us, so we ordered spinach paneer, rice, and garlic naan.  The food was not bad, but nothing to knock my socks off.  It was pricey too.  Sorry, but I've had better Indian food in Artesia and at more affordable prices.  Maybe next time I have to try an Indian restaurant in London that is a off the beaten path and not near the touristy part of town.  I would've thought they had a Little India section in London too, but either it doesn't exist or I couldn't find it.",-1
4,"Let's get this straight. Four Seasons will give you the best roast duck in the world. However I decided to give 4 stars because of their service, which should be better. 
As a student based in Leeds, I go to London from time to time to watch football, and usually before that, I would go here for lunch. 
Quite a lot of times, I went there and it's a 50/50 chance the service would be good or bad. I've had the good service twice and the
bad service twice. 
But for food, the duck is the best around. No question. The aubergine with fried pork meat is amazing. And for the price, it was worth trying. It's just that the service could be better.",1
4,"I went with a lovely group of people to Ping Pong for a Saturday lunch. They were busy, but they have a nice lounge upstairs which worked out perfect for our medium sized group. The food was delicious, the service may have been a little slow but being an American in London, I didn't notice. Great food, awesome company made my time at Ping Pong to be superb. The food was also very affordable, plus they had the funky credit card machine they bring in to the table (the UK way of swiping it :-P) I'll definitely come back to Ping Pong for the variety of delicious offerings.",1
4,"I'm a bit torn about Yauatcha. First time I went, we had the dim sum tasting menu. Now this was very good value, and it's true, the dim sum are a twist on the original and prepared with exceptional care (truffle oil in spring rolls?? it works.)
Second time I went, we had more standard items off the menu. The dishes tasted good, with obviously quality ingredients, but not overwhelmingly different from the equivalent dish you'd get at a regular chinese restaurant. Maybe it's just me, but perhaps it's hard to get subtle, inventive ""haut cuisine"" type flavors in Chinese food. 
I'd go back, especially for the tasting menu, but what I love about Chinese food wasn't totally there in the main dishes.
A good plus though - great tea selection, and if you order a few, you can really compare and contrast.",1
3,"Yauatcha is pretty much an upmarket yum cha (dim sum) restaurant.  Our evening there was a mix of good and bad, so this is why I have given it an average rating.
When I make a booking at a restaurant for 8pm, I expect to be seated at the table when I turn up on time.  Instead, we were waiting at the bar for half an hour before our table was ready.  If they are intending for you to buy drinks at the bar before your meal, then I feel they should have a no reservations policy.  When I made the booking, they told me that I would need to vacate the table by 10pm.  Fortunately this wasn't an issue for us tonight.
The restaurant is pretty loud and it didn't help that the tables were so close together.  I think this is a trendy restaurant.  There were a few parties of friends who had come for drinks and to try the nice-looking desserts.
Notwithstanding all this, I thought the dishes were excellent.  We got 8 dishes for dinner, a dessert each and a pot of jasmine tea (and a refill).  The prices ranged from £4.60 for a plate of 3 venison puffs to £13.50 for a plate of jasmine ribs.  The ribs were really delicious - the meat fell of the bones and was very tasty.  The desserts were very nice, but not outstanding.",-1
3,"Swift service (mind you we were only the second table to be occupied so at that stage there were far more staff than customers), keen prices and good food (my Barbary duck main course was very tasty but the pate starter could have done with a third triangle of toast. Nothing but praise for the chocolate tart dessert) made for a pleasant meal.
Despite the above I'm only awarding 3 stars as I can't comment on the quality of the alcohol on offer and once we were ready for the bill we'd become invisible so actually paying up an leaving took longer than it should have.",-1
3,Good dumplings but way too expensive for what you get.  Everything comes in portions of 3 which is daft if there's 2 of you on a date...who gets the 3rd one....urggghgh...!!,-1
1,"After looking at the yelp reviews, went there on my second day in London.  There was a line outside and was told a wait of 1 1/2 hrs.  Hmmm,  decided nothing can be worth that wait,  walked around covent Garden and had pretty good food at 'punjab' restaurant.  
A few days pass and I was walking around the area, saw the line wasn't too big,  decided to take the leap. It was a looong wait, an hour in the cold outside. Finally I was shown in and directed to the bar in the basement cos my table was apparently still not ready. It was a little surprising as I was walking by a bunch of empty tables. The bar area was mostly empty,  it could easily absorb almost everyone standing in the line outside in the cold..  But hey,  that's not my worry..  As I am inside now and it is warm..  Nice. 
Finally I am shown to the table that was empty all the time I was standing at the bar. The menu is unique by basically having a few different choices but mostly just renaming most of the usual Indian restaurant food. By this time I am just excited to be sitting at my table and I go ahead and order the usual chicken and paneer dishes. And now I wait... Well actually, the wait was not long..  Surprisingly it just took them two mins to bring my food..  Part of me was very excited till I started to taste cold chicken tikka, cold romali roti and chicken Ruby which was just a bland tasting butter chicken with dry boneless chicken pieces ... 
Suggestions -  don't make people wait for hours in the cold to make the demand appear to be above capacity. Try and make food at order so it gets to the table not cold like it was waiting to be picked up ten mins ago. 
Overall - like I said earlier,  most of the time, no food Is worth an hour waiting in line, freezing London cold or not. If you are one of those folks reading reviews standing in that line, Take this advice - Go walk over to Talli Joe, a 5 mins walk to Soho and enjoy better food and amazing cocktails.",-1
2,"The food was bad with the service to match.   I would stay away, as there are so many better restaurants around Chinatown.",-1
4,"I admit it, I go to Wong Kei... and I LIKE it!
So they closed and reopened, and some things have changed. The prices went up a little (not by that much), although the portions are the same, the staff got a little friendlier and service just a tad slower. But what's important remains the same. It's a place where you can get a plate of relatively good Chinese food quickly for not a lot of money. It's by no means the best food in the world but it is at a price that's cheaper that the rest. 
By all means go to the buffets in Chinatown, but unless you eat smart, you're losing out, the drink you have there will push you to the £10 mark... At Wong Kei, eat in, and your tea is free. I don't go for the really elaborate dishes, they specialise in the one plate meal in my opinion, rice or noodles with something on it. Larger plates are a pretty much a plate of the main, and you then order rice on the side, good for groups. I've only once ordered off of their Chef's specials list - udon with seafood and XO, and to my surprise I loved it, but it was expensive, so don't think I'd get it again. That and most of my colleagues didn't really appreciate it...
So stick to the basics, don't worry about sitting at the communal table (people, it's meant to zig zag so you're not sitting next to someone, please learn this! Talking to you Mr sweaty businessman who proceeded to elbow me for my meal and cluck that I was in his way - I was there first!). And enjoy the experience, yes the staff can be surley, but they're meant to be!",1
2,"We were so so excited to visit this restaurant. It came highly recommended by our hotel. We had visited it's sister place Chutney Mary's and were very pleased although we just had small bites in the bar. Veersawamy is beautiful. The view over Regent Street incredible. The scents were amazing and we were ready for a fantastic meal and experience. We were disappointed with both. Our server was cold and not attentive. She was on the sarcastic side and treated us like the tourists we were. Tourists who love London! She was neither British nor Indian and seemed to be miserable. That is unfortunate for her customers who spend high $$$ at Veeraswamy for food we could get in Central Square in Cambridge, MA or at a food truck in Portland, OR. Overpriced. Limited menu. Big disappointment.",-1
3,"I have to say, I've been to this PingPong and the one in Hampstead for at least 7 or 8 times and I keep on coming back...yet still I only give this place a three-star rating - why is that?
Well, the dim sum is actually pretty decent here, the selection is definitely very innovative and the food quality is always very high. In fact, I often come here with a Chinese friend who agrees with all of the above.
So, what is it that I don't like? Well, it comes down to the interior design and the customer service, which this place is kind of lacking. Inter-design-wise, I am sure that lots of people would disagree with me, but for me this is too slick, too stylish and too wanna-be funky. As for the customer service, the people here seem to be lacking a great deal of motivation - no smile, no sign of personal acknowledgement whatsoever...and this just doesn't go well with me.
Plus, it's also not a cheap meal, unless you come on a Sunday, when you can do Lazy Sum Day, which is an all-you-can-eat-kind-of-deal for GBP 18.99...still not cheap though.
What this place is lacking is the authentic Chinese experience of push cards being rolled around in the restaurant, the steam baskets piling up in the trolleys and also the fact that you can order in a more leisurely style. Along the lines of: I still could eat one more, let's see what the next lady is having in her trolley...
Well, if you want this experience in London, I suggest you go to New World in Chinatown...",-1
2,Biggest rip off ever. Who is paying off reviewers like Lonely Planet to put this in their books? Two smallish (based on previous ramen experiences) bowls of ramen: 32 pounds. Mine had a wafer thin slice of pork belly and a small piece of crab. The kale? One small shred. The extra bok choi (for an additional 1.5 pounds over the 14 pound base price)was 2 small limp leaves delivered late. Really? For 1.5 pounds? On the upside the service was sweet but still not worth it. There is just as good ramen at better value elsewhere.,-1
3,"This place COULD actually be amazing. The flavors of their curries are very good and the naan is of excellent quality. However, I personally feel that they skimp on ingredient quality and charge prices that would indicate higher quality. I had a fish curry and a vegetable medley made mostly of canned or frozen peas, corn and carrots. Just not up to standard for the prices that they are charging and for the quality of food that they have the potential to produce.",-1
5,"Simply excellent. Extremely knowledgable and professional wait staff, incredible food and great atmosphere and decor.",1
5,"Second visit here, very delicious. The fried chicken are taste. The grilled pork in the dipping ramen are very delicious. The only issue is the music are too loud and noisy, would be better not to make it like a night club. So far so good, really like this restaurant.",1
5,"My husband and I first ate at Clos Maggiore last March 2018, in their restaurant because we couldn't get a table at the Conservatory.. I made a reservation months before our anniversary dinner last night, flying in from LA 2 days ago.. It was truly worth the wait!! It was a magical evening from the time we walked in, up to the time we left!! The service was excellent, the food was amazingly sumptuous, and the ambience is what you come to Clos Maggiore for!!
A definite experience of you want a romantic experience worth remembering!!
Thank you Julio for the cafe and extra delicious dessert!!",1
5,"This is a very impressive restaurant. Begin your evening at the cocktail bar, which is an experience in itself, with a host of unusual martinis.
 The food I had was excellent, with probably the best cod I have ever eaten. However, do try to make sure that you don't get carried away with the ordering - which is very easy to do, as you will end up with too much food and a very hefy bill.
 We did have one problem with the wine - once opened and poured, the bottle was taken away from our table and placed in a bucket with several other bottles. Unfortunately, we did not get our bottle back and had to complain.
 Overall, this restaurant is a treat with great cocktails and fabulous food.",1
2,"Overpriced and overrated. I've been twice and each time had ridiculous wait times; the second time being over one hour outside in the freezing cold and they didn't even have heaters or let us order from the bar, which would have made our wait less painful. Then once inside we had to wait another 20 minutes at the bar downstairs for a table. The food, while interesting, was overly salty (on both visits) and not that memorable. Highlights were the fried okra chips, the greens and the mango ice lollies. Please note that they don't serve the customary curries, this is Bombay street cuisine. All in all, this is not worth your time or money; you'll be much happier with any of the decent Indian restaurants around Euston Station at a much cheaper price, though you won't get the same atmosphere.",-1
3,"Hmmm...
 My experience of the Cinnamon Club is rather different from most of those here, so I'll get straight to the point!
 The interior is indeed impressive, having once been a library, this two-storey room does provide a unique ambience.
 The food is Anglo-Indian in true fusion style, and there's no doubt that you can get some rich and unique flavours. Whether you actually like something like Massala Mash will be up to you - expect the innovative rather than classic Indian cooking. Personally, I find the offerings a bit hit and miss, and the vegetarian selection disappointing for an Indian restaurant. Some dishes really are very good, but others rather less so. The wine list is very good indeed, at a price.
 The price: I've not tried the £22 early-bird menu, which sounds like a very good deal, and probably the best way to sample the food. If you go a la carte, expect to pay £60 a head or more - plus service. Go for an above-average bottle of wine and I'd budget on £75 a head.
 And that is my main gripe. For this amount of money, I have not been impressed with the quality of service. On my last visit, my starter arrived before I had finished my (actually rather nice) 'free' appetiser, which was unceremoniously whisked away before I had finished it, and without being asked. I found this absolutely astonishing. And the waiters seemed a little sniffy throughout - again not what I expect for this amount of money (or for any amount of money, actually).
 So, good marks for the food and surroundings, but three overall taking into account value for money and service.",-1
4,"On a recent trip to England, we asked a local friend for a recommendation for a good, local Indian restaurant. They recommended Dishoom. My fiancee and I are huge fans of Indian food, so we took her recommendation.
First, let's get the ""bad"" out of the way: Dishoom is so popular, and so good, that the wait on a Sunday evening is over an HOUR. Seriously, there's a line out the door and into the street. This is just a symptom of their success. Frankly, they just need to open another location or two. Incidentally, our friend warned us to go early, like 5 pm, if we didn't want to wait too long. We figured that a Sunday night wouldn't be too bad, so we got there around 6. The line was spilling out into the street.
Now on to the ""Good"" (and there is a lot of good... )
We met with the hostess outside, and she got us on the list, and into the line. While on line, a waiter comes through and brings out shots of various things. Sherry on one trip, maybe a chai shooter on the next. It was a nice way to wait in line, and socialize with our fellow diners.
Once you make it to the door, they send you to the bar to wait some more. I think this is part of their business model. The bar is packed tight, with no place to sit, and almost nowhere to stand. Be pushy, or you'll never make it to the bar, and never get a drink. The bartenders are fantastic, and make some beautiful, artful drinks. We had 2 rounds, and that was great.
We finally got a table, in the outside room, which was blissfully quiet. 
The waitstaff was fairly good. Friendly, mostly on top of it. The downside is that, again, being very busy, you can't get a lot of service. We waited ages for refills on water, mostly because they just don't have anyone filling water.
Now, on to the excellent: The food. Fiancee spent months living in India, and she said this was as close as she's had since. We tried an excellent spread of different items, and they were all excellent. I think the Ruby Chicken was my favorite. Everything was spiced well, without being extreme.
The cost was not particularly out of line. We spent a lot, but that was due greatly to the multiple rounds of drinks. I think each dish was priced well.
I want to give Dishoom 5 stars, but for me, the crazy wait on a Sunday evening, both outside and in the bar, knocked off a star. I can't even imagine what a Friday or Saturday night looks like! Another slight knock: We asked the host to call us a cab, and they called us a car that I think was not an official cab. That was a little dicey, but it worked out OK. The driver was nice, anyway.
Given the experience as a whole, I give Dishoom a solid 4 stars. I can see how they have so many 5 star reviews, but it wasn't quite there for us. Really good, but too many people for my taste.",1
2,"I don't like giving out bad reviews, but this place offers overpriced mediocre and very disappointing. With one michelin star and all, you would think you can get something special here. I had Har Gau, Prawn and bean curd Chaung-fen, and Spinach cuttlefish & prawn balls. It added up to 22.58 pounds (including a 13% service charge and a 1 pound donation to a certain foundation that I know nothing about.)
The food was over salted in general and the skin of the Har Gau broke as soon as my chopsticks touched it. The Chaung-fen was nothing special.
The most ridiculous part? I couldn't finish my Chaung-fen so I asked the waitress if she could box the left-over and she said the restaurant does not allow their diners to box the leftovers. If it's a buffet, fine. But when a client has already paid for the food, you'd rather see it go to waste than have the client take it home? That logic is completely bulls. 
I asked for my change and put every penny back into my wallet. Definitely won't come back again. In the future, I'd rather spend that amount of money on a decent steak at Jamie's Italian.",-1
5,"It's really impressive how cheap and how good the food can be here, in the heart of Chinatown. The beef with chilli and black bean sauce is my personal classic and it's only £5! Seafood noodles can be as cheap as £3,80, the service is fast and they serve you jasmine tea for free - I find it perfect to help digestion after so much food. Portions are large! You might share your table with strangers and they are famous for the kinda rude service, but that's absolutely alright when you get the (cheap) bill.",1
2,"Was able to get a table for 4 early on a weeknight, but they were extremely strict about the time limit. We were told to leave about 15 minutes before the end. Make sure that you book a table and maybe have plans for where to go afterwards. 
As part of London restaurant month, they had a special dim sum set menu. Everything came out relatively quickly, but the portion that came out was a little small. It was also not the best dim sum I'd ever had, but I haven't had a good one in London yet.
This place was geared towards the foreign palate as opposed to real Chinese dim sum. Depends on what you're looking for.",-1
5,"Good food, wine and service right in the middle of London without being a tourist trap.
 Take someone special to impress them and expect to pay for it too.
 Only thing I would say is that they allocate the best tables to those that book first so if it's a last minute booking, dont expect to get the extra wow factor of this setting.",1
5,"I was wet, cold, hungry, and cranky while waiting for my husband to finish up record shopping at Rough Trade, and found this place via online search.  
I was skeptical because there were so many publications giving this place a great review, I thought maybe they just had really good PR. 
We were able to thankfully grab a table right away, ordered some drinks as it was a day that ended in a ""Y"", and ordered: Bhel, Chicken Tikka, Mattar Paneer,  Black Dahl, and Plain Naans. We ate every single piece of food that we ordered, it was so tasty! 
Sad we don't live out there, but if we ever do go back to London,  we're definitely eating here again!",1
3,"i've been here twice now and really enjoyed it both times. the most recent was for a night out with my colleagues from work. we ordered the seafood and vegetable set menu for £14.95 per head and thought it was really good. dim sum can get pretty pricey (in here anyway!) if you are ordering off the menu, so this seems like good enough value. i would like it if the waiting staff would explain what each thing is when they bring it to the table, because once you order, your menus are taken away from you, and my memory is not that good! none of us knew what we were eating...and i would like to know!
the cocktails are delicious, although i'm not sure how strong they are. they are around the £7.50 mark, and being that they are in tall tumblers, i guess it is okay. i had the hong kong colada which was delicious.i really love coconut, but not creamy drinks so this was perfect for me! i ordered a second cocktail, i think it was a raspberry and limoncello caiprinha - it was tasty, but mainly ice, BOO! 
the wait staff are pretty good here - efficient and professional, but no real warmth or connection. the atmosphere is busy, loud, close together. this place is good for things like work nights out, but i don't think i would choose to come here for a meal with friends, or my boyfriend.",-1
3,"The food was great but it all felt a bit rushed and I am immediately put off anywhere that you need to queue. The staff were also a bit rude. The Waiter who took our order more than suggested we were ordering wrong. In summary, great food but not worth queuing for.",-1
5,"By far the best Indian in town ( far better than expensive Umaya). We were two people and paid around forty pounds (very good for London). Their traditional beer is outstanding, we skipped appetizers and ordered; the dhal which was above average, ruby chicken which was the best Indian item and their special tikka which is perfect after you squeeze some lemon over it. Food comes spiced decently (for someone who likes very spicy it's quite something) and with three sauces. Finally the pistachio kulfi was quite something coming in a stick version. Overall great experience, portions are decent and so would advise special care when ordering so as not to over-order. I would skip the dhal as its slightly above average and take something else. Beware you ll come out smelling like curry.",1
4,"Taking a sophisticated Chinese friend from Hong Kong for lunch in London is always tricky as the standard of the home city is so unbelievably high, and so it proved on this occasion when she expressed herself impressed with the decor, but found the food not as good as in Hong Hong and the whole place a bit pretentious. In truth, it's not a place for lunch, though they do a pretty good dim sum, as it's decorated and lit like a nightclub and the menu prices make no concession to the time of day, unlike other Michelin-starred restaurants such as L'Atelier Joel Robuchon where you can have a prix fixe at lunchtime for £19.
 The staff too are somewhat snooty - as has been noted elsewhere, and our waiter was both a touch surly and distinctly unhelpful when we wanted to make more room on the rather too small (for a Chinese meal) table for two. The pretentiousness came out again when he saw me taking a photo of the dim sum and was positively 'British Airways steward' in trying to suggest that I was in the wrong. I quite understand restaurants don't want people flashing their cameras at other diners, but discreet no-flash photos of your own food is fine and I refuse to be brow-beaten. As a consequence, I took more than usual of the decor.(also apparently banned).
 The crispy squid was good and well seasoned and the seafood soup delicious - it tasted almost as good as the fabled sharks-fin rice that one is sometimes given in private company restaurants in Beijing and which costs an Emperor's ransom, and the roast chicken and stir-fried lotus root was excellent too. Though not quite good enough for seasoned Hong Kong tastebuds.
 We only drank tea (of which there was a fine selection) so we avoided the mark-ups on the wines which have made others wince, but we emerged in to the light with a pretty big hole in our wallet for a lunchtime meal and some tiresome service
 A final point; I am now unimpressed with restaurants and pubs which don't provide free wi-fi - and extremely unimpressed it's not available in a basement like Hakkasan, as one can't pick up 3G either.",1
3,"Used to be great, seems the food has slipped, some of the items we had were terrible combos of tastes. Personally wouldn't good back anytime soon.",-1
2,"I had high expectations for this place.  The restaurant interior is beautiful, and I appreciate that they kept the Victorian library look and feel of the space.  
For the price point, I have to say that the food was less than stellar, and the portions were on the small side, requiring my group to order more and more.  There was nothing in particular that stood out for me in terms of any dishes that ""wowed"" me, other than the butter chicken.  However, I liken butter chicken to pizza.  Even bad pizza is still pretty good pizza.
Service was okay to below-average.  I was without a drink for quite some time, and had to constantly flag the wait staff down to put my order in.    
For your money and time, I would probably try other places out over the Cinnamon Club.  Not worth the time.",-1
2,"After 3+ months of cuisine française, I wanted to tuck into something more familiar on our first night in London. After figuring out where Chinatown was on the tube map we made our way there and stumbled into Wong Kei since it was the first ""decent"" looking restaurant that wasn't a cheap looking buffet. 
This place is cavernous, with three floors and people shuffling in and out when it gets busy. The wait staff is cold and quite unfriendly, even by Chinese restaurant standards, however they get the job done. The food is standard Cantonese noodle house fare, though unlike the case Tayyabs, where the food was better than what I had in the US, the offerings here were in the opposite direction. Their clay pot rice, while tasting ok, didn't come in a clay pot and thus didn't have the unique texture and crunch on the bottom that its supposed to have. While the chow fun was on par which what I was used back home the won-ton soup lacked flavor and the duck over rice came covered in candy-sweet dark brown sauce, which I think was a nod to local tastes, since I had seen the exact same thing in Glasgow. In any case, this place is inexpensive by London standards and will satisfy your Cantonese food fix. Mostly.",-1
5,"Wong Kei's has been famous for being rude to customers for over 20yrs it is why people use to go, usually to take a friend who was none the wiser & then sit back in amusement & watch their look of horror & disbelief on their faces, as the staff are abrupt & rude & normally move you to another table at least once during your meal, for no apparent reason, often 2 or 3 times. 
I haven't been for a while. I really must go back & relive that de ja vou experience again!! 
I hope it hasn't changed, as it's just so much fun, you could always clock the diners who were, in on the joke & those who are new to the delights of Wong Kei's, the tasty cheap food always comes 2nd to the side show entertainment, that is the waiters & newbee customers!! I have been eating there on & off 20yrs & it never fails to be an amusing night out! 
Very cheap food, but still tasty & very abrupt rude staff, who will be ruder to your newbee diner friend if you slip them a few quid!",1
4,"Had a really good night at Yauatcha.  Food was good and the wine even better!  It is pricey but as other people have mentioned, there are various deals that you could check out.  I would go back and I do recommend!",1
2,"Its good to see lots of reviews about this place!
 The main points of Wong Kei are:
 1) Cheap cheap cheap. You won't find cheaper Chinese food elsewhere in Chinatown.
2) Waiting staff are stretched thin, and customer satisfaction is their lowest priority as they have way too many tasks to handle.
3) Food is decent for the price paid
4) During busy times you might have to share a table with others",-1
3,"Crispy fat juicy duck FTW! The duck is worth the queue. If you ain't a duck fan you have other alternative dishes that are equally tasty, but then you'd be wasting your time. I had some friends telling me that it was OK, I think the duck quality varies. I got lucky with mine. I'd skip the crispy pork belly and just go try something else.
It's probably a little pricey for my liking but they're portions are huge and generous. If you're in groups of 3-4, make a booking because this place is packed.",-1
3,"Very good food but service...well, lets be nice and say it was ""odd"". Off for another beer.",-1
2,"Not the best food I had, but, the expectation and the matching decor to the younger casual hip crowds compensate the shortcomings. It's decor is more of French Gastro Pub/Brasserie style. 
The spices are too much and after the half of the meal, all 3 of us lost interest in food, just the black pepper bomb in all 7 dishes and not enough happiness signal reached to the brains. I think we weren't full but done with too much spices of the same kind.
The beer was from London, and, not impressive, the blueberry beer came in a can, felt CHEAP.
The food side was underwhelming in the end. But, our waiter and the beverage waitress are real charmers.
The foul tactic at the entrance door was really not nice. The greeting staff said the waiting is 1 hour 25 minutes, but, if we ordered the drinks inside (at the bar area) the waiting will be shorter. Indeed, whether you order the drinks or not, within 25 minutes, we were seated. And, the exit is on to the main street, and, the arriving guests might never guess but think that the place is fully packed as they see no one comes out through the entrance. That could sell one or two more cocktails or beers, but, that is clearly a deception.
Unique enough to try out, but, I wonder if I would go back to try their food again. But, the deluded people put on their smile all the way. I guess they succeed in casting some good spell.",-1
4,"We went to Hakkasan for a birthday brunch. The restaurant has lauched Dim Sum Sundays where you get to choose between two different menus. One with and one without champagne. Six courses, couple of drinks, champagne and dessert. For a very good price. 
The first course, a crispy duck salad was simply amazing. I still dream about it! It was followed by dumplings, dim sum, rolls, a main course, a small snack, and it was all very very good.
The staff was very attentive, the food was excellent, we had some amazing drinks and a lot of champage. All included in the menu we went for. 
There was a DJ playing, and the restaurant was packed, but even though it was packed, you got all the attention you could expect from the staff. We had a very good time, and I will defiitly go back!",1
4,"Wow! This place has got pretty darn good tasting ramen. It can definitely give Daikokuya in Los Angeles a run for their $$. Having heard about this place on Yelp! I was quite excited to give it a try. We came here on a whim during one of the unusual snowy weekend in London. When we got there we got seated immediately by the uber friendly staff. The ambiance here is very casual, hip and on the loud side. The space can be a tad cramp but we were comfortable.
Foodwise, I had the tonkatsu ramen while my husband had the soy ramen. My tonkatsu soup was pork bone base and as the menu stated took 20 hours to achieve its perfect rich flavor. The soy soup on the other hand is chicken base thus lighter but equally delicious (yep I had a slurp off of the mister's soup). Both soup had a descent amount of toppings (spring onions) while the noodles was just right (not too soft or hard). I cant tell if they were handmade but I found it really tasty. My only gripe here is the temperature of the soup. I thought that it could have been a bit more warmer than what I was served. Otherwise everything is good in this hood.",1
2,"Ping Pong is a themed chain of restaurants that sell modern Asian food, in particular dim-sum. They are usually well decorated and usually quite busy.
 At the Waterloo branch you sit as in most of the locations around small tables, asian style. Let me start in a rather petty way by saying they're uncomfortable little things and don't lend themselves to long stay. Staying at a place for a reasonable length of time is something that high prices should allow but in the case of Ping-Pong it's not always the case.
 Foodwise, they have a great little menu that's got a lot of lovely items on. There's seafood dim-sum, which appears to be a speciality as well as the usual assorted steamed and fried dishes. Since it's somewhat Western in influence these aren't as authentic as a Chinatown place, but it's a good start.
 The dishes though are expensive, as another reviewer pointed out this is quite shocking considered the very small portions. In addition when I visited it was very easy for the server to seem to get confused and bring us the dishes for the other tables.
As an example of the price comparison, the 'special' flower tea they sell can be found for 1/10th the price in supermarkets There's a lot of mark-up on the 'exotic' nature of the products they are selling, so you need to be aware of this.
 So, overall on the food It's good, tasty and varied, but oh-so-small portions and so expensive. Very much a 3 star if you're with a group, or on a business lunch. However I actually only rate it a 2 once you factor in that you can't really justify the prices if it's only two of you dining.",-1
4,"Imagine you're at dim sum with five other friends and you order two steamers of prawn shu mai.  You all take a piece and there are two left.  Who are the lucky two that get seconds?? Everyone is being all fake polite so no one claims them initially as you are secretly eyeing the dumplings, willing someone to just give up already in favour of those with hungrier stomachs (aka you).  Hey, no shame, we've all been there before...
Fortunately this completely hypothetical scenario never has to happen at Yauatcha! They just rolled out their Supreme Saturdays menu where they serve a generous tasting of assorted steamed and fried dim sum for a reasonable price and for those selfish eaters, you don't have to worry about sharing with others :). 
Can't make it on the weekend? Their Taste of Yauatcha menu offered on weekdays is just as good!
I personally am a fan of their fusion, upscale dim sum items (e.g., prawn and bean curd cherng fun, curry taro puffs) but I'm aware it's not for everyone. Fear not, however, as they also serve a selection of the traditional items for all you purists out there.",1
4,"Dim Sum was on our must try list during our trip to London.  We had heard about Yauatcha and jumped at the chance to try,  We tried for reservations but there were none to be had.  They accommodated us quickly and got us a seat in the bar area that worked out great.  The food was REALLY good and had a lot of variety.  
Food - We tried a few different things as there were so many good options on the table.  Dim Sum, Duck and a Noodle Dish were the things that we tried:
Dim Sum - Char Sui Bun, Pork and Prawn Shu Mai and finally Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumplings.  All were very good.  Char Sui Buns are classic dim sum, great flavor.  The Pork and Prawn Shu Mai was good.  Finally the Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumpling were also done very well.  
Mains - We had the Crispy Aromatic Duck and the Singapore Stir fry vermicelli with prawns and squid.  The duck was incredible (first time trying it).  Not too oily and had great flavor.  I didn't have any of the noodles but wife really enjoyed it. 
Atmosphere - The restaurant is very modern looking and tastefully decorated.  We ended up sitting in the bar for dinner, but it didn't matter.  Many times I didnt feel that I was in a restaurant.  It felt like a cool place to hang out.  
Service - The service was top notch.  The servers were attentive, but not overbearing.  I never had to ask for a refill as they approached us at the right time.  The dishes (yes there were a lot) were brought out in stages as it didn't feel that we had things piling up.  We took our time and really enjoyed the experience.  
Great Job.  We really enjoyed our experience and told many of our friends.",1
2,"The most agitated I've ever been while eating a meal. From the minute we walked in, they were hesitant to give us a table (even though we were surrounded by empty tables) and told is we'd have to be out in an hour if they did. When ordering, they kept questioning our order as if they were judging us for ordering so little and the waiter snapped at us for ordering out of order (kept saying to order appetizers first). The entire meal they hovered around- not allowing us to enjoy our food or have peaceful conversation and after giving us our bill, they asked if we were done paying three times within two or three minutes of dropping it off. Two servers stood and watched us count our cash which was uncomfortable. The food was fine but the entire experience made me want to leave asap.",-1
3,"After months of wanting to come here, but knowing about the queues, we were finally out and about in London and ready to eat right about the time they opened, so I figured it would be the perfect time to go (as no queue, right?) Luckily I was right and we got right in.
The menu, easy, steak and fries. And a salad to start. We get our salads and order our wine. The wine comes, the waitress opens it, pours a partial glass (for tasting I assume) and then sets the wine down on the table and walks off? What? Um, shouldn't you wait to make sure the wine is okay before you just leave in on the table and disappear. I mean, if it's not, I suppose we don't have to pour it and drink it, but given the servers come around practically never, that's really not an option. So I take a sip, and joking look over my shoulder, ""Oh yes, that's great thanks!"" Then the wine turns out to be NOT the wine we ordered. Luckily it was a cheaper wine, so we didn't feel so bad about drinking it, and it was quite tasty, but still, why can't the waitress remember what wine to bring? At this point I comment that perhaps they're going for the authentic French experience: rude waitstaff. Except that every place I've been to in France, they've been more than courteous and not at all rude, so clearly if that's what they're going for, they'd going for the stereotype.
The steaks arrived. They are arranged fairly unattractively on a small plate with a pile of chips on the side. It was decidingly unattractive and unappealing. You'd think a restaurant that does ONE dish would be able to do it in a way that actually makes it appealing to eat. It also seemed a bit small, but for some unknown reason (because it keeps the food hot maybe? I don't really know) they bring a second portion of the food around when you're done.
The food though, yeah it was good. The steak was cooked rare and the sauce was tasty. The chips were also great (and I used some of the mustard on them, tasty). Weirdly though, the steak itself was kind of chewy and not really that great. Again, you'd think a restaurant that ONLY MAKES THIS DISH would make it perfectly. I can cook a better steak at home. Who are the chefs that work here?
We get dessert: The other half orders cheese and I order the raspberry tart. I then get up to use the bathroom, and when I return, there are two strawberry tarts on the table. Um, I ordered raspberry. So I can see why they only do one dish now, because that way the servers don't have to remember what people order because clearly they can't. About five minutes later, the cheese finally comes. They serve my other half up some cheese (and it's a lot of cheese, be prepared if you order the cheese for dessert). I mention that they brought the wrong tarts. The server gave me the ugliest stare for even mentioning that it was wrong, but they said they'd bring me the correct tarts. Then they say they'll bring bread for the cheese. Afterwards, I turn to my other half and say, ""Hmm, I wonder which they'll bring first, the tarts or the bread"". Turns out I won, as the tarts turned up. I slowly start eating my tarts (which were quite tasty), and no bread shows up. Finally, I turn around and grab some random person walking by and say, ""Can we get some bread for the cheese?""
She gets bread, then notices that they didn't bring a knife for the cheese (at least this one noticed), so she ran off to get the bread. The cheese turned out quite nice, but we paid the bill and left, and noticed the queue outside the door as we walked away.
Bottom line: The steaks were alright, nothing special. The desserts were good. It's worth the price, but not the wait, so go if you're planning on going early, but not if you're planning on waiting in the queue. The service is definitely not worth it (and given they only do ONE dish, you'd think they'd be WAY more organized than they actually are). And honestly, I had a better steak at La Petite Maison (and hey they actually take reservations, so you don't have to queue). I'm beginning to think that Londoners actually just really like queuing, regardless of the quality of product they'll be receiving (Monmouth coffee anyone?). Herd mentality, maybe? I don't know, but I'll be dining elsewhere for steak thank you.",-1
5,"i keep on going back for their congee ... to me this is the best congee ... i will miss yauatcha but as a consolation, i was told that they have a sister restaurant, hakkasan in nyc!",1
5,Best Indian restaurant in London I've been to for the 10 years I've lived here. It's quite hard to get in as the queue is always massive but totally worth the wait. Black Daahl is just insane.,1
5,"I can't fault this place. 
Great Food - great service and a beautifully contradictory space. 
The only down side is most people need to take out a loan to eat here.  If you can - experience it!",1
3,"Go for breakfast its great. Bacon wrapped in nan bread smothered in ghee....I mean yes! The Indian spiced omelette yes! The free refills on chai...YES!
Never go for dinner unless you like a 2 hour wait.....! needs to start taking reservations its just too busy for this turn up an queue malarky.",-1
3,"In short, I think Yauatcha is over hyped and over priced. 
Positives:
- Design and atmosphere: very posh, intimate, nice lighting, nothing like a loud traditional dim sum place
- Wine list: most extensive wine list I've ever seen in a dim sum place, they also have a trendy looking bar
- Dessert bar: they look like works of art, just so pleasant to look at. 
The rest is not as jolly: 
On this bitter cold night I decided to reward myself for walking around Oxford University all day by coming to Yauatcha. I've heard so much about it and there are more than 100 reviews with an average of 4 stars, it's about time we meet ;). 
So I decided to examine the place by the 4 basics:
- Shrimp Chang Fun
- Chicken feet
- Pot stickers
- Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli)
Food wasn't bad, but not among the top of my dim sum billboard either. Chang fun was smooth, but the prawns were a bit fishy (could be the a different kind from what I'm used to). Chicken feet were a little too sweet and too greasy (they usually are). Pot stickers were okay, not enough meat in the stuffing. And gai lan. Oh the garlic gai lan, it's very good but considering it's just steamed vegetable stir fried with garlic, there's no way it should cost more than 8 bloody pounds!  That can buy me 2 lunches! 3 from Tesco! 
Most authentic dim sum place will serve you tea for free. Not at Yauatcha, where they have a big tea menu with fancy names. While I'm in no position of judging the various English tea,  I know my Chinese green/black/floral tea pretty well, and that Pu Er served with no tea leaf is definitely no more than mediocrity (hence is not worth 5 pounds). 
In the end I was full and my craving was somewhat resolved. But the sum wasn't so dim - it ended up being a 35 pounds meal. Ouch. 
Although the cakes looked lovely, I had no stomach or budget to try any, if I ever return it'd be for the desserts. 
It's not surprising to me though, knowing that this place is created by Alan Yau, who also created Wagamama. Basically his target is Asian food for non-native Asians, and I don't blame him, the market is big and margin is fat.  I should have known better. I do, however, take objection to the fact that this place was rated two Michelin-star. It does not deserve it, and it made me believe that nowadays Michelin rating is more an indicator of the price, not the food.",-1
5,Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had! our waitress was really nice and gave us great recommendations on what to order and of course we ordered it all! We had more food than either of us could eat but the food was just that good. The walk back to the hotel was hard because we were stuffed and both wanted to take a serious nap.,1
3,Heard so much about this place. Heard it was best Chinese in London. Well. Ambience was great. Music was repetitive and loud. Food was salty. No way the best Chinese I have had. Average at best,-1
3,"Let me say that I'm a big ramen fan, but I think I've been spoiled by ramen I've had in San Francisco and Las Vegas.  
On a cold rainy day in London ramen is a nice antidote to blah weather.  This place does a decent job, although the noodles were pretty thin and didn't seem to be freshly made.  
Overall a decent place that I'd probably go back to.",-1
3,"I do not understand the obsession with Bone Daddies, it is ok but it definitely isn't amazing or anywhere near the best in London. It felt like the Nandos or pizza express of Ramen. As another yelper said below, it's not real ramen. Far from it. 
I had the Tantanmen ramen which had around an inch of oil on top and one measly slice of Pork. Really? One slice? By the end of my bowl, I felt physically sick by the amount of oil that I had consumed. It started off great then quickly changed as the oil hit my stomach. On the bright side, the egg was perfectly cooked!
The best part of the evening was the drinks. 
I would rather go to Tonkotsu, Kanada-Ya or Shoryu for my ramen fix. I will give bone daddies another shot in the future, but in the mean time, I need to wait a month for the oil to leave my body. 
Solid 3* (would give 2.5* if I could)",-1
3,"I must say I was a bit disappointed...
On a Friday night, we waited for 50 minutes before being seated (around 10:30pm). They offered us chai tea during the wait and it wasn't raining, so that was OK. They have an efficient system where they can tell you exactly how much you've been waiting and are very respectful of the order in which you arrived, so it felt like a fair process. 
We ordered the dahl (house recommendation, £7), a chicken dish (£11) with rice (£2.50), and garlic and cheese naans (£3 each). The dishes were good, but quite spicy, despite being described as mild, and not out of this world - very similar to Indian restaurants in Paris, which are not considered as the best preserved international food in France. The naans were incredible though - we hesitated to order more at the end of our meal, and one week after I'm still longingly thinking about them. Nah, I'm not food-obsessed AT ALL (: 
Is it good? I guess, if you are more of a spice-lover than us. Is it worth queuing up for 1 hour? Don't think so.",-1
3,"I enjoyed the food here and it was certainly an interesting dining experience (you get a little menu at the start and you just mark what you want from it and hand it in, it also comes very quickly) but nothing to rave about really and think you can get better Dim Sum at Yauatcha quite nearby!
However I really enjoyed the coconut and mushroom soup, the vegetable puffs and also the duck spring rolls!",-1
5,"The tonkotsu ramen was delicious. Hit all the right notes. The standouts are the rich, creamy, savoury broth (nicely balanced with a bit of fresh ginger), and that egg.....man that egg. I'm already plotting my next return. If my husband can't make it, I'll come back solo. That's how much I want it.  I had amazing, memorable ramen in Tokyo years ago, but sadly lots of mediocre bowls in the years since, but the tonkotsu ramen at Bone Daddies put my taste buds right back in that happy place.",1
5,"I love this restaurant but it does warrant a special occasion - as other reviews has stated, you can easily get carried away (as the menu is so delicious) and will need to dig deep in your wallet to pay the bill.
 First off, it's difficult to find. Just off Tottenham Court Road, down a back alley, tucked away in the corner, set in an old underground carpark. Keep going towards the end of the street and you'll eventually find the exclusive entrance.
 Plunge into the bowels, down a set of sleek and very dark stairs and suddenly a wonderland will open up to you. This would be the perfect place to bring a first date you're keen to impress. The tables are discrete, the lighting moody and beautiful people waft around looking cool - although you will find the odd rowdy group of Chinese businessmen.
 Incense hangs in the air and you can just about take a sneaky peak into the buzzy kitchen.
 The menu is huge and pretty overwhelming. The tea-smoked ribs are a favourite, the jasmine rice served in a dainty bamboo basket. The pepper beef is also delicious.
 Service can be a little hit or miss for a restaurant of this caliber. But the food makes up for it.",1
3,"Biggest disappointment of my trip to London. Was recommended this spot by multiple people and literally every dish was under seasoned, underwhelming and overpriced.  From the hour long wait to the small portions and subpar service, this spot is definitely one to skip",-1
5,There are several locations but I was told the shoreditch one is the best so we came to meet up with some friends. The line can be quite long. We put our names down and were told that it would be about 60-70 minutes but you can wait by the bar to get a drink. There are a few standing tables by the bar if you can snag one. We probably only waited 35-40 minutes so at least it was overestimated. The food is delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything you get.,1
3,The food was good.  I recommend the spicy chicken dumpling.  It does have a kick to it.  The spinach and mushroom dumpling is good.  The firecracker chicken roll is not spicy.  The service was ok.,-1
3,"Sad to say that the hype may have gotten the best of this restaurant.
The small bites, appetizers and desserts were all fantastic. Well prepared and presented. The main courses we ok, but nothing spectacular. No real complaints, just nothing to write home about. While the restaurant has an excellent wine list, it is grotesquely overpriced. It's aimed towards those who want to be seen spending money, not those interested in drinking a great wine.
Our main waiter was very friendly. However, there seems to be overall poor communication between the staff. We would ask for a drink or bread and the message never seemed to be passed on - disappointing for a restaurant of this calibre. Having to re-ask for things multiple times is tiresome. The sommelier also left something to be desire as far as friendliness goes.
The atmosphere and décor are lovely and comfortable. Modern European with an open kitchen.
If you're prepared for the fact that it's over-hyped, you'll have a good dinner.",-1
4,"Yauatcha isn't located in the most salubrious part of London - it's in the heart of Soho and right next door to the Berwick Street market.
It has 2 distinct personalities. The most obvious one is a sophisticated tea house, serving the most elegant and amazing cakes and macaroons, which you can see from the big windows opening onto the street. They just look so perfect and colourful and full of flavour. These are served on the ground floor and many people come for takeaway.
The other part to Yauatcha is a high-class (and expensive!) dim sum restaurant on the ground floor. Routine dishes are given a lift with exotic ingredients like venison and even gold leaf. Lovely to eat. Expensive ingredients make it better? Debatable I think.
So a solid 4 stars - lovely experience but heavy on the wallet.",1
3,"Well if you don't mind dining in the most modest of furnishings, a table and a chair between babies in strollers galore with noisy conditions--- and you like your meat well done & not succulent; and you are easily swayed into ordering 'extras' at the insistence of waiters speaking broken English, then DISHOOM is just the place for you! 
Me? I'm not planning a return visit.",-1
2,"Came at 6.30 on a Sunday night when it was busy but there was no wait. Staff are friendly and efficient. Room is buzzy. We were disappointed by the ramen having tried the two tantanmen variants. The soup was thick but a bit bland and heavy on peanuts which added an unwelcome sweetness and starchiness. Missed the savoury umami that's really important in any noodle soup. The noodles didn't hold their texture very well either. Soft shell crab was OK but nothing special. Would definitely recommend Shoryu over Bone Daddies for its more subtle soup, noodles with better bite and excellent range of sides. Altogether better as evidenced by the preponderance of Japanese diners (compared with Soho hipsters).",-1
3,"I am not sure why I don't love Ping Pong. I mean, I should. I love food, and will generally and happily eat most things that are put in front of me. And then ask for more. My friends all love Ping Pong, and suggest stopping by whenever we pass the ubiquitous Ping, but after a couple of visits there I am not so sure. So what is my issue?
Well, perhaps I'm not sure how I feel about dim sum? I mean, it is a little odd. It comes steaming to the table, and then by the time you have got your chopsticks out, the dumplings have turned cold and gone strangely sticky. 
The other thing is the cost. On paper it seems inexpensive. £2.99 - £3.99 for three dumplings. But here is the thing; the dumplings are swallowed in a flash, and they recommend ordering at least three portions, so it starts to slowly add up, then there are all the little sides, then the bill is bigger than expected, and I am still hungry!",-1
3,"We had high expectations of this restaurant but it ended up being just ok. We had the pumpkin appetizer which was served very hot and was good. We also had saag paneer (very average). The paneer cheese in the dish was chewy and didn't have much flavor. We also ordered Chicken Tikka Masala which was tangy and decent tasting but didn't best some of the ones I've had before. The naan was good. Rice was decent but not great. We also had two types of pappadum and we prefer the masala pappadum to the plain. The chutneys and spices were not very flavorful. Nothing was really spicy. I ordered Rasmalai for dessert. It was good, milky and rich.",-1
5,Best f'ing ramen in London. Period. I drop into this joint every time I am in town. I have a high bar for ramen and this place never disappoints.,1
1,"After seeing their excellent rating on Yelp, I was excited to go to Le Mercury to celebrate my husband and my 1st year wedding anniversary.
Unfortunately, our experience was less than mediocre.
First of all, I had made a reservation using their online website and when we arrived they claimed that they had no record of it.  They managed to find us a table, but it was perhaps the worst table in the restaurant.  We were upstairs in a corner where the windows were completely blocked by plants.  Not very conducive to a romantic evening...
The only plus side to Le Mercury is that it is very affordable.  But the food is cheap for a reason.
We started with the ravioli, which was ""meh.""  Then I had the duck, which was the better of the two entrees and my hubby had the rib-eyed steak, which was vastly overdone. All of it was only lukewarm by the time it arrived at our table.
The service was terrible and slow.  I don't know if they resented having an extra table, but they never refilled our water and only bothered to check on us when they were dropping off our food.
Suffice it to say, though I live only a few blocks way, we will not be back.",-1
3,"I wanted to treat my family to a nice meal on our vacation in London while still trying to maintain a budget since the exchange rate is horrible against the dollar.
I read in a few traveler guides that the £19.50 3 course pre fixe was a good value at Clos Maggiore. I suppose considering the cost of most meals in London we did get a decent value but was expecting more from this restaurant.
The conservatory room is gorgeous and intimate. Since it was a clear day they opened the retractable glass roof which brought in a nice fresh breeze. Only issue with that was little black seeds, that looked like rat droppings, kept falling from above onto diners.
Our head waiter was a strange. He had to go over our orders multiple times and had to look over the menu more than once after I gave my order. I think a restaurant of this quality should have waitstaff that are familiar with the menu. At one point he chased me down on my way to the bathroom to clarify one more time what my starter was even though 3 of us ordered the same thing!
The food was just average and the options were rather limiting. I ordered the pork terrine and thought it was good but my sister likened it to fancy spam. My hubby ordered the crab mousseline for his starter which had an supplemental fee of £5 and not worth it. Bisque was more like a foam and the portions of scallops were small.
For entrees, I had the guinea fowl and everyone else ordered the red mullet w/smoked haddock risotto. I found the smoked fish flavour very overpowering. The mushrooms on my dish were tasty albeit on the salty side. I've never had guinea fowl but it tasted like old chicken and not very tender.
my mom's favorite part of the meal was the plum tart dessert. 
I don't think my family was too impressed with the meal.",-1
3,"I struggled whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars and admit I am somewhat biased as I enjoy amazing, authentic Chinese food near home.  In the end, I rounded down simply because I was not really wowed with many of their offerings.  The food was good but not amazing and probably not worth the overall cost.  If cost is no concern, I am happy to recommend trying this place and I would definitely go back just with tempered expectations.  I'll join the crowd who questions how this establishment earned a Michelin star, but good on them for doing so.",-1
3,"Reasonable quality food, hence the price.  If the credit crunch is hitting you hard then this a good place to take that special someone without having to spend too much.  It is pretty much always busy, maybe I am being too harsh on the food quality rating but I have been to many french restaurants and have had better, because I've paid more.  The starter was the best out of the three dishes, it was the mussels in white wine (not as fresh, but they were only £3.95).  The salmon was tasty with the lobster sauce but I was let down by the food's temperature, as if it had been left on the side for a bit before serving it.  Other than that, decent candle lit place with many tables cramped in a small-ish area but you will be surprised when you realize it is actually a three storey building.",-1
4,"Trendy and fun experience. Liked it so much we came one day for lunch and dinner! They have a very cool and casual vibe and the service was super friendly. A great place to enjoy some small plates and drinks with friends. They have two floors but I prefer the upstairs.
The lentils and the lamb samosas.YUM!",1
3,"3.5 stars. Came here with a friend for the first time with high expectations. Big mistake. I've had much better sushi back home in San Francisco for the same price or much cheaper. Heres what we ordered:
1. Hamachi Tartare - pretty good, loaded with wasabi and topped with caviar so beware if you don't like wasabi. 
2. Salmon Tacos - MEH, it came with a ""spicy salsa"" which wasn't spicy... and the tacos were about the size of a pringle. -_-
3. House Special Roll - Nothing out of the ordinary. Anyone can make this roll... just stuff salmon, tuna, and ebi into a roll and voila, you have Nobu's House Special Roll. 
4. Uni - Fresh, worth the 18 pounds it cost? Not sure.
5. Ikura - Equally fresh
6. Toro - Amazing
7. Hamachi - Don't even bother.
8. Mackerel - YUM.
9. Dessert - Chocolate Bento Box - EHHHHHHHH. Whatevs. 
HOWEVER, I ordered a glass of Billcart-Salmon Rose - this was the best glass of rose I've ever had. If you are a big champagne drinker, do not pass this up !
Service was exceptional (after all this place has atleast 20 of them running around aimlessly)
Even though my experience at this Nobu didnt meet my expectations, I'm still going to try the Los Angeles location but if I'm ever in London again, I doubt I'd come back.",-1
2,"Don't sit on the ground floor in winter time. You will freeze.
Their food is basically OK. most of the time it comes super speedily, once I had to wait quite a while (I have a feeling they forgot my order). Ma Po tofu was a touch slimy, singapore noodles pretty standard if a little salty. Rice is usually overcooked, which is surprising to see in a chinese restaurant.
Redeeming qualities: freakin' cheap. Massive portions. Free Tea. Hilarious. Always interesting if you're on your own.",-1
2,"MEH. This place is so average, it's painful. 
It's basic white girl average. 
It's white converse average. 
It's ripped on the knees jeans average. 
And I DETEST, above anything, spending money on average food. Give me a four figure Heston bill with no fear, but dont you come at me with your room temperature white and ultra fatty pork and claim it to be French cuisine. Aint nobody got time for that. 
And I wont even begin with the service. Im a nice human, seriously, and I hate calling people out on their shit work, but this establishment is famous for underpaying their staff and it shows! THEY ARE TIRED. and grumpy. and so unhelpful. and there were so many people, and it was stuffy and gross... 
ugh. Nope, not a fan.",-1
3,"Perhaps one of the worst things about Yelp is the expectations. I was expecting a lot out of this place from all the reviews, so I brought my sister here. I can't seem to remember what she ordered, but I had the escargot and a lamb dish. Both were decent, but were really not that great. The lamb was too chewy and the escargot was also lacking some hit-the-spot Frenchy goodness. 
Nonetheless, it is nicely located in central London and has a nice restaurant setting. I guess you could give it a try if you're itchin' for French food within the area, but personally, I wouldn't itch to go back here again.
I also might want to add how funny it was when my (also American) sister asked for a glass of iced tea. The response she received was a facial expression which read ""what the hell? ICED tea?!,"" which obviously came from the English waitress who couldn't understand why on earth one would want their tea ICE COLD. The lack of frigidity to my drinks was definitely something I had to get used to whilst living in London :)",-1
1,"This was a bitter disappointment. Had heard good things about the restaurant, however on arrival we found the place over booked. We were ushered into a cramped corridor of a bar, where aside from not being able to hear ourselves speak, we were unable to get to the bar as it was so crowded. The disappointing thing was that the bar was full of dissatisfied customers waiting overly long on their tables. Our 9 o clock table came at 9.40, after a huge amount of pestering of the overworked staff. 
The table we were given was so near the DJ that we couldn't hear, and the table was so dark we couldn't see. Typically, a second after opening the menu, a waiter impatiently asked if we has chosen, and we told him that with our senses so deeply inhibited, it was fairly difficult to discern your a** from your elbow, let alone chose food. In the end we left the restaurant without eating, as the place had the all the charm and character of a reversing dump truck with no tires on. 
It was a typical restaurant that was greedy- and overbooked hugely, and tried to be too cool. One doesn't go to one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants in the world to listen to repetitive and shoddy music from a low end DJ- in fact a DJ has little place in a restaurant at all. Put a candle on the table, and stop thinking your a hip place. You're not.",-1
2,"I was in London town recently and concluding a lovely early evening stroll along the Thames we decided to try out Ping pong. 
I desperately wanted this to be good, with a quirky name and an inviting seating area outside, we decided to give it a go. The result was a very uncomfortable hour after which we were left with nothing but a bill, regret and a stomach asking why oh why did you put me through that. 
The food simply wasn't up to it. It lacked taste. The steamed rice might as well have been from Tesco's or Asda. I was left not just disappointed but slightly angry at the cheek of serving such mediocre food.  Luckily London saves the day. The day was so enjoyable this mishap didn't make too much of a dint on the old mood.",-1
5,"Best ramen in London, and **shock** not a Japanese person in sight. This is luxury ramen cooked for hours, if not days to get the best out of every bone. I was blown away by the flavours of my chicken-based T22 soup with added corn, which unexpectedly pipped my wife's Tonkotsu for taste and appearance.  We also enjoyed the beautiful pickled fruit and vegetables, salty fried chicken and far too many of the garlic cloves that are at your disposal.
And of course, as a molecular biologist I also had to order the pipette. A dollop of extra fat (presumably duck) didn't actually do much for the already-fatty T22. Perhaps it's more needed for some of the other soups which we'd love to come back and try - especially the Chinese-inspired Tantamen.
The only negatives were that the big bowls only come half-full and could easily fit in a little more broth, and that the over-chatty staff coming and asking you how you're doing every five minutes takes away from the Ramen experience, especially when not one of them is Japanese.",1
3,"We went for a dinner with work colleagues.  The atmosphere is beautiful and lively and there is good people watching.  The wine list is very good.  The service was ok.  They were prompt with pouring wine but they didn't give an extra utensils to share the dishes (and I find it a little off putting when people are using the same fork to grab the food and sauces that they are putting in their mouth).  This was inconsistent with the posh atmosphere.  They also had to be prompted to explain which was the lamb, the chicken, the vegetarian dish etc and they seemed anxious to drop the dishes and jump away.  The food was good.  Not excellent.  Not a lot heat to any dish.  Small portions.  Admittedly my expectations must have been too high.  They weren't met.  I have much better Indian.",-1
2,"Not for Indian people.
This restaurant is catered to the ambiance and foreigners wanting chic Indian. There were only 2 items for vegetarians??? That makes no sense.  However the paneer makani was awesome so if the chef decided to put the 1 thing he did know how to cook this would be it!  Also this one is super pricey. Expect to pay $80 USD of 45 gbp a person for just 1 item ....and the naan, rice etc. is all extra charges.",-1
5,"I came here for the beautiful dining room, left was thoroughly impressed by the whole dining experience. The conservatory here is known as one of the most beautiful and romantic dining rooms in London, with delicate flowers and lights strewn in a canopy below a skylight, a nice fireplace, and a number of very well placed mirrors to make the place look much bigger than it is. I was surprised to find that there are only 7 tables in the room, which explains why you have to book 6 months in advance! Most tables were occupied by parties of 2 (lots of couples), but two in the corners were larger and seated groups of 3 or 4. There is an awkward table in the middle that ends up being watched by the groups of two, so try to avoid that one if you can! We saw a couple sit there and then were re-seated just a few minutes later (presumably they asked to be moved). We ordered from the rather affordable seasonal set menu (5 courses for £65) and opted for the wine pairing, which is £40 per person. The food was excellent and the wine pairing phenomenal, with unique wines like whites from Santa Barbara and a red dessert wine. They even accepted my substitution request without question when I wanted a dish from the vegetarian set menu instead of one of ones from the main set menu. Service was very quick and we didn't have to wait long for any dish, and the sommelier always just behind, ready with an explanation of why the wine was chosen for the pairing. In all, we finished 5 courses in less than 2 hours (that's my kind of fine dining!) I would recommend this for couples or special occasions, it's just such an incredible place and one of those quintessential London classics. But book ahead for the conservatory! Definitely worth the wait!",1
2,"The food here is amazing but we were clearly punished by our service staff for having booked for eight people when only five turned up. They virtually neglected our table despite having purchased large dinners, sides, appetizers, and bottles of wine. It was nearly embarrassing to see our waiter make numerous stops at every other table even when it was clear nothing was needed while neglecting ours.  To make matters worse on the odd occasion he did stop he would apologize but gave no reason for his tardiness. So enjoy the food but be warned the staff behaves like they are above you.",-1
1,Good food but very spicy and it is premade and they cannot alter anything on the menu to decrease the level of heat/ spice.  One of the people in our party never got her main entree.  They never brought it,-1
2,"Go for the sesame soft ice cream.  That's the only thing on the menu worth eating.  Stay AWAY from the ramen.
Seriously, I think London sometimes deserves its reputation for bad food.  If Londoners can't discern between good or bad ramen, what can I say?
Seeing the 4* reviews here, I had high expectations for this place.  The queue wsa about 30 mins long, on a Tuesday night.  We went for the 20-hour broth, of course.  It was insipid and bland.
Service was horrible, as well - our waiter basically ignored us for 20 mins before we could place our order, or grab our cheque.  Small wonder that there are such long queues for this place..",-1
5,"Great Ramen house in the heart of SOHO. Very close to the gay district and in walking distance to the shopping areas. When we arrived a line was forming out the door. Waited for about 15-20 minutes before being seated. I don't think they take reservations at this location and from the looks of the que, seems like a local favorite. 
Of course I ordered the Miso Ramen. It was actually quite different from what i'm use too. The soup base almost reminded me of a tex-mex kind of fusion with the traditional miso ramen. It was different but delicious! Ramen noodles cooked perfectly, and pork was cooked just enough to keep a firm texture. Waiters were very friendly and understood people were waiting long for food so extra smiles and attention was given. Would definitely recommend this location for tasty Ramen. Tuna tartar was amazing as well! Freshly prepared and uniquely set for a fun and memorable experience.",1
2,"Tucked away from the chaos of Covent Garden we stepped into the hedge maze from the Shining for what would end up being an odd experience. I have never seen a bigger drop off from back of house to front, but that is just what we got. Even though we booked at least one month out, we were seated at the first table in the bar. We asked about being seated elsewhere, and were told that we had not requested the dining room and this would be our table. Next time I guess I'll inform them of my desire to eat when placing my dinner reservation. This set the tone for the pretentious service we would have all night. The large table next to us was halfway through the meal and the staff still managed to spill three times on them. I think the only ""apology"" one poor guy who had coffee spilled all over his suit received was a napkin. Staff was not too helpful with selections and every interaction was curt, if even a word said. We heard tables ask about the need for side dishes.  The staff did not really respond, instead they just placed an order for more food. The entrees are huge and the sides largely untouched. 
Thankfully, that moves us on to the food which was fantastic. We started with grilled scallops served on mashed potatoes. 
Entrees were a dry aged Scottish ribeye, gratin potatoes and haricot verts. It was served a bit undercooked when the knife finally arrived for me. It was a large cut and a sizable portion compared to many taster sizes at similar restaurants. 
We finished with a very tasty lemon meringue before waiting a long time on our bill. A fitting conclusion to two ends of the spectrum between very high quality food and terrible service.",-1
5,"Delicious ramen! Coming from New York where there is already a big ramen culture, Bone Daddies has my stamp of approval. The broth is not as salty as a lot of places. I love the little details where they offer ladies' hair ties for practical ramen slurping! Yuuuuum!! It can be crowded during rush hours.",1
2,"Disappointing.
Went here for a work dinner, so while I did not have to pay, I will still disappointed.  
I'm always cautious of Japanese restaurants where there are no Japanese patrons. I was here for dinner on a Monday night and did not see a salary-man in sight.
Do not get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the food. There was nothing great about the food either.  When you're hawking a 100 pound omakase, I expect to be impressed. I think Nobu was one of the trendsetters for what we now see as the typical western Japanese restaurant. That's exactly how it felt. Like every Japanese restaurant from the 90's.  
I love gindara miso to death, but the Nobu version was not any better than the 100 imitation restaurants. I would not return unless I absolutely had to. There are other better overpriced Japanese restaurants.",-1
3,"The food was good and the ambiance was decent, definitely a restaurant to see and been seen.  The sushi was good but I'm from the Seattle where the sushi is much better, fresher and more reasonably price (even at the high end sushi restaurants)
The service was decent, the waiter kept forgetting our order or giving it to the table next to us.  
If you're interested in hanging out with the young, rich and fabulous of London, I definitely recommend a visit.  If you're on a budget, I would pass.",-1
1,"A complete waste of time. After a confirmation call from the restaurant the night before,asking our table preference, special occasion etc., the hostess managed to not only treat us with utter disrespect but would not seat us until we PROVED we had a reservation here. All this on my birthday! We did manage to find an email, but needless to say we were in no mood to eat here after all the unnecessary drama and went elsewhere. There are so many evening dim sum joints in Soho alone, so skip this pricy snooty place.",-1
1,"We went to a few Ping Pong, non of them have good service. this place is disgrace. why do we want to pay to get such awful service when the food is not that particular good??!!! the host of this place should be fired, or maybe the manager, if they don't understand the value of customer, or if they don't want to serve, why are they there? I know some restaurants just happen to have big investment behind, so they afford to have best locations, no matter what they serve, or how bad is the service, people just flood in.. unless you have no place to eat, otherwise, don't bother. go to Ping Pong, just waste your money! go to china town, you can get better dimsum and better service!",-1
2,"I just had dinner with the family here at the Four Seasons for Mother's Day. So first of all, I want to apologize to my mom for taking her here. Our dishes were extremely greasy and salty. I understand that a little use of oil prevents stickiness in the pan but when the vegetable dish is greasier than the meat dish then there's a problem. The couple things that were passable was the steam rice and BBQ pork. The chow fun was drenched with a very salty gravy. I think my doctor would recommend me to stop dining here. 
Also the men's toilet is the smallest one I've been to. How small is it? Imagine sharing an airplane bathroom with another person. I swear while I was peeing I was rubbing shoulders with the man in the next stall and rubbing cheeks with another man washing his hands. Intimacy is good sometimes but not in the toilet. 
After the meal there is complimentary orange slices and mint for your stinky breath. They also add a 12% service charge to your bill.",-1
5,Perfect. I was having a bad night and this still ranks amongst the best meals I've ever had. I wish I could eat there every night.,1
3,"Before bentos, katsus, sushi and noodles became ubiquitous in London thanks to the like of Japanese Canteen, Wagamama and Wasabi, there was Tokyo Diner. 
Tucked away in a corner in Chinatown, Tokyo Diner is an authentic Japanese-run restaurant serving unadulterated and homely staples of modern Japanese cuisine including katsu curries, udon noodles, donburi, sushi and bentos. The menu and dishes are straight forward, but the quality here is far superior to that of the aforementioned chains. You will actually see Japanese people eating here, which is always a good sign, as are the tight crowds during the evening rush. 
The food quality here is superior to that which I've seen at 99% of the 'Japanese' diners in London though this is in part reflected in the prices. You can get away with spending under 10 pounds but I often find myself going closer to 15. 
I love the Japanese touches which make the dining experience here particularly welcome and authentic. There is no tipping or automatic service charge, you can request a complimentary large-sized portion of rice if you're extra hungry and the nifty automatic door which is cleverly disguised to look rather old and run down is a nice trick too.",-1
4,"After spending 6 months living in India, it takes something a little bit special for me to make a British curry house a regular haunt of mine. 
I can say that whilst the décor and western style atmosphere is as far removed from India as Columbus thinking he'd arrived there when he's actually discovered the Americas, Dishoom get it right when it comes to the authentic taste of India: spice blends that are unique and exciting; fresh simple, top quality ingredients and menu items that you wouldn't usually get from the generic high street British Indian restaurant. 
My top tips for dining at Dishoom are:
Breakfast - it's all about the Bacon naan (yes, I did say Bacon naan) with their homemade masala chai - the perfect way to start any weekend breakfast/brunch (although they do serve breakfast 7 days a week) 
Dinner - The Roomali Roti's are amazing and the perfect accompaniment to a Mahi Tikka (Fish curry) and Mattar Paneer (Indian cottage cheese and peas) 
Beer - make sure you try their special Dishoom Pale ale which is brewed in collaboration with Beavertown brewery; it's less gassy and suits the blends of the spices much better than Kingfisher.",1
4,"Yup yup, this place is all sorts of solid and delish, but four stars is generous. I'd say 3.5
Went on Saturday night despite the suicide-inducing 110 minutes of estimated waiting time, and spent the majority of it nibbling on some fabulously juicy prawns, some calamari and lamb samosas (all three very good) and a shitload of alcohol, because how else are you going to deal with life. 
When we were finally seated, our waitress was knowledgeable - which to me is always a plus, cause my knowledge of Indian food is relative- and ended up ordering half the menu, including their special lamb shank ( Lamb Raan) and a boatload of cheese naan and yogurt and chicken and veggies and, yeah. I had to tell my trainer I was significantly over my macros for the evening and he was not a happy bunny. 
Now, as a proper food snob, I'll say this: this place has some fantastic pieces: best of the night was the naan and the chocolate and salt mousse, but the rest was ""just good"". I mean, the lamb raan was a tad salty, and we got a veggie concoction called Pau Baji which was really not great. The chicken was good, but I dont need to be going out to a restaurant to have ""just good""
Will I go back? Potentially, also cause there's a hotel bar nearby that had the HOTTEST single guys I've ever seen all in one place in London, so there you go.",1
2,"Horrible. This place disappoints big time. I've been to the Nobu in NYC and while it's not stellar there either, this place is 10x worse. Hard rice sushi, doesn't taste fresh, mini sashimi taco shells are completely stale and overwhelms the fish. You take one bite and everything falls apart and onto your plate. Sigh. Menu is a little boring and not the most inventive. I wanted to order uni/sea urchin, didn't have it that night. I wanted to order the watercress salad, didn't have that either. =/
If you're going to spend this much money on food and a sexy atmosphere, go to Hakkansan instead. I first went there when I was living in London years ago and I still prefer it over Nobu.",-1
1,"Not remotely worth £20.
If you advertise yourself as The Place to Go for steak frites, you had better be good. First the good things: the ambiance was noisy and convivial, the salad was excellent and the frites were spot on.
The steak, however, came in a roughly 6 ounce serving, drowned in a pleasant but nondescript green sauce. The meat under the sauce could just as easily have been mushrooms chicken or tofu. 
There were seconds, which brought the total steak serving up to around 9 ounces.
So  £20 seems to me a lot to pay for a salad and frites, however good. Seldom has this happened, but I really felt ripped off.
Go get a steak frites at your local, you will almost certainly get better quality at a better price.",-1
5,"My favorite dim sum in town! They have great deals and set menus :) the drinks are awesome and really refreshing, the ginger and lime tea is delicious! 
the place is also nice and after you fill yourself with food theres nothing better than go for a little walk around the river and appreciate the view while you digest all that amazing food !",1
4,"I am comparing this against probably the best dim sum joint in London.  Honestly, I have to say there is only Hakkasan Hanway Place which does the best in London.  This is the sister company.  It doesn't have that cool, dark, chic vibe like Hakkasan but the food is comparable.  If I have to say which is better, then of course, Hakkasan is a tad better.  The service here is really good and staff as attentive.  They have no attitude issues like some Chinese restaurant and are really professional.  Try to book in advance but if you come here on a Sunday afternoon dim sum time, then be prepared to wait.  That's when the Chinese family have their big outing and eating dim sum.  We had an issue with our last order and it came really late.  We decided to cancel and the manager was quick to come and apologise.  They even gave us free dessert each so we were happy for this.  This is what you call professional.  If you go to some other restaurants, they apologise and bring the food out late right when you are cancelling it and you are forced to eat them or take them home.  However, the one star is omitted due to Hakkasan performing slightly better.  That said, it is still probably one of the best dim sum in London so I would not miss giving this place a try at all.  Must go in London.",1
2,"We walked in the establishment and were directed upstairs. We were a party of four. Coming from the west, we wanted more of the traditional dishes we were used to. We ordered starters and the RUDE staff did not want to let us keep the menu to order entrees. We did not feel welcomed and were under the impression that they wanted us to get the f%^*+ out. ALL of the staff was rude. Very very difficult and did not want to try and meet our needs. 
However the food was very tasty and the Singapore noodles were great.
The stars are solely for the taste of the food. This restaurant could easily be a 5 star place if the staff would change their attitudes. 
Average priced. 
Very old fashioned decorations. 
Bathrooms were somewhat clean.",-1
4,"* SPICY MISO RAMEN - I have abandoned the theory that the fairest way to judge the restaurant was to order the basic. What can I say, I like spicy! 
Let's break it down:
o Noodle - Normal portions, nothing to note here. Of course, noodles are my favourite part, so I think they could be a bit more generous with the noodles. 
o Broth - Best part! The spicy miso really takes the ramen broth over the top. 
o Pork - Not much to note here, mostly because the meat portion was a bit skimpy. What was given was delicious.   
o The egg -  Finally, a place that acknowledges the importance of the egg and keeps  it as a standard component in the ramen. Well done! I forgive you for the light meat portions. 
o Overall - Super delicious.  
The menu had a wide selection ramen flavours and sashimi as well. There is definitely more exploring on this menu to be done!",1
2,"The dim sum here is average. I love dim sum but their dim sum only looks nice in presentation and is rather commercial. Nothing about the taste really stood out and it was quite plain. The table service here was alright. Although one guy in particular could have provided a better service, because they did a mistake with the menu which caused us paying for something that wasn't worth it. If taken the price into consideration, I'd say a definite no. 
So briefly, food average, service average, price not justified. 
It's not a horrible place, but also has nothing I can recall that would make me want to come back.",-1
3,"We didn't love this.  The space was a bit overwhelming, the food was OK, and the drinks were too sweet.  It seemed like a restaurant that received way too much hype and couldn't maintain their quality.  The service was also just bad; our waitress basically ignored us and we didn't receive our bill until almost an hour after requesting it.  The only standout item was the ruby chicken, but I would go to a traditional Indian restaurant for everything else.",-1
1,"I was sorely disappointed by my visit here... If you read my review of the Covent Garden branch you'll see I like the place and perhaps I had high hopes but the only redeeming feature of the shoreditch branch is the gorgeous waiting staff... The food was bad. Flavourless drivel that I didn't even want to finish. I tried a number of dishes collectively with my friends but none of the were notable for anything but how bad they were. I won't be coming here again, which is a shame really as it reflects badly on the other place. If you want the nice atmosphere go to Covent Garden. If you want a better curry than this one, you can get one in the cold food aisle of your nearest Tesco.",-1
4,"Stopped in here an hour before closing on a Friday. The place was packed but we were greeted quickly and we grabbed a beer at the (tiny) bar while we waited. We were seated on two stools in the back  corner--definitely a tight squeeze so if you're not a fan of bar seating or close quarters, this isn't the place for you. I opted for the late night  special--a signature drink, pork bun and curry ramen for £15. We also tried the soft shell crab appetizer and the pork ramen. The signature drink was tasty but unmemorable. In a joint where cocktails can run you £9, I wasn't complaining in the slightest. 
The pork bun was delish! The bun was soft and fluffy and folded over pork, fresh cucumber and hot pepper. The ginger sauce that accompanied the soft shell crab was superb. 
As for the ramen, both broths were delicious but the curry stole the show for me. It came with small pieces of fried chicken, roasted hot peppers and cabbage. The broth was very rich and flavorful. The pork in the pork ramen was sliced thin and flavorful and the broth was light and...well porky. It also came with an egg which always adds some welcome richness. 
A nice touch was that they provide both plastic bibs for slurping splash and hair ties to pull your hair back! I thought these were some thoughtful details. 
Service was great despite being packed, food was delicious--this spot gets my vote!",1
5,"Amazing restaurant in a buzzing location. Quick, delicious and hot food was exactly what I wanted and so I received just that. Waiters are a tad rude but the food is excellent. Be prepared to sit on a table with strangers but overall, you wont be disappointed especially not at the cheap prices.",1
3,"With all the great dim sum options in London, not sure how this restaurant thrives.  The dim sum overall is mediocre and the service is snotty.  If it was in Lexington, Kentucky, I could see the novelty but with the great options in Chinatown (and others) I would not return.
Went with a friend and we tried multiple dim sum.  None were bad and some were pretty good:
--  Duck bao.  One of the more disappointing.  The duck was smoked and I prefer roasted while the sauce was somewhat thin.  It was a nice sized portion, though.
--  Duck spring roll, good but not great.
--  Prawn toast with sesame seeds, one of the best options.  Tasty, a lot of prawn, not much filler.
--  Spinach and mushroom dumpling.  A surprise success, especially as I normally don't care of mushroom.  Very tasty, fried but not greasy.
--  Honey soy chicken wings.  Looked and sounded good, meaty wings, not much flavour
--  Char siu bun, a standard but well prepared and tasty, good balance of filling and bun
--  Prawn and chive dumpling, good but not great
--  Black prawn dumpling, most interesting and innovative dish, good flavor
--  crab and prawn dumpling, good but not incredible
I also didn't like the service.  Empty restaurant but they could not put us in any of the tables we wanted.  Ended up eating outside, which was great, but they were really kind of jerks about finding us a table.  Overall, a competent meal but not worth the opportunity cost.",-1
4,"I was in London for a few days and my coworker had recommended coming here, so we went for dinner. I probably wouldn't have found it if I were just wandering around.
My coworker had ordered the Padron Peppers for appetizer, which she shared. The peppers aren't spicy, but were flavorful. I think I ate quite a few.
I think I ordered the Garlic Tantamen ramen. There was so much meat in it! I thought it was a little too oily for my liking. The oily broth was a little too rich. Otherwise, the broth was good.
The server we had needed deodorant. That was the only other turn-off about this place.",1
3,"We did quite a bit of research and wanted to go to an Indian restaurant with some history in London. This certainly fit the bill. It also recently received a Michelin star. Coming from a place in the US that is chock full of good Indian options (SE Michigan), I had high hopes for the city that my British friends claim is the ""best place for Indian in the world"". The place is very classy, with a nice address in Piccadilly Circus. The interior decor is rich with hints of Indian accents. We ordered a number of items from the menu including the mango avocado salad, the crab ginger soup, the vegetarian platter, and the shrimp curry. I asked if they had paratha, which they did not. Fine, we'll have the roti. The roti featured exactly one piece for 5 pounds. I thought we'd have at least two pieces for that price! Our appetizers were good, but the crab was non-existant in the crab ginger soup. It was mostly just ginger soup with a few tiny scraps of crab meat. The veggie appetizer came in bowls that yielded a spoonful or two of food. The spinach ball dish in the platter with almond dressing was most interesting, but gone in two bites. The shrimp curry was fine, but nothing memorable. At the end, with no alcohol, our tab for two was 125 pounds. I could eat for a week of Indian food for that. Had it been great, I would have been able to justify the price. But the miserly portions, unremarkable dishes, combined with the long wait between the appetizer and mains, makes this s a first and last visit for us.",-1
1,"Once upon a time, this is a chinese restaurant famous for its poor (somewhat rude) service. After 10 years, I returned to this restaurant again, hoping to check out if the service and food quality has improved. I wasnt disappointed as the poor and rude service remain and the food is only average. Not my choice of restaurant and I would certainly not bring any friends there.",-1
3,"There are pictures of naked ladies all around the restaurant, so I do not recommend bringing your adolescent son here for a meal with his school mates.
The menu is reasonably priced and the wines are, too. There are two levels and the bathroom is so small that it made me have panic attacks. Not really. I'm a man, I can handle that kind of stuff.
But seriously, the sink was so tiny if my hands had a nervous system, they would have panic attacks. Not really. They are a man's hands. Don't get it twisted.",-1
5,"Ah-maze-ing... Great atmosphere. Great food. Also, lots of dairy free options in case those you're dining with are lactose intolerant. Do it. Eat it. Now.",1
1,"If I have to be honest, I have traveled extensively and you certainly get the feeling here that if your not a famous face your not worth much. We had a meeting in the less that par conference room and we're constantly harassed by the staff after hours as to wether or not we were staying at the hotel or not. For the over all price I do not see the value",-1
5,"Fantastic ramen. I'm far from the first person to figure out Bone Daddies knows what's up, but I've now been twice, and each time I've been impressed. I decided to try to curry ramen with fried chicken - amazing. They had some appetizers that looked delicious as well, but with a big bowl of ramen, your stomach will be full, so one course is really all you need, unless you have a few people to share something with. 
We got there at 7:30pm (on a Monday) and probably waited 15 minutes to get seated. Once in our seats, we didn't have to wait long to order though, and the food came pretty promptly. I'm excited to try some other ramen places in London, but Bone Daddies did a pretty good job of setting the bar. We'll see if anything else comes close.",1
3,"Nobu has always been on my to try list. However, as London has so many restaurants, I finally got around to it on an opentable deal (4 courses for 49 pounds). I was excited to finally go. Then I went to the wrong Nobu. I went to the flagship store on Berkley Street only to realized that my deal was at a different location on Park Lane. When I finally arrived at the restaurant, I was disappointed, as it looked quite plain and we even only had those one time use chopsticks. 
I ignored it all, as I was anticipating a great meal. Then it turned out to be a very OK experience. The four course we had were sashimi starter, assortment of sushi, tempura and then chicken with Teriyaki Sauce. I was expecting a lot more from Nobu, or at least a little twist or something different. If these were the dishes I want to eat, I would have gone to a local Japanese restaurant. I felt it was totally pedestrian. I understand that usually restaurants don't tend to put their best dishes in set menu deals, but come one, maybe just one awesome dish to make me want to come back and try the regular menu. Now, I have totally no desire of returning.",-1
4,Good basic food. SUPER cheap especially for a visiting American stressing about how bad the pound conversion is. Horrible service -- but when it that cheap does it matter? Awkward seating...,1
5,"I went here in the summer two years ago. The only restaurant in London that I will always remember - best ambiance I've ever seen, very romantic. Food is awesome - from starter to entry, from drinks to dessert. Just love everything~",1
5,"Just delicious!
One of my top 3 dim sum restaurants in town. If I could I would eat everything that is on their menu card. 
The interieur is well decorated, the staff is very helpful and gives you great recommendations as well.
All in all, expensive but tasty & delicious",1
3,"of course the food is great - however, I have had food just as great for a third of the price. I was really looking forward to my meal and had high expectations. and although I enjoyed my meal - I couldnt help thinking of all of the things I could have spent that money on and still had a great meal - the decor is nothing special and the wait staff quite rushed. 
In summary: Great food, over priced in mediocre surroundings.",-1
2,Their edamame truffle dim sum is probably the worst thing I've ever tasted. Wayyy too much garlic! Also the service was really slow and they took like 45 mins to bring some of our food. Vegetable dumplings were good so at least they didn't mess up everything. Bathroom doors are heavy and the handles hurt your hand when you use them. Very aesthetic but the food wasn't good and service was terrible. Not coming back.,-1
3,"Food was alright, nothing to brag about.  Portions are very small in comparison to the prices.",-1
4,"After a few or more sticky sweet drinks in Soho I love stumbling down to Wong Kei, not only to snicker at the name, but to devour their fast, hot and dazzling dishes.
The service here is brisk if not quite rude but none of the patrons seem to mind as they are more concerned about what they will soon be shoveling into their pieholes and when the tube will shut.
I always get the crispy duck which they somehow manage to bring out in whole pieces and in record time, armed with only spoons, they've managed to reduce to a beautiful pile of scrumptious duck.  
Whenever I go with friends we order as a table so we can take a bit from each others plates but staples definately include crispy duck and pancakes, singapore noodles, spring rolls, and chicken balls.
My only real complaint is that I always have to run out to get cash to pay!",1
5,Unbelievable! Best Indian food I've ever had. So many great options and very cool atmosphere. Had a bit of a wait but was totally worth it! Still dreaming of the meal and it's been almost 3 weeks since my visit.,1
4,"Ate here on a business trip with about 10 colleagues. We had reservations - and they were needed with the line out the door on a Wednesday night. Place was packed. I am not an Indian food expert but everything we had was pretty damn good. My favorites were the shrimp, and the lentils. We took a while to decide but the food came out quickly and in rapid waves. The food was gone almost as fast. Well worth a visit.",1
3,"After reading all the great reviews about this restaurant we decided to give it a go recently. Overall an ok experience, but nothing really that stood out, hence we probably won't be going back.
So to the details... As we arrived we were seated downstairs and the whole area smells of a cellar or a damp basement, which isn't very pleasant but you quickly get used to it. One of the reviewers mentioned images of 'naked ladies' plastering the walls, which we've seen none of - a bit disappointing:)
The service was very friendly and attentive, but the food took forever to arrive, so make sure that you allocate plenty of time if you decide to visit. We ordered a french wine (unfortunately I don't remember the name of it), which was recommended as 'owners favourite' and it was in fact quite nice and affordable.
The dishes are quite big, so even the most demanding stomachs shouldn't be left disappointed, while those with smaller tummies make sure to NOT eat the bread that's brought in at the start, I know it's fresh, with a crunchy crust and tasty, but otherwise you won't be able to finish your dishes:) 
I had lamb following recommendations of numerous reviewers and my wife had duck. Both dishes were quite nice, but they were very much like home-cooked food I haven't felt anything exquisite about them.
So to sum up, the service is great, food takes a while to arrive, the dishes are more like home-cooked rather than French exquisite cuisine.",-1
5,"Hakkasan makes Chinese food fashionable. With its sexy black decor and amazing food and cocktails this is a place to take people to impress or be impressed. The food is genuinely very good, I would go so far to say the best Chinese in London. The atmosphere is buzzy and lots of fun as well for a group night out. It doesn't come cheaply, but hey you are in London",1
3,"Ordered the Raj Kachori, papadam, duck curry, prawn curry, veggie main course platter (daal, Gobi aaloo, kofta, and paneer). Malbec wine and amazingggggg mirchi martini -- nothing worth recommending other than yup - you guessed it - the mirchi martini :)",-1
4,"I've been wanting to go to Bone Daddies for ages and finally got to go! I have to say I was not disappointed. It definitely lived up to my expectations!
We got a window seat so that was really nice. I had the mushroom ramen and it was amazing, SO tasty. I mashed one of the garlic cloves available on the tables which made the broth even tastier.
The atmosphere was buzzing and it was quite busy but we always felt looked after.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Already looking forward to going back!",1
3,"Another Thursday, another Chinese in 25 minutes review.  My rice with bbq duck and roast pork was delicious with about a 5 inch strip of each pork and veggie.  It came with a larger than normal portion of gratuitous chinese cabbage (i.e. more than 1 leaf).  As others have said, the soy gravy that comes with it is quite sweet, but I like it that way.
They were nice people there, with 3 types of chillies and gave me soured plum sauce immediately when I requested it.
The bad thing was they dumped some oranges on my table before I finished the plate and then dumped the check on the table whiles I was finishing the orange.  They took the bill away the second I reached for the mint and my hand left the bill container thingy.  Although I get that it is busy, I didn't appreciate being literally swept out of the restaurant.  I must say, it was probably them more than me who kept the meal to the 25 minutes limit.
Food:  Solid 4.5 stars.  Service: (minus 1 star) = 3.5 stars.",-1
3,"Hmmm... well there were certainly loads of pros to Dishoom, mainly the delicious, spicy, fresh, and utterly fantastic food. But outside of the steaming hot plates of goodness that came quickly and seemingly endlessly, I wasn't overly impressed. 
Sure, with a sterile atmosphere like this you have the benefit of not reeking of curry when you leave. Your eyes won't burn, you won't be pushed around by storm trooper servers, and you won't feel rushed out of your seat by the next group of people who have been standing over you drooling for over an hour... (You *know* who I'm talking about.) Consequently though, you'll feel like you're eating Indian food in veritable Cheesecake Factory atmosphere. The whole urban industrial feel just didn't correspond with the cuisine.
The service also seemed a bit off. Our group of 12 was split over two four-person booths, as apparently they don't take bookings. (In fact, we were probably lucky to get a table for all of us, full stop.) Our table never received water though we asked multiple times. A few lassies went missing. Though we ordered two of everything, the orders seemed to be confused over the two tables. 
I can't fault the delicious food -- it really was stunning. But the rest of the experience didn't dishoooooom me away.",-1
4,"Really good food very tasty and the service is amazing! I went there with an amazing yelp friend and we had a great time in there, I'll go back to try more and try to get the ""garden""seat they look fantastic!",1
3,"Contrary to what the endless queues outside this place would have you believe, this place is ordinary and far from extraordinary. I think this restaurant is so overrated. Not because it's bad, but because it tastes pretty much like any other fairly good Indian restaurant but with slightly bumped up prices and long lines outside. 
I didn't find that this restaurant offered anything particularly spectacular or different, which makes me wonder why it has become such a sought-after restaurant. The service is fine, the food is fine, the decor is fine, but that's just it, fine.",-1
4,"So having waited quite a bit outside, then at the bar, we finally were seated. 
The cocktails at the bar were a great appetizer and I was really surprised at them despite their pretentious names and descriptions.
The style is Bombay so lots of small dishes to share. It was like no other Indian I've ever tasted. 
The lamb shoulder fell off the bone and yes, I'm still dreaming about it. The cheesy naan was succulent. I came away full but not bursting and super satisfied...yummmm!",1
3,"The selection of restaurants on the Southbank isn't plentiful - especially when you don't count the markets. Ping Pong is one of the few that I've come to quite a few times because of its relatively speedy service and relatively tasty dim sum. Not the best by far, and definitely not the cheapest. But if you by from the set menu, then you get a decent amount of food for a decent price. Cocktails are sweet, service is friendly. I'll probably end up here again, but I don't purposely seek it out. A solid 3 stars from me.",-1
5,"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars instead of 5, because I despise crowded places, stools, small table space and queues, and this Bone Daddies has all of the above. 
That said, as soon as I've put food in my mouth I went to ramen heaven and back, and as my friend pointed out, I didn't say a word for 20 minutes. 
I've ordered the Tonkatsu (Tonkotsu? Tonk...whatever) ramen, and added the cock scratching because in all the pictures I saw of ramen from Bone Daddies I could spot these crispy bits on top and really wanted to know what they were and try them. 
OH. MY. SWEET. BABY. DAY. IN. THE. LIFE. 
Can I just go back there RIGHT NOW?
The 20h pork broth was so rich and creamy, it would have been delicious on its own. Like, even without the perfectly sliced thin pork, the flavourful noodles, the hard-boiled eggs that kept a soft but not runny yolk, the soy sauce on the one side of the bowl, the spring onions, and all the other bits, including the scratching. Which were out of this world delicious. 
I would love to say something more about the place itself, the hairband and bib they provide for mess-free experience, the atmosphere, etc. But I have a parade of ramen soups dancing in front of my eyes and can't think of anything else but going back there asap. 
So if you're anything like me (i.e. a fussy introverted mess) you'll want to run away when you see the crowd, PLEASE BE PATIENT BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT. I promise. 
(Ps. Thank you Charlotte K. for being to me that one friend to take me here, as someone else did with you years ago. Let's keep the tradition going eh?)",1
1,"Yuck. Ordered 4 rolls. None of them tasty. Fish wasn't particularly flavorful, too much sauce on top of rolls that had it, and 3 of the 4 were mostly rice. No refills on the green tea, and no sight of these rice cakes everyone is talking about. No low-sodium soy sauce. No WiFi. Edamame was fresh, crisp, yummy. Miso soup was also good. We ordered an extra edamame, ate the centers of our rolls and left hungry. Boo",-1
3,"Food was ok (not as good as some places I've been but not as bad as some others!) - the prawn toast didn't have very much prawn on it and was more sesame toast than anything else.
 There were no kerfuffles during our visit, the food was simple and quick, but wasn't of the most amazing quailty. Still, you get what you pay for!
 Converse to some opinions, the waiters were actually quite nice to us. It must have been pay-day!",-1
5,"We had to come back here for a 2nd time during our vacation in London. For the 1st time, I made reservations about 3 weeks early for our anniversary. I was hoping to sit in the Conservatory, but when I asked about it when we came in they said they were booked until December! That's 3 months!
So we were seated upstairs in an intimate room & had the seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing. I choose the vegetarian tasting menu & who knew vegetables could taste so good!! It really showed that the simplest dishes could still taste amazing & didn't need to sacrifice flavor! 
FOOD & DRINK HIGHLIGHTS
-Chargrilled Green Asparagus: Really asparagus? This was the best asparagus I've ever had.  I didn't expect too much from it by just looking at it, but it was SO DELICIOUS! My husband doesn't like asparagus & he thought it was amazing too. 
-Papardella with Truffle & Mushrooms: This dish was so decadent. Instead of adding freshly grated parmesan on top, they put freshly grated truffle on top! What?! & they add a good layer on top.
-Iced Green Apple Parfait: Wow. This was the perfect fall dessert. 
-Shetland Isles Mussel & Saffron Soup: I was obsessed with the mussels in London & I love saffron so I thought this was going to be really good & it was! 
Everything we had was amazing & the wine pairing was PERFECT! I discovered a new favorite wine of mine, Foradori Fontanasanta Nosiola. 
CONSERVATORY vs SITTING UPSTAIRS
First time when we were seated upstairs, it felt more intimate & service was very attentive. The team worked well with one another & everything flowed. There was never a time our water wasn't filled & they were ready for our next course when we were. It gave us a better chance to enjoy the food & the entire experience. The 2nd time we asked a couple days early if we could make a reservation & a reservation was just cancelled. We were so lucky that we got the middle table in the Conservatory! In the Conservatory, the team seemed a little more flustered possibly because the Conservatory & downstairs area is larger. The Conservatory was really beautiful & romantic!! Both experiences/rooms felt different, but we enjoyed Clos Maggiore very much. If only this place wasn't thousands of miles away from home!",1
4,"A true classic. Busy busy , authentic cooking. Great ambience, very much at the heart of a Chinatown experience. Have been here since 1987 at regular intervals.",1
1,"NOT FOR WESTERNERS!!! Felt unwelcome. On New Years Day, the waiter wanted us to leave our stuff on the dirty floor. We said the floor is dirty. He told us to go eat elsewhere. Bad service. Horrible. Jan 1, 2016 at 17:00.",-1
3,"Excellent tempura and black bean Dover sole
Food was good but Service was not very good
Sushi came out incorrect but they fixed it
One meal came out more than five minutes after the other two meals",-1
3,"I wanted to love Dishoom so badly but it just let me down. I'd heard rave reviews from friends about how 'different' and delicious their brunch was, but what I got was glorified cheese on toast with very little chilli. It was lacking flavour and not particularly inventive (or well executed).
My companions both had the omelettes which were also left lacking. After waiting 40 minutes for a table it was just a bit meh. The service was pretty good but couldn't make up for  the dreary food.
Maybe save this one for dinner.",-1
3,"varunmurali.com/blog/dis…
Irani cafes have this inexplicable homely feeling about them. I absolutely love going to Kyaani with my brother back in Bombay. At Kyaani you have to get the buttery bun maska, spicy and juicy chicken farcha with the delicious gravy poured all over it, and of course the timeless salli boti.
I've actually never been to an Irani cafe outside of Bombay even within India. So when I head about Dishoom a couple weeks ago I was stoked! So many people recommended it to me so there was little chance I would skip visiting this homage to Bombay's Irani cafes.
I really wanted to love Dishoom, but unfortunately I felt a little let down. Though the menu was stacked with favorites of Indian cuisine, I saw few traditional Parsi dishes on it. They did have bun maska (though not for lunch) and keema pav and a few other classics.
Dishes
The keema pav was pretty delicious. Spicy and authentic. Complemented the hot buttered pav really well. I would have been content to stop right there given how filling and value for money that single dish was.
My friend who I was eating with vouched for the okra fries. He was not wrong. They were super tangy and chatpata. Fried well and not oily at all.
My friend ordered the pav bhaji. Not a fan. The bhaji was waaaaay too smooth. I strongly believe you should be able to actually tell what you're eating in a pav bhaji. You need different textures to come through. The bhaji also tasted almost too creamy. It felt more like a paneer makhani sauce than bhaji.
   
 The chicken biryani was the biggest let down. Mild, bland, uninspired. The chicken was tender I'll give it that. Not much else going on with the dish. It was just mushy and the rice was over cooked.
You can't keep me away from black dal. The menu featured it as one of their best items so we ordered it. Good, not great. Could definitely use a bit more flavor but the expected creaminess was there for sure.
Oh and the rose lassis were pretty great!
Would I come back?
I think I would maybe once a month or so, but I would definitely stick to the smaller dishes and appetizers. Unless someone else at the table orders a main course that tastes good that is!
I think the small plates are super value for money. They get you pretty full and taste great. Definitely worth checking out!",-1
5,Shares a selection of dishes amongst friends and had an all round great experience. The food was a+ and the service was great. Would highly recommend the okra fries.,1
3,"Come here for the atmosphere, the drinks, the cheer. The music is authentic too. All staff and management are extremely nice. The Indian food is all right. However, If you're vegan avoid this establishment. There is a pdf menu online. Check it out.  Prices are reasonable.",-1
4,"Super yummy tonkatsu broth and cha siu.  We found this place on yelp and arrived at 9 pm.  The place was busy, loud more like a pub. We are the only ones with little kids and its not kids friendly.  The table was counter height and chairs.  However my husband ordered tonkatsu ramen and I ordered spicy miso ramen.  Spicy miso is too salty and not as good.  But tonkatsu is out of this world, packed with flavor and thick broth.  Their eggs and char siu is very yummy too.  The best ramen I had by far.",1
2,"Went here on the last night of my trip in Europe because my dad (who lives in London) said its his favorite restaurant. Now.. obviously I'm from California, so going to a high end ""asian"" restaurant in England made me skeptical from the get-go.
The first thing that ticked me off about this place is the fact that we had to have our reservation checked not only once but TWICE by the stuck up snobs that worked there (once at the door and once again when we got inside). Yeah, I know a family does not fit the profile of young and wannabe rich, but that shouldn't warrant attitude from restaurant staff of what's supposedly high end (this is not a damn club). We're going here for the supposed good food, not to act like douches and stare at everyone else in the restaurant. This ain't Hollywood.. so the B.S. shouldn't even be a factor here.
Secondly, they sat us all the way in furthest corner of the restaurant in the furthest place from other guests as humanly possible. I thought I had escaped the L.A. pretentiousness by going across the pond but I guess its even worse here even when they don't have any celebrities to cater to. 
Lastly, nothing we ordered was bad.. but NOTHING was what I would consider good - AT ALL. All the deserts were mediocre too. The only thing that lived up to my expectations was the service; but it should be a given in a place like this. 
The only points I'm giving are for the service and for the decor/ambiance because both were very nice. Looks wise this restaurant does rival nice spots in Los Angeles so its a good place to 'impress' someone I guess. 
Given the ridiculously bad attitude from the staff and the fact that the food did not impress me at all, I would definitely have to say there's no way I would ever go back. But I can see the appeal for most people.",-1
4,"Their ""Taste of Yauatcha"" menu is such an awesome value (£28.88 for 2 people) and a great way to taste a variety of their dim sum items without breaking the bank! 
The vibe and decor at Yauatcha is slick and modern, but the service is still really friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious and the cocktails are well made and tasty. Of the items that came with the pre fixe, I think the baked venison puff and sweet potato mushroom mei-si roll were my favorites (pictured).",1
5,"No hype this is the one. Consistant quality. Impecable staff and terrific Ambience. Some say it's too dark but my take is the dim light gives you more chance to savour the flavour of the cuisine. This is what I think they are trying to acheve and I believe they succced. Bar staff are terrific and seem to get it just right even when you take clients and try to impress ( I admit my Vodka knowledge is lacking..OK Jake its crap.) Top Dishes : Silver Cod, Vggie Chicken (love regular but this is terrific. No1 's Dish Tofu and Beef. Loved the Miami branch but it's just not London!",1
1,"I just tried Ippudo in NYC few days ago where Hirata Buns and Ramen are PERFECT. So basically when you come to Shoryu Ramen in London, the deception is normal.
The Waguy Beef Hirata is BAD, very fatty, the bun doesn't hold and it is drenched in mayonnaise !! (£7.5)
The fried chichen Ramen, is a large portion with several big pieces of Fried chicken (bland) that lost their crispness because of the broth.
The broth is flavourful but nothing compared to Ippudo.
The 1 star is for the location.
The minus 4 stars are basically more for the lack of service i got from the staff.  They are not motivated and not welcoming. I really was about to leave cause i felt i disturbed them. They were several empty seats/table but they offered the one very mext to the main door (bear in mind it is freezing outside and the clients are entering and flgoing out from this door)
When i insisted to get the seat inside that i knew was free they told me no. I was abot to give up but eventually they gave me that seat after mumbling about me.
That is how my experience started at shoryu and believe me l, i was still expecting the food to be good despite the attitude of some staff.
It is very expensive for nothing and no need to say that i won't recommend it.",-1
5,"Really, really, really good ramen and stupidly long queue - even on Mondays.
I completely buy that ramen places are supposed to be quick eats - order, sit, eat (slurp) and leave - but that's in Japan, where awesome ramen places are at every corner, not in London where delicious ramen with amazing broth and plenty of seafood for a good price - is a rarity. They should definitely open another branch - one of this is just too little of goodness.
Crammy inside, so don't expect fine dining, but then again - it's soul food! So, come in, enjoy, slurp as loud as you can (that shows your appreciation for the chef if they did a good job) and LEAVE. Don't sit and chat - let others enjoy this too (and not stand outside waiting for you to finish... yes. Even on Mondays.)",1
3,"The service was good, the restaurant upstairs is over lit and soul less. One does get the impression they want you in and out as fast as possible. The food seemed very ordinary, pre cooked and waiting under lights, nothing special. I always  seem compare other indian restaurants in london to Rickshaw in Battersea square which is amazing. So I was disappointed,",-1
4,"This place is a mix of bombay Cafe and hipster chique with hipster staff. 
I have been here many times for breakfast and dinner and I can tell that the experiences are different.
Breakfast:
It wasn't crowded so the staff was quick and friendly. The atmosphere in the morning is nice. We ordered the famous bacon naan roll and sausage naan roll and they are really good! Everytime when I am in London I have to eat breakfast here. 
Dinner:
The evenings are always crowded and however the staff is still friendly, it takes more time to order. Or to get the right plates. Instead of the starters they gave us the main dishes first...the food was OK, not the best. This is good for people who are crying when they eat spicy food. Although I am crying sometimes I prefer spices. 
Overall I am a fan of Dishoom, because the trendy atmosphere, the breakfast and the affordable prices.",1
2,"I've only had the desserts so far as we popped in after a late lunch at my favourite Vietnamese restaurant nearby, and if I were judging solely on desserts I'd give the place 5 stars... But the service here sucks, big time. Despite the place being half empty they were really cagey about giving us a table in the first place, and when we sat down it took some time for them to take our order. It then took considerably longer for them to serve us our desserts and tea, which is the only thing we ordered. When it came to paying we asked for the bill 3 times and it never came, and it was only when we got up and went to what looked like the manager that we got our bill, obviously with an 'optional' service charge already included.
We also wanted to buy some sweets to take away but that took absolutely ages too, despite me going behind the counter and actually jumping up and down to try and attract their attention.
The only redemption was that the same person who looked like the manager didn't charge for some of the chocolates, but I think that's actually because he was just trying to be nice to my lady friend (who is of course, a hottie)!
Annoyingly though, I will have to return to try the dim sum because of all the other badass reviews saying how great it is!",-1
3,"This is essentially overpriced Asian food off Tottenham Court Road. I've been to both branches of Hakkasan in London and this is pales in comparison to Hakksan Mayfair in terms of service, food quality and also general decor. Even walking to HHP feels a little eerie given it's at the end of a dark side street. Unfortunately, the inside also suffers from the same poor lighting.
This is based on two different experiences from around two years ago as well as one last year (for the sake of clarity) and there are some good dishes on the menu but I've always felt underwhelmed and hungry when leaving. The drinks are average and truthfully, the first time I visited the waitress pretty much turned up her nose at two of my friends who are strict Jains and do not drink. For a Michelin starred Chinese restaurant this is disappointing both in terms of food and service. I live in Hong Kong now and have been to many other dim sum restaurants in London and although some of the dim sum on the weekend menu at Hakkasan are creative they do not justify the price tag in my opinion. The ambience at the other branch is much nicer and I've had better experiences with staff as well as enjoyed the food a little more. A quick tip - don't bring your own birthday cake unless you plan on also ordering dessert here, you will be charged a cake cutting fee per person.",-1
4,"This place is ""contemporary dim sum."" I said contemporary because the servers do not push the carts around and the decor and prices are ""modern/pretentious."" The dim sum has a refined quality though and taste is excellent. There are also unique cocktails and beautifully crafted desserts that taste scrumptious. However, I heard that the portions got smaller since I have been there.",1
4,"It's a restaurant in Covent Garden, you would never imagine there is a terrace like that in there. It's cozy, for lunch, the lighting is like a movie set. It's rated the most romantic place in London, the food are small pieces, good presentation, the service extremely kind and attentive. You feel good in this place, its meant to be an intimate experience. They know what they are doing. Expensive, formal and conservative.",1
5,"Brunch! So good. We had the bacon naan roll, chai, chili cheese toast, and keema. All were delish. Definitely come again!",1
3,"This is one of those, I must try in my lifetime places based on reputation certainly.  One of the only chances I could get was when I got the bento box on a special opentable deal with friends who had organised it recently.
Pros:
Tuna Sashimi - Wonderful
Assorted sushi was very fresh and tasty (3 nigiri and 3 maki rolls).
Black Cod was good.
Cons:
Raspberry cocktail came with deal and it was OK. Nothing special.
Not the biggest bento box in size.
Didn't think much of the décor and surrounding space at all. Very simple which is fair enough since Japanese style is like that, but it was almost too simple (especially if you were to pay a proper premium price to visit). And seemed to be a lot of staff hanging around. Not bad, but nothing special.",-1
5,"I'll begin with an obligatory complaint about the queues. There will be a long queue on a Friday or Saturday night. Don't complain. It's survival of the fittest here. If you're going as a group, delegate the weak one (whoever gets off work first) to queue!
The atmosphere here is energetic and it's full of young professionals gathered at the bar waiting for their tables so once the host staff hand you your little vibrating black box of joy, feel free to join them you young go-getter, you!
Cocktails here are fairly priced and some quite unique. If I recall correctly I had a chilli martini and it rocked! 
We were seated in just under an hour and the time seemed to fly past so it was no big deal. The food was well worth it and once seated everything arrived very quickly. 
Considering the very obvious trendy atmosphere and decor, I didn't expect too much from the food. I'm by no means an expert but have eaten my fair share of Indian food and prefer to hunt out authentic fare so expected the food here to be a somewhat 'Westernised' version of Indian food both in presentation and taste. This was the case to a lesser extent than I had anticipated and the food was thoroughly enjoyable. It was nice to see some tasty desserts on the menu. Although mostly not of Indian origin, they were delicious nevertheless.
The price was very reasonable and our waiter was the happiest man I've ever met which made the evening even more enjoyable. Service was included (thank you I love you London, making the awkward far less awkward.) 
Would definitely go back again.",1
5,As good as the Hakksan from SF and Vagas :)  It' s hidden in hard to find place tho :),1
5,"Hands down this was the best dim sum I have ever eaten! We came in for an early dinner and we were promptly seated and the process was explained (to me anyway, my boyfriend is a dim sum aficionado).
I ordered the hibiscus spritz which comes in two parts, with a flower frozen in an ice cube and a tower for the drink. It was amazing, sweet and refreshing with a unique presentation. 
We sampled a variety of food and the first out was the shrimp balls. They were filling with a good mix inside, though difficult to eat since fried bits were on all ends. The dipping sauce that came with this was fantastic. Next up were my boyfriend's favourite the char sui bun, which was good. When I tasted the har gau I thought that would be my favourite of the night but the last up crab and prawn dumpling trumped it. Everything we had was delicious and we left completely stuffed. 
Our waitress was attentive, the drinks were expertly crafted and all the food we tried was phenomenal. If you are looking for a good meal in London I would definitely recommend coming here.",1
1,"My order: tonkotsu ramen with corn.  What arrived: tonkotsu broth, trimmings, no noodles, no corn.  I try the broth and am pretty disappointed that it doesn't really taste much like tonkotsu.  But hey what do you expect outside of Japan.  Fine.  As I get about 4 spoonfuls in, the staff realize that they've botched the order and rush to take away the noodle-free ""ramen"" assuring me that a replacement will be right out.  It never comes.  15-20 minutes later...bowls destined for other patrons go by again and again...we have to leave or risk being late to our appointment.  So, I ended up with no lunch at all.  Average food.  Abysmal service.",-1
5,"I love this restaurant. I went there for my birthday about five years ago, and returned again recently for a special night out. Both times were exquisite experiences - and I use the word experiences, not meals, because this is exactly what separates a good from an outstanding restaurant: attention to detail and the crafting of a dining experience, rather than a focus solely on great food. It's rare that you find such an upscale, modern, sensual and trendy dining experience centered around traditional Cantonese food. Thank goodness they haven't taken the ""Asian fusion"" route (one that almost unfailingly results in quality reduction). 
The restaurant is down a dark alleyway off Oxford Street. Think James Bond, sexy spy movies, understated luxury. You would assume you were gaining entry into a secret celebs-only club, not a Michelin-starred restaurant. Down the stairs you go, your interest piqued and your excitement growing. The entryway will not disappoint. The interior was designed by the set director of the film The Matrix, and it's stunning. The intricate woodwork, lighting, bustle, aromas, ambiance...all are intoxicating and immediately provide respite from the stressful streets of London. Beautiful people, beautiful food, beautiful bar. 
I remembered specifically the heavenly texture of the silver cod on the menu, so wanted to make sure we ordered it this time. Because of the tantalizing selections on the menu (lovely cocktail list too), we decided to go with a Signature Tasting Menu for 60 pounds per person. We got a dim sum sampler, some of the most flavorful smoked pork ribs I've ever had, and an array of entrees that lived up to my expectations (what a relief). The silver cod was just as perfectly cooked, tender, moist and slippery as I remembered it from the past. The Angus beef stir fry, vegetables and prawn dishes were also amazing. Service was flawless. My husband commented on how it was one of the best dinners he'd had in some time, and how surprising it was that this was Chinese food.....
The clientele here is a mixture of people celebrating special occasions and smartly dressed businessmen and women having work networking dinners. The dining room seems to maintain that perfect equilibrium of gregarious but intimate. It's alluring AND trendy. Not sure how the place manages to keep the balance going, but it works and it's a wonderful escape. 
It's not cheap, but I highly recommend saving some money and time for an experience here if you can. Dress up, go balls to the wall, and have some fun.",1
3,"If I were to rate Ping Pong on their interior design I'd be giving them a 5 but I'm sorry to say their food is overpriced for what it is. 
This restaurant is beautiful and the drinks are fantastic which brought my rating from a 2 to a 3 star. 
The service I received at the restaurant was ok, and the food was adequate.  In the past year they have changed their menu, and to be honest their old menu was better.  
Our food arrived quickly and it all tasted good, their dessert menu isn't fantastic, so you might have to follow on somewhere else afterwards :) 
It is quite expensive considering you may not leave full. 
In my opinion there are much better Dim Sum places in China town.",-1
1,"While the Nobu (s) in California rock, this pretentious ""Overdressed Red Lobster"" is awful.  From the crappy drink I got at the bar to the snobby, anorexic hostess, I knew I was not in for a fun night.  I got sushi and several items I had loved at the Nobu in Malibu only to find that everything smelled ""fishy"" and the signature Black Cod with Miso was like eating a ""Dr. Scholls gel insole with Miso""....",-1
2,"Not a goof place to go. Very disappointed.  The taste is wired, not like real Chinese food.  It seems kind of mix of Guangdong food and Malaysia and did not like it at all",-1
2,"My wife and I went to Savoir Faire on the basis of the 4.5 star Yelp rating. Thinking we were in a cosmopolitan city like London, the rating meant a lot to us in selecting the restaurant.  We were very disappointed.
We started with the mussels which were grilled and then served with a pernod butter garlic sauce.  The mussels were the best of the dinner and we rated them a 7 on a 10 point scale.  Things went down hill quickly from there.
The second course was the warm goat cheese and fig salad on arugula (""rocket"") bed.  It was mediocre, despite our high expectations.  It could have had more arugula which would have added to the experience, and fresher  rather than wilted.
The third (main course) was the Entrocote Steak Frites.  We ordered it medium rare.  It was cooked to the right temperature, but the steak was as tough as shoe leather, despite the chef pounding it for a long time before cooking it.  The french fries were okay.
For dessert, we had Vanoffee which was a pie with toffee and banana and whipped cream on a graham cracker shell.  It was good but not spectacular.
The service was pretty good and we had no complaints about the serve staff.  
Finally, the ambiance was just fair.  No table cloths, paper napkins, etc.
In summary, Savoir Faire does not deserve more than a 2 star rating.  It is inexpensive, but very average.",-1
5,"It didn't get a Michelin star for nothing.  Everything tasted great, some tasted amazing.  The dumplings are some of the best anywhere.  Ask to be seated in the main dining room if you get a choice.",1
2,"I feel like I'm the only person in London who doesn't really ""get"" Dishoom.
The decor is cool. It has a neat, sort of vintage speakeasy kind of feel to it. The dining experience here definitely beats the kitschy, 1980's living room atmosphere I'm used to with mom-and-pop Indian joints back home. Service was totally fine as well.
The food though. Ultimately, for me it doesn't matter how cool a restaurant looks if the food isn't up to snuff. I stopped in for lunch one day after reading all of the reviews. I just don't.. get it. We got the chicken tikka, the lamb with rice, and some garlic naan. It was tasty, don't get me wrong, but really not life-changing in my mind. It made me a little depressed to shell out the Central London premium when the bill came, knowing that there are better and cheaper alternatives in East London.
Not a hater, but not exactly a fan either. I just found it to be wildly overrated. To each his own, I guess.",-1
3,"Been to this Ping Pong many times. Good spot for groups (with enough notice). Excellent and creative drinks. Decent food, but nothing very special. The usual ""asian fusion"" kind of fare that seems so commonplace these days. I go back just for the fun drinks :)",-1
3,"Erm... Where to start? So much to say... 
So we decided to do the very cliche thing - go to Nobu for Valentines Day! We dont really put much importance on Valentines day, its more an excuse for a fancy dinner! However we did have high expectations in terms of food. I remember many moons ago being repeatedly told by a friend in Rome that Nobu was the best restaurant in London. I remember thinking it would take me quite a few years before being able to afford. Although ive been able to for a couple years now, never got round to it, so this was exciting stuff. 
I want to start by saying the food was amazing. Really absolutely fantastic - ill go into more details below. However, when you pay this much and when you go somewhere with such a reputation you expect more, much more. So lets beginning:
Absolutely no atmosphere, no vibe, nothing. This place has no soul. White walls, no decoration, nothing to excite you. Very bad very loud music, i guess thats what they might call ""atmosphere"", but you could barely hear yourself think and even less talk. Seats and tables were particularly uncomfortable. Lots of fancy people in fancy clothes but nothing else. Thats gotta be why it lost its star... Great food just isnt enough for michelin starred restaurants. You want an experience with insane food. 
Service was decent considering it was Valentines Day and surely a particularly busy evening. 
The food though... Thats another story, we had the Valentines Day 6 course menu, so didnt get to try the special and ph so famous black cod. However, i was not dissapointed with any ofthe dishes. They looked good and tasted good. Fancy japonese food at its best, combination of exciting flavours & luxury products (from a little caviar to classic lobster) cooked to perfection. Every dish was exceptional. Quick mention for the dessert, which i guess i expected less off. It was stunning, fresh & tasty. 
If we look at the food alone, i highly recommend, i wodeven want to go again and again and again. However you cant ignore the price tag, ita not cheap obviously. For thatprice id want thw food to be outstanding but also the restaurant also the atmophere... So overall, if you are looking for amazing food i would recommend, but if you are looking for an experience out of this world i wouldnt recommend. Honestly im not sure ill be back.  
However, super keen to try Zuma now!",-1
2,"Nice service, but poor quality food.
Had calamari and ravioli to start.  Then canceled entree order because the food was a major bummer.
Calamari:  VERY rubbery (way beyond the natural chewy texture of squid we all love) and devoid of flavor.
Ravioli:  Watery sauce, tough pasta and overall diluted flavor.
Don't half step.  This place is obviously quite popular and was VERY busy when we were there....so don't let my review dissuade you from trying this place out.",-1
4,"I respect the quality that Hakkasan consistently provides to all of its diners. The last time that I ate here, it was a bit of a random event with a friend, and they fortunately had enough tables to seat us although they did warn us they needed the table back after a couple of hours.
 My friend was also wearing trainers and although the bouncer had to check with the manager, he let us go through anyway though told us about their normal dress code.
 Even now that the ownership has been transferred away from Yau, the last experience was just as good as previous ones. Service was prompt without being too in your face. We ordered both a starter and main with some vegetables and all of it was totally delicious. I'd highly recommend the ribs where the meat had been cooked to a point where it literally fell off the bone.
 It's cool inside and a nice dining experience overall.",1
4,"I brought my son here
 He doesnt like french food but the food at this restaurant changed his mind.
 The salad of young Leaves with sherry vinaigrette & herbs was sensational.
 Very smartly dressed waiters.
 Will definatly go here again",1
5,"I will keep coming back here again and again. My new London favorite! Honestly I had very low expectations for this ramen. My favorite ramen in the whole world is Ippudo NYC and in my experience nothing has even come close to being on that level. However, Bone Daddies changed everything. First I started off with the sweet and spicy pork bones which was an amazing appetizer. They were ribs with quite a bit of meat on them with a very spicy peppery sticky sweet sauce. I couldn't stop licking my fingers. I also tried the hamachi sashimi appetizer which was wonderfully fresh with a hint of ponzu.
For my ramen, I chose the tonkatsu ramen because of the 20 hour pork broth. The broth was rich in flavor, the pork was tender and juicy and I ordered an extra egg because I love the way they're cooked with a custard like yolk. Next time I'll be order the tantanmen to get a little more spice!
You might have to queue for a bit but I didn't mind. The waitstaff were super nice which is not always the easiest thing to find in London and they made the queue outside bearable with a shot of sake!",1
3,"Ordered:
Chicken Tikka Masala - 
Unfortunately have had better Chicken Tikka Masala in San Francisco, Malaysia AND Sweden which is a sad statement since Chicken Tikka Masala originated from the UK...and most food in Sweden is lacklustre.
The chicken was VERY TENDER, which I did think saved the dish from the lack of seasoning and spice.
Rice - The plain basmati rice was perfectly cooked, but was missing some basic spices that are normally added to even plain basmati rice.
Had to pay for rice which I thought was odd, but I guess that is the norm in the UK.
Butter Naan - Was very small in size and was VERY thin so it was completely crispy like a cracker which was a shame.  It was almost impossible to use the naan for dipping in sauce or using to eat the food on my plate.
I don't know if I will go back or recommend to others for the price.
16+ GBP for the above items.  I ate all the food but didn't get full, so beware if you have a big appetite you may need to order a 2nd dish or several naan.
The staff however was very nice, helpful and attentive.  One waiter saw that I was about finished with my rice and naan and politely asked me if I would like more.  But at 3.50p an order I declined.",-1
3,"High ceilinged space with capacity for 50+ people in downstairs room made this a great setting for a company gathering.  
We ate a fixed menu with lamb samosas, chili cheese toast, naan, chicken briyani, vegatable curry, chicken tikka and desserts (kulfi on a stick and gola ice).
I have a nut allergy and even though my company hadn't asked about dietary restrictions they helpfully provided a menu which marked which items had nuts (unfortunately this included 2 of the items on our set menu - briyani and veggie curry).  Not to worry, they brought me out an extra main course just for me - and I chose the lamb boti kebab - which was superb!
Spices are used very well to flavor the food - which did not rely of heavy sauces or too much salt to be tasty.  One of the better Indian meals I have ever had that wasn't homecooked.
Note:  If you are not for spice - this is not for you.  Lots of yoghurt and lassi was needed by the non-chili-lovers at our tables.  But, if you are for spice - this is amazing!
Finally, the mango kulfi was amazing.",-1
3,"Weekday lunch here.  Please excuse the fact that I cannot remember the correct names for many of the dishes we had.  We sat upstairs in the Street Food bit.
We shared starters. Chaat (puffed rice mixed with diced tomatoes, onions, coriander and a tamarind sauce), puri (crispy shells topped with diced potato, chickpeas, a tamarind sauce and yoghurt), the steamed chickpea cake, chicken lollipops and chicken strips with a spicy dipping sauce.  All of these were delicious although a couple of colleagues found the chickpea cake a little too 'out of the box' for their tastes.  I liked it.
We ordered curries for main.  I had the fish curry which was good if a little too salty.  Large chunks of deep-fried cod, cauliflower florets in a yellow mustard seed based sauce.  My colleagues tried the lamb curry with chapatis and said it was good.
GBP16 per person and loads of food.  Good value!  Stars docked for service which good rather shoddy once the place filled up.",-1
3,"Very nice for a Sunday brunch with friends.
I pre-booked a table because that's how we roll. Easy peasy.
Keep in mind, they advise that they turn tables but we were not pushed out as the turnover was steady and they always seemed to have an empty table to accommodate other arriving diners.
The initial drink service was slow and mind you, 2 of us opted for the bottomless Bellini's - we did start to wonder if they were being slow because of that, hence limiting how many we would actually get. Hmm
Anyway, the food was tasty and there are more than enough options on the All You Can Eat Dim Sum (aka Lazy Sunday) to satisfy anyone.
Lovely - we'll be back!",-1
3,"As far as brunch spots go I'd say this place is a safe bet. The service was good and the food was tasty. The eggs Benedict was good but didn't come with a side so I was left hungry. A half order of the NY pancakes finished me off and rounded out the meal. 
The meal was expensive relative to what you get. That could be a function of the location being next to covent garden square (great place to grab a cup of coffee and listen to the street performers. Exactly what I'm doing as I write this review) or London being expensive...full stop.",-1
3,"Modern Indian - its good food, but not really what I personally want when going for an Indian meal.",-1
5,"We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  By the time I booked a table online a few days in advance, 5:30pm was the only available time.  So book your table well in advance!
We arrived a little early and waited at the bar.  We both ordered non-alcoholic drinks, one was with kiwi and the other was orange/cayenne pepper/ginger, both delicious!
Our table was downstairs in the basement.  It was semi-dark and chic, I love the look of the restaurant!  Our waiter was nice and attentive, very good and professional service.
We ordered a lot of food, they were all very good (as expected of a Michelin star restaurant).  But particularly, I'd recommend Turnip Cake, Venison Puff, Rice Paper Prawn and Mango Roll, Lobster Dumpling, Spinach Ball with Prawn and Cuttlefish and Prawn and Beancurd Cheung Fun.
I was very impressed with the presentation of the dessert.  We had Green Tea Choux and Mandarin Macadamia.  I personally liked the Green Tea pastry better as it was less sweet.  Recommended roasted tea paired with the Green Tea dessert was excellent.
We had a great dining experience here and would love to come back for another occasion :)",1
4,"East London Coolness + Indian Goodness = OH YEAH!
Came in here for a late lunch and a drink while wandering around East London. I didn't look at the menu but asked the server to just bring me his top recommendations for a light meal. I ended up with the lamb skewer and black dahl with naan. It was the perfect snack.
On top of the great food, the atmosphere was amazing. Looking forward to my next visit.",1
1,The shiiiit service ever! The food is not warm and fresh. Either too light or too salty! They don't provide take away and warm up food at all. I will never recommend any friend go there!,-1
1,"i recently discovered how poorly the staff is treated in this restaurant and since then, I am determined not to come ever again.
Surely the core staff members are perfectly happy working there, but there is also a lot of turnover: 
young recruits are paid under the minimum wage, and tips distribution is utterly scandalous! It can go from zero per shift, to a shocking £20 after covering a couple of months!
How can you enjoy sustaining such an embarrassing system?
Should we remind them this is London, one of the most expensive city in the world, where rent and food should not be impossible to afford for young professionals? Come on, Mercury, make an effort on this! You can do better!
A HUGE disappointment because overall, I really enjoyed having dinner there.",-1
5,"So, I went to Japan for a week, and stayed in Sapporo, on the island of Hokkaido. I ate a lot of ramen there.
Then I came home and met a friend for lunch at Bone Daddie's. I didn't even know what kind of food they were going to serve until I got there. I thought to myself ""oh no, here we go, the last thing I need after a week in Japan is some hipster place pretending to be a ramen restaurant"" but I hadn't seen my friend for a while and she has good taste so I didn't kick up a fuss.
And I would have been really embarassed if I had kicked up a fuss, because this place is great!
The ramen is really authentic, just like the stuff you'd get back in Japan. In many ways better because they have pork-free broth for those who are sensitive to it.
For the price they charge, you get a tasty bowl of soup, with good noodles.
It's just a shame everyone else in the world seems to know this and there's always a queue to get in!",1
5,"Just wow. 
This is the prettiest restaurant we've ever been to, and thankfully the substance more than matches the style. 
It all feels very authentically French, the service is exceptional and the food is exquisite. We went for the Sunday prix fixe 3 course plus wine for a reasonable £37.50. The crab and celeriac remoulade was stunning, the wife had wagyu beef (!!) terrine which was equally delicious.
Mains were pork neck with petit pois 'Francaise' and bacon sauce which was unbelievably flavoursome and totally delicious, the wife had truffle parpadella, with extra truffle - superb.
We also loved the desserts - Mille feuille and a vanilla cream cheese mousse with pistachio ice cream. A perfect way to finish the meal off.
Great looking wine selection too - we had a lovely Spanish Tempranillo with the meal, but the list was impressive. 
Overall a fantastic experience. Clearly a place for couples!",1
4,"This place is great!! It's definitely a 'no frills' restaurant, from the decor to the service but the food is good and reasonably priced for Chinatown. We usually have the set meal at £12 a head which is excellent value as you do get a lot of food!! The first time I came here with friends we ordered the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu at £9.95, definitely not a good move as it tasted akin to how I imagine battery acid would taste!! On our next visit we opted for a slightly more expensive bottle at £12.95 and were presented with a perfectly drinkable white wine.
 Be prepared to share one of the large round tables with complete strangers, but that's half the fun of the Wong Kei experience, that and the waiters who've never heard of customer care!!",1
5,"Hands down the best dim sum in London. You pay for the food for sure, but it is totally worth it. The ingredients are super fresh, the flavor is authentic and the presentation is elegant. This is not your stereotypical dim sum place where people hustle for food. Don't get me wrong, I love that atmosphere. Yauatcha is more posh and proper, you get tiny baskets of food brought your table with a smile. 
Shrimp dumpling is served at every dim sum restaurant and it is my litmus test for authenticity of a dim sum place. The Shrimp dumpling here among the best I have tasted. They are juice and fresh and you can taste the subtle flavor of the bamboo shoots inside. Everything is really good here, but I particularly like the Xiao Long Bao, turnip cake, shrimp cheung fun, fried chicken chive dumpling, and we can't forget the congee! The pork and preserved egg congee is out of control tasty and perfect for a cold and rainy day in London! 
No meal is completed without good desserts, and apparently this rule applies to dim sum as well. The desserts here are beautiful, delicate and mouth watering. If you are too full you can bring these lovely babies home to enjoy and prolong the whole experience. 
You already figured this is not your typical dim sum place, so don't expect they to top up water for your teapot! They charge you for each pot of tea, which I think is not cool. Oh well, nowhere is perfect!",1
3,"I'm a huge fan of the duck which is out of this world, unfortunately the service is a hit and miss (most likely miss). Typically rude Chinese service that I expect if I am in Asia but not when I'm in London. Oh and don't bother turning up in the evening after dinner hours as the meat has gone cold and chewy.",-1
3,"We went for dinner with a few friends and had a good time. 
The menu had a few standard dimsum plates but also, more generic Asian dishes in general. I found most of their dimsums acceptable but not the most flavourful. For instance, the soup within xiaolongbao should have been served much warmer, succulent and tasteful. Nonetheless, most everything got the job done, so I would give the place three stars. 
Service was generally good. Whilst there was a slight glitch with our reservation, they were prompt in finding us a table for six. Throughout the meal, they served most everything on time. However, the bill they calculated turned out to be wrong on many items, so we had to manually check them and get them to correct for us. 
Ambience was modern and spacious. Not your average Chinatown dimsum place and good for reasonably stylish gatherings.",-1
3,"My husband and I came here in March 2017 for dinner one night during our time in London. We had reservations (which were relatively easy to secure) and arrived to our table. The restaurant is packed and busy on a weeknight. We ordered:
1) Ribeye steak - my husband ordered this and was underwhelmed. maybe his expectations were too high but he said it was only OK
2) duck confit - I really enjoyed this dish and felt the flavors were tasty and just right.
3) onion soup - my husband ordered this too and again, he thought it was just ""eh"".
Overall, the service was friendly although they were so busy that it didn't feel as welcoming. Even though this place has high marks, we left feeling like the experience was only mediocre.",-1
5,Love eating here whenever I happen to be in London. Have yet to try any ramen here but those bao sandwiches are amazing!,1
5,This place lives up to its reputation. Everything seemed pretty well priced in an open cool environment. The curries and lamb were all well cooked. The food came pretty fast but it did take a while to clear. I would definitely come here again based on the quality of the chicken tikka alone.,1
2,"Sadly this was a let down and isn't a patch on the NYC one. I suspect the location in London is one of the issues as it ends up being full of tourists and almost feels like an Angus Steak House!
Our waiter knew diddly about the menu and when i asked for a standard drink - fresh lime and soda, he got a proper sweat on and then told me they didn't stock that cocktail?! 
The actual brunch was so so but nothing special.",-1
5,"One of the better dim sum places in London, the vibe is nothing of the traditional sort. Showcases smart techniques that keeps the menu ahead of any traditional dim sum restaurant. You'll leave satisfied, now it's time for you to binge away; cause nothing you order will ever go wrong!",1
4,"Nothing beats a cold winter London night than a big bowl of noodle soup... even better when it's easy on your wallet.  The wonton noodle soup with chasui used to be my fave before I swore off meat.  I don't know about the rudeness.... everyone's is usually pretty nice when I visit, altho sometimes they are really busy and may not be as friendly.",1
5,"Why do so many Chinese people eat here? Because the food is Fantastic! Order anything from peking crispy duck to deep fried chilie salt squid and you cant expect anything but very traditional, superbly cooked food. I've never met anone with any complaints about the quality of the dishes. Excellent value for money as well..!
Service and seating arrangements leave much to be desired, but the food really does speak for itself, hence its 500 person capacity often being packed.",1
4,The dumplings were good. The rest of the food okay I think Hakassan is for duck lovers and I am not. But Rihanna was Seating next to us and having diner. So you basically get a nice atmosphere and an okay good. I wouldn't go to hakassan if I am starving I would go to mr chow but I definitely would go there if I look hot and need to go out .,1
4,"The food in this place is incredible, really good and very affordable. Great value for price for sure! The terrace is great too, nice exotic atmosphere, cushions, sweet tea dishes and colours. The only downside is the queue. You might end up queuing for almost and hour and when you get in there is another queue which is annoying. Try to go on days that aren't too busy, it's worth a visit",1
4,"And finally, something on the UK ramen scene worth writing and raving about! 
No more of that tasteless clear broth with no fat or oil on the surface, this is the real deal - Hakata style tonkotsu! Such eerie, cloudy and unbelievably unhealthy broth yet oh so nourishing - and that's the charm of it. Pretty standard toppings, nicely made egg, and yes, as much garlic and chili as you would dare to add. 
The big thing going for Bone Daddies is the tonkotsu broth. The noodles aren't exceptional, nor are the sides, or probably even many of the other dishes, but that's fine. The tonkotsu broth makes up for it, in droves. 
It's got a wonderful little atmosphere, it's obviously in a great part of town, and if you head there at the right time there will be a queue - that's the sign of a good ramen joint in my books. 
Get the tonkotsu, that's the signature dish. I would be happy if they stopped making the other types of ramen, and just focussed on perfecting it, but since when have you seen a restaurant in the UK focus on one thing only? 
And finally, only 4 stars because the other broths really aren't worth writing home about, the chāshū is cut way too thin, and the noodles are a bit meh... But really these are minor gripes, so go forth and set yourself a new ramen baseline.",1
1,"Yawn.  From the food to the service, Ping Pong is a bore and I'm shocked that it has received 3.5 start from my fellow Yelpers.  
My hubby and I had to flag down a server to place our order and actually had to ask for our drinks to be delivered (they had been sitting on the bar counter for close to 5 minutes) after our horribly bland food arrived.  Sure, the decor is cool, but the only saving grace for their food is the spicy chili sauce that actually provided our bland dim sum a bit of flavor.  Ping Pong is overpriced and lacks in flavor...head to Chinatown for real dim sum.",-1
5,"Believe the hype. In fact, take the hype, tag on a little extra and then believe it. You won't be disappointed.
And there is hype around this place. The queue for a table was 45 minutes' worth when we showed up, longer for those in parties of more than two people. Long wait times seem to be the way of the world at the moment for the hotly-tipped eateries of the moment (e,.g. Meat Mission, Honest Burgers, Burger and Lobster etc). Ordinarily I'm a huge and vocal sceptic as to whether food can be worth waiting that kind of time for. Surely it can't be THAT much better than rival, less heralded places?
But Bone Daddies proved it most certainly can be. The Tonkotsu Ramen I went for, with extra egg was the best ramen I've had and a well thought out dish comprised of pork, veg, ramen noodles and a mild but well-balanced and welcome seasoning. My dining companion's Tantamen was spicier but similarly well-received. Furthermore, it was filling. My appetite's increased recently due to my stepping up of various sports but I was not disappointed with the portion size. Yum!
The service was incredible too. Friendly, and willing to engage in banter about possible connections between Bone Daddies' menu and the movie Donnie Darko (yes!). Accurate as to how much longer we'd have to wait for and then helpful in steering us relative ramen newbies to recommended dishes. And complete with an unexpected surprise too: after we sang their praises and said that we'd like to help them in return by giving back their table (we had a movie to run for), the waiter arrived with the bill, declaring that as we'd been such nice customers he'd taken 10% off!! What the....? Before this happened this place was lighting up those five stars - now it was making the case for a bonus sixth.
Throw in the rockin' music (think 70s rock) faintly reminiscent of Meat Mission but not turned up to 11 and I had a great time here. Bone Daddies, I salute you.",1
2,"Cute little ramen shop on the corner of St. Giles High Street.
Can only speak to the experience of making a light and early lunch out of a few side dishes, the chicken karaage (small portion for £4) and the truffle edamame (large portion for £4). I went there with the intent of having a nice bowl of ramen, but they were out of char siu, which doesn't make much sense for a ramen house since char siu is such an integral part of the dish in general. Every single one of their bowls contains char siu, and the Yelp photos suggest hearty portions, and to not have it available is like saying they're out of ramen broth or noodles, hence my reasoning for just ordering a few sides at that time.
When time came to pay the bill, I was told by the staff that if I want to ever dine there again, I have to order ramen. Okay, that makes sense, and I came with the intent of having ramen but decided against it since I would be paying full-price for a meal that lacked an integral part of its essence: the thick slices of char siu. So it was a little off-putting to be blatantly told this. 
Next time, I'll probably opt for a different ramen joint in the area with better prepared karaage and one that would have char siu in stock.",-1
4,"Shoreditch Dishoom is actually a little bit cooler, bigger and for some reason I like it better than Covent Garden (maybe cause it's less rushed and crammed all the time).
Normally I wouldn't copy paste a review for another but below is my review for the Dishoom in Covent Garden, which still applies to Shoreditch's one :) 
Bear out the wait! It's never as long as they say, and worth it for the free chai (dirty if you are lucky). If there is a place in Central London I like to eat in more, I haven't found it. Having loved and lived in Mumbaj it makes me nostalgic for lunch and dinner dates in Cafe Britannia and other Parsi cafés. 
If you or members of your group aren't used to eating Indian food, this is a great introduction with something for everyone. I've brought family, friends, and dates. Kick it off with a cocktail, all are good, but I especially recommend an off the menu item called the 'Dhoble' (Dub-lay; named after Mumbai's infamous Polic Commissioner)- just ask them to ask the bar staff.
I'm a big fan of the pau bhaji/bhel/vada pau for starters. Highly recommend the Biryani or Bhoti kabobs for mains. No order will be complete without the house Black Daal (my Keralan GF adores it). Remember it's easier and cheaper to share- most dishes can serve two. Mop it all up with a roomali roti (handkerchief roti- ask to see them make it, it's epic).
Truthfully dessert isn't as strong as the rest. Go for the kulfi on a stick. Chai is too small a portion in my opinion, coffee is fine but not done in traditional pulled fashion. Just grab cocktail 2 or 3 instead :)
I'd be surprised if it comes to more than £30pp :)",1
3,"Dim sums in every shape and flavor is a way to describe Ping Pong. There are lots of Ping Pong's in different areas in London, therefore a safe option to find one in your part of town.
In my opinion this place is perfect for visitors who like to put little bits and bobs together. The choice is extensive and for those who have a hard time making up their mind, there are set menus.
You get a pencil to tick the right menu box for the dim sum chosen. Ping Pong recommends 4-6 dishes each, which mean a table for two will be covered by all sorts of dim sum baskets in every shape and form. 'Surprise' is the right word to describe the dumplings you choose, as you do not know what it tastes like before you have tried each of them.
I little tip, ask the waiters to not bring everything at once - it is a shame when food gets cold. The place is an experience, it not only holds surprises for you but also engages with the customer interactively. You will not get bored and you need to be skilled in eating the dim sum with chopsticks.",-1
2,"I don't get the hype. I guess if you're into average-tasting, overpriced Indian food in a trendy setting with neglectful service, this is your place.
We waited for 1.5 hours for a two-person table on a Wednesday night. We stood outside for a while, but they brought out some warm chai and a sherry shot. Okay, despite the wait, it's s good start -- full of promise. 
We spent the bulk of the waiting period standing around the bar area, where they encourage you to buy drinks and snacks while you wait. (Cha-ching!) Eventually our buzzer vibrated and we were led to a downstairs table. 
They have seating areas upstairs, downstairs, and even in a detached tent. The environment is chic and trendy, but I found the actual substance of the Dishoom experience to be lacking.
Service was awful. No one ever came to refill our waters until I flagged someone down at the end of our meal and I asked for it. And instead of asking if we even wanted dessert, they just left us with a dessert menu, even though all we wanted was the check. After waiting for a while (guess he wasn't too interested in taking our dessert orders either) we had to flag him down again and ask for the check. They automatically add on a 12.5% optional service charge -- perhaps they think that since few people would opt out, they're safe with giving subpar service?
They don't ask about your preferred spice levels. I would have preferred my food to have been spicer. We ordered the black daal, the royal chicken, a garlic naan, and the roti. The servings were so tiny, we contemplated ordering a lamb biryani too but decided against it when we saw it arrive at the table next to us.
More than once, while taking a bite of the chicken curry, I got a cardamom pod, a big slice of ginger, and other chunks of spices in my mouth. If you're going to give me such a small dollop of food, I would at least expect all of it to be edible.
The black daal tasted decent but was nothing special. It actually arrived as a light brown color, was waterier than I expected (for something supposedly stewing for 24 hours), and strongly resembled Mexican refried beans.
The roti was borderline awful. You only get one large piece in an order. It's extremely thin, extremely dry, and kind of crispy. It tastes very plain. You'd be better off mopping your food up with flour tortillas (for less price too). The garlic naan was a similarly paltry portion -- two tiny triangles in the basket. The naan was flat and dense -- unlikely that it was baked in a tandoori oven. 
The best part about this place was the free wifi.",-1
2,"This is for delivery: I've given this place a few chances, and now I'm done.  They advertise their tonkatsu as 20 hour pork bone broth that is ""A Bone Daddies Favorite: creamy white broth with Braised Tractor pork.""
The first time I  ordered tonkatsu, I got a brown insta-broth, I thought it was a mistake. I ordered it again, and it was brown again, and didn't have the tonkatsu taste.  It was oily and tasted like they just threw a pack of soup into hot water and grease, almost like a bad roux. I called them to ask if their tonkatsu was brown, and they confirmed, saying ""That's how we make it."" I've seen other reviews with the creamy white broth, so I don't know if they just send people who order delivery anything or what.
It's actually decent if you're craving ramen, but not the taste I was looking for. The minced pork is really good, and their chashu is delicious.  The noodles aren't my favorite. They seem to be soba noodles (buckwheat), but don't retain any of the flavors.",-1
5,"Surprisingly great food in London's Ctown, a place packed with pretenders.
We followed where other Chinese went.  The restaurant looked crowded with locals.  They spoke Cantonese.  All good signs.
The duck was as good as advertised.  A must, really.  They'll hack it off the bone for you, but that's a very un-Chinese thing to do.  Our other dishes were just as good (Peking-styled ribs, basic stir fry dishes).  Price was pretty good for London.  Service was typically Chinese (mostly good), but we're used it.",1
5,"Last Sunday a friend and I went to Columbia road flower market. We were up and out early doors to make the most of the sunshine and were planning to get breakfast there as I've seen some reviews saying there are some great cafes. I didn't spot anything I fancied (did have a great freshly squeezed juice!) and knew dishoom was nearby so we wandered back that way hoping there would be a table.
I've been to dishoom before - twice in Leicester Square and once in Shoreditch and allll for dinner - boy can I recommend the paneer curry, their rotis and naans and to finish of a kulfi! But I really love the Shoreditch branch and have been dying to come for breakfast
It was actually quite empty on a Sunday at 11 but I guess as they don't take bookings that could be why? Also the place is massive with lots of seating upstairs and down. My fav part though is they have a conservatory type area with sofas where they open the roof when it's sunny. This area was pretty busy but i was desperate to sit out there so we waited ten minutes for another couple to leave!
Right now for the food - wow! I can't wait to go back already. I was lucky my friend agreed to get a few things and share everything. So I started off insisting we got the famous naan roll (I've seen it in so many mags and websites featured as one of the best brunch/ breakfast items), my friend chose the granola and then we decided to get the maksa bun to go with the chai we had ordered. What we didn't realise is that the maksa came with a chai. This came first so we were happily dipping the toasted buttery bread in chai while waiting for the rest. Would recommend but won't  be getting again - just a one time thing for me!
Wow was the naan good! Cream cheese, crispy bacon and chilli jam in one of their delish naans served warm obvs. I'll def be getting this again and I also saw someone else with a sausage and egg naan which looked really good! 
We finished on the home made granola which was full of tasty nuts with their vanilla yoghurt and fresh fruit. Lovely way to finish and utterly stuffed!
This is a definite recommend for both dinner and breakfast and I can't wait to come again! I want my bf to have the big bombay so I can try it all and also fancy the look of the Akuri (scrambled eggs) with a side of masala beans!",1
4,"Came here for dinner with 2 other people on a Saturday night. Expect about an hour wait if you get here around 8pm. You can grab a drink in the bar as you wait. Nice selection of drinks and served fresh.
Chicken tikka - nice flavor. spicy. Recommend getting the yogurt (raita) to cool down your mouth. 
Garlic naan pretty standard and good.
Roomali roti was very nice change to naan. 
House black daal was my favorite. Not too spicy and a very large portion served.
Chicken ruby was delicious. Similar to chicken tikka masala in my opinion. Great flavor and spice to it.",1
2,"After all the hype, it was a bit of a letdown for ""affordable authentic French food"" and it felt a bit touristy. 
My context: At my local taphouse in a collegetown back in America, there is a Monday night dinner special where I can get a similar quality steak with mashed potatoes for $5 (with purchase of a craft beer on tap). So when I heard that this steak dinner would be an amazing deal and the sauce would be what seals it, I expected more.
What I got (everyone gets) for 24 pound deal = 
*To start: a fairly run-of-the-mill waldorf salad (walnuts, romaine, mustard-based dressing) and half of a French baguette, which was soft but cold and I would have liked some butter to go on it. I ended up dipping it in dijion mustard, as there was a jar of it on the table and I liked the kick 
*Supposed star of the show: Two servings of steak frites (cooked only at rare, medium or well, already slice and covered in a mustard-based sauce) - This might sound like the typical (possibly ignorant) American tourist, but I'm not used to already have my steak cut for me and not being able to order my desired medium rare. The sauce also tasted a bit bland to me. The frites were fine - shoe-string so extra crispy. Overall, this was plenty of food but afterward, I felt unsatisfied so I ordered dessert (rare for me!)
Ultimate letdown - the lemon tarts. I was shocked to receive what seemed like grocery chain store quality dessert as they had rock hard crust that seemed to lack sugar and a filling that tasted more saccharine rather than zippy from citrus (which I craved).
With a glass of the cheapest house red wine and gratuity added on to the bill, my dinner ran closer to 40 pounds total. So I suggest to avoid waiting in line, and instead save your money for street or pub food of similar (sometimes better) quality for a quarter of the cost.",-1
5,"Very impressed with this one. Have only been once, but went for the afternoon tea (£28 for two, weekdays 3pm-6pm) which was extremely generous in size and absolutely delicious. Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but there's a great ambience and it was absolutely delicious. For the money, I don't think you can do much better in London.",1
5,"Great drinks and amazing Indian small plates. We got the bhel, ruby chicken, black daal, and grilled lamb. Everything was FANTASTIC and sufficiently spicy.
Also, be prepared for a wait.",1
1,"The food was okay but the appropriation of Parsi culture as a marketing gimmick was unacceptably crass. Imagine a Jewish-themed restaurant, with the walls decorated with menorahs and the wait staff wearing yarmulkes, except that the management and waiters were all, let's say, Chinese. This would undoubtedly cause an international uproar. Just because the Parsi community is almost extinct doesn't make this any more acceptable.",-1
5,"Intimate, gorgeous, delicious, romantic.  All that plus the best mashed potatoes I have EVER HAD.  Request the conservatory, we had the center table and were in heaven.  Don't miss this spot, the food was delicious and the wine list was fantastic and thorough.",1
4,"Boy was I in for a treat!  My boyfriend and I always look like such an odd couple when we meet for lunch.  I wear some punk rock looking sweatshirt or t-shirt with jeans and trainers and he's in a really expensive suit.  Doesn't mean we don't have a common love of good food.  I often wonder what people think when they see us together, especially when we turn up in nice restaurants.  
Today we went to Clos Maggiore for lunch and arrived without a reservation literally at the end of lunch service.  They seated us anyway and even took my jacket and hung it up, nice.  
I have a new love for lunch prix fixe menus.  I'm sure dinner is off the charts expensive at this place, but for lunch they had an amazing prix fixe menu!  3 courses or 2 courses and a 1/2 bottle of wine for 19 pounds.  Killer!!!!  
I don't think I've ever had such good service without the waiters barely saying a word.  The place looks like a place where high end business happens, a really unique interior.  
We both ordered off the prix fixe and it was DELICIOUS!  Whenever we go out to eat my boyfriend always asks if I'd like some of his food.  I've come to learn that by saying that, what he really means is ""can I have some of yours?""  Now that I've deciphered the code we always discuss what we're ordering before hand so we'll both be happy to ""share"".  
Starters:
Seared Tuna - This was delicious, it came with a pastry, almost baklava type pairing, and a wonderful sweet bruschetta.  Sweet cheeks literally cut the starter in half so we could switch once we'd eaten our allotted halves.  
Pea and Mint Soup - Wonderfully rich and creamy, yet light at the same time, and had broad beans as well.  Came with some addictive cheese bread on the side.  Bring on Round 2!  
Mains:  
Slow cooked beef cheek - I can't say I've ever had ""beef cheek"" but it was delicious.  Very tender and the meat effortless pulled apart.  Was accompanied with a very rich sauce and green pea pods with carrots. I will now add ""beef cheek"" to dishes I want to try at home!
Monkfish - I've never been a huge fan of fish, but this was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The outside was nice and  crispy and soft on the inside.  It came with prawns as well.  Both mains were delicious.  
I had the 3 course and got the coffee and petite fours for dessert.  They were 6 scrumptious little samples of YUM!  I said that anything that is gold dusted will most certainly be delicious and I was right!  
I love deals, I love good food, I love good service, I love ambiance.  All of which I got at Clos Maggiore for lunch!  Party!",1
4,"I am not sure I felt comfortable at this restaurant, the interior is cold and not very cozy, plus I find the decoration a bit on the tacky side. 
Yauatcha is very popular so be ready to share your experience with hundreds of other guests and to occasionally rub elbows with the customers at the neighbouring table. 
Anyway, I was happy with my dim sums and the service was kind and attentive. It turns out that Yauatcha has a Michelin star and maybe it deserves it, but if you're looking for dim sums there's a couple of similarly good (non-starred) options in China Town.",1
5,The broth is very delicious here. It is not hard to make but not everyone can prepare it the way I like it. Here they manage to do it the way I think it should be done. GReat place.,1
4,"ME: "" Hello Yauatcha I'd like to review your restaurant. ""
YAUATCHA:  "" Ok, we can fit your review in a week next Tuesday at 8.35 pm until 10.05 pm ""
------- ---------- ---------- --------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- ------- 
So you got the booking? Congratulations. A few years ago that was one of the toughest things to do here in London. The night-time 25thCentury Dim Sum bar with it's aquarium-filled cocktail bar and 1 Michelin Star was the talk of the town. The Dim Sum craze began here with Yau's creativity, coolness and excellent design.
It helped that they had edible GOLD-painted dumplings too!
Those bling-bling dumplings have sadly left the menu but plenty of other extravangances exist and the prices can rocket sky high for some small dishes. And if you are trying the world-class teas and masterpiece petit fours upstairs then you could be forgiven for thinking they screwed up and just converted prices one-to-one from Chinese Yuan they are so high.
But don't let that fool you. Yauatcha is the cheapest place I've ever had a filling Michelin-starred meal. If you come in a three (3 is the magic Dim Sum number) then you can stuff yourself with many dishes and even have cocktails and quite easily leave without spending more than 30 each. That's pretty magical considering you'll not eat at many places so obviously cool and 25th Century.
It's sounding like the perfect date place too, isn't it?
Well it almost is... but think of all those awkward moments when little dumpling number 3 is lying there and you have to decide who gets it. Take my advice and do your dating mid-afternoon with the tea and cakes upstairs. Yau's Taiwanese tea-expert wife is the lord of this section and this lady gets it right - easily the best Asian teas in town.
So why is my once favourite restaurant in the world only getting four stars? Because of the system... the booking, the time allocation and the..

ME: "" ;__; """,1
5,"Just before hitting an event at the Hide&Seek Party event at the Old Vic Tunnels... thought it was a good idea to get some food in my belly as I didn't want a repeat of  my over imbibing session a few days earlier so food was a must!
I like the modern look of the place. It's not traditional dim sum or atmosphere, still a nice venue and menu. 
So we stuffed our faces till our bellies were full. Job well done.",1
4,"I love ping pong for mommy get togethers. There's rarely a fuss over prams or kiddos running amok which is good for me and the food is really good. Or so it tastes better because I have limited time and usually rocking a pram to sleep or running after my toddler with a delicious pork rib in hand. Either way, i'm a huge fan!
The chicken and crunchy peanut salad is really good. Avcocado, crisp lettuce, chicken, and a great peanut sauce thats still light. Well done. 
The spicy prawn bao is a build it your own asian style taco thing that was super tasty as well. I'm not keen on build it your own stuff but this wasn't messy or anything so that is a plus. 
The Mocktails were also really nice. I had the jasmine and mint, the jasmine had gone a bit bitter as it was brewed a while but i'm not sure if i'm just a tea snob or not. I take that back, i'm a total tea snob and i know what over brewed tea tastes like. That being said, it was still nice. 
The staff were really nice too. Can't help but love staff that fix all that 3 toddlers destroy. Bless them.",1
4,"Great atmosphere. Colonial India feel, I like it. Tbh I'm pretty critical when it comes to eating Indian food when going out but this place served decent chops and black daal. Dhal. Dahl. Daaahl. Wonder what the actual spelling of that word is 
Anyway. Taste was 8/10. Atmosphere was 8.5/10. Good service. 
Oh damn.... I remember I had a old fashion, but the viceroy old fashion (think that was the name???). Yea that was dope. 8/10.",1
3,"Ah, Ping Pong. I want to love you. I really, really do. Lots of the food is yummy and while it's a bit expensive, we can still usually get out for around £30 for 2 (no alcohol). 
Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of this branch. It's big and loud and we're almost always put at a table for 8, all scrunched around with strangers and no room. I get that it's how it is there but it's not really my thing.
We went last week with another couple, and were at a nice table for 4. The service is usually quite good but on this occasion, our waiter just could not be bothered. Since we wanted separate bills, each couple did their own ticking off on separate papers. The waiter insisted that he had to combine them and that he couldn't bring us each our own bill. After much arguing, he eventually relented but it set a sour tone for the evening, and our service was pretty awful all night. Luckily we had decent food in good company and it didn't ruin our night!
(On a side note, the other couple's bill was over twice what ours was - it would have been quite a pain to try to figure it out on our own, especially after a few drinks!)",-1
1,"This was fantastic. 20 year ago. Now it's seriously overcrowded, the staff think they are too cool to be even remotely polite to non-celebs and the food is not a patch on the much better Nobu Berkeley (the one where the celebs actually go). Thank God I'm teetotal so it was just irritatingly expensive rather than really annoying.",-1
5,"Hakkasan, an Alan Yau's creation. I love it! I love it! I love it! Thats all I can say. The whole experience matches the food and drinks so well. Hoever, one down side is thta it is really expensives and the dishes are quite small portion. Try the duck with caviar and the stir fry venison. They are all great dishes, very tasty indeed. I will try to go more often if I can afford it. I recommend it to everyone. The interior is cool and designer like!",1
3,"This whole hype on social media in regards to Wong Kei closing and then opening with new management really got me wanting to go back to see if there has been any changes. 
Wong Kei has always been a place for a simple fix of food at a cheap price and a place I can get fresh ho fun stir-fried at a reasonable price. Hate it when people state 'ho fun' in the menu when in fact it's just dried rice noodles rehydrated. Portion sizes is always a plus too along with no service charge and free green tea. But I never expect good presentation of food, wok energy, particularly good service or a very positive memorable experience.
So it caught my attention when news coverage was saying that the new manager is trying to input better service. Whilst customers were worried about the change in portion sizes, cheap prices and taste in their favourite chilli oil. So on Saturday me and my friend decided to test this new 'Wong Kei' out with a few of the most popular dishes and see if Wong Kei has lost it's original values.
Although there has been a repaint, decor is still exactly the same, same off green/blue tables on the ground floor, plastic white plates with 'Wong Kei' printed on them. The only thing that looked any diffferent were the soy sauce that are now in Lee Kum Kee glass bottles. 
We were given the new menu where the dishes looked exactly the same however all dishes were hiked up by 0.20p-0.40p. This certainly gives room for other Chinese restaurants to top Wong Kei in offering the cheapest one dish plates. 
We started with the most popular Roast pork and pork belly on rice. Either we were very lucky on the occasion with the cut or the meat has improved in quality. I was quite impressed with how lean the roast pork was, succulent and well marinated. The generous slices of meat did have a good bounce to it with a generous portion of rice in the same sweet brown sauce I'm used to. Nothing had changed here, if anything it was better than a lot of times I have been. 
My friend was so happy to find the chilli oil had not change either, still fragrant with notes of garlic and flavoursome. A spoon of that onto the rice dish add that perfect kick needed to make it a good simple lunch fix.
My usual char kway teow went downhill sadly. It was still fresh ho fun but it lacked flavour and depth. It was not as spicy as it used to be and in fact it was more bland than it used to be. There was minimal egg to be seen and portion went down as well. I've heard most of the chefs have left since the new manager took over but no reason was given. That could explain the cooking changes. They must be using a different curry powder or paste to.
Crispy pork noodles had mix opinions. My friend was sad to find that the noodles had change and are a lot thinner. It didn't effect me as it just made things more lighter and crisper but some might like it with more bite. As a business perspective I can see these noodles being quicker to fry. This actually became my favourite dish of the three as I enjoyed the long shredded pork and the thinly chopped mix vegetables on top that created a good layered of texture. The sauce was seasoned perfectly for me and yes although greasy it was expected, nothing has changed there. 
Now I didn't feel service had change at all- not like it bothered me. But there was no major improvements. Still no smile or polite welcoming. Our waiter still quickly pointed to the back which some can consider rude and asked us to pick any table there. Our female waitress who delivered our food was nicer and answered the majority of our questions given but she seemed genuinely nice and not like she had particular training. 
Still quite intrigued if any other dishes have changed at Wong Kei especially the Wonton Noodle Soup. Still I somehow feel the old Wong Kei is lost and being the most 'cheap' and 'generous' portions in Chinatown is no more. But for it's roast meats, chilli oil and crispy noodles there is a reason for return.",-1
3,"A cozy restaurant with fresh ingredients with a homecooked touch. I actually felt as if I was sitting in a house being served by my friend's family. The food is good, but waiting almost an hour to have it put in front of you was tough. I had a group lunch and we were on a tight schedule so we promptly ordered at noon hoping to be done before 1PM since we had class. We all ordered different things around the table and were served our appetizers while we waited for main courses. As we were sitting there, I could tell we were getting antsy and constantly checking the time because we knew we were running out and we were going to be late. Not really sure why it took nearly an hour for the food to come out, but I think it's something they should work on for people on a time crunch during lunch time.
When it comes down to the food, it was nice. Not exactly out of this world amazing, but it was definitely a nice light meal. The service was good since we were the only ones in the restaurant, but my only gripe is the long wait for the food to arrive at the table. Maybe I'll be back, but not when I'm in a hurry.",-1
5,"The best dim sum ever, in a stylish modern room. We each had the prix fixe £45 option, and were not disappointed. Reservations are necessary on busy days.
Strongly recommend.",1
4,"Korean chicken wings and pig bones are probably my favourite food in London currently. It's amazing how crispy, wet, spicy, sweet and succulent they are. I even found myself spooning up the remaining sauce.
The tonkotsu was fine but the main reason to go is the starters",1
2,"Automatic ding for having an empty soap dispenser in an already unsanitary bathroom.
Otherwise, the food tastes like most authentic Chinese places: it tastes fine but nothing spectacular.
I came for dinner and ordered a soup, main pork dish, and some rice. Overall, it was decent. None of the dishes really stood out to me. They're merely meeting my expectations for Chinese food. My parents did say the steamed fish dish that they had was actually amazing though so that counts for something I suppose. 
I encountered inconsistently slow service here which isn't uncommon for Chinese places. I'm pretty sure the two tables next to me got their food before me despite showing up afterwards. However, being insulted at one is new to me. When I asked the waitress where my food was long after her estimates had passed, she said it's my fault that I'm so impatient because I'm from mainland China. Thanks for assuming that just because I'm a foreigner who can speak Chinese, I'm automatically from China. 
I was also hoping for a break from pricey pubs, but in the end, the total came out to about how much I'd spend at a pub so it wasn't as cheap as I had hoped. Also an itemized bill would be nice so I can be sure I'm not being ripped off.",-1
4,"Cheap and cheerful. Brisket of beef with rice or noodles is a favourite.
And for only £3.90!
Admittedly they're not the best for roast duck or pork just a few shops away, so stick to the noodle or rice dishes.
They're good for solo dining or a quick meal before movies etc.",1
3,"Bottom line up front: Ramen is okay, the sides are much better.
Things I've tried:
- Tonkotsu. The broth is thick, but lacks flavor. The noodles are good and the eggs were excellent.
- Tsukemen. Noodles totally stuck together. The eggs were worse than when I had the Tonkotsu.
- Karaage. Delicious! Squeeze your lemons on those suckers.
- Croquettes. The pork and corn croquettes are interesting, but I probably don't need to try them again.
I hope an actor does a dramatic reading of this review on YouTube.",-1
5,"I visited this restaurant for the second time in September 2012, after my first dinner back in 2008.
The food is still as tasty as I remembered.
We ordered:
Jasmine tea smoked ribs
Scallop shui mai (steamed)
Venison puffs
Crispy aromatic duck (half-duck)
Everything was delicious, especially the ribs. Many other dinners also ordered the ribs, it seems to be a favorite.",1
2,"Honestly can't see what the fuss is about. Guess it found its niche. Food bland, not enough spices.. Maybe they are not going for my palate. Massive queues and overrated.",-1
4,"Came here while roaming London on my own. It's tucked away in Soho and quiet a gem. I walked in and found that it was very busy. I'm not sure if it was due to the rain outside or if it was always like this. Luckily, since I was by myself, I was seated immediately.
After much debate, I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. The ramen is in a very rich chicken bone broth. The broth had a padron pepper floating in it, and complimented the pork neck chasu. I've had my fair share of ramen and I really loved this ramen. I found that although it was spicy (just the way I like it), the broth was just a teensy bit sweet. Not sure if that was due to the Miso? This did not bother me though. The pork and spiciness of the broth offset that sweetness and it was very well balanced. I'd love to try the tantanmen ramen the next time I am here though!",1
1,"One of our friends was on her way, and the staff didn't give us a table until she arrived. This is not the hospitality I would expect from any decent restaurant.",-1
5,"Yay!! London seems to be getting better and better at ramen!! Finally!!
I have been excited about Bone daddies for aaaages! I've been following them on twitter and drooling over the photos...so I had high expectations that this would be a decent ramen venue. It seems like other yelpers had the same idea as we had the biggest turn out ever for a ramen club! Thank you all for joining me!!
On to the noodles:
Oh my goodness the tonkotsu ramen made me happy! The soup was rich, creamy and you can tell those bones have been brewing for a looong time. I initially thought there was not quite enough broth for that number of noodles, but actually it was all so rich that I found it difficult to finish it all.
- Soup = Gorgeous...now I want to try all the other flavours
- Eggs = Cooked to perfection with squidgy middles and well-seasoned
- Meat = Fatty, full of flavour and so tender that it falls apart on your chopsticks
- Extras = It was good that you can add extra garlic...and I shared some of Rob's extra pipette of fat. Yum
- Noodles = Perfect
The staff were complete sweeties and coped well with such a large group.
The only let-down for me was the karaage chicken...the taste was okay but it wasn't crunchy (maybe they made it in advance and reheated it???) 
The drinks were also a bit pricey... over £8 for ume-shu!? wha!?
However these weren't big enough gripes to detract a star, so I think I have found my new favourite ramen shop.",1
3,"Decided to give this place a try last night and was really impressed. Inexpensive, good atmosphere, and polite staff. Highly recommend the spinach and prawn wrap.",-1
5,"Excellent food. Excellent atmosphere. Excellent service.
The tasting menus are very good, with a great variety of foods all with high quality. The dim sum is great, the ribs and peppered steak is juicy and has great flavor, and the prawns are outstanding. The desserts are good, but not exceptional. The very cool atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Highly recommended.",1
4,Simply delicious. Upscale dim sum restaurant. As a tourist this place was loaded with locals. Fast service and large dessert selection. I wish they had one in Los Angeles.,1
1,"What is the fuss all about?
I am now wishing I had read Yelp reviews BEFORE we went.  
Picked this place to celebrate a friend visiting London, for a big milestone birthday dinner.  What a terrible choice.
Being from Vancouver and then Toronto, I was spoiled for choice for good sushi.  Ever since moving to Europe, I've had a tough time finding something as delicious as my favourite haunts in Toronto.  
So naturally, I thought Nobu, world famous, name-dropped on shows, etc.etc., must have decent sushi.  I had high expectations.
The food was...meh.
Small portions, expensive, and not that impressive.  If you're from Vancouver or Toronto, seriously, that place down the street from you that you think has average food but is cheap does the same thing.
Ugh.  To add to it, the service was downright awful.  A couple of us had set dinners and a few of us shared small plates.  Only those of us who declared ""sharing"" were allowed plates.  Other people asked, and were TURNED DOWN.  I'm not even kidding you here - ""oh no sir, you don't need a plate.""  
As soon as the sharers finished, their plates and chopsticks were whisked away.  We protested ""but we want to keep our chopsticks so we can try a piece of other people's food!""  The server looked at us like we spoke Martian to her.
We were a party of 5 - four of us had received what we ordered, finished it all, before the fifth person received his first dish.  And he ordered three small dishes.  Yes, food comes staggered in a Japanese restaurant, but this was absolutely ridiculous.  You couldn't get out a sushi roll for this guy in 30 minutes, but everyone else at the table who ordered sushi got theirs in a timely manner?
Just...DON'T DO IT.
I'm so upset that my friend's birthday celebration was marred by such a terrible dining experience.  Wish I had kept the other reservation I made for that evening instead.",-1
2,"Let's start with the positives.  The dishes themselves were quite nice and certainly not standard indian cuisine.  If you are hoping to eat some familiar standards like tikka masala, this is not the place.  However, the food overall was good, not great.  I really did like the library themed bar and the bartender was very nice.
The bad.  We arrived at 8:02 for an 8pm reservation and had to wait 30 minutes for our table.  Once we were told our table was ready we went back to the main entrance and waited another 2-3 minutes while both hostesses ignored us.  Finally once we were seated our food took forever to arrive.  Food arrive at 9:30.  
The manager wound up comping our drinks in the bar and several items from our meal.  I do appreciate them recognizing the service issues we had.  But all in all, even if we were seated on time and food came relatively quickly I probably still would have been a little underwhelmed given both the hype of this place and the plethora of other Indian restaurants in London.",-1
3,"Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to try Bone Daddies on a chilly Tuesday night before a gig at Madame Jojo's around the corner. We arrived at 6:40pm to find the queue already out the door, but were assured that the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. Waiting in the bitter cold certainly increased our craving for a hot bowl of soup, and luckily we were seated just 10 minutes later at the bar facing the street window. 
After unsuccessfully trying to make ourselves comfortable on the bar stools, we ordered the following dishes:
+Spicy Kimchi Ramen with Prawns, Mussels, Egg, and Corn in Fish Broth - Though not listed online, our amicable server assured us that this dish (his favourite) has become a permanent fixture on the menu. This aggressively spiced soup exceeded my expectations and is now one of my favourite noodle-based soups in London. The opaque red broth coated the ramen noodles in a clean fish flavour with a strong kick from the chilli. The lightly fried prawns and mussels that topped the soup were tasty, but the amount of seafood was a bit skimpy.
+Tantanmen Ramen with Sesame, Chilli, Pork Mince, and Bok Choy in Chicken Bone Broth - This soup tasted mainly of peanut butter, which was an unpleasant surprise to my bf. Though we were warned that the dish contains peanuts (in case of an allergy), the predominant peanut flavour should be mentioned in the description.
+Pickle Plate - A well-executed plate with a variety of pickled vegetables (cauliflower, daikon, carrots, beets), kimchi, and pickled Asian pear. A must for any lover of pickled foods.
I also ordered a Maiken-Me cocktail (shochu, ume shu, watermelon, salt) which unfortunately tasted like the nondescript cocktails served at karaoke bars around London and cost nearly as much as a bowl of ramen. Save your money.
I thoroughly enjoyed my seafood ramen with kimchi, but am not sure I would try any of the other broths on the menu after struggling with a few spoonfuls of my boyfriend's Tantanmen. I am not generally a fan of tonkotsu broth to begin with though, so I found the lighter flavour and consistency of the fish broth welcome. However, Bone Daddies should be more explicit about the strong peanut taste in their Tantanmen ramen. Many people (including my boyfriend, unfortunately) have a strong aversion to the taste of peanut butter, which the broth resembled after it had cooled. The Tantanmen ramen reduces my rating of Bone Daddies from four stars to three.

5,"This is by the best meal I had in London (and maybe life). This is not a drill. I love Indian food, so I couldn't pass up the chance to try out the highly rated Dishoom restaurant. This was my first stop and meal in the area before drinks at Happiness Forgets, so I was super excited to try some of their dishes.
Must Try's:
- Butter-bhutta: next level corn on the cob. Love the chili, butter, lime on top of the grilled corn. I am drooling thinking of this.
- Black House Daal: simmered over 24 hours, there is a reason this is highlighted and outlined on the menu. Pure dopeness. Trust me. Taste the creaminess in it. Tastes like winning the lottery twice.
- Lamb boti kabab: are you serious???? I'm not even a fan of lamb and this was a standout. The meat is smothered with this delicious spice rub that penetrates it all the way to its core. You like boring drab dry meat? This dish is not for you.
- Ruby Chicken: for all you basic Indian food lovers, this is your default chicken tikka masala and it's the best you will ever had
- Bowl of greens: sounds basic, but come on, get your veggie on with some grilled broccoli, snow pea, and spinach dressed in some delicious lime and chili sauce. If you're like me and don't get eating bread or rice (I'm weird, I know), this is your go to side dish.
Also shoutout to the beverage game here. Watermelon drink (non-alcoholic) and the toddy were also friggin mind blowing.",1
3,"People rave about this place but I've never gotten the fuss. Can see the appeal if you are eating with a large group and share some dishes, but I'd always opt for a more run of the mill local Indian if given the choice.",-1
3,"If you are looking for a wonderfully polite service, attentive to your every need, this isn't it. However what you can guarantee is good food, well cooked and fast. Part of the allure of Wong Kei's are the surly, busy waiters running around like flies and doing their best to avoid the wrath of their manager.
 From most of the reviews on this page you can see the service is non-existent, but almost everyone agrees the food is tasty. And better still, it is cheap as chips (or chow mein). If you want a good night out with a group of friends, where better to go than a bustling noisy Chinese restaurant, where the conversation will be endless thanks to a few impolite members of staff.",-1

(

 )
 I have a love-hate relationship with Hakkasan  there are so many things to admire about this place but also so much I dislike. Over the years, I have returned many times to Hakkasan, and on every visit I found that what I loved most about this place - the food - had been consistently good. My last visit was no exception.
 Much has been said about French designer Christian Liaigre's multi million pound interior, Hakkasan's Michelin Star rating in 2003, and its listing in S. Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2008, so I will not go over old ground.
 Despite the occasional snooty service, and the extortionate prices for their teas I keep going back. I love the décor, and unlike many, I do not feel that the restaurant lighting is excessively dark - I find it soothing and feel that it adds to the overall experience at Hakkasan.
 I was pleasantly surprised to find I was able to book a table at 12:30pm for dim sum when I called on that same Saturday morning. Dr G and I headed to the familiar spot on Hanway Place, and were soon seated. We ordered a pot of Orchid Pao Chung tea @ £4.30 and a selection of eight dim sum dishes. These were:
 Scallop shumai with tobiko caviar @ £5.20  the scallops tasted fresh, and were within the finest skin I have encountered. The tobiko caviar added a sophisticated look and a pleasant saltiness/crunchiness to the delicate scallops.
 Braised beef brisket with cheung fun @ £4.80  this was also delicious although I was expecting to have beef brisket cheung fun not with cheung fun (my mistake!). The meat was braised to perfection in a deliciously sweet broth with hints of cinnamon and star anise. It was lovely to be able to finish off this delicious sauce with the added cheung fun.
 Crispy smoked duck and pumpkin puff @ £4.80  I loved both the presentation and flavours of this dish. The combination of pumpkin and duck was perfect and made for a good alternative to the more usual prawn & pork combo.
 Sticky rice in lotus leaf with wind dried pork and salted duck egg yolk @ £4.50 this was also a delicious dish with plenty of salted duck egg and pork filling in a thin case of sticky rice.
 Pan fried turnip cake with garlic and Chinese chive @ 5.50  the cake had a lovely texture, was crispy on the outside with a delicious flavor of fried chives and garlic. This was one of the highlights.
 Steamed corn-fed chicken bun with abalone and crabmeat @ £4.50  the combination of the different meats was surprisingly good within a light and delicious pastry.
 Steamed crabmeat siew long bun @ £6.00  Hakkasan's take on xiao long bao or Shanghai dumplings was as expected excellent, with plenty of soup and a thin, delicate skin.
 Sweet black sesame ball @ £3.30  stunning presentation and a light, fragile outer casing containing a generous amount of rich, sweet and nutty black sesame paste. This was a fantastic dessert and one I will make sure to order on my next visit.
 I apologize for the poor quality of the pictures. Hakkasan is renowned for not allowing any photography, and I was politely asked by management to stop taking pictures.
 Cost: £52 for two, or £26 per person including 13% (!) service charge. This is nearly twice as much as I would normally pay in most dim sum eateries in London.
 Likes: Excellent quality dishes beautifully presented, ultra fresh ingredients, stunningly designed restaurant.
 Dislikes: Efficient but impersonal service, no refilling of tea pot, and no photography allowed.
 Verdict: Hakkasan is one of those restaurants many would love to hate. I love it. I am still surprised by the amount of hostility this place attracts but in my opinion, despite the ridiculously high prices and the impersonal service, the food is fantastic and I will certainly be going back for more.",1
5,"The absolute best restaurant we've been to so far in London. It has the perfect romantic atmosphere that won't soon be forgotten by your significant other. Everything was perfect, from the drinks and  starters, to the main course, and dessert. The service was outstanding. I would say, easily the best restaurant I've had a chance to experience. You've got to try it when in London.",1
3,"Visited on a short trip to London (from California). Menu is not that Vegi/Vegan friendly. Service was good and they accommodated my request for customization. Taste of food was ok, not too great... apart from history, I feel it was not worth the money... 
If I am in Piccadilly again, I would go to other places...",-1
5,"Still can't grasp just how magical this trip is. Hubs truly did it and made reservations awhile back to have dinner at Clos Maggiore. Named, ""The most romantic restaurant in the world."" And by all means this post is not meant in any way to boast but rather to suggest to you if you or know of someone that is a huge foodie or and looking for a beautiful experience in dining while in London please share this place on. My husband and I love trying different cuisines and wines when we can. So I truly would love to take a moment to share with you of this beautiful gem off Covent Garden in London. From the moment we walked in, the amazing food, impressive 2,500+ in international wine selection, and impeccable service are just few to describe of the wonderful experience we had when we were there. There is a 6-7 month wait list for reservations but is well worth it, so book ahead. A romantic and small French cafe from the outside leads you in to a warm greeting as they'll help you to your area of seating request. From that moment we were lost in words entering the most beautiful conservatory elegantly adorned with cherry blossoms above. We then met our waiter Hugo.Attentive, wonderful and just made sure we really enjoyed ourselves. He helped answered all of our questions, made sure if we had any food allergies, and thoroughly explained what each dish was and how it was prepared. We then tried the seasonal tasting menu which consisted of 5 dishes starting with: Handpicked dorset crab mayonnaise with green apple & mango salsa, followed by the most delicious Pan-roasted Les Landes Duck Foie Gras with Fig and Oat biscuit, Pan-roasted and smoked wild sea bass with smoked haddock and leek croquette, oven-roasted and herb smoked Íberiko pork loin with chorizo and sweet peppers. Every dish was decadent, flavorful and truly unique on its own but complimented the dish right before it perfectly. At this point-of-time I thought I had reached my limit on tummy capacity. I mean, how could I even possibly take another bite? But it's dessert! there's always room for dessert!We finished it off with Blackcurrant sorbet paired with champagne foam. Mind blown. Please be sure to give them a visit when you're in town, you truly won't regret it.",1
4,"I have been on the hunt for some good ramen joints so I was very excited to find Bone Daddies. Back in the states ramen places like this are everywhere and they just now seem to be catching on in London.
We tried the fried chicken and the tonkotsu ramen. Both items were delicious. The chicken came out hot and crispy with great flavor. The ramen broth was rich and comforting and I was very eggcited to get a soft boiled egg as well.
TONKOTSU RAMEN with spring onion, chashu pork(20 hour pork bone broth)",1
3,"There were six of us which afforded us the luxury of reserving a table in advance. But even calling a month ahead only got us a reservation at 18:00!
Nevertheless, I digress. 
We were seated in the dark lower level. Nice low lighting for an intimate dinner but it made for difficult reading of the menu. We managed to order a wide selection of food which was all delicious. Highlights were the tender lambchops, calamari, gunpowder potatoes, cheese toasts and the briyanis. The chutneys were also very good. 
The service felt pushy. They told us they needed our table back in 2 hours which was fine but the meal felt very rushed. They had us in and out in less than an hour. We ordered some samosas which arrived while we were still placing our order since it was being relayed wirelessly back to the kitchen.  Really? They couldn't wait until the waitress left our table to start bringing food out? I also felt the waitress was trying to suggestively upsell us along the way - would you like a lassi? Maybe a saucier dish to go with your meal? A trip to the loo also meant being accosted by staff and being herded in the right direction rather than being politely asked if I needed help.  I relayed this all back to the manager via email who was apologetic about the experience.
I really enjoyed the food but the experience was not relaxing as the service was too in your face. The Shoreditch branch does a much better job in the delicate balancing act of turning tables and delivering a good service experience. The food serves 4 stars but the service really brings it down to 3.",-1
2,"In a word, the breakfast I had here was incredibly underwhelming, and the other people in my party said the exact same thing.  The service was not bad by any means, but the servers did come off as a little bit scattered.  My waffles were quite dry on their own, and the fact that they gave me no syrup with them really did not help.  One person in my party ordered scrambled eggs, and they were essentially in liquid form.  It was actually quite disgusting, even to look at, let alone eat it.  I know that this place has a good reputation, especially the NYC location, so I was disappointed by the experience.",-1
1,"Do not waste your time.  The service here is completely terrible.  I don't care how good the food is,I wouldn't let my dog eat here based on how rude they were.",-1
5,I went there for New Year's Eve with 5 other friends. Everyone was truly satisfied with the food. I had the Pipa duck... Brilliant. The service and the atmosphere are also two things that bring this restaurant close to perfection.,1
3,"A beautiful looking restaurant with a chic and bubbly vibe. The food did not live up to the ambience though. I was excited looking at the menu but when it came the dim sum was quite pasty and stodgy and not at all light like it is in China. The portion vs cost does not balance as each dish averages at £4 and consists of 3 small peices of dim sum.
 The staff spoke poor english and I had to translate what they were saying to my dinner companion. Their good nature did make up for the lack of linguistic skills though!
 The food took a long time and so did the drinks but it was ram jam packed out.
 For 2 people with one alcoholic drink it came to £45. All that said, I would go there again.",-1
3,"Nice food, good costumer service. The ramen was well served, well condiment. The spice plate was hot but not excessive",-1
5,"FINALLY a tasty ramen shop in London! It's been over a year and a half since I moved here from LA and I've been so sad about the quality of Asian food here. Everything seems to fall flat, and I don't know why.
I went with a friend and had their cabbage and miso (starter), artichoke (starter), and Tonkotsu Ramen. The starters were incredibly moreish. The cabbage reminds me of a very homey veg + dip my family eats in China and is a fab alternative to the typical edamame. The artichoke is paired with a delicious dip with just enough kick to keep you interested. We also tried a pineapple sake and Asahi beer. The beer is some special Asahi brew (I don't understand beer so don't quote me) but it stayed really cold and had a delicious rice-flavored aftertaste. The pineapple sake is dangerous -  reminds me of the fruity yogurt soju at korean bars - tastes like juice!
Bone Daddies do chashu pork really well. They do broth really well. They do their eggs so freaking well that I would push you, your mother, your grandmother, AND your little dog down the stairs to get more. Luckily for your family, you can order extra, and for a mere £1. Perfectly soft-boiled and so flavorful, the egg was the star for me. I have had fantastic broth at Ippudo in NYC and Daikokuya in LA but that egg is legend. And speaking with Chef Ross, it's only going to get better. I am dancing in anticipation.
Almost forgot to mention another star - their homemade chili oil. Don't be intimidated by the chili flakes in there. It adds a toasty, smokey, warm heat to the ramen without being overpoweringly spicy. I think it's a must, if only because it adds yet another dimension of flavor.
It's a brand new restaurant so they are constantly working on their menu, broth, and noodles. I personally thought it was all amazeballs, but I certainly welcome their ambition for better.
If you're one of those people who think Wagamama is an acceptable place for food, do yourself a favor and get schooled by Bone Daddies.",1
5,"I just started working in the area and my coworker sent me here for the ""best ramen in London"" and it was so delicious! Our server helped me pick what to order after discussing my spicy tolerance levels. Portions are large and prices are very fair for London. He picked the perfect dish! A trendy place with friendly vibes and a social laid back atmosphere.",1
5,Superb ramen. Boyfriend had the tonkatsu ramen and I had the dipping ramen. Appreciated the clean hair ties at the table for long-haired folks. Fun establishment and a great find for delicious food.,1
5,"Expensive but it is worth it!
Not your Restaurant for a casual dinner in the evening.
But if you have planned something special, this is the place to be. Beautiful interior design. Great Atmosphere. And the food is excellent.
The Dumplings as a stater are a must have!
Cocktails are awesome and dont let me start on the dessert. Exceptional!
The Service is very .. lets say frequent. It gets a bit annoying over time. But they are very friendly
Of course its very expensive but its well worth thw money. We paid 120 pounds for 2 people with shared starter and shared dessert. Plus 2 cocktails and Water.
But if you want to have a special dinnrr with somebody. Hakkasan is a good spot.",1
5,"This is by far my favourite restaurant in London. The setting is incredibly romantic, the food is exquisite, the wine list impeccable. I have been here 3 or 4 times now and loved every experience. It is pretty pricey but if no more expensive than other restaurants of the same standard (and I don't think there are many of those around to be honest!) There is a private room available for hire upstairs but the conservatory area in the main dining room is where you want to be for the best ambience. I almost don't want to post this review because then you'll all go there and I want to keep it just for me!",1
5,"Favorite spot to eat in London. Be prepared to come to the restaurant right when they open or you can stand in line for hours. Really. If you can make a reservation well in advance I would make certain to do so. Had we known about the wait time we would have done this before traveling here- but we were bound and determined to eat here and someone recommended coming around 9:45 so the chances of 7 of us getting a table would be better. We did, and they were. Our wait was only an hour compared to the three hour wait that we left for the few nights prior. 
The wait IS worth it, however. Every. Single. Dish. Is perfection. Garlic, cheese and original naan all are melt in your mouth incredible. If you really are a lover of Indian food I would recommend ordering every dish off the menu- none will disappoint and the drinks are equally impressive. 
Huge fans.",1
2,"Disappointing, both relative to other ramen restaurants in London and as an experience in and of itself. I found my main dish average (though for full disclosure, I ate the Tori Kara-Age Men which is not made with their famous pork broth) and the surrounding dishes (with the exception of a delicious Chicken Bun) unexciting. The sashimi sampler tasted as if had been sitting out for a while. And the fruit flies that were buzzing around during our meal also didn't help the ambiance... Needless to say, I was expecting more from my meal at Shoryu. And good service from a pleasant and attentive waitstaff could not make up for mediocre food.",-1
4,"Pretty good black bean chow fun. Excellent sweet and sour sauce and very good service. They need better tables, but other than that I was quite satisfied.",1
4,"Yep, Dishoom has a fan in me.
With an overly trendy place in Shoreditch, you expect the worst. Higher unjustified prices, average quality and take-it-or-leave-it service. Not the case here, especially when you compare Dishoom against its traditional competitors over in Brick Lane. You see, Dishoom doesn't carry the price tag you'd expect, and is in fact a little bit cheaper - and a very respectable quality to boot. Yes, I admit, some of the menu names and descriptions are hard to fathom and err on the side of wanky, but don't be too put off.
The drinks menu is fun, and you could easily just treat this place as a bar and leave very happy. Not cheap mind, but their cocktails are well made and imaginative. 
The food here ranges from ok to actually really rather good. My favourite was the lamb chop, closely followed by the biryani. I can forgive the average naan. Indian food done well, and without the grease.
The place has an exciting feel to it. Certainly very different to the white table-clothed Indian restaurants you're used to - it's decked out in original decor that might just cause you to take a very long toilet break as you stop and look at/read the stuff on the wall. The bow-tied subservant waiters are gone too, replaced by the young/trendy type who strangely have the same hair cut (girls and boys), but they just about get it right - informative and not overly up their own arse. Which is a pleasant treat for Shoreditch.
The courtyard is great for the warmer months.
I'll be back.",1
3,The steak was good but not as good as some of the other locations. The restaurant was crowded and the service staff did not care much. We went quite early so even though they don't take reservations we were able to get a table fast.,-1
3,"Currently, this is the place to be and be seen due to it's celebrity clientele - so jumping on the band wagon, we headed to Chiltern Firehouse for Sunday Brunch.   
While the decor is beautiful; plush booths, an incredible tiled bar where you can watch the food being made and everything you'd really expect from a restaurant with such a great reputation, I was a little disappointed.  
 The staff cannot be faulted for their manners and service, they're attentive and helpful but at times it felt like they were a little too attentive. We'd barely been sat down two minutes before they had rushed over to take our order, and the food was as quickly set onto the table in front of us.   
Honestly, I can't fault the food - it was well presented, well cooked and tasted lovely, however I wouldn't say it was any better than some other cheaper restaurants in London. When you're paying such a high price tag, you would expect something a little more mind blowing than what we were served. The champagne cocktails were probably the highlight of the meal, while the coffee was weak and a little tasteless.   
Would I recommend this place? Sure, if only for the experience of saying you've been and done a little celeb spotting while you were at it - but sadly I feel that's probably the best feature of the place.",-1
5,"As many have highlighted already, the ramen is very good (Tonkotsu, Shoyu), the atmosphere is ""cool"" (very Soho-ish) and the staff is super friendly and helpful. 
Yes, it's a bit loud. Yes, the dishes are not exactly how a traditional ramen bar in Osaka would prepare them (but maybe a hip place in Tokyo's Daikanyama district would) but nonetheless they are very tasty and I find that it gives the place part of its personality.
I had to queue outside 2 out of 3 times, but the waiting was ok and you could already order beers while standing up in line (when you were inside the bar). Plus, in most good ramen places in Japan I had always had to wait in line for a bit.
The people are also an interesting mix: several Japanese were eating there, and this is always a good sign. You could see locals (albeit towards the posh side of the spectrum) and tourists alike plus your occasional hollywood star and successful musician (I'm referring to you Gwyneth P. & Chris M. ;-) but nobody seemed to care (which is nice).",1
3,"Lamb chops were overrated. The potatoes were really weak... the chicken curry is not bad but not amazing. The Dahl had a good taste but once again, not amazing. 
The only thing that I really enjoyed were the Lamb Samosas. I may be spoiled with the Indian food in San Francisco and Bay Area but this place just was not special to me.",-1
2,"There's something very egalitarian about chain restaurants. They simply don't care who you are and aren't at all bothered about trying to impress you specifically. No bookings, you turn up, wait your turn, and get the same service as everyone else. In his excellent review in the Guardian, Jay Rayner recounts how he had to stand outside in the queue with the rest of the rabble too, slightly discombobulating I've no doubt, for a man used to a certain level of recognition. After a late afternoon meeting over wine (the best sort of meeting) me and my two guests thought about staying in the rarified atmosphere of the Ivy Club but in the interests of investigative research joined Mr Rayner and other food luminaries by queuing at Dishoom. 
Dishoom has been referred to (mainly by the PR team) as a Bombay style cafe. An egalitarian, open all hours canteen serving taxi drivers, students, writers and lawyers (according to their puff anyway)...None of those stereotypes were notably present on the night, predominantly, our fellow diners were more the middle class braying London types you traditionally find clogging up the greener parts of zone 2.
There's got to be a book written for this. 'Food Branding 2.0 - lessons for the post Pizza Express generation'. Like the equally insipid Jamie's Italian next door, and 'gourmet, authentic Mexican fine dining experience' (more PR bullshit) Cantina Laredo next door to that, the team behind Dishoom seem to have swallowed the whole volume, hook, (press) line and sinker. It's somewhat sinister having all three of them next to each other. It's the kind of line-up better suited to touting for passing trade outside a Croydon multiplex rather than prime real estate in the centre of London. 
The food is casual, safe and generic Indian (at risk of insulting a large country). It doesn't seem to come from anywhere specific, and certainly didn't bear any relation to what (admittedly little) I know of the hot, spicy street food of the region. For a coastal city, you'd expect fish to feature heavily, the best they could do was a 'Dill Salmon (that well known Indian fish) Tikka'. Our starters included Bombay Sausages, a student dinner party staple of the future fusing chipolatas, onion and curry paste, Chilli Cheese (on) Toast, pleasant but utterly underwhelming, and a dish called Keema Pau, minced lamb in a ragu style sauce served alongside a muffin.  These came with fridge fresh pickle pots and a highlight, perfectly chilled Meantime Union beer. 
Our main courses were similarly pedestrian. The Chicken Biryani was nicely presented in a clay pot with a pastry seal but arrived dry, beautifully but subtly fragranced and lacking in a core ingredient. ""Do they serve the chicken on the side?"" questioned the Drama Queen, apparently not, it was just hiding (very well) in the rice. The taste was as subtle and shy as a thirteen year old at a school disco, it felt like nothing more than an accompaniment. The Spicy Lamb Chops came with some semblance of taste and some of the vim and zing you'd expect from a decent kitchen. Beautifully cooked, tender and juicy, they were the one high point for me. The final plate, a Lamb Boti Kebab was dry again and chewier than expected.  
There's a niche in the market for a chain Indian, and Dishoom gives a good argument for filling it. For anyone who's ventured within a mile of Tayyabs or Lahore in the East End, or been to some of the great curry houses of Birmingham, Southall or Bradford you're going to be left wanting. That being said, if you're stuck in theatreland with kids or random relatives who ""don't usually like that spicy foreign stuff"", you could do worse. And if that isn't damning with faint praise, I don't know what is.",-1
3,"Nice Indian street food style food which is quite trendy at the moment.
Good size portions for sharing. Bit pricey for what you get but it is Covent Garden.
I didn't rate the calamari or the chilli cheese toast. Calamari was really oily, small bity bits and the toast was just that - toast.......
It's better than the usual English curry houses so handy for a quick Indian fix but still a bit too trendy for me. I like my Indian food in a no frillls way.",-1
2,"Overpriced average food wrapped in a nice decor sprinkled with attitude. Awful service and manager. You always have to wait for a table even with a reservation (even a famous actor was screaming at them), service is not what you would expect for these prices. Never again.",-1
1,Waited patiently for 45 mins for a meal that never arrived. Won't be rushing back,-1
1,"It was my first time for me and my friend in Covent Garden. I ordered Bhel puri which was good. In mains, we ordered Lamb Biryani which I didn't like it at all. It was very dry and the rice had melted more than what it was supposed to be. I am a Biryani lover and after having heard so much about Dishoom, this wasn't the place what I expected it to be. We were sitting in the basement which was very dark than usual and way too noisy. Not a perfect place for me.",-1
3,"Roast duck is a must and is the only saving grace of the meal! Everything else was ordinary and meh.  Veggies were greasy and my friend felt sick after. This is definitely a legitimate Cantonese restaurant, though. 
I've had better elsewhere and for less £",-1
3,"A really cute and cosy French restaurant! The food was fair - and the price was reasonable. However, the service was excellent, and there was a great atmosphere in there...which is why I would probably go back and give the food another chance. And also to order something with the garlic potato puree! I totally had food envy when I tried some that my boyfriend had...it was to die for.
Actually...it's worth visiting just for the garlic potato puree!",-1
3,"After skirting by this place maybe 87 times in my life...I finally decided to go in.  And I've repeated that decision.  So that means it's 3 stars (somehow this review seems very unenthused).
Great prices and tasty noodle and rice dishes (unagi mmm!) - I would skip the sushi though, seriously...just no.  If you're looking for something that's open relatively late for this city, perhaps after a show (I had just watched Jude Law's modern portrayal of Hamlet, complete with skinny jeans), then this would be the spot to go to.  
Don't expect to be able to sit and wax lyrical over something or other for hours and hours; it's in the heart of Chinatown and next to a bar complete with colorful patrons spilling out looking for a bite.  
I do love people watchin here though !!",-1
2,"Damn fine ramen of the creamy tonkotsu variety which would merit 4 stars but for the terrible service.  Waiters and the manager seemed to ignore our eye contact and repeated polite hand signals, so I had to get up from the table to ask for a menu.  After another several hand signals we were able to order, and received our food after yet another delay.  Unless you're desperate for ramen (no shame in that), I'd recommend avoiding it.",-1
3,"Gosh this place does some things really well but other things are just really awful. Their cantonese style bbq-ed meats are justly popular. Most people go for the roast duck but I find their soy sauce chicken is quite delicious as well. For a little bit more than a fiver, you can get a decent portion of bbq, a little bit of veg, and a pile of rice.
However I made the mistake of coming here for dinner and trying some things off their ""specials"" menu. In chinese, they all sounded very appetising and more interesting than western style chinese food. In the end however what we got did not live up to what I was expecting; certainly nowhere close to what I've had in Vancouver, Hong Kong, San Francisco, even Royal China here in London. The portion sizes were extremely small, mediocre in skill, and poor value.
I say stick to the rice plate and roast meat and you'll do fine.",-1
3,"This is a superb restaurant, the food is quite tasty.  But I was a bit disappointed with the service. Be sure you bring a lot of patience.  Didn't want to - but was forced to knock down two stars - customer service is everything.",-1
5,"Went for a quick bite at 18.30. Place was half empty but reception still checked their bookings, which always makes me smile. I suppose they do need to check that they might have forgotten that 100 people were arriving en mass.
However she was charming and it was all smiles to our table. Been four times here and never been disappointed, food is great. My favourite is the Green Tea Smoked Ribs, but we always try new things. Not China Town prices, but as you would expect from an Alan Yau venture, the quality is several steps up. A real treat.",1
4,"Jumped in last night for a bite before heading home. While it's not completely authentic, it is an excellent Western take on Japanese/Chinese noodles. The hubs got his normal tonkatsu ramen. The broth was steaming hot and unctuous, but the pork a little chewy. Still, for someone as picky about his Japanese carbs, he deemed it a success. He was thrilled by the fact that they serve a bowl with two eggs, instead of just one (it's the little things, really). 
I tried the tantanmen ramen--a take on Sichuan dan dan noodles (often on the top of my cravings list). It was spectacular. The broth was a beautiful combination of spice and umami. Let's just say, I could eat that bowl of noodles every day. The burn builds substantially with each bite, and by the end my nose was a bit runny (a sign of an excellently hot dish in my book). We also tried the karaage (fried chicken), which was well fried, but the breading lacked a bit in flavour.
Topped off with some ice cold Asahi, we were both impressed with this new spot in Soho. And while they say they're open late, I've yet to come across a noodle place open past Midnight. My little American gripe--Midnight is not late. I've barely just finished dinner by that point. Other than that, the space is large and open playing some of the best American rock from the 70s to the 90s. We sat at the counter facing the hipster cycle shop across the street, which (of course) meant brilliant people watching. 
All in all, a new staple to our Asian restaurant repertoire.",1
4,"A meal I truly enjoyed but it could of gotten anywhere from three to five stars.  First, the issue some other Yelpers complained about, ""bouncers"" outside has been resolved.  Rather than anyone intimidating, a very nice women met us outside and checked our reservation, as well as making sure the staff downstairs was prepared for us.
In terms of the meal itself, again I can see how it could anything from three to five stars.  The menu is fantastic.  Probably twenty, twenty-five dishes I wish I could of ordered.  The problem was there definitely was inconsistency.  Some food was wow, this is what I expect from a top London restaurants.  Others were weaker than what you would get at a local Chinese restaurant.  Started with the Dim Sum platter, which was interesting, but flavor and complexity did not stand up to the top Dim Sum around Leicester Square.  The appetizers that jumped out were duck rolls (spring rolls filled with duck) and the ribs, which had a great caramelized exterior.  Both of those clearly five stars.
I was with four other people so we were able to sample multiple entrees.  I had Pipa Duck, effectively peking duck without the pancakes.  It was perfectly prepared and everyone who tried it loved it.  Also stand out was a black beef dish.  On the other hand sweet and sour berkshire pork had no more flavor or complexity than I would expect in an airport and was left half eaten).  Dessert was also good but not memorable.
Service was definitely five stars, friendly, attentive, but not overpowering.  Atmosphere is fantastic either for a business dinner or date.
Overall a great experience but the food should have been more consistent.",1
1,"One of the worst experience in a restaurant in my life. Both the food and the service, we have one friend who just had an injury on her leg so we asked if we can eat at the ground floor to avoid climbing the stairs. The waiter rudely checked my friend's leg to see if I am lying, we almost left because of it. 
In the end my friend didn't want to ruin the mood so we still stay. Fortunately we sat at the ground floor as we asked but one of the guy in the counter gave us a disgust look. ( there were plenty of sits in the restaurant at the time we were really unsure why they make it so difficult) 
The food was as terrible as the service, the rice was cooked with just too much water, the rice stick together like a rice ball, we didn't finish the rice. The grilled duck I had was ok but not crispy at all if you are looking for authentic Cantonese cuisine. The waiter who helped us to order was nice though, but the food and the main service is horrible. Skip this place if you can.",-1
3,nice selection of dimsums and buns in modern building. it gives better taste i guess.,-1
4,"The perfect spot for a leisurely get-together with friends over delicious food and addictive chai (seriously, I could drink a gallon of the stuff). Beautiful decor and subtle acoustics means you can have a good old catch up without the echo factor.
So many great food options but my favourite have to be the daal and the naans various - all wonderful and full of flavour. Recommended!",1
3,"I came here having been hooked and reeled in by the spotlit rows of immaculate cakes in the window. But once in, I couldn't just order cake could I? So myself and a friend managed to share a fair few char sui buns and some gyoza dumplings between us before getting down to business with a crazily geometric pineapple concoction and a layered coffee and cream tart. It felt almost wrong eating these 'creations', they seemed just too perfect to look at. We finished with a jasmine tea, served in a delightful traditional jug. I would have to agree with other reviewers though, and say that for a pricey restaurant such as this to make such an effort with its food only to be let down by its waiter service is slightly sad.",-1
5,Dim Sum Sampler was amazing and so was the sea bass.  I will definitely be going to one of their other locations once I return to the US.  The desserts were especially amazing.  Food is like art here.,1
3,"The food here is great and very authentic Japanese cuisine. So far, we tried the katsu curry with rice and the nigiri set. Both are extremely delicious. One great thing here is that you can get a bonus on rice if you ask for them with any donburi or curry rice. 
But there is something less to be desired about the owners' attitude toward their customers. I tried to be friendly and speak Japanese with them, but they were extremely protective and replied in English sternly. Service level could be improved to make this store a better experience to be honest. But at least people will not be disappointed with the food! This place can also get quite crowded during weekends due to being a relatively small place.",-1
2,"Walking into the lounge, you're greeted with a lines and lines of beautiful desserts. 
You think: What kind of dim sum place this is? And you're ushered downstairs to a star lit dim room. 
Yauatcha is more a fusion sort of dim sum. Everything we had was typical chinese dim sum but they were just presented so clean and tasted mediocre. My parents remarked that we could get better dim sum for way cheaper back in San Francisco. I enjoyed all of the dishes we got, but I believe that there was nothing special about any of them. All of the plates were remarkably tiny sized for the amount we paid for it. 
The only dish I thought was worth checking out were the Prawn & Beancurd Cheung Fun. 
Oh and this place is the slowest service I have ever experienced before.. It takes forever to get anything done. Food comes out slow, waiters never seem to see you, water takes forever to come to the table. Oh and make sure you ask for tap water or they'll charge you for still water. 
I would recommend just coming here for drinks and desserts. We tried the Raspberry Delice. It looked better than it tasted. The lychee ice cream that came with it was much more delicious and unique.",-1
1,"Very poor service, finished my meal before receiving a drink. Asked twice about not having my drink while eating. Servers did nothing to fix this. I would avoid this one",-1
3,"Traveling from America and hearing that this place is a Michelin star restaurant meant I had to try it! We have one of their locations opening in Houston so had to taste their prime restaurant first. Reservations were made through OpenTable so it was fairly easy when I tried. We were greeted by the hostesses and brought down to their lower level dining area. Nice atmosphere.  Looking at their menu, it had so much a variety and different twists on traditional dim sum. My bf and I were so stoked. We ordered the Scallop Shu Mai, Lobster dumpling w/ tobiko, king crab dumpling, traditional shu mai (pork & shrimp), prawn cheung fun (shrimp roll wrapped in a clear rice layer),  and curry taro cake. The presentation for each dish was beautiful, they all looked so tasty. However, actually eating it... very mediocre. Maybe my taste palette is different from the dim sum I'm accustomed to, but the price and the hype didn't really justify what I tasted. Everything tasted exactly what it is. The lobster dumpling just tasted like pieces of lobster, the kind crab tasted like bits of king crab. The curry taro puffs were more overwhelming with curry than taro. The shrimp roll was ok... Very plain and bland. Scallop shu mai tasted like scallop. Even the traditional shu mai was ok...  All of them tasted like what it is, but nothing more. All of the ingredients did taste quite fresh, but it lacked so much in the flavor department. Quite disappointing. Did not get a chance to try any of their desserts. Service was good.",-1
2,Hey man this joint got no flavor. I wish I can ask the chef for a refund. I should've stopped by tesco express to add some spices and real ingredients. Please save your money and go elsewhere.,-1
5,"Great asian restaurant
 £36 - five persons, multiple dim sum dishes",1
3,"I was really excited to try a Michelin star restaurant. We came here to try their set menu ""Taste of Yauatcha"". The food was kind of a disappointment honestly, I expected better. It was nothing special at all. I've had better dimsum at other places. The service was good, our waiter was really nice and attentive. The atmosphere was different and cool.",-1
5,"great food - a superb salad with greens, mango and cheese slices, a nice rumali roti, a kaali daal and an awadhi lamb biryani to die for.",1
3,"I'm a fan of Ping Pong but this is not my favourite branch of the chain particularly due to its location which goes for and against it. 
The food and drinks are delicious, like in all branches of Ping Pong, and we went recently for the Sunday buffet for £18.99 which was fantastic value if like my friend and I, you believe you can eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and still walk out as if you've eaten a light salad! I've never known defeat like it. 
What lets this branch down, though obviously too is a plus, is its location on the busy  chain & tourist fest that is the Southbank. You cannot book, so on one busy Sunday we were turned away, and they are always busy so you have no other choice than to savour one of their delicious cocktails; juices; wines in the bar while you wait. You also need to be prepared to be seated with others while you dine. Sometimes this doesn't bother me but when you are trying to eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and you and your friends want an adult conversation, you'd rather it not be listened in on by tourist's and their young son! 
The staff were friendly and the service was good / quick considering how busy it was but I would rather not return to this branch.",-1
3,"I'm hovering around 3.5 here. Ultimately, the food was good, ""A-OK"" as the 3 star rating states.  I lived in an Indian neighborhood in Chicago so I've had a ton of really great Indian food -- the meal at Dishoom was good, but nothing I hadn't really tasted before. The flavors and spices were great and the chutneys were especially tasty. I do admire the tikka masala wrap I got that was a great lunch option.  The selection of lassis was also nice. Service was good, attentive and friendly, but I can't understand all the hype around the restaurant. The line during the evening was out the door and down the block.  If this is the case when you walk by, keep walking, it's not worth the wait.",-1
3,"Despite the hype, food doesn't deliver the goods. Drinks were well made however. That said a table in the garden is nice to dine in.",-1
5,"Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Huge portions, and dirty cheap. Food is tasty and served quicker than your average fast food chain.
 The whole 'expect abuse' thing is no more, and like all myths most seemt o want it to continue. Completely family friendly although you're likely to share a table with other guests. The chilli sauce is to die for.
 Good place for a quick feed, but if you're after a real 'dining experience' go elsewhere!",1
4,"Great dimsum in a fun area, perfect for meals before or after a play at The Globe or the National Theatre. We had an assortment of dimsums and tea, all of which were decent. Note, this isn't an authentic dimsum place as such, but it's a neat westernised atmosphere if you're not feeling like going to Chinatown. My favourite were the chicken with cashew nuts and the hargau. 
Service was decent, though it was generally busy in the restaurant. Allow for extra time before and after if you want to make it to a show.",1
4,"Is memory playing tricks , or are standards slipping here ?
 A recent Saturday lunch here was marred by a few things. First, the reduced size of the menu ( relative to days of yore, circa 2009), means that some of the ""wow"" factor dishes have disappeared. I lament, in particular, the passing of the salt-and-pepper quail. The venison puffs , which used to be so ethereal, are now merely nice. Worse still, some dishes I swear could have come from any one of a dozen places in Chinatown - pleasant, but wholly undistinguished.
 The drinks, as has been noted, are something of a stitch up - no mid-range sake, for example, only the cloudy version ( which comes in an effete pink bottle fit for Barbie and Ken, and can only be drunk cold). Brief discussion of the situation with staff suggested that they were pretty clueless on this score - not actually their fault if the leadership is not educating them.
 Saving graces ? Well the macaroons are still gorgeous, and the (much reduced) dessert menu does offer delights such as the Coconut Charlotte, so light and otherworldly I'd imagine it's the kind of thing angels eat as a holiday treat. The people inside are much prettier than in your average central London dim sum factory. It's not the place to come, perhaps, for a slap-up feed, but you'll be aware that you could have had something 75 % as good for 50% of the price elsewhere.",1
4,"Hubs and I were visiting London and interested in getting some Indian fare for dinner one thursday evening.  It was fairly late, on a weekday, so we were a little surprised to hear that the wait would be 1.5 hours.  But no matter, we weren't starving and we were on vacation, so thus, not a school night.
Ultimately I think we only waited around 45 minutes, so not bad at all!  Dishoom is so very charming, the decor and everything really sets the tone and mood for what you'll eat.  We tried to think of any chain in the US that comes close to what Dishoom achieves and came up short.  This place is pretty great.
We followed the advice of many reviewers before us and ordered the Ruby Chicken, along with a biryani and prawns.  I had the viceroy's old fashioned which was quite nice.
In short, the food was stellar.  My one comment would be that the biryani was a bit under-seasoned, but still quite delicious.
I almost wish we'd been hungrier!  Then we could have tried more things.  So much yum to be had!",1
2,My friend recommended this restaurant as a must eat. The ambience is super cute and modern. Food was ok. The service needs improvement (the lady refilled my husband's cup for water but completed neglected mine...how rude!) i want to like this place but I don't think I'll come back. I'd rather go to Chinatown for some dim sum.,-1
3,"I went there with my family during the weekend,which is understandably busy. The food was meh. The duck is the only saving grace for the night. We asked for the green chili and the waiter came back with the regular one,and when we pointed it out,he got frustrated and told us "" I have to walk back and forth for you"", and then went on rambling in Chinese,and I didn't understand a single word. Like I don't get how that was acceptable for a waiter to be pissed at us when I was more that sure that all of us were very polite asking for thing. Still not impressed, the only thing that saved the night for me was the duck.",-1
4,"Lol.  Apparently I already complained extensively about their lack of chinese desserts.  I'm still WTF all over it.
They make mean cocktails though.  And will make an old fashioned out of any whisky they have.
The prawn and beancurd cheung fan was to die for.
I'd come back for more cocktail and dim sum when my piggy bank is full.",1
5,"I was traveling in London with my mom and we desperately wanted dim sum. I looked on Infatuation London and this place sounded like exactly what we wanted. I only found out that it has one Michelin star after I had already made the reservation and I got 10 times more excited. Seriously, this was some of the best, most fancy dim sum I've ever had. The wagu beef puffs and the lobster dumplings were the stars of the show for sure. The drinks were also delicious and impressive. If you're ever in Soho going to see a show, go to Yauatcha first. But don't forget to make a reservation!!",1
3,"Nice place for a date, but not super romantic. Staff is good and friendly, but sometimes they fail to notice when they are needed. Food is of a good standard. Desserts were ok but not impressive in taste, display was great thou. Generally, nice and pleasant experience.",-1
2,"Not inedible, but just average by even San Francisco standards. Out the door for 235 pounds. 
Not again.",-1
3,"Cool atmosphere but to me I was expecting robust Indian food. The chicken ruby and black daal were bland in flavor. They said they had to ""cater to the masses"" when asked about dishes like Vendaloo.
I just say this because it is the first listing under ""indian or bangledeshi"" food. This is more of a Iranian fusion joint.",-1
5,"If you want to impress a girl, this is the place to take her. Clog Maggiore is one of the most romantic restaurant i have been to in London.
Food
1. Tuna Tartare - This is not the standard tuna tartare with avocado and tuna chunks that we get in California. To my surprise, its marinated in vinaigrette and serve with zucchini, squash and other garden vegetables. Truly refreshing - 4/5
2. Triple cooked chips (British call potato fries chips) - Nothing special to be honest - 3/5
3. Honey glazed duck breast - This is the signature dish and its exquisite. The duck is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. The honey glazed sauce compliments the duck so well and take away the gamey flavor of the meat. MUST TRY 5/5
4. Homemade Pasta in truffle cream sauce - They are very generous with the truffles and shave a bunch of truffles on the table side. I have had better truffle pastas but this was above average.  4/5
5. Creamed spinach - Standard 3/5
Decor
The conservatory seating area is very cosy and the lighting make it very romantic. The entire area is decorated in silk flowers to make you feel like you are in a garden in France. 
Pricing
This place won't break your bank. Price is reasonable consider the quality of the food, decor and service. 
Tip: Make sure to make a reservation in advance and request for the conservatory seating area. Its not worth it otherwise.",1
3,"I first went to Wong Kei in 1984 back when it was in its peak ""HOW MANY YOU?  UPSTAIR."" mode and ate here at least once a week when I still lived in London. I've lived overseas for a good few years but always make a point to visit WK when I'm back in London. The dishes had no change over the years at all: a good thing. March 2017, my first trip back since 2010, and the taste is much the same but now you can't order off menu and the portions are smaller. Also, the mixed meat chow ho fun didn't have liver in, which while not everyone's favorite did make it tastier. I'll always come back but the incredibly solid consistency has gone; it was a good run...",-1
4,"This is apparently the only Chinese restaurant to be awarded with a michelin star. It is often rated as the best Chinese restaurant in London and maybe deservedly so. This is not your average Chinese eaterie. This is Chinese fine dining style. The food was good, though I can't really remember what we ate which is usually a sign that it wasn't that memorable. The decor is dark and fancy (apparently you can't take pictures here as the owner doesn't want unauthorised pictures of his restaurant circulating around - didn't test this rumour). Our party of four was sat on one of the tables around the sides. Apparently the main tables in the middle were fully booked, but actually it didn't look to me like it would be that nice sat at the tables in the middle. To sum up - good food, dark fancy decor, high prices. Would recommend it just for the experience.",1
1,"Don't let Eve serve you!! She was rude: not only did she take the order of the couple next to me AFTER she had just seated me first, when I asked her why I had to wait, her response was that I hadn't waved my hand in the air to get her attention. Apparently everyone else in the restaurant could sit respectively, but I was expected to look like an idiot and wave my arms around. Right... Who says that to a customer?!?! She put up a little argument about taking off the service fee also. As if arguing with a customer is common practice. RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.",-1
5,"Loved this place! Went here with friends for a birthday and intend to go again soon.
Obviously the food is fantastic, but it's also quite refreshing to find a place where the mocktails aren't a total rip off. While we waited for a table (dinner reservations are only available for groups of six or more) we had passionfruit sharbats - perfect for the warm evening and unlike anything else I'd ever had before. Fortunately, we didn't have to kill time drinking too many of these, and were shown to our table fairly promptly, despite it being dinner time on a Sunday.
There were five of us in total, and our waiter was particularly helpful - advising us to try and pick as much variety as possible, and letting us know that we'd probably only need one or two servings of rice between us (we were about to order three bowls). When our food arrived it was amazing. It arrived surprisingly rapidly and tasted really fresh. Personally, I was feeling a bit under the weather, and while I'm sure that the food isn't exactly healthy or low calorie, it felt really nourishing and quite gentle on my stomach; something I wouldn't expect from Indian food, which can often be overpowering and heavy.
Even though we ate quite a lot, for some reason we decided to order dessert as well. Quite a gluttonous move, so maybe go a bit easy on the main course if you want to sample the dessert menu as well! I chose the guju chocolate mousse - a rich, slightly salty mousse which comes with berries.
Another good thing about Dishoom is that they don't automatically add on the service charge. We tipped our waiter generously because the service was so good, but it's still nice for it to be left to your discretion. I hate having to kick up a fuss when I've received below par service which I'm then expected to pay extra for.
By the time we left, I was completely stuffed and I barely ate a thing the day after. But when my appetite returned, I wanted to go straight back to Dishoom!",1
2,"Check your bill carefully, and count your change!   Came on at 17:30, had a nice meal, and obviously had to get going for a show, I had my cash out.  Gave us a bill that was 11£ to much, over charge was on a glass of wine.   Could have been a simple error but three servers were hunched over the area where my bill was being prepared.  There were only three tables of diners in the place.",-1
5,"Luckily we came on a Monday afternoon at 2pm and it was not crowded at all. We requested to sit in the veranda which was super cute, faint scent of incense that made me feel like I was in an anthropologie store. We shared the prawn kolowada (yummy, could have used some lime), chicken tikka (very nicely seasoned, cooked well, white meat a bit on the dry side) , the mattar paneer (soo good, more satisfying with rice instead of naan IMO), garlic naan is much more satisfying than the roti. The house chai is the most delicious I've ordered in London. we also shared the kala khatta hola ice dessert and unless you really like Asian salted dried plums, you might not enjoy this, not even past the fifth spoonful. I can see why everyone raves about this place!!",1
4,"Heard this place was hard to get into but we made a reservation for an early dinner at 5 p.m. and got in with no problems. There were several empty tables around us but they quickly filled up as we got closer to 6 p.m. This location is fairly big with two levels of seating and an outdoor patio. The downstairs space seems to be a little more romantic.
We started with an appetizer of vegetable samosas, which were perfectly cooked and served with 3 different chutneys. After that we shared the sheekh lamb kebabs, biryani rice and naan. Everything was great! only complaint was that the lamb kebabs were a little dry but the flavor was excellent. 
Staff was friendly and attentive and they had a great cocktail/wine/cider list. Highly recommend this place if you love Indian cuisine and are looking for great food and a lively atmosphere!",1
2,I don't think the food is all that and certainly not worth waiting in a line for.,-1
4,"There is a lot to like about Bone Daddies but since I've become an obsessive fan of Tonkotsu ramen I have developed my own standards. With ramen I find it hard to judge because the broth can varied each day especially when you make it in large quantities at once unlike other dishes where you mostly cook it one at a time. So if I have a 'bad' ramen it could just be a 'bad' day but of course consistency would be great to have, just harder to get. I do usually go at least twice we confirm my judgement but this review is purely based on one lunch visit.
Bone Daddies is very well lit, white and red walls, trying to get in colours of Japan maybe? High stools which I never have been a fan of but it creates a quick turnover so Iess queuing. I would associate it more a quick lunch or dinner as it does get packed as seating is limited so trying so trying to get a group of friends to dine here is not ideal. It's place you are very likely to be seating next to a complete stranger if you have an available seat next to you so no room for personal space here.Still I love the laboratory feel to it with the random jars containing condiments to hair bands and even bibs for those messy eaters. Makes life a lot easier for those who keep dropping their chopsticks and could just use the mini self service area and pick a new pair up conveniently.
So I my lunch order was the obvious choice of Tonkotsu whilst my boyfriend ordered the kimchee seafood ramen which uses fish broth instead of mine being pork. We both ordered an extra egg too for £1 which is very reasonable as some places sell it at £2.50!! I only managed to have a few sip of the kimchee broth and a feel mussels and already felt the intense heat and spice kick in. There was a generous amount of seafood of prawns and mussels. The broth was slightly sweet for easier consumption but I'm not going to review anymore as it would be wrong of me to judge based on a few sips.
So moving on to my Tonkotsu, as much as I enjoyed the thick creamy broth and the firm bouncy noodles the broth really did needed depth. Creamy and thick was all it was but flavour wise it was lacking. Although we were given the choice to add whole cloves of garlic in the broth with the garlic presser as well I felt my broth was definitely hungry for some. I suppose I'm just used to tonkotsu having many notes of flavour. But texture and ingredients compensated on all that was lost to make it still enjoyable with a nice addition of black sesame oil for presentation and some flavour. The pork belly was incredibly tender throughout, generously sliced in perfect thickness. Eggs top notch, rich egg yolk still runny inside and gently seasoned. Nice crunches came from the beansprouts and bamboo too. 
If I was purely reviewing on the ramen this meal would have been a 3 out of 5 but overall with the quick service, decor, menu choices it grabbed itself an extra star, Will need to go again to try it's other ramen though as I do want this place to do well. It definitely has the potential.",1
3,"Good...but forgettable.
My friend ordered the Tonkotsu which was surprisingly more bland than it looked and should have been (being very cloudy from their 20hour pork bone boiling.) I ordered the T2 whose broth was really flavorful and was ace to have the ""cock scratchings"" for crunchy texture.
Perhaps I went on an ""off-day"" but the biggest turn-offs were that the broth was pretty lukewarm and not enough of it. I'd try Bonedaddies again, but not in a rush. I still stick to my guns on the best ramen being at Nagomi.",-1
3,"Well Savoir Faire...you were a bit of a letdown. Not in a ""Oh my gosh, I am going to see that Blair Witch Project film, it looks great!"" way. More like ""The last Family Guy season wasn't as funny as the others, was it?"" 
The food was pretty good, but not up to what I had heard it could be. Although tasty enough, steaks were stringy and fatty. That lost a star from the review right there! I also felt that starters were lacking in portion size. Overall though, I did really enjoy myself, but that was probably due to the stellar company I was in! 
The ambience was pretty good in the restaurant, but décor was a little rough in places. Service was pretty slow and inattentive, but to be fair, this was possibly because we were tucked out of the way in the basement, like a pack of grouchy live-in mother-in-laws. 
All in all, I had a wonderful night, but that standard of Savoir Faire is more comparable to some of the 'Red Café' establishments around town, as opposed to being a newly discovered gem for me.",-1
5,"This is a must visit if you can, this is just an absolute experience that is hard to compare to anything i have ever tried, the quality of the food, the craftsmanship, the flavors so delicious and delicate is almost overwhelming!
And when it comes to service this is second to none, you feel just whiskered into another universe where attention to your meal and enjoyment is the sole purpose.
The only thing with this place that I regret is that i am not there right now.",1
3,"Really busy restaurant. We manage to go one afternoon and we didn't need to queue. Indian food, but I wouldn't define it very authentic, small portions too and not very cheap, however, it is a very trendy place so I guess you pay for that.",-1
4,"Have been coming to Wong Kei for several years and have yet to be disappointed. Food is always plentiful in size and flavour. The duck pancakes in particular are exquisite. Personally I am not a fan of the free jasmine tea they serve, but that's just personal taste. 
The chilli oil provided on the table is also amazing - definitely the best in Chinatown. No other place comes close with their chilli oil. 
Service has gradually improved over the years, though still known for being rude, it is now more in a playful fashion, as if only done to keep up the reputation. I tend to find that you are treated nicer if you come alone and sit on the ground floor, and treated more as a burden if in a group.
Would be 5 stars if they accepted card - cash only can be a drag.",1
4,"Yauatcha is yummy. Desserts are to die for, french patisserie with asian influences, like kiwi tiramisu. A lot of dim sum varieties for a pretty reasonable price although if you add in a few main courses it can get a bit expensive. Upstairs has a more casual feel while downstairs is dark and suitably trendy. definitely worth a visit or two",1
3,"Just had an original ramen - it is a much anticipated japanese tonkotsu ramen from japan. It is better than shorty or bone daddy... But not as good as I anticipated - soup is slightly off... It is rich and creamy but missing an exciting note leaving aftertaste quite rich... Pros are noodles and cha-shu. Especially cha-shu is the best in London... But of course, you would not be there for cha shu only.., without good soup, a bowl of ramen would never taste right... By the way, it's kikurage - tree grown mushroom, is supposedly specially cured from japan... It tasted not too special - too coarsely chopped and too big in my opinion...",-1
3,"perfect to find this place still open after a show on shaftsbury ave. Noodles rather expensive (£11 for the pork bone tonkotsu). The broth was divine, the egg still runny and umptious, the 2 slices of pork melts in your mouth. Everything was a tad salty though. Would say the portion a lot smaller than I expected (suited me fine, but friend said he didn't have quite enough) so big eaters, add noodles (£2 on top I think?)",-1
3,"I have to disappointingly give 3 stars the Punjab. I specifically dragged my friend here for dinner because I wanted to go to the oldest Punjabi restaurant in the U.K.  The food here is pretty good. We both loved the apps we got (lamb shish and the pumpkin app). My paneer makhani was fine, but I wish it was spicy. Her chicken tikka speciality was a bit smaller than expected. Sugar and mango lassi's were also good. I was not too thrilled that you have to also buy rice. We ended up buying one naan and one basmati. And if we had wanted water we would have paid. 
But here's where the bigger problem comes. We had no problems with the waiter who seated us and gave us our check. But the waiter who took our orders and brought our food out was a big problem. He's a young guy, probably the youngest there, but that's no excuse for being OFFENSIVE. Let me preface this by saying both my friend and I are American and speak English perfectly without accents (which btw our rude waiter had an accent when he spoke in English) AND YET despite this, he chose to continually say ""arigato"" and ""xie xie"" to my friend, thinking he was cute or funny? I don't know but it's completely unacceptable. It made both of us extremely uncomfortable and he never stopped doing it. Not to mention when he brought my rice out he referred to it as ""arroz"" instead of rice. And he did all of this clearly KNOWING we speak English (better than him for that matter). For these reasons, I'm disappointed that Punjab isn't a place I can recommend to anyone who isn't white or south Asian since our abilities to speak English were questioned while here.",-1
3,"So,  I don't know if I didn't get a taste of some of the magic mushrooms other reviews did in order to take this place so highly, but overall I found Dishoom to be pretty disappointing. 
Upon entering, the decor is nice and funky. Like someone else mentioned,  it's got a cool speakeasy vibe going on. I was really excited, but let down by the service from the beginning. Despite being pretty busy,  we were seated fairly quickly (probably only 15 minutes wait after being told 25-30), but that's when things just took a downturn. The guy who seemed to be in charge of seating seemed pretty disappointed when we said we hadn't ordered any drinks while waiting in the area by the bar, and then after he plonked us at a table, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to notice us and give us menus. 
But, I tried my best not to let it bother me, as I was excited for their ""Haleem"" dish, which was touted as so special and flavorful. 
From their online menu: ""for 8 hours we let the wheat, lamb and lentils simmer with precise quantities of coriander, turmeric, cumin and many other aromatic spices. Then the ingredients are pounded to intertwine and infuse the spices, release the flavour, and create a thick, smooth texture, almost a savoury porridge."" My partner ordered the haleem and when I tasted it, I really expected a total flavor explosion in my mouth. Instead, I got an underwhelming mouth of mush. I didn't have a problem with the texture, as it was as described, but I was really expecting more punch and more depth to a dish that was allegedly cooked down for 8 hours with spices. Just...okay. This chef's special, btw, came at a lovely premium of £16.50. Yes, you heard me right. £16.50. For a child's sized portion of porridge. 
For a drink, I treated myself to the Bombay Pimm's, which was basically just ginger beer in a highball glass with some bits and bobs thrown in the bottom. Waste of £7.50.
I also ordered the chicken ruby, which many people here totally raved about, but I also found it devoid of any depth of flavor. It was just any old tomato based sauce to me, and I was let down. Average tasting, but nice to soak up with the naan, which was delicious. 
Also disappointing, was dessert. A pineapple and black pepper crumble. I was excited for the combo, but when I dug in, found that all I'd really been served was a ramekin of dense, sugary flour crumble with the tiniest layer of unripe pineapple at the very bottom (bleh). I needed to drown it in the provided custard sauce in order to provide any moisture. Also, didn't even taste the slightest hint of black pepper.
 
Really, aside from the annoying service, Dishoom was nothing awful, but definitely underwhelming. Mediocre food and mediocre service, so no, not a very good value at all. I feel as though I could have gotten better, cheaper Indian food somewhere else in London where the staff would have paid a bit more attention.  
At the end of the night, I could tell someone at Dishoom knew deep down they'd screwed up, because the owner came over with discount vouchers to placate us. However, given what I think of Dishoom, the option of $10 off a $40 meal at a completely different location isn't exactly very gracious, in my books. Right now, I certainly wouldn't rush to go back (certainly not to the Covent Garden location), but maybe one night if feeling a little tipsy, I'd give Dishoom another try.

3,"The breakfast was definitely an interesting take on my morning meal.  I have friends who adore Dishoom and it was decent, but not something I am dying to do again in London when there are so many other places to dine.  If you're looking for something quick, this is definitely not the place.  We had trouble keeping the attention of the server and getting more food and tea.  The chai is very nice and the bacon roll was good, but overall I wasn't over the moon about the whole experience.",-1
5,"4 out of 6 dishes were remarkable, best i've had.  1 dish was sort of ordinary (chili cheese toast) nothing special - i'm not even sure why we order it and seems out of place with everything else they have going on, on their menu.  The keema was a little salty and probably my least favorite, its memorable for being the only dish that wasn't outstanding.  The rest of the food was eaten with a chorus of ""OMG!"" after every bite.  Waited an hour, it was well worth the wait. Food came out fast.  Enjoyed conversing with the front door guy.  Great dining experience.",1
2,"We came to this restaurant after reading Yelp reviews. Arrived at about 6:30pm, one party ahead of us. Despite seeing several open tables we were told to wait, and took about 20 minutes to seat the 3 of us. The ambience was good, and the food aroma was inviting. We ordered buttered chicken which consisted of two medium sized pieces of chicken that was covered with the yellow spiced curry, but dry on the inside. We also ordered the goat tandoori which came in 4 kebabs, well seasoned but very salty. Also ordered buttered naan and sweet naan, both just okay. The service was definitely a low light, had to ask for water 3 times, and they never came by to refill. The bill came quickly though, and surprised to find they already added tip. Overall not impressed with the food, bad service, definitely not recommended and would not come back.",-1
5,This was an amazing dining experience!! and some of the best food i've ever eaten!! try a venison puff if you wanna know what I'm talking about! Or a duck pumpkin ball! This is exceptional food. Try it!!! wow!!!,1
3,Not my favorite nobu . Tried it three times and I have a problem with the waiters ( I hate when it happens I am not eating for free please do your job or go work at a fast food) . The park lane one is better and ohhhhh man I miss nobu Malibu .,-1
3,"Distinctly OK.
Overcooked fried tofu & katsu in general; it's a bit cheaper but about par for hte course in C-town.",-1
3,"London's tidal wave of shabby chic, cultural-niche themed restaurants seems unstoppable. I'd classify Dishoom in this category. 
My rating is based on a dinner for 5 around 8pm on a Monday.
Pros
* Really tasty, freshly made inventive recipes. Big flavours and variety of textures.
* Good, original cocktail selection
* Well executed décor giving a believable ambiance to the facade.
Cons
* Staff seem employed for looks rather than ability/competence (more on that later, I appreciate that this seems to be the modus operandi of most of the East End these days)
* Portions don't match the price - the 'leg of lamb' was £21 and is meant for 2 sharing, yet it's just a decent serving for 1. Our waiter claimed only 1 person has finished it themselves before - seems unlikely chief. It also is a pile of shredded meat 'next to' an alarmingly bare looking bone - no visible signs that ever the twain had met.
*  Side dishes are significantly overpriced - £5 for coleslaw or Okra chips...
I know the recession hit hard, but carrots, cabbage, mayo and pomegranate haven't gone through the roof just yet.
*  The place is huge, so there is often a delay in ordering drinks. Our food came quite quickly but we waited 45 minutes for cocktails at one point.
The overall experience was pretty good, really enjoyed the food, though it is definitely overpriced. The cocktails tasted great, especially the Badam Alexander and the 1850 Julep - both with plenty of booze.
Our waiter was amiable yet  slightly incompetent. A common pairing. If you're going to wear a novelty santa hat you need to back your look up with unerring professionalism, otherwise you just seem a bit of a clown. And if you fail to clear glasses and food away until 30 minutes after the meal, fail to submit a drinks order completely and don't give change even after the 12.5% discretionary gratuity has been included and paid for, then I'm afraid you're not ready for maitre' d just yet.
I'd go back for a light early evening dinner and one cocktail, keep it short and simple and be able to leave without clutching your wallet in alarm.",-1
5,"Calvin T recently reminded me I haven't tried Bone Daddies so when I unexpectedly had a case in London I seized the opportunity to take my bff along for some ramen. We're big Koya fans but Bone Daddies is equally as good, if not quite as zen (and of course the menus are very different).
We had some delicious sake to keep us warm in the queue and then were ushered to some of the best seats in the house (near hooks for hanging coats! joy!) where we were swiftly served with drinks and our fantastic starters - soft shell crab and tenderstem broccoli with their respective sauces were absolutely top drawer. We were surprised to discover the sauce with the broccoli is made with a Japanese citrus fruit - it's hard to describe its unique flavour but that's not what we would have guessed. The fiery green pepper/jalapeno based accompaniment with the soft shell was also unusual and a great match.
Ramen was outstanding. I followed Yee Gan's lead and had the tantanmen - it's fiery kick caught the back of my throat more than once, which was awesome! My bff also loved his tonkutsu ramen, he drained the bowl in about 10 minutes.
Service as I said was swift but also friendly and enthusiastic with the staff despite how busy it was taking time to explain the sauces to us and not rushing us out despite me taking forever to eat my ramen (it really is filling!).
Finally, at £11 a bowl this is perfectly priced - for the quality of the food it's excellent value.
Excited already for my next visit!",1
2,"I was excited to try out Le Mercury after all the glowing reviews on Yelp.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day - rainy Saturday for lunch - but there was nothing particularly memorable or good about this place other than the reasonable prices (£5 starters, £10 mains, and a cheap wine list)
The service was really, really bad.  I think our server's vision was based on movement since the only way he ever dropped by our table was after desperate waving by one or more of us -- take our order, water, wine order #1, wine order #2, dessert order, check (twice).  We were exhausted by the end.
The food was unremarkable, and not particularly French (just because the menu says  ""croquette de poisson"" doesn't make fishcakes french.)  Two of us had the over-cooked swordfish over a bed of cold string beans.  A friend ordered a salad that we all agreed looked like the one you get in coach on a British Airlines flight.  The crayfish and lobster ravioli (also, ravioli... not french) starter was good but I suspect they bought them frozen from somewhere.  I had the chicken entree which was ok.
The most entertaining part was the STEEP decent down slippery metal stairs to the toilet.  As a bonus the water was running in the dirty sink and couldn't be turned off.
One star experience overall, but I'm giving them two stars because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for.",-1
3,"Went recently for a very quick lunch. I loved the starters which were served promptly but I came here for the main event of ramen. It was cold and I needed arming up.
Compared to say Bone Daddies or Kanada-Ya all not far from here, I was quite disappointed. Did I come on an off day? I got the original Ramen Tonkotsu, which I didn't think had any depth of flavour. Pork belly also far too fatty for my liking.
I'm willing to come back one day but it did put me off considering I could easily compare it to it's rivals in Soho.",-1
5,"In addition to the dim sum restaurant downstairs, I would also highly recommend coming here for the ground floor tea room.  
There is a big selection of teas to chose from, hot and cold ones and the cakes are divine and colourful.  You might even hesitate before eating them, but the taste is not disappointing.  My sister brought me here for some tea and catch up, and I was pleasantly impressed.  It is a bit pricey, but a great location for a treat.",1
3,"I agree with Danny K - 'service' is a misnomer. Waiters seem to begrudge our requests. We asked to sit by a window but we were told that that table was for 4 and we were 3 so we should sit at a table for 3. They did concede after the blast of air conditioning was raised as an issue - kind of spoiled the feeling of a treat out. Courteous interactions were sparse throughout the rest of the meal but I remember the food being good. The loos was unisex - good for some, but  in a relatively small space.",-1
5,"Popped in for some takeaway cakes yesterday and today for various bday treats. Super scrumptious esp the jasmine and coconut with lime versions. On both occasions I was given full sized samples. Yesterday was the mini moon cake which was filled with a custard filling. And today was a macaron filed with gooey salted caramel. Wow. Both were scrumptious. However I def think it would taste even more amazing if I had with some hour Chinese tea as in their own, they did have a sweet aftertaste...but they were very good. Am definitely tempted to go back for more.",1
2,I was REALLY sick from a cold and needed a ramen food fix. I was itching to try this place because nothing makes me happier than a nice bowl of soup. I found this place on the Yelp app and walked in. Right away you are greeted by the lingering smell of slow simmered broth and the sound of slurping noodles. There was about five people before us so the wait was roughly ten minutes! During this time I browsed over the menu. They had loads of ramen to look through. My husband got the soy ramen and I got the tonkatsu ramen! The tonkatsu was salty and dark. I didn't even want to finish it. When I asked the server to remove it after a bite she took t away but didn't offer to bring me the menu so I could order something else. The customer service here is rushed and not very friendly. Wouldn't go back again,-1
3,"Taste: 3
Creativity/Authenticity: 3
Atmosphere: 3.5
Service: 2
Bang for your buck: 3
Let me start by saying when in London which claims to have the best indian food your not gonna find it here. I'm free Los Angeles and we'll punjab is about the same as LA; Los Angeles might be better!! First our waiter was very rude, service Def needs work. As far as the food goes nothing special the condiments tasted like pre package jar sauces, their chicken masala just another indian dish nothing that a place that claims to be the first indian restaurant in London should taste like. If you want indian food you can probally find another place that has just as good food if not better i suggest for the price of punjab you go eat at dishoom way better service, better food but make a reservation. Good luck",-1
1,Food to eat,-1
4,Good dim sum and wonderful service.  Delicious congee too.  The French pastries looked amazing and I will have to try them on my next visit.  I noticed on the menu that there was a reasonably priced special dim sum tasting menu after 2 pm Mondays to Thursdays.  A nice tea break if you are walking around Soho.,1
5,"I've only had dim sum a few times before, but I don't think I'm going to find dim sum as good this again soon. We didn't really know what to order so we asked the waiter to put together a menu for us. Everything tasted great! Although you usually get 3 pieces when you order, we were 4 and got one piece each which made it easy to share. The service was great. 
My only criticism is you didn't have that much room for your legs under the table - if you're more than about 5'8"" :)",1
3,"Original (no menu), good (decent meat in London), exotic (French), the deal is clear and most people will like it.
 If I may say:
 - £20 for steak should include a glass of wine. If they dwelve on their French style, the wine is missing.
 - it's not the best steak you can eat. Come on, guys, are you American or what ? It's good, not exceptional.
 - on Friday and Saturday evenings, there is a queue outside. It can take you more than half an hour to get in...
 Don't go there with your girlfriend, but with your mates :-)",-1
5,Ordered Sichuan Prawns and Singapore Rice Noodles. Both were amazing.  Cash Only establishment.,1
4,"The prospect of posh Chinese food in London didn't seem positive. But after sampling one (or more) of nearly everything on the menu over the course of two visits I gotta say: Yauatcha is legit! 
I've eaten both upstairs and down: I prefer upstairs during the day and downstairs at night. Regardless of your seating position, order the venison puffs! Also their French macarons are more than just pretty to look at: they're delicious.",1
1,"I've been coming to Shoryu for years so this recent visit was extremely disappointing because I am familiar with their usual level of service and quality of food. 
When I was seated I sat there for maybe ten minutes before I had to ask someone for a menu, while other parties were sat after me and given menus right away. These same parties were also given the opportunity to order before I was. I made eye contact with several waiters, signaling that I was ready to order and they ignored me, continuing to chat to each other behind the counter. It wasn't until another ten minutes that I was given the opportunity to order. 
I ordered my usual prawn tempura shoryu bun and a piri piri tonkotsu. When the shoryu bun comes out, there is usually a wrapped wet wipe so that you can clean your hands before you pick up the bun but they didn't give me anything and I had difficulty getting anyone's attention again so I just gave up and ate the bun which tasted great, as usual. When my tonkotsu came out, the nitamago was really overdone to where there was no runny yolk quality, and about 90% of the yolk was a crumbling yellow rather than a silky orange. When I asked for another egg, the waitress asked what was wrong with it and I told her it was overdone and how it's supposed to be soft boiled (I had to explain to her what a proper nitamago looks like while I'm sitting in front of a chalkboard with the definitions of the different elements that make up a ramen, one of which is a definition of a nitamago). She came back with another egg that was still over cooked but better than the my initial egg claiming ""this is the best we've got"".  Other than the egg, the ramen was delicious. 
Finally, when I asked for my check they brought me the bill right away and I sat with my credit card in my hand for maybe 15 minutes before I had to again ask if I could pay. A new waitress came and asked if I wanted to pay by card, and I asked her if the 12.5% service charge could be taken off because out of all the years I've been here I've never experienced such awful service. She just sulked away and came back with an adjusted bill, not once making an attempt to ask why I felt that way or inquire as to what they could do to improve. She merely processed my transaction in complete silence and then walked away. 
I would also like to add that I was not the only one experiencing poor customer service. There was a six-top of Australian diners behind me who asked for water from at least three different waiters and also said they were ready to order, to which the waitress who processed my bill replied in a really harsh and rude tone ""it's coming! I've already asked!"" And another waiter turned up and told them ""you're just going to have to wait!""
I usually go to the carnaby branch so maybe it's my mistake for going to a different location but I've been to this location in the past too. I don't think I will return to this branch but look forward to going to another branch soon",-1
3,"Welcome to the most expensive curry house on the whole planet. I first tried it in the seventies when the restaurant was owned by an Englishman by the name of Edwin Palmer. He grew up in Hyderabad in India. He also marketed a selection of jarred curry products under the name of E.P. Veeraswamy. 
What took me aback, like a dumb slapstick comedy, was being greeted at the elevator by a man dressed as a Hunzar, including a foot high cloth fin coming out of his hat, who saluted my date and I like we were four star generals. To this very day, it gives me a good laugh. The food was boringly mild and tasteless. The price was through the stratosphere.
New owners ditched the fake Hunzar in the elevator and greatly improved the quality of their menu. The food is excellent but incredibly London England style. As long as you are not looking for authentic and you want to stay close to the theatre district, Piccadilly Circus, or the West End you cannot go wrong on quality. Just bring a wheel barrow load full of money. 
I give it four stars for the food but two stars for the price, making a three. It is only a short ride on the tube to Queensway where you will find more authentic food with prices where you will only need a fistful of money and can leave the wheel barrow in your hotel safe. A better than five star Indo-Pakistani restaurant is Shezan in Knightsbridge for those with six figure incomes. The food is authentic Punjabi and Northwest Frontier.
A multi course lunch at Veeraswamy for two will cost about 80 to 100 pounds and dinner about 120 to 150 pounds; more if you include a bottle of Champagne which I believe is the perfect wine match for Indian style food. Red wines clash, an Australian Shiraz the least, and the food overpowers most white wines except for a Gewurztraminer which can cost more that a magnum of bubbly. A glass of cold lager is even better and so much easier on the pocketbook.
If you want authentic Amritsar Punjabi style, take the train to Southall from Paddington Station. It is a 30 minute ride and you will enjoy fabulous Masalas, Seekh Kebabs, naan, tikkas etc. for a fraction of the price and oh so much better. Dress casual for Southall and fancy for Veeraswamy.",-1
4,"I love ramen! So, I'm always looking for a great ramen house. Bone Daddies is not your typical ramen house. They add their own special touches/spins to traditional ramen. We tried the Tatanmen and the tonkatsu. These weren't really your typical tatanmen or tonkatsu broths. I can't quiet put my tongue to it, but it's got its own special kick! The noodles were decently chewy and in good amounts. The garnishes aren't that special. I think what makes Bone Daddies special is their broth! Oh and their drinks! Mr. Sparkle and BD Rocket! I will be returning for those!
The decor is unique - modern yet edgy. The place is always packed. There's going to be a line. Prepare for some tight seating and maybe even eating with strangers. But really, it's not that bad! You're there for the food anyways!",1
4,"yeah i would take people here! for sure. I was generally impressed. the staff were friendly, attentive and in good form. we had the soft shell crab (small and overpriced, but tasty) and the renowned fried chicken (juicy, crispy, tasty and plenty of it, not bad for a 5er i suppose).
we both had the tonkatsu...standardly it seems and yes it was very nice. not ur usual watery soup, this was almost creamy meaty goodness juice. a little salty but that's the deal huh? egg was perfectly cooked, my friend ordered another for some serious eggy action. couple of ashahi's and £50 odd later we left satisfied.
only thing I would say is they definitely cram you in, we sat in the window and it was every elbow for themselves!!! 
peace.",1
5,"You don't go to Four Seasons for the service or the ambiance, you go to eat delicious roast duck. The service is not great and the restaurant is rather dingy, now let's move on.
The food is fantastic. Three of us split the crispy aromatic duck, Peking short ribs, and softshell crab, and were absolutely exquisitely stuffed by the end of the meal. Everything was delicious but the duck stole the show- it was incredibly flavorful and the combination of cucumbers and sauce on the thin little pancake was out of this world. The food here is absolutely fantastic- just manage your expectations about the service, and you will love it.",1
3,"Dubbed one of London's top ramen shops, I can only think of one word to describe Kanada-Ya: underwhelming. 
Perhaps it is London's pre-eminent ramen shop with lines flying out the door. Across, you'll find Ippudo, a world-renowned ramen chain that has hours-long waits in its NYC shops, sitting slightly emptier. Has Kanada-Ya taken the throne away from them in London? Maybe.
I waited about 15 minutes on a Tuesday night. It is a very small, quaint corner restaurant that can fit less than 40 people. As I was approaching the from across the street, I could already smell the heavy truffle aroma from their popular Truffle Ramen from the swinging door. The patrons leaving, too, smelled like truffles as they dashed past me. Being a truffle fanatic, I was so pumped for the Truffle Ramen.
I'm no ramen expert but this was far from the best ramen I've ever had. You might like this if you like light broths, but it's not creamy at all. The truffle oil felt more like it was there for the smell, and maybe some flavor. The pork was a bit on the dry side and took me awhile to get through. For the most expensive ramen on the menu (£14), I wish they'd included a Hanjuku egg or something because it felt...plain. Kanada-Ya is definitely overhyped. I can't speak for Ippudo in London, but I try to avoid it altogether like a plague since it's overhyped in NYC. London doesn't seem to have a very competitive ramen scene and that's sorta sad, given how many trendy Japanese restaurants there are in the area, I might as well have just gone to Japan Centre.",-1
1,"Food was delicious. Service was the worst I have experienced in years. After ordering a drink, we had to remind wait staff twice of the order. It took 45mins for the drink to arrive. Comically unbelievable. Do not go here. Visit another restaurant in the area (I recommend arch duke), or a better ping pong in the city. The wait staff here need to be fired and replaced to save this restaurant.
If you do visit, do not sit outside. The wait staff seemed especially incompetent here as the manager could not see these tables. If you are being served by the bald man, leave immediately as your experience will be worse than terrible",-1
2,"I was really disappointed when I came here. It came to me so highly recommended by so many people that I went for my birthday. We were seated at a table downstairs and away from where most people sat, which of course happens but, I already felt like I was missing out on something.
When I ordered my food the waitress told me that I should really order her recommendations, and she sounded so passionate that I changed my order. But when the food arrived it was all a bit bland and it was more expensive than my original order.
I'll definitely come back here, just because so many people rave about it and the atmosphere upstairs seemed great and it's so close to where I work and live. However my first visit was really underwhelming.",-1
4,"Wonderful restaurant in Soho. The staff were all really hospitable and the ramen was really nice. Not lots of space in the restaurant but the space available was always filled with people. Clearly this place is worth it's rating. 
I had heard about this restaurant through a Yelp search, and decided that it sounded like a great place to get ramen in London. The restaurant is reasonably easy to find, we just needed to ask a local where it was when Google Maps said we were close by, but we had no clue where to look. 
There wasn't much of a line when we got there around lunch time so we were seated right away. Because I had come with my family who didn't really know much of ramen other than the plastic packets you can get in stores, they didn't have much of a clue on what was what. The staff helped them on what the different ramen where made of and what they preferred.
We ended up ordering one tonkotsu, two tantanmen and one T22. The ramen came reasonably quickly and they were very aesthetically pleasingly presented.
The tonkotsu was very, very delicious. The dark sesame oil on top gave the already amazing broth a toasted flavour. The broth was a milky colour, as would be expected of a bone marrow, and the noodles were a bit thicker than somen noodles which was a bit surprising, given that I am more used to having thicker noodles, but they tasted just fine. The ramen was topped with chashu pork, soft boiled eggs and green onion. 
The others were very pleased with their noodles too. The tantanmen was reasonably spicy and the bokchoy on the side was very refreshing. The T22 was equally as good. 
Needless to say we were all very, very pleased with our food. The portions were perfectly filling, although there was space for a special dessert from their menu. We ordered a sesame ice-cream to share,  which ended up being a very interesting experience since none of us had ever tasted a sesame flavoured soft serve. It was a perfect end to the meal and all of us agreed that we'd be coming back in the future. 
I ended up coming back the next day for another serving since I'd been enchanted by the ramen. You simply can't find such good ramen in Norway so I had to take advantage of the restaurants' existence.",1
5,"In today's world, there are few restaurants that still make you feel special when you walk in the door.  This describes the service that you will receive at Clos Maggiore.  The waitstaff is very well trained, they all welcome you by name, and the service is impeccable.
My wife and I went to Clos Maggiore to celebrate my birthday.  It's one of those small, intimiate, romantic settings - I certainly wouldn't bring kids here.  I'm a huge wine enthusiast - so I was thrilled when I saw the school textbook-sized wine menu.  I think it was 90+ pages.  The great part is that the wine list was organised by the sommelier's recommendations, then by grape, then by region.  Trust me - there is a bottle of wine for everyone here.  We were particularly pleased with the French wine selection.  Just having returned from Burgundy, we were able to find several of our favourites on the list.
In terms of the food, we decided to go with the tasting menu.  The first course was marinated scallops with charlotte potatoes and seaweed salad.  This was accompanied by a really nice Sauvignon Blanc from Tinpot Hut.  Our second course was a fantastically prepared pan fried duck foie gras and a crisp confit duck leg.  My wife really enjoyed the wine compliment - a riesling kabinett from Mosel, Germany.  For our third course, we had a very nicely prepared slow cooked fillet of Cornish cod.  It was served on a bed of butter beans and sauce rougaille.  This course was accompanied by my favourite wine of the evening:  Marsanne, Qupé 2008 Santa Barbara County, California.  A French couple owns this US-based vineyard and they make terrific wine.  It reminded me much of a nice white Burgundy from the Chassagne-Montrachet area.  For the fourth course, we had my favourite course of the night:  treacle caramelised breast of Gressingham duck.  This was served with roasted red plums, endive meuniere, and a ruby port sauce.  The accompanying wine was also very well paired - a Barolo from the Marchesi di Barolo producer in Piemonte, Italy.  Our fifth course was a fairly standard cheese plate.  To be honest, this was my only disappointment all night.  They did not bring a cheese trolley over to the table and pre-selected all of the cheeses.  Many of the cheeses were also stinky soft cheeses, which I am not entirely keen on.  Nonetheless, it was paired with a nicely
with walnut  and raisin rye flour bread biscuits and quince jelly.  The
Barros Late Bottled Vintage Port from the Duoro Valley was also nice to cut through the cheese.  The sixth and final course was a Valrhona chocolate and griottine fondant served with cherry sorbet.  I probably could have eaten this for all six courses.  It was paired wonderfully with a reserve muscat from Yalumba NV Victoria, Australia.  This was a nice ending to a wonderful meal.  They even spelled ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate for our special occassion.
Don't miss a chance to eat at Clos Maggiore.  Leave plenty of time to enjoy your meal and use if for a special occassion!
TIP:  Book in advance.  This restaurant is fairly small and cannot accommodate a large number of people.  Use Open Table to secure your booking in advance.  Also, check with the host to see if you can be seated in the centre of the restaurant near the fireplace.  Very romantic!",1
4,I tried their pineapple desserts and it was exactly what I expected. It wasn't too sweet and it was just the way I like it,1
3,"Here's one American who didn't think this place was all that amazing.  
Before I get lambasted, here are the reasons why.  
1) It was marketed to me as a great one-of-a-kind establishment, but it turns out they're a chain with locations all around the world.  
2) Rushed service - since everyone knows what you're basically going to order, wine/bread/salad/steak/frites are essentially dumped out in front of you.
3) I really hate it when waitresses ask you for still or sparkling, you say still, and they pop the cap off an expensive bottle of Evian.  Well, you won't get me again - I say tap water everywhere I go now.
4) Nothing was that amazing.  The salad had this garlic dressing (in all honesty, it's been a while, the flavor might not have been garlic, but it was really strong whatever it was) that completely overpowered the rest of the salad, the steak had only what seemed to be a watered-down curry flavor, and the frites were tiny.  I also didn't love when they gave me more food.  Now don't get me wrong, I do love getting free food, but the way they present it has all the trappings of shoveling gruel on your plate.  The desserts looked amazing, and I ordered this macaroon tower, but they also failed to impress.
5)  Finally, I realize they can do nothing about this, but does every freakin' person in the UK smoke?  Waiting in the 1 hour queue, we were continually blasted by smoke.  
On the other hand, the two people waiting behind us were a lot of fun - a great way to meet new people.  
Anyways, if I ever want to eat here again, (and I don't), I'll just go to one of the US locations...no reason to go to a US chain when I'm overseas, and I won't be making that mistake again.",-1
5,"tried all 3 dishooms, fave place was at king's cross, the biggest dishoom out of all 3 and atmosphere was awesome  overall all dishooms has great interior and also GREAT foods. must try is mattar paneer and raita with garlic naan must try chai also : bestttt",1
2,"Went on the 1-Jan-13 to welcome in the new year and it was very busy as expected. Quality of food was very good though but the experience was totally ruined by an obnoxious and sarcastic waiter. Service was downright unacceptable as he keeps forgetting our order of extra drinks / coffee and we even have to ask the dessert menu twice. Said waiter always avoided eye-contact and finally we decided to complaint to the manager. We told her to take the discretionary service charge off the bill and she kindly obliged. She apologised for the unpleasant service experienced by us and even took off 2 of our desserts order from the final bill.
We appreciated her help / offer but sadly, I don't think I will be back in a hurry. Don't mind splashing out for good quality food on special occasions but service level was just atrocious! We overheard the same service problem on an adjacent table before we left. I would have thought for the price they are charging, the least they could do is provide decent service. As I mentioned, food is great but let down terribly by their unprofessional service!!!",-1
5,"The best ramen I have ever had! I was loving the ramen in Cocoro, but i found a better place now. The fried chicken and friend crap is great! need to order it every time i visit! 
T22 and 20 hours broth is great!!!",1
4,"I lived around the corner from here and dropped in for the first time on a lazy Saturday morning with a local friend. We were seated in the lovely garden like patio which gave you a sense of being somewhere exotic without the corniness. 
Been back many times since. I think it's excellent for all occasions, great vibes. And of course the food and the drinks are always on point.",1
4,Roast duck noodle soup and fish ball noodle soup are perfect for a cold London day! YUM-wish I was there!,1
3,"Awesome food but bad service. The waiter overruled our order and we ended up reordering more food. They srem to be surfing on their popularity. 5 star food, 2 star service",-1
5,"Excellent food. Great service. Had the Dishoom calamari, chicken ruby, awadhi lamb biryani, house black daal, bowl of greens, butter bhutta, and garlic naan. The house black daal was the favorite with the butter bhutta in second (basically it was elote with Indian spices).",1
1,Very rude host. Have had much better Indian food. Once was enough. Twice we arrived before closing and were told not seating anymore. Finally got in and not impressed.,-1
3,"This was in all likelihood going to be the review that got away. I've spent time in the original Balthazar and had some lovely lunches but, especially in a white hot, can't get a table for love nor money, opening period, I'd resigned myself to forgetting about the London branch. And anyway, who really wants to go to the London branch of a slavish New York recreation of a traditional French bistro? I could be on the Eurostar before they'd answered the reservations line.
As it goes, it's reasonably quiet, even on a Thursday lunch, and therefore the perfect spot to slide into a banquette opposite the International Man of Mystery. He's never sure which city he's in at any given point in time, so this level of high class generic internationalism is perfect for him.
It's not cheap, their range of French classics, but if you've come here deliberately you know that and are comfortable paying £24 for a plate of Steak Frites and £17 for a burger. If you're a wall-eyed tourist who has just stumbled across its prime Covent Garden location then congratulations. You're going to be fleeced, but in a much more pleasant way than if you'd wound up in the Angus Steak House.
Get a back wall booth if you can, perfect for people watching amidst the monied buzz and much, much more room than on the cramped banquettes filling the centre of the room.
After being spoilt by their homemade bread, the ceviche starter was utterly underwhelming, a few rings of squid or octopus in a vinegary coleslaw of mandolined bell peppers and onion. From a distance it looked perfectly pleasant, but ended up being pushed around the plate.
Confit duck on the other hand was perfect. Rich and unctuous, it fell off the bone like a dark brown silk dressing gown sliding from a dressmakers dummy. Definitely a contender for comfort dish of the year, though at the price it bloody well should be.
It's a lovely cavernous space, with decent food slightly over-assiduous staff (that'll be the New York influences rather than the French) but for the money, the ambience and the attitude, I'd much rather be in Zedel, sucking down champagne with the money I've saved on my steak. If it's a power lunch that I need, then I'll be back at the Wolesley first.",-1
1,"Food was okay. Can get better food in Chinatown for lesser price. Worst service ever. Took 15 minutes to get us the menu, wrong charge on the check, delayed serving. Takes forever to get us what we need when asked for. I don't recommend this restaurant.",-1
5,"Excellent. 
Service top notch and nice.
Food fabulous, with exceptionally creative dim sums. Not too expensive for what it is, in addition.
Highly recommended.
(only minus for me was desserts,,, whereas cakes look good, their tastes were just ok)",1
1,"I am shocked by the 4.5/5 star rating this place has! Ate here last night with some friends before heading to a party in the area. After reading the glowing reviews on Yelp, the Street Kitchen seemed like a great choice.
Service: Front of the house seemed accommodating. The waitstaff, however, was either too persistent in their attempts to take our order or, when we needed them, not attentive enough. There also seemed to be a lack of coordination, as three different people tried to take our drink order. Despite this, we had to ask about four times for some water before any was brought to us (at least ten minutes wait time).
Food: From the Yelp reviews, I had high expectations. Sadly, no noteworthy dishes (aside from the chocolate cardamom tart) were to be had. I was also disappointed with the price. I don't mind paying for food, street food or otherwise, if the food justifies said price. But I honestly enjoyed the Indian pre-made meals I have purchased from Waitrose and Tesco more than the food here.",-1
2,"- Main issue for me is that the broth was way too thick, like a gravy
~ Fairly loud, dive bar-esque atmosphere
~ Note that the Prince of Darkness is super spicy",-1
5,The food is awesome and it has a great ambiance. The drink menu works as well with the food as vine. No matter which way you go you need to try the Hakkan. Best drink I had all year!,1
3,"I also heard about this place from friends, so I decided to venture over here for a warm bowl of ramen. First impressions, I liked how they have garlic ready on the table with a garlic masher, BIBS if you're a messy eater (I am sure am!), hot sauce, and lots of utensils already ready. The garlic is in a jar, but I love garlic in my ramen so I was very happy. 
I ordered the T22 ramen and I was a little dissapointed. The broth was not as rich as I liked and it was spicy. I'm not a spicy food fan so that was an immediate no-no for me. The noddles were also incredibly hard and it tasted almost undercooked. The meat was also not very tender. The mushrooms were good tho. However, they do give you TWO halves of a soft-boiled egg unlike a lot of other ramen restuarants and they have a very impressive drink menu. I wouldn't say this would be a go-to ramen place for me, but it was enjoyable for such a cold winter day.",-1
4,"This is my favorite Dim Sum house in London. Every trip to London requires a visit and a big purchase of delectable pastries and other goodies. I tend to hold camp here for meetings as the atmosphere is perfect. I prefer to sit upstairs as the air is light (after all, I only go during the daytime). 
All the pastries are amazing and they seem to introduce something new and innovative every few months. Perfect for my regular quarterly visits. BUT, what never ceases to amaze me the most is their packaging. Superb is all I can say. The packaging alone is worth visiting and collecting.
Yauatcha will always be a favorite (and easier to get a table at than the big-brother Hakkasan).",1
5,"This is definably one favourite restaurants in London, it even has a vegetarian tasting menu! Can't wait to go again!",1
4,"All of the food that we had was absolutely amazing. Was disappointed that the bartenders were unable to make a good dry, dirty martini. I mean, we are in London after all.  Unbelievable whiskey collection.  This easily would've been 5 stars but for the constant techno pulse music. I know I am not in my 20s more, but the constant...bump, bump, bump of the music was like a bad 90's venue.",1
5,"The restaurant is tucked away in an alley just off the Tottenham Court Road/Oxford Street junction. One's name is checked off on a list by a doorman; a back slate-lined stairway leads down to an incensed-perfumed reception hall and the restaurant. The decor is mostly black with backlit blue walls. Laser-beam spots punctuate the gloom, and geometric Chinese screens divide the tables. It manages to reference an art-deco Shanghai opium den while being very modern, luxurious and comfortable.
 Waiting for Liz at the bar, I had something called a Purple Emperor: a wonderfully smooth, but actually yellow mix (a base of rum and sake). The purple was supplied by a massive orchid the bartender popped on top for decoration
 My preconception was that a Michelin-starred trendy restaurant would offer small portions: however the opposite was very much the case, with every dish seemingly sized for two hungry eaters. A starter of Sechuan chili crab was enormous and completely fabulous; my dimsum selection was pretty good too and contained 8 large dimsum. My main of jasmine tea smoked chicken was amazing (but must have contained at least half a chicken). Liz had another massive pile  of ribs this time. Side orders were a very generous plate of pak choi and and a canister of steamed rice. Neither of us actually fancied the rice but our waiter insisted.
 He was a funny one  all the staff were charming and friendly except our waiter, who was quite aloof and dismissive and really couldn't be bothered to answer questions (all the staff are very beautiful  the restaurant could double as a modeling agency).
We got complete fireworks when we asked for a doggy bag for the large quantities of leftovers. We don't do takeaway! We don't do takeaway! our waiter insisted emotionally, as if the very suggestion was mortally insulting. OK, this is a very smart restaurant and obviously they want to distance themselves from fast-food joints: point taken (and obviously, Hakkasan is a world away from a takeaway). But there were HUGE amounts of leftovers of very delicious food I was loath to leave behind. However, I am completely averse to making a fuss in restaurants. Not so Liz, who made them very aware that on this occasion they would be doing a doggy bag! So, eventually, I climbed the stairs out clutching my precious hamper of leftovers (much admired by an American tourist). Even our waiter seemed to find the funny side at last.",1
5,I have been coming here for 17 years! Sat 'upstairs downstairs' met some great strangers sitting in the same table with them. Most of the time we talk about how fantastic the food is here everytime! Highly recommend this place not for their unique service but for their excellent food!,1
4,"I went to Bone Daddies with a friend around 5:30 on weekday evening. It was only about less than half capacity, so we were seating inside right away. The decor is really beautiful, and the seating is mostly at communal tables. They have wall hooks around the store for you to hang your coat which was really convenient!
All of your utensils are in a big can in the middle of the table, so you can grab whatever you need. They are also supplied with hair ties and bibs so you can thoroughly enjoy your meal without making a big mess! They also had a jar of sesame seeds, garlic, and chili sauce.
Our order was taken promptly, and we ordered the softshell crab, salmon and yellowtail tartare, spicy miso, and one more ramen - the name is escaping me. 
The softshell crab and the tartare was delicious!! I will have nightmares about never getting to eat it again when I leave London. The sauce that was included with it was also to die for - super spicy too! The tartare came with some fried lotus chips, and the combination was like a new, japanese take on the holy grail of chips and salsa. 
A reason why I knocked Bone Daddies down a star is because it is too salty! I used to stay away from ramen places because I thought they were ALL too salty; later experiences taught me that really good ramen has salt, but it isn't distracting at all. If only Bone Daddies was a little less salty it would have been PERFECT.
The service was mediocre - there wasn't anything bad that happened but I have definitely had better service in many other places. It was a bit on the pricey side, but I also got the pricier appetizers to start. Overall, it was a solid ramen place, and I will most likely be back for more.",1
5,Potentially my favourite dimsum place in London. Chefs used to be at Hakkasan so similar menu but better value and generally a less pretentious version. It definitely keeps me returning!,1
5,Very good across the board. Michelin-rated Chinese restaurants are pretty hard to come by in the US so this was a treat to be in the UK and stumble on this gem. I will also say the best meal we had in London. Hibiscus was good but Yautcha was better.,1
4,"Apparently it's been a long time since the good old days of waiters telling you to piss off because there's a queue outside and being amusingly rude. Anyway, they're still reasonably priced (cash only, folks) and the food remains good. I wouldn't say it's a life changing culinary experience, but it usually delivers and I never had to send anything back. The trick is to order food from the back of the menu; basically lots of options of meat with rice or noodles. It's even cheaper and the portions are huge; you won't miss out for not ordering the ""posher"" sounding dishes on the first few pages.
I can't stand green/jasmine tea, but if that's your thing you'll get it for free to your heart's content. There are some communal round tables where you sit in close proximity with strangers; if that's not your thing keep in mind it's always a risk. :)
If you want a chatty and smiley staff this is not the place to go (as it happens with most chinese places where staff is usually tired and overworked anyway), but if you like quick and good chinese food in central London, do try. I love sitting there during off peak hours with my tablet and munch on rice and meat while I people watch. There are always some amusing customers around, and sometimes the interaction between them and the staff isn't so smooth. Ah, the good old Wong Kei will always be the good old Wong Kei. ;)",1
4,"Really nice inside. Dark and moody and a little hidden away but I like that. Eventhough it's very close to the hustle of Oxford St.
All about the Dim Sum and some cocktails. Couldn't fault the taste and quality. Pricey but that is to be expected for the reputation you know you are getting.
Will be back for one of their deals they often have running like Dim Sum Sundays.",1
3,"Pretty disappointed by this place. It looks very sexy with decor etc, but service was really poor - and I was there for dinner at 5.30pm before a show.  I finally got a menu and realised there wasn't much veggie choice (which I guess is to be expected, so that's not a biggie) but I opted for a pancake which sounded intriguing. 
Well, we waited 40 mins for food, and only after enquiring were brought an undercooked and frankly bizarrely chewy dish, minus the advertised salad. I would normally have sent something like this back, but by this point we were in a rush and there seemed to be no point, so I just graciously ate, then tried and failed to pay using Apple Pay. I think this is just not for me, and won't return,,,",-1
3,"Wong Kei is notorious for its extremely rude staff and cheap tasty Chinese food. The rudeness of the staff has to be seen to be believed but people keep returning to China Town's largest restaurant.
Why? Well the prices have probably remained the same in years which is good news in these credit crunch times. Wong Kei is a no nonsense fast food restaurant- don't expect to relax after your meal with a glass of wine. The next 'batch' of customers will be nearby ready to sit in your seats as soon as you have paid the bill. It's not so much service with a smile as service with a snarl.
The food is always good although that cannot be said for the interior- I wouldn't describe it as dirty but another paint job is definately long overdue. Do NOT come here for a romantic meal because you are seated with strangers on the circular tables.
It might not be for you but I always know what to expect- good value Chinese food but no customer service. That's fine with me and they are so abrupt it's almost entertaining.",-1
5,Uau! What an amazing restaurant. Everything is amazing. Have to go there every time I visit London!,1
4,"Great little restaurant/bar in the newly done up Southbank area. 
Round tables downstairs for social dining whilst upstairs is a cosy bar with low lighting and sofas - you can eat in the bar bit too.
 Yummy dim sum to please all at a bargain £3 a dish, plus great cocktails (i recommend the Mango & Gin one). Also a big fan of the Jasmine tea which comes in tall glasses and when hot water is added the little jasmine flower opens up - so pretty!
 Gets quite busy so recommend booking in the eve!",1
2,"I hate Ping Pong. I hate its greasy little fancy 'round' prawn toasts (which just means bread got thrown away, which is a shameful waste). I hate its stupidly expensive menu. I hate that its pork buns aren't as good as any in Chinatown. I hate waiting ages for a table with rubbish bar service in the meantime. I hate the haughty waiting staff. I hate that it seems to have invaded London. I hate that it is so easy to go here, the bill always shocks me, and I feel dirty handing over my money. 
I really like their bubble tea-style champagne cocktail. 
I am weak.",-1
5,"Good food, trendy look. Very cool fish tank bar downstairs. Food is tasty, small portions and expensive but for SOHO London it is what it is. 
Enjoyed their mixed cocktails too, the Hakka is great.",1
4,"The ultimate in comfort food. Never had better ramen!
I had the tonkotsu made with 20-hour pork broth. It is rich, flavoursome, filling, refreshing and the noodles, veg and egg melt in your mouth.
A couple of admin points: it opens all day at the weekend (Yelp suggested it was closed at the time we were there) and they don't take Amex.
This is real soul food and is definitely worth the trip I highly recommend it! A new London gem.",1
4,"The food is exquisite, and the ambience is intimate - despite the jungle of plants. Perfect for a romantic meal, or entertaining an important client. Abandon the no-carb diet - the bread is superb as is the selection of cheese and hand baked biscuits at the end. Good wine list as expected.
The only thing that lets it down is the varied customer service - there are some very rude and pretentious staff there. 
We were a party of two, we had a three course meal, two bottles of wine, the bill was about £160. It was worth it.",1
3,"Just OK.  Nothing to rave about.  Not sure why people waiting in line for two hours for.  Flavor and spice level are tone down to 30% of regular Indian food.  Cheese chicken ruby is too oily on the sweet side, not sure why?  Daal is pretty good.  Naan is above average.  Samosa is good, Keema Pau not bad.  Spicy potato is good, spicy lamp chop too dry.  Biryani is good.  DONOT order lasi drinks, no flavor at all.  This place is more like Britainized Indian food.",-1
5,"This is one of my favorite spots to eat in London and apparently a lot of others too. They don't take reservations so you will have to wait in line to be seated. Even on weeknights the wait can be around 1 hour at peak time (7-8pm). I suggest going early (6pm) or late (9:30pm) if you prefer a shorter wait.
First stop is the bar. They make delicious cocktails. 
Once seated you can't go wrong. We ordered the chicken tikka, masala prawns, lamb biryani, chicken ruby, black house daal, bowl of greens and garlic naan. All delicious but my favorite was the lamb biryani. I wish we had ordered two orders of naan instead of one to dip in the sauces.
Great meal! Can't miss if you are in London.",1
5,"I first saw this restaurant on an article that stated that this was one of the cheaper options to try that has a Michelin star. As a result, when I went to London, I had to give this place a try. My family was seated right away when we went there. The environment was classy and it was very enjoyable looking at all of the desserts displayed on the side. Even though the dim sum is pricey compared to other Chinese restaurants, I think it's still worth the price since they use more expensive ingredients. My favorite was the scallop xiu mai. After eating here, I'd have to say this was the best dim sum restaurant I've ever had (and I've had a lot) but it's also by far the most expensive. If you have the cash, I highly recommend trying this place out. And don't forget to get the dessert too!",1
3,"I would put this place in the catagory of ""another Chinese restaurant in China town"" in general pretty unremarkable. The food was ok, the service was what you learn to expect in many ""Chinese restaurants in China town"" - sit, eat, leave.... The latter at their insistence. 
It's supposed to be well known for their duck, it's not my dish of choice but I tried it and it was good (very fatty, but I hear that's the best part). 
The restaurant is of a  reasonable size and they maximize the number of seats which means your pretty close to the next table. 
My personal opinion is the best Chinese restaurants aren't in China town, but for quick eats this place meets the requirements.",-1
3,"Not bad for local standard, but lacks authenticity.  Soup base should be richer, the noodle is a bit too soggy for ramen gurus.",-1
5,"Breakfast? Yes, breakfast! 
'Til 11am weekdays, and noon on weekends. We made it in just under the wire for Saturday breakfast with friends, and we were absolutely delighted with the offerings. It's not a super extensive list, but they do what they do quite well. 
My pal and I both ordered the egg and bacon naan (served with a wonderful spicy jam) and then the housemade granola + yogurt and fruit to split. We both wished we'd ordered our own granola, as 1. it was fantastic and 2. the portion was a bit small for 5 quid. However, it was tasty. The boys enjoyed the bigger breakfast plates and were also very satisfied. 
Service was swift, friendly and we were seated immediately and prompted for drinks. The bloody mary was very different (in a great way) and all the chai and coffee were well received, despite being served in glass. There's something I can't quite grasp about hot drinks served in glass, but that's how they do it here. 
Highly recommend for breakfast, it's a different spin and one worth trying most definitely. Just don't skimp on that granola, you'll regret it when you try to order more and it's past breakfast-time!",1
4,Hakkasan is a Michelin star rated Chinese fusion restaurant located down a back alley in Central London. You  would not know it was there unless you were specifically looking for it. Hakkasan is not reliant on pedestrian traffic and yet it can be difficult to get a reservation. There is actually a dress code and formal shoes are required. If you are going to spend this kind of money on a meal you should dress up and make an effort anyway. Do make sure to bring the credit card with you because this is an extremely ridiculously expensive restaurant. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is romantic. If you work it right you will be too drunk at the end of the meal to care about the price.  It is rated number 19 out of the 50 best restaurants in the WORLD not just London. I think going to restaurants you can't really afford makes for a memorable and more appreciated night reserved for birthdays and anniversaries. When was the last memorable meal you had at Nandos?,1
5,"After a lukewarm review in the last fortnight by Grace Dent, I was reconsidering the wisdom of my choice to bring my wife here for our 4th anniversary.
I'm glad I stayed the course.
In terms of location - we did end up in one of those slightly sub-optimal places outside of the main atrium, but you know what? I didn't mind. Even the relatively pokey table we got (booking only 2 weeks in advance is apparently a rookie error) was actually fine. Would it've been nicer to be in the conservatory? By the looks of it yes, but the ambience was perfectly adequate. Granted, the whole ""most romantic restaurant in London"" vibe was missing, but it was still completely fit for purpose for a nice evening meal with a loved one.
Service throughout was absolutely spot on; from the girl who greeted us and took our coats, through to the sommelier and the food runners, all of the staff were attentive, jovial, and professional. As a restaurateur, my biggest pet peeve is bad service, but these guys didn't put a foot wrong. Nothing was too much trouble, and they balanced well the needs for discretion and engaging service. 
Breads looked superb in totality, though I never moved beyond their frankly sublime cheese focaccia. My opening piece which seemed to boast a schmear of ricotta in the centre was indisputably one of the finest breads I've had. 2 Further pieces lacked the same slightly sharp bite of cheese filling, but remained gloriously soft and flavourful.
Food was consistently good. Crab with smoked anchovy and cauliflower brought together 2 of my least favourite things into a very surprising dish. Paired with a wonderful Alsatian Riesling, it promised that the rest might well blow my concerns out of the water.
Foie Gras next, with roasted quince and gingerbread. Wonderful. A light touch from the kitchen, evocative of something I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it conjured up very warm feelings. Great little confit duck croquette. Served alongside a stunning Fiano orange wine, this was a great next step.
Cod with vermicelli and chorizo was one of the less exciting dishes. Beautifully cooked fish, with a lightly spiced pasta (they described it as more like a paella, which sort of makes sense in terms of the serve) was very pleasant, if not as demanding of oohing and aahing as other courses. 
Gorgeous duck with roasted plum and endive to follow. Slightly overcooked against the medium-rare that they recommended, but on the rarer side of medium, so hardly a travesty. My virtual thermometer may be off, but I know the Chef that night was French, so am surprised he erred towards better done. A stunning 2001 'Corullon' from Spain quickly smoothed over any slight wrinkles.
A last minute request for the cheese course was graciously obliged, and I'm incredibly pleased that it was so. A wonderful cross section, including Lancashire Bomb and Bleu St Jacques was superb, along with a cheeky Madeira. Biscuits are supposedly ""hand baked"", though they looked bought in. Very nice all the same.
We closed on a peanut butter parfait with a black sesame sponge which was a very interesting juxtaposition of flavours and textures. Not seen anyone convert black sesame into the almost seaweed-like sponge that accompanied this. The accompanying 2007 Jurancon was bang on the money - by far one of the better ones I've tried.
Petits Fours, coffee and Calvados, along with some complimentary eaux de vies, provided a very welcome rounding off.
All in all a very worthy location for a dinner, regardless of which table you get. I will certainly be popping back in (maybe even just for an impromptu course or two with a glass of wine, but can happily recommend it for any and all occasions. Fellow diners appeared to comprise birthdays, large groups, and informal post-dinner crowds, so the clientele is an interesting mix, though it seems like a degree of pre-planning is required to have any certainty of a table.",1
5,"This place is a treat if you love dim sum. I was skeptical of places with fancy shmancy titles and michelin stars, but now I'm a believer. The dim sum, drinks, desserts here are amazing. The food is high quality, well made, and not greasy. It's definitely far above your typical Chinese fare. I'm in love with the food here! Perhaps the best dim sum I've had yet.
I saw every single table order the bbq ribs, but I personally didn't find those worthwhile. While they were very delicious, they're overly salty and not the most amazing I've had. Hey, I am from the south after all. :P
The service was absolutely impeccable. The atmosphere was perfect as well, beautiful place.",1
5,"The best dim sum in London. Once you've been here, you won't go anywhere else.",1
2,"This is a solid 3 stars, if you only order the ramen. The buns were a huge disappointment, lovely soft and fluffy, ruined by iceberg lettuce, piece of cucumber and pretty rank Mayo. Not worth queuing for, pricey, but I can forgive a little of that given it is in tourist central. Broth is made centrally and shipped in, if that matters to you. I feel kind of bad about the two stars, but don't big up the buns and leave me feeling like I've been conned out of seven and a half quid ! Will I be back, probably not.",-1
3,Didn't quite live up to my expectations,-1
4,"Ordered duck takeaway, it was excellent as usual. Not sure why they were rated the best duck shop, but I do agree that their drippings are nicer than other restaurants. Very small but successful restaurant, gotta enjoy my dinner at home then ;)",1
5,"Excellent ramen. Excellent atmosphere. Excellent mochi ice cream.
The ramen is deeply flavorful with unique toppings like ""cock scratchings"" which is crushed fried chicken skins. The atmosphere is hip and trendy, with tight quarters, communal seating, and no reservations. The service is quick and kind. Top it all off with excellent mochi, a Japanese dessert that are tasty balls filled with ice cream.
I was a tourist and this was the best meal of my trip.",1
4,"My friend took me here as a birthday treat and i was pleasantly surprised. The dim sum dishes offered are quite innovative and the noodle dishes were nice and a good size. There is a wonderful selection of teas also.
 The only thing I didn't like too much was the slightly rushed service during the meal.
 Other than that I would probably go back again for a special occasion, and even more so just to visit the shop upstairs that sells the wonderful macaroons. Lots of different flavours, the Pandan flavour is awesome!",1
5,"Yum Yum in my Tum - Bone Daddies is the one! Well, it's kinda' rhymes! I had the Tonkotsu Raman in the Pork Bone Broth and it really was one of a kind. Be prepared for a queue and the seating is pretty tight - absolutely worth the wait though!",1
3,"Too salty, too rich, I believe the kitchen is not related with Japanese, or at least the intentioned customer is not Asian but Europeans.",-1
5,"Known as the fast food chinese in chinatown, 
The service is brisk and you get stuck on tables with complete strangers while we all tuck into our food, its like were back in asia again... its great ;)
The cheap eats, with  big portions... and taste is pretty authentic 
Average cost is £4-8 for a dish 
I ordered 
Ramen noodles with duck
3 meats with rice 
with free green tea",1
4,"I'm glamorously late to the Yelp! party review on Bone Daddies, and I'm giving this a 4* to be even more useless to the rating itself, but do I give a rats? No. Because I'm an elite yelper, and that's what we do in this town. We give our two pennies (cents if you're Ameri-porean) worth even if it doesn't mean a darn.
So. Since I'm spectacularly late, I'm going to make up for it. 
GET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS ON EVERYTHING!! 
You'll thank me later.
If you've been following the tales of my exploits for noodles and swimming, you'll know that my professor friend and I go swimming once a week and we end up somewhere in Soho for noodles after. This time around, it was Bone Daddies turn. Besides knowing there was an elite event here, and having walked past and had one of the sexy waiters try to seductively lure me in (with good tasting noodles - and it certainly helped that the waiter was hotter than the broth they served here), I had to try the newest installment of gourmet ramen in my neighborhood.
For starters, try the BD Fruity or the Carrot and Ginger juice. Both excellent drinks on the menu. 
Both professor and I were torn at what to choose on the menu. The good thing I guess is that they have all kinds of sides. So, if you want nori on the chicken ramen, or an extra egg in that soy ramen, you can add them in at a bit extra £1 for an egg, £0.20 for the nori. 
We decided to go for the Ramen Salad (a ramen dish tossed in sesame sauce) and the Soy Ramen. Intrigued by cock-scratchings, we asked the friendly Aussie waitress about what they were. Apparently it's chicken skin/fat that's been fried to a crisp and sprinked on top of the noodles.
Now, here's the tip... Cock-scratchings are not on the list of extras, but as mentioned above and I'll mention it again, GET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS SIDE ON EVERYTHING. It's like the fat pipette. Indulgent, but you won't regret it. 
Everything was impeccable, and the sesame seed grinder was doubly a treat. 5*s would have been given if the broth was steamier. Was too cold by the time it reached the table. I will definitely be back. :-)",1
3,"Heatwave in London. Warmest summer ever and what better than a super hot face melting bowl of Ramen!  Gambate! Itadakimaaaas!
I peeked over the door noren and I see this place is packed already. I guess I wasn't the only one mad in the brain to eat hot ramen on a hot day. Anyhoo.. I held up 4 fingers and the hostess seemed to know I meant .. table for 4.  So she led me to the tiniest of tables, crammed next to 2 of the tiniest of tables, and with a quick Hai Dozo.. I was left there.  But,... but.... I cannot possible traverse the tiny space between the tables to get my seat on the inside.  I mean.. people were already eating , and their bowls of ramen was perched on their tables, and I would most def, either knock their table over... or even worst.. go past the tables sideways and put my butt right over their table.. So I gave the hostess a helpless look.. ehh...sumimasen... but she looks away.  Fine.. be like that.. so I proceed to wedge myself between table and takes seat.. So uncool. Tho my wife rolled her eyes at me.  
I needed ramen, I needed something to restore my center.  The walking and sightseeing and meal decisions while visiting London has been exhausting.  I needed ramen to get back to basic.  We got us, Dracula Ramen, Regular Tonkotsu, I think there was Spicy Miso too.  tldr;- None was spectacular. It wasn't bad.  But it lacked an identity.  The noodles was text book, the broth standard, the chashu pedestrian, the toppings bleh.  In a sea of ramen.. Shoryu ramen did not stand out one bit.  
Service was so-so.  I don't expect it at a Ramen-ya anyway.  So I was fine with bare minimum.  
I don't know if there is better Ramen in London.  This isn't bad, but I would search harder the next time for something better.",-1
2,"In a city with no shortage of good food, Roti Chai is definitely a runt of the litter. The branding and decor are cool, but there's not a whole lot of depth below the surface. 
The food is rather bland for Indian food, and the whole street food shtick has been become rather tired and trite. This must be the universe's way of saying ""beta, don't waste your shillings on such mediocre khaana when you can eat your ammi's cooking and buy her a gift with the money instead"": point taken universe! 
The cocktails are actually fantastic here, and the few my brother and I tried were delicious, and reasonably priced...the food on the other hand was uninspired. The agni ""fire"" wings were fatty and chewy and as far them being ""dangerously hot and spicy"" per our waitress...mah, me thinks not. The English concept of ""spicy"" is laughable and the general lack of ""mirch"" left most dishes lacking in any sort of real flavor. 
I'd stop in for drinks and maybe a samosa...beyond that, just go to Dishoom!",-1
5,M favorite Indian fusion restaurant in London. Nice decorstion and a good choice of food. Better go there for lunch to avoid the long queues...,1
5,The best ramen I've ever tasted. The stock is so smooth and delicious fillings. Atmosphere amazing -they think of everything. Right down to a hair tie for the girls!,1
4,"Call me picky but this is one of the only really acceptable Chinese places in London that serves decent cantonese dim sum, the only Xiao Long Bao that's matches with an average Hong Kong XLB. 
I am not going to say it's spectacular because many restaurants in Hong Kong can match up with this level. This is average when comparing to a Hong Kong restaurant but with better ambience.
I consider everything else fast food (ping pong or whatever else in china town)..... but this one is the only good quality dim sum place in London.",1
2,"Having lived in NYC and LA, I've had some pretty bomb-ass ramen and unfortunately this just didn't match up. I had the most popular tonkotsu ramen  with supposedly extra rich broth. However, I had to add a little more chili oil and soy sauce than I would have liked in order to make it more flavorful. It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't the best and I'm not sure that I'd return. On the positive side, the guy who brought us our water was really nice and friendly :)",-1
4,"After hearing good things about this place, I had to give it a try! Me and a friend popped along on a Wednesday evening. After waiting well over 45 minutes in the queue(apparently there is always a long wait)
The food was top notch however. Being a vegetarian, the Black Dal did not disappoint, and the Roomali Roti's were freshly made by hand.
With a buzzing , great atmosphere & large drinks selection, it was somewhere that definitely I would go back too.
Would have 5 stars, if it wasn't for the long wait, or they took reservations!! :)",1
3,"I've had better, but if I lived in London, I'd be a regular.
What I liked about Tokyo Diner was the interior design of the restaurant. When inside the restaurant, I really felt like I was in Japan. I didn't get to see the second floor, but the first floor is very cramped. I had to wait outside the restaurant for about 20 minutes.
I got the gyu don, and it wasn't too special. I am huge tofu fan and I enjoyed the age-dashi tofu.

3,Good sushi but overpriced.  Certainly not worth going to if you're visiting and live somewhere where you can get quality sushi anytime.,-1
2,"Went for dinner with friends.
Likes: 
1. Interior very nice
2. Servers very polite 
3. Ordered the lychee and ginger iced tea was very nice
4. The duck spring rolls were nice
Dislikes: 
1. Waited a long time for our food 
2. Food came at different times 
3. Found the food very expensive for the portion of food
4. Music was so loud we couldn't even hear each other speak
We were waiting for so long we ended up leaving after a trying a few dishes and had a burrito at wahacca's kitchen food van.  
Overall I don't think I'll be going back for dinner at ping pong, however if I do go back I'll probably order a set menu instead or just go for lunch.",-1
5,"Had dinner there on Sunday evening, the combination of good cuisine and a relaxed....rather intimate atmosphere, the hall was dark, but at the same time a lot  of people revive the atmosphere of romance... quite busy place in the evening....
Roasted Silver cod was come with too sweet souce..as for me..
A wonderful dessert ""The emperor garden"", I highly recommend....",1
4,"Great spot for an occasion or a pre-going out dinner. Fusion food, loungy music. Kinda people watching spot where everyone is proper and well dressed. Make sure to reserve well in advance as it gets very crowded. Choose to sit downstairs to enjoy the blue aquarium and cool lighting.
Easy to get overwhelmed by all the choices of dim sum. Best to choose a selection of three/four (3 pieces each) so 9/12 total and you are all set. Around £25/person with tea. Fair price. Have had more expensive meals in Chinatown in a less pleasant atmosphere. 
It was my birthday and they brought a complimentary plate of macarons and a candle.  Nice touch
One star off for the service, I had booked at 830pm and we had to wait in the entrance for 30min so our table would be ready. Crowd accumulates in the entrance area so not super cool to wait there. However, you can check out the offer of macarons and pretty cakes overlooking the street... And not too much leg room under the table. 
In a nutshell: original, tasty dim sum in a chic atmosphere",1
4,"This place is amazing and you pay for every bit of it. If you feel like splurging on a stylish night out, then this is a great choice. 
You have someone greeting you at the door of this sleek hideaway. You have someone take your coat and yet another person check your reservation and guide you in. I'm surprised they didn't have someone forking the food into your mouth. 
I've found it tough to find a quality, creative cocktail in London - Hakkasan is clearly trying to make up for this and they do a good job. They also have a stellar wine list. 
The menu can be overwhelming. It's also shocking to see main entrees for £150 or more. I'm not kidding. It's nuts. 
My friend and I decided to split a bunch of starters including the dim sum platter (yummy), ribs (amazing), lamb salad (meat was too dry, I wouldn't pick this again), mushroom and water chesnut with lettuce (mediocre), soft shell crab (big yum). 
The waiter was average and didn't do a good job of advising us on how much to order and what makes a good combo, nor did she have any wine suggestions. For a place of this calibre, you'd expect the waiters to be pros. 
But in the end, it was all about the experience. It felt like being in a sleek spa, with scrumptious cocktails, original and memorable food and  WAY too expensive. I guess you're paying for them to have fifty people waiting around to show you to the bathroom and to keep up the gorgeous space...",1
3,"'£11 seems like a lot for a bowl of soup'. Um yeah. Not being an enormous ramen enthusiast myself, I was underwhelmed at Bone Daddies. It certainly did nothing to convert me to the ramen cause. I spent £23 here and left hungry. I could have spent that on a decent roast and left groaning. 
They charged 3 quid for a tiny cup of tea, I had two. That's £6 for about a half pint of oolong tea. 
I wasn't a fan of the tonkotsu ramen itself, it seemed pretty average and I didn't like the meat. I've had better ramen at beatnik Vancouver dives for about $5. 
However, the fried chicken was the best I'd ever had. My advice: do not share a portion, get your own. And the soft shell crab was divine. Get your own. 
I thought the service was friendly and quite good, we stayed for an hour and they never rushed us once, despite the queue of people waiting. 
i must be in the minority of not thinking this place was great, because I showed up at 11.45 and by 12pm, there was a queue of Asian families behind me. So, I guess you had better go and make up your own mind about the place. I probably won't be back.",-1
3,"We looking for a a quick noodle fix before our train back to Birmingham. This looked liked the go to place for ramen and it didn't disappoint. Up on arrival into the small restaurant a bong sounded and all the staff greeted us in unison. A unique if not strange touch. The two of us had traveling bags, so chose a 4 seater table. Even this was a squeeze. I went for the shoryu pork ramen and my partner went for the curry flavoured chicken ramen. we had pork buns on the side to share. The dishes came quickly and were well presented. I really enjoyed the pork broth and the slowed cooked egg was perfect. The pork buns though seemed a little unloved and a bit thrown together. Overall a decent quick cheap eat.",-1
5,"We had an excellent experience at Dishoom.  We started with the Bombay martinis and then shared a few dishes - all were tasty and an absolute treat.  The food is flavourful and it's great to be able to try and range of different tastes.  
It's also a great change to be able to have a lovely Indian meal in a beautiful environment.  The decor is great, nice vibe, fun atmosphere.  It's also great value for money (cocktails aside!)  Will definitely go back!",1
2,"My god. I've never had such terrible beef hor fun in my life. The noodles were tasteless and greasy, just a huge disappointment. 
The sauce for the mapo tofu was starchy and boring, basically just seasoned with a load of salt or soy sauce. 
The roast duck rice was average as well. The meat wasn't terrible but it wasn't great.
And to be honest, it isn't that cheap as well. Oh well. Come here if you wish, though I really don't recommend it.",-1
4,"I don't know: I bodied this tonkotsu ramen.  Washed it down with a gingery cocktail.  Walked home in the cold, with a warm belly full o' noodle sloshing (yeah, that sounds gross.  It felt good, though).
There is a wait.  It's not biggie, they've got heat-lamps and it moves fast if you're solo or a party of 2.  
Love: efficient, tasty, well-priced, tasty, tasty.  Did I say: tasty?  
YEAH.  
Super-appreciate that, despite being a busy spot, never ever felt rushed to finish up and open up my seat (I had some 2015 catching up to do with a pal!).
Great, attentive service - good tap water (yeah, yeah, it's a consideration!) served in great cups.
One watch-out: the tantanman ramen?  Hot as Hades.  Delish, but *hot as Hades*.  As my dining companion advised: ""they should have a flame icon next to that one!"".  Wurd.
Yelp note:  just flipping love the DIY counter in front of you - garlic and press and sesame and soy and hot chills.  Yes.",1
5,"There is a reason this place is always packed and that is great food and equally great ambiance.  Try one of the fresh juices with a shot of vodka if you drink.  The vegetable dumplings are divine and, lastly, the service is wonderful and elegant even under pressure.",1
3,"There's one thing you just have to know going into Nobu: it's expensive as all get out. Regardless of how much it costs to actually construct the dish, it will cost you an arm and a leg. It's kind of like Vegas, you just have to resolve yourself to a  certain ""sunk"" cost when you step inside. When you've made your peace with that, then you can make some smart choices to get the most enjoyment out of the 401k you gave up to eat there.
In terms of fish, I have to say that it's not the best, most flavorful, freshest fish I have ever tasted. Just like any other sushi joint, some days are better than others, and some cuts are better than others. Definitely ask what is best that day, because the sushi chefs will know. Remind yourself that you don't care about the price. The scallop has been very good, and of course you can rarely go wrong with Toro. Salmon is consistent but still not the best I've tasted.
The wagyu beef traditional style with two sauces is delicious. Sometimes you just can't beat a REALLY good cut of beef.
The hamachi and jalapeno starter is always a favorite of mine and Nobu does it to a standard almost worthy of the price.
while miso glazed black cod isn't the most original of dishes anymore, it's still addictive, and just as flaky as you remember it the last time, every time. You will most likely never be disappointed ordering this.
The sashimi salads are also a great starter. I'm partial to salmon, but the tuna is also very good. The dressing is light and the greens are a really refreshing starter, especially when you've been eating nothing but heavy british food for awhile which I have been guilty of.
The rock shrimp tempura is a classic. The shrimp is meaty, the tempura is not too oily, and there's a lot of it. So it's good for larger parties.
In summary, I like going to Nobu because of the atmosphere and the service and just the overall feeling of luxury and being spoiled. Since the price is 5x more expensive than other places, is the quality 5x? meh, probably not. But like I said, if you are willing to put down the cash if only to guarantee a no hassle, relaxing, consistently delicious meal, Nobu will get the job done.",-1
3,"After hearing so much about this place I finally checked it out. Overall I felt that this place was just average and didn't really live up to the hype. There were definitely positives and negatives and because I have such mixed feelings it will be easier to just list the pros and cons. 
Positives:
- Like the decor and atmosphere (they were playing nice 1920s music which gave it that speak easy feel)
- Friendly staff 
-  Chilli cheese toast - really good
- Lamb Biriyani - tasty, tender and well cooked lamb
Negatives:
- Tables were very close together (like they were trying to cram in as many people in there as they could)
- Chicken Tikka roll - really salty chicken and very odd flavours (super sweet, then a spicy kick, too overpowering taste of ginger), just really didn't taste nice (especially the chicken)
- The ""raita"" (this was just all wrong, no cumin, it had onions and tomatoes and lacked flavour big time), it was like a salsa that someone added yoghurt to, it was also such a huge portion (like a bowl full) 
- ordering process (we ordered the starters and only took the mains order while we were partway through eating the mains - a bit odd)
- Lack of choice (only 2 curry options - chicken or paneer and not many starters)
- You can't book a table for dinner (from 5:45) for less than 6 people 
So to summarise, would I come here again? Maybe (I would like to try the curry) but I'm not in any rush. Is it worth it to come here when you see massive queues outside? Hell no! (On principal, I never queue for restaurants anyway, but the food is definitely not worth queuing for).",-1
2,"A really posh restaurant steeped in history. That does not though, satisfy the taste buds of a vegetarian. The appetizers were good, but not exceptional. The main course was largely passable. You expect much more from such a posh place. My recommendation is to skip this if you are a fellow vegetarian. London has much better to offer.",-1
4,"I've been here a couple of times and the long queues are testament to how good it is. So busy that you have to even queue to get into the bar whilst you wait for your table but it is worth the wait if you really like your dim sum.
 If you're not sure what to have then go with friends, order random dishes and try a bit of everything, there will be something on the menu you'll like. And the cocktails are pretty good too, especially the long ones.",1
4,"I keep going back here yet the toilets are disgusting, the waiters have less charm than a brick wall and the place reeks of stale fat and buckets. Why? Because its cheap and fast. When eating out in one of the most expensive areas of central London, Soho, and in need of a quick bite to eat, you can eat here if you ditch your snobbiness at the front door and grow a thick skin in case one of the waiters decides to kick off at you.
 The best dish by far (and the cheapest) is the crispy aromatic duck. I've never seen it cheaper in London; half a duck will keep 3 grown men happy-chappy!
 But seriously, this restaurant is a hidden gem in Soho and well worth a visit. You'll hate it when you arrive but leave thinking you've been given a bargain. Just stay away from the toilets and be sure to be quick ordering your food!",1
4,"After a long flight , and navigating out of the madness that is London Heathrow, I looked forward to my first hot meal.  At Yauatcha.  Getting in was half the fun, since on the outside, all one saw were blue glass walls.  The space inside (the upstairs tea shop) was hip & fun and ready for the lunch crowd.  After settling in and given the complimentary Chinese pickles, i poured over the long list of items on the menu.  At Yauatcha, I really like their particular format for dim sum.  No one is pushing carts and hawking dishes, so you're not sitting there just waiting for stuff to come by.  You can order whatever you want from the menu.  Spend more time with your company, and again, just enjoy the surroundings.
For the 2 of us, we had a pot of tea, 7 dim sum items, and a rice dish.  The roasted Anxi Tie Guan Yin was very subtle, but had a mild smoky taste.  Some of the standout dishes included the Wild Mushroom Dumpling.  Oyster, shimeiji, and shitake in a chive-flavored dumpling skin, dotted on top with euryale seeds.  Perfect starter.  The Prawn Cheung Fun had the added crunch of brunoise of zucchini (or I suppose I should call it courgette as I was in London).  ;-).  The Pan-fried Turnip Cake had a whole mess of herbs and dried shrimp, a far cry from the bland affair at a lot of dim sum places.  The Sesame Prawn Toast was a throwback to my childhood.  Except here, there was a whole prawn, aside from the prawn paste.  The last dish was the Egg White & Salted Fish Fried Rice.  Typically, this dish could get bogged down with being too greasy, and too salty ingredients.  Here, it is very mild and perfectly seasoned.  A perfect finale to a perfect lunch.
Why 4 stars?  This is dim sum kicked up a few notches.  The dishes have been enhanced to make them more special.  It is in a modern, cool room  that provided a lot of the usual convivial vibe at dim sum houses.  Perhaps purists might scoff at the Westernization of it all, but i simply loved it.",1
2,"Not sure how this place gets so many 5 star reviews. It's pretty much quick & dirty Chinese food. I'm not saying this place is dirty (figure of speech), but its cleanliness is on par with a typical cheap Chinese restaurant.
I've had the Beef Flat Noodle and Slippery Egg & Beef Rice, which were average to below average. Quality was okay, service was pretty nonexistant; just go in, eat, and get out. I did feel slightly rushed here - though it might have been a more psychological thing for me than actual waiters trying to rush us out.
The servers seem to give bad service on purpose, but it's all in good fun - as if they're playing a part. They actually aren't rude and quite courteous. I remember one visit I was watching as a waiter kept his eye pinned on a little kid jumping around in a seat. The server mentioned to the family that it was dangerous for the kid (~3 years old) to be jumping on the seat like that, and that it could tip over - which the parents just ignored. The waiter had his eye on the kid whenever he wasn't serving someone else, and would occasionally jerk towards the kid/seat when the kid seemed to be losing his balance. Nice guy - though he told one of our party to get their own chopsticks when asked to get a set of chopsticks (which he did get).",-1
5,"I'll be brief: The best customer service I've received in a long time, and probably in my top 5 dining experiences ever. I was never left wanting for anything, the staff was incredibly knowledgeable about every menu item, and plates were brought in and taken away in a completely unobtrusive manner. These people are professionals of the upmost degree, and hats off to them.
The food was excellent. We shared some 4 small plates and entrees, plus a noodle dish and some excellent vegetables. I'd say the highlights for me were the small plates, particularly the salt and pepper squid and the dim sum platter (i'm looking at you little scallop and prawn wrap of tastiness) Unfortunately, it was still Chinese, and despite spending some $400 American on a meal, we were still hungry a few hours later and ended up at a Burger King. 
I can't say i'd come back unless I was once again invited as a guest,  as this place is definitely WAY out of my price range. Still, I feel incredibly fortunate to have had a chance to experience this meal.",1
4,"I'm making my way through high-end Chinese restaurants in London. In general, I have a narrative in my mind that while some asian foods, like sushi, enjoy a high markup, Chinese food in the Western world is often seen as cheap takeaway. You expect to have your kung-pao chickens and beef and broccolis served up to you in a takeaway box for about £5 - leading to caricatures like Panda Express in the states and Wok to Walk in the UK. The problem with these too for actual Chinese establishments is that because of this unidimensional view and a universal expectation of cheapness - Chinese restaurants end up battling over operational efficiency - cutting costs, skimping on taxes, paying minimum wage. Re-imagined, upscale Chinese restaurants would bring the benefit of giving Chinese chefs in the western world more freedom to experiment and explore while raising the overall expectation of what a Chinese restaurant could be.
Yauatcha, I'm visiting right on the cusp of having Duck and Rice yesterday. But Yauatcha is in style more similar to Hakkasan than it is Duck and Rice. So after I've eaten all of these foods, imagine my surprise when I realized that all three of these restaurants were created by the SAME GUY - Alan Yau; Yautcha of course being his namesake, Hakkasan named after his ethnic minority background of being Hakka and Duck and Rice I can only imagine because the guy probably GORGES himself on that stuff. Good for him.I happened to come with my Asian American roommate from New York that also went to Harvard (many shared identities as you can see) and we both had the Tou Chan. You can find the menu online, but I'll run through some of my favorite of the dishes:
Chicken Gyoza
Wild Mushroom Dumpling  - I generally like anything named ""wild mushroom x"" and this was no exception
Beef in black-bean sauce - so good, it reminded me of my childhood favorite ""dou chi ling yu"" which is fish with black bean.
Ultimately a great meal, for a reasonable £35.
I also highly enjoyed the ""nan"" and the ""nu"" on the door and briefly wondered how a non-Chinese reader would be able to distinguish between the men and women's bathroom, until I looked more closely and saw the ""W"" and ""M"" etched into the doors.",1
5,"It may not look like much from the outside but as soon as you enter Yauatcha you're in for a treat. As you wait for your table to be set up you can see all the luxurious dessert available from their dessert counter; this is surely enough to heighten up your anticipation of what's to come. My party of 6 was led downstairs into a sparkling underground dining area lit up with life-like (but actually fake) candles and twinkling lights on the ceiling that mimic stars. Yauatcha achieves what Hakkasan and Hutong fail to do, which is to create a special twilight-like atmosphere without plunging the restaurant into darkness; testament to this is that photos can still be taken with the utmost clarity whereby all the natural colours of the food are proudly visible.
So, the first impression Yauatcha achieves is certainly promising, but what of the meal itself? Well the menu is an issue...the issue is, there are so many fabulous options to choose from! Plus you are mindfully conscious of the fact that you want to leave enough space in your stomach to consume at least one of the delightful desserts you've just seen and etched into your brain. However, one of the fabulous benefits of dining with a group of friends is that you have a greater capacity for ordering more, feasting your eyes on more and trying out more.
The Duck Roll had a suitably crispy but light exterior with a satisfyingly meaty filling. The Scallop Shuimai was delicately soft with a quality offering of roe on top. The Siew Long Bun dumplings were tasty but easily split, letting out the juice of the dumpling - which is one of the cardinal sins of this type of dumpling; but it is hard to get these perfect. The Wheat Squid was so very well flavoured with dried shallots, garlic, spring onion and chilli peppers that I found myself lapping up all these extra bits until my tongue was burning from all the spice (- so be warned not to get carried away with polishing this dish off). The Beancurd and Prawn Cheung Fun had a beautifully smooth exterior around a crispy beancurd layer encasing a juicy prawn filling. The Crystal Pumpkin Dumplings were an attractive orange colour and delicately handcrafted to give one of the most original versions of dumplings that I've ever seen. The Seafood Asparagus dish was another fantastic creation, with sweet scallop and prawn amongst crunchy carrot and asparagus, all spilling out of a beautiful rice cracker shaped like an oyster. Probably the only dishes that were unexceptional were the seafood noodles and vegetarian noodles which were satisfactory but indistinctive and Yauatcha's attempt at vegetarian duck which was a good effort, with the texture of the duck and seaweed being a nice touch but the overall taste being a bit too salty.
The meal and experience of Yauatcha would not be complete without trying their dessert. As mentioned from the offset, the dessert on offer is enough to make your mouth water and your eyes widen. At this stage of my indulgent meal I was still able to spoil myself with one and a half desserts. The Exotic Pandan Dessert is a remarkable construction of thin layers of pandan cake, cream and mango filling with a shiny delicate gel on top that exhibits an intricate design. The cake is also accompanied by a dollop of smooth mango sorbet and the whole dessert is decorated with delightful titbits. The pear almond dessert was beautifully put together with the a smooth pear-flavoured layer on top of a quality biscuit base alongside a helping of nuts, a dashing of cream, a couple of pretty petals, a dollop of coffee-flavoured ice cream and a musky dessert sauce on the side. Needless to say, the desserts that Yauatcha serves up are truly a treat: with intricate designs, great colour combinations and a creative combination of textures and taste. 
As you can see, the whole dining experience at Yauatcha was exemplary and to top it all off, our waitress, Marjorie, was the most patient, accommodating, efficient and genuinely friendly waitress that I can ever remember having at any restaurant. The only mini-annoyance I have is that we were billed for the still water (one bottle of Still Water = £3.90) and not forewarned about this (which unfortunately can happen in restaurants if you don't check beforehand when they ask you if you want water). So, this aside, Yauatcha is for sure a restaurant to visit if you desire excellent quality Chinese food with original ideas and authentic Chinese recipes complementing each other at every turn. The desserts are sublime and the array of drinks well concocted. The location convenient, the atmosphere positive and the service as perfect as you could hope for.",1
4,"I've enjoyed this place very much! I came here for breakfast and it was awesome. That mix of Indian - English breakfast was surprisingly good! I had the naan roll with eggs and bacon...  and the chai very good too. It's a must if you like Indian food and you want to change your regular breakfast, and you have many options. A warm place with a great service! I will repeat for sure :)",1
5,"Absolutely crazy place, about a million covers, decent good value food.",1
3,"Decent, best way to describe it. Service was good. But was initially a bit spotty. The food was average. Just average. Disappointed as I was told London was the place to eat Indian food. I am also fairly picky about my Indian cuisine and was so surprised at how average my food tasted. Oh well.",-1
3,"My wife and I went here during our last night in London because it had a good Yelp rating along with the other parameters we used. I thought the food was great and normally the pros and cons of the place would have evened out to a 4 star experience, but the waiter we had was so bad that the meal ultimately ruined what would have otherwise been a pleasant end to our U.K. vacation. Frankly I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I'm restraining myself out of a greater sense of fairness and keeping it at 3 because I think overall this place is well managed and I can't justify dropping it lower mainly because of one waiter with a bad attitude. Thus, at the end of the day we sort of got what we paid for (3 stars), but it's not a place I'd really want to go back to or even recommend for others to try (3 stars).
When we first arrived we reached the back of a line outside the door and the staff did a great job of managing our expectations re: wait time and I thought it was really nice that at one point one of the waiters actually came outside with complementary tea for all of us. One of the people in line with us talked about how one of his friends always wants to come to this place whenever he visits London and I really liked how we could see what people were doing in the kitchen.
Then we got in and we had this waiter who seemed nice, but after the first glasses of water he never refilled them for us after being asked more than once. Thank God the food wasn't too spicy -- otherwise, we would have been in trouble! And he did that thing that too many waiters do where they hold you hostage with your bill and you have to flag them down, and this was getting pretty late on a Sunday night. Overall it gave us the impression that he just had this attitude of oh, these people are just American tourists, they'll never be back so forget about them. Adding insult to injury our bill had something called ""voluntary"" [tip/gratuity] instead of just charging an honest price for each of the items and managing our expectations instead of making us think oh wow, these prices are actually reasonable despite being in the heart of London.
Negatives:
-really small portion sizes -- this was to be expected and considering the prime location would not have been an issue if other basic things had been up to par
-no complementary rice -- this is more of a critique of U.K. Indian restaurants in general, but really? It costs almost nothing to make rice and an Indian restaurant without free rice is like a Mexican restaurant without free chips & salsa
Positive things:
-Excellent fresh taste, about as good as one could expect of Indian food (psst! There's also a great Indian restaurant in Salisbury near Queen Elizabeth's Park that's even better. My experience in the U.K. is that restaurants in outlying areas are better in addition to being more economical and in London you're better off just going to one of the big grocery stores)
-Great atmosphere, no complaints there
-From a cultural standpoint I liked that they offered Iranian items -- the lamb was quite good",-1
2,"Like others have said, the service is pretty awful but that's how it's supposed to be at an authentic Chinese restaurant, so that wasn't an issue. The food tasted okay and the prices were average. My only real problem with my experience was the stingy portion sizes of our dishes. I'm used to the whole mostly rice, very little meat thing that asian restaurants do, but the value at Wong Kei compared to what you can get elsewhere in London straight up bad. As a tourist from a small Canadian city with superior Chinese restaurants (in my humble opinion), I gotta say... Londoners deserve better and shouldn't have to pay ridiculously high prices for half decent service/food when it comes to Chinese.",-1
3,"The dim sum was not good. Half of the items off the ""Ping Pong Selection"" tasted like plastic. The food is definitely overpriced for the quality! Maybe my standards are high because I'm chinese, but also maybe this is just extremely average food.",-1
4,Super nice service or because I'm Chinese too? We had the combo of meats and it was delish! Oh you get oranges after the meal. :),1
4,"Fantastic interior, food very good to fantastic, wine list very good. The bar and selection of spirits and cocktails is particularly fine. Good number of front-of-house staff, so service is superior too. Can I say the exotic fruit platter dessert is worth the trip all by itself.",1
2,"Ooooooh dear. This really didn't tick the ""tasty dim sum"" box this evening.
The main problem here was service. It was *appallingly* slow and inattentive; I literally had to thrust my order into one of the waitstaff's hands in order for them to actually notice we were ready to order and take it. Not good at all. While the food came reasonably quickly afterwards, there was complete failure to clear empty dishes, and we eventually had to ask (twice!) for the bill.
The food was merely okay... yes, it was dim sum, but not exactly good dim sum. Their interpretation of bao was undercooked, their jiaozi were quite good but also slightly undercooked, the prawn toasts reasonably good, the wonton broth rather gritty and tasteless (although the wontons themselves were fair)... you get the picture.
Fortunately, the company I was with saved the evening from being a total disaster -- along with the actually quite acceptably tasting (but VERY weak!) cocktails. It's not worth the premium they charge though, I'm afraid. Overpriced, ineffective dim sum -- there are better places to go in London!",-1
3,"Dishoom is the sound a Bollywood film hero makes when he lands a good punch. How cool is that? The restaurant (although they call themselves a Bombay café) is pretty cool as well. Consisting of two floors, it's routinely packed to the afters on Friday and Saturday nights. Even for a  table for 3 at 6pm, the wait was 30mins so if going make sure to make a reservation or leave a margin for waiting. A quick pre-theatre meal this is not.
I've been wanting to go for ages since one of my Indian friends had raved about the dal and biriyani. So I grabbed him and another of my brown brethren and the three of us headed off to Dishoom for dinner.
As noted above, we had a wait so off to the downstairs bar we went. Dishoom doesn't have an extensive cocktail list (although I imagine any of the standard drinks would be provided upon request if you so asked) but it does have several classics rejuvenated with a Desi twist. I opted for the Chaijito which as the name suggests is a Chai infused mojito. I was a bit doubtful of a lime and chai tea flavour mix but I have to say it was spectacular. The clean crisp flavours of the lime just barely sweetened with sugar refreshed the palatte while the chai added a playful note without any of the cloudy and cloying after taste you get in a chai tea latte. My friends' Bollywood Bellini and some form of punch were also good but I would stick with my choice as being the best.
After about 20-25 minutes we were seated in a cosy table upstairs. Naturally, we ordered the house dal (a black lentil dal rather than the traditional red or orange) and a lamb biriyani with masala prawns for a starter. The prawns were good in their own right however could have used more masala to truly be masala prawn. The dal was delicious with a sharp bite and a deeper burn from the chillies used. The biriyani was tasty but nothing on what my mom makes (and since she made it a few days ago it had to contend with my recent taste memory). 
The garlic naan was sorely disappointed and looked more like a garlic topped Ryvita cracker than any real attempt at a naan. I hope ours was just an anomaly as a good naan is an essential pillar of a good Indian restaurant.
Overall, it's a bit expensive but a fun and tasty experience. Keep in mind this is more grilled type of Indian cooking rather than an abundance of curries (going North rather than South) but overall a good time. Definitely worked a treat as a pre-night out classy spot!
I really want to go back for breakfast and get a bacon naan roll!",-1
4,"Whenever I am feeling starving this is my go to place. Cheap and quick authentic Chinese food. Portion sizes are huge and it's perfect for large groups. 
Be prepared that if you go by yourself or with someone else that you get seated with other smaller groups. The menu is extensive and you really are spoilt for choice! Whatever you pick it's all delicious. 
My dishes of choice are always Singapore noodles, Pork chop and Aubergine on boiled rice, or Braised Brisket of beef on boiled rice. 
Free unlimited Chinese tea and quick service! Remember Cash Only.",1
4,"Yauatcha was recommended by a friend of mine as the informal version of London's well known restaurant Hakkasan. Alan Yau won Britain's first Michelin star for his Chinese cooking at London's Hakkasan  and has opened Yauatcha a couple of years ago.
Placed in middle of Soho my first trip there was in a rickshaw straight from a musical. We did not have a reservation and we also risked to miss the last order at 11pm at Saturday. After several left and rights in a labyrinth of narrow streets we arrives safe and sound. 
Friendly greeted we entered the ground floor of a modern decorated restaurant having our eyes drawn to gold fishes swimming in the display windows. The waiters all are dressed in a uniform designed by Tim Yip, who won an Oscar for art direction in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. During peak hours this restaurant is packed, lucky for us, we did not have to wait for a table and were seated in the chic teahouse and patisserie. 
I prefer it to the restaurant in the basement as I have to my front colourful patisseries displayed and to my back direct view into the kitchen, where Chinese chefs prepare the dim sums. Ordering several starters to share and some jasmine tea I finally get to try my prawn and date dumplings, which literally melt in my mouth. These Chinese dumplings were among the best I have ever tasted. For those who want to have a little bit more work I recommend the duck wrap.
We finally have time to relax and recover from a rather busy and packed Soho, the musical and the bumpy rickshaw ride.",1
5,"As soon as you walk in, they tell you to go upstairs!
This place was great. I was warned ahead of time that the service would be awful, but that wasn't really my experience at all.
The food was dirt cheap, tasted great, had huge portion sizes, and came quickly. The servers aren't necessarily super attentive or overwhelmingly chatty, but who cares? They brought my delicious and reasonably priced chinese food to me quickly. That's all I cared about. I would recommend this place and go again.
They only take cash, I didn't know this beforehand but there's an ATM/cash machine a block away so it wasn't a big deal to run and grab some cash money!",1
3,"Best meal of my recent visit to London. Like some of the other yelpers , being from the west coast and living in NY, I was skeptical of an Asian fusion spot in London. I was pleasantly surprised from the moment we pulled up into the small back lane entrance and walked downstairs into a fabulous underground lair. The decor was beautiful asian-style and contemporary plus the place was packed with a great, upbeat ambiance. The food surpassed my expectations - it was adventurous chinese mixing a nice balance of authentic flavours with new flair. Served family style, it made for a great group meal and I kept eating long after I should have put the chopsticks down. Not to mention the delish lychee cocktails which were more creative than the usual lychee martinis you'll find at so many asian fusion spots. Only downshot, cocktails were a bit slow to be offered and then delivered to the table and after our allotted dining timeslot,  we were politely but firmly asked to leave rather than enjoy another drink. Understand this is a reality for hot tables in London, NY etc but I prefer a subtle request versus the pointed ushering towards the door. 
All said, I would absolutely return!",-1
3,"Wonderful atmosphere. 
dim sum is just OK,. The other dishes are mediocre.
The drinks are pretty good.
The waitstaff are attentive.",-1
3,"We came here for a fancy dinner to celebrate our engagement.
The food wasn't memorable at all, but we ordered the cheapest champagne (still around £30) and it was the best champagne I've ever tasted. I'm still dreaming about that champagne.
In terms of special, we couldn't sit in the garden-y area because we didn't book far enough in advance (impromptu proposal and all), and we told 2 waiters that we just got engaged and were celebrating and neither particularly cared. ""Uhh okay, so here are the specials.""
A lot of buck, not much bang. Great potential though, and it is very pretty inside.",-1
5,"I was in Soho with a friend planning to eat at Koya but we saw the queue and decided to eat elsewhere. Time Out had raved about Yauatcha, so we decided to check it out (yes shame on me, i should stay true to Yelp for recommendations). 
We stepped into a gorgeous restaurant surrounded with decadent deserts and modern chinese decor. We were promptly seated downstairs (next to the bar which also acts as a fish tank, amazing). 
Not sure what to order, we shared steamed chicken dumplings, grilled vegetable dumplings and beef ho fun noodles. The food was served quickly and was simply the best i've eaten in a while. I also had a lime and passion fruit ice tea which washed it all down nicely. All together the meal was £15 each including drinks which i think is a reasonable amount for a lunch date. It is on the more pricey side but it's really not surprising considering Yauatcha has a Michelin star, well deserved too. 
Highly recommended. I'm saving my pennies for my next round of dim sum.",1
2,"Overrated, overpriced. The food is good, the atmosphere is ok (when not overcrowded), this poor chain of restaurants is a victim of its own success - not for people who actually want to enjoy their food AND their conversation. On the plus side, definitely worth a try, the food is quite nice. Just not living up to the hype it has.",-1
3,"This place was OK, but way overhyped. 
It is a well-decorated place, and the food was decent - but as expensive as it was (about £30-40 pp), and as long as the wait was (2 hours!!), I wouldn't do it again.
The ruby chicken was the best thing we'd ordered. The paneer tikka was the runner-up for me.",-1
3,"All in all the experience was alright. Had heard good things about this chain, so had high expectations for an authentic banging ramen. Was pleasant, though they forgot about our sides.... Also didn't see one Japanese staff.... Was a little odd but I guess they pulled it off ok. In summary, it was ok. The space was pleasant, the service was ok... Erm... Prob a little like an upper end fast food joint though? I dunno.. Maybe I'm too picky? I'll still rate it a 3.5 out of 5.",-1
3,"Ramen in london.  After visiting japan, the ramen was average.   Nothing bad about it although it it took an awful long time to arrive to the table.  The servers were really nice.   The price i felt was too high compared to other competitors.",-1
5,I haven't even paid my bill yet. This place is amazing the lamb raan and black daal combination is beyond amazing. I would fly back to London from the US just for this.,1
2,"Bad service. Bad food. 
Super cheap. 
The worst restaurant review I ever gave out. 
You might like this place if (1) you have never had Chinese food before, (2) you like dickheads to serve your table, (3) you enjoy sitting next to some stranger, watching them slurping noodles, and getting their saliva/broth all over your face. 
If you love your stomach and want a stranger's-saliva-free face, stay away.",-1
3,"*Be aware of the £15 minimum per person purchase, our neighbors were kicked out for wanting to order apps only, see below*
We ordered the vegetable biryani with vegetable curry, chicken madrasa, bullet naan and a beer. The rice and chicken madrasa was very flavorful, spicy and worth the order. The bullet naan wasn't anything special, the cilantro and chillies didn't add much flavor. 
*Food was delicious, however, the lead waiter was pretty rude to other guests (we were there at 3:30 pm: he asked a couple to leave for only waiting to order appetizers, and a father wanted to sit next to the window with his daughter but he wouldn't let them).",-1
1,"I can only postulate the kitsch of eating indian food in the heart of london and the assumption that a long line must mean great food has brought this place unwarranted attention.  The wait in line is about 45 min. as they refused to take a reservation from me when I passed by the restaurant earlier in the afternoon.  The other people in line (whether London natives or tourists, I don't know) and of course the two hosts at the door raved about the place and assured me that the wait would be worth it.
First: this is NOT authentic indian food, north, south, east, west, or heart of india, pakistan, bangladesh, Afghanistan, what have you.  It is FUSION.  For those who already knew that, i'm just stating the obvious then.  For those who didn't, this is fusion, pan-indian, and likely not what you will find if you visited any of the above countries.  
Second: the food is spicy.  I like spicy food, but it seemed to me that the vast majority of their dishes were spicy and there was not much variation.  Even the okra fries!
Third: The kacchi lamb dish (cubes of dry lamb under a mound of rice) is by far the driest piece of rubbish I have ever tasted in my life.  I had to cut it up into little tiny pieces, douse it in their black daal before I could even eat the thing.  Utterly horrible.  I'm also not quite sure what the hype is over this black daal.  Not amused.
Last: To end on a good note, service is very good as they are attentive and helpful.  In a city that makes you bleed money, this place is actually relatively affordable.  But overall, not worth the wait, not even for 45 seconds.",-1
5,"My wife and I went here on our vacation. Loved it. I'm not big on Indian food, but I'm sold on this place. The server had us try all different kinds of dishes and had us order the perfect amount. Great drinks as well. Highly recommended.",1
3,"A solid and well priced French restaurant, it's been on Upper Street for 30+ years for a reason - because it serves decent food at a great price.
The crayfish and lobster ravioli is very nice, as are most of the starters. I've had the steak and chips and lamb for main and have been happy, never blown away. 
You get more than what you pay for here. We also checked out the new one, Mercury Deuxieme the other week and it was good too.",-1
4,"Wong Kei used to be a go-to place for me when visiting London in my youth. It was a good place for a quick, reliable meal to start or end an evening in the pubs around Covent Garden and Leicester Square.
Visiting London again, I thought it would be good to renew my acquaintance with the place after what must be 15 years, particularly because I was traveling with a friend who grew up in Hong Kong - I was keen to get his take on the experience.
I am glad to say Wong Kei did not disappoint after all this time. Apart from the staff's fun uniform t-shirts, everything else was exactly as I remember it. The brisk, efficient service was as unfriendly as ever. The plastic bowls and flatware was as classy as ever. The seating arrangements were as communal as ever. But best of all, the food was as tasty and good value as ever. I was always a fan, and I still am.",1
4,"Brunch at Dishoom was fantastic. As it was my first time there- I had the highly recommended bacon naan which didn't disappoint. The portion size was slightly on the small side for brunch so if you're really hungry its probably a good idea to order some extras. Really liked the feel of the place- bright and airy with great decor. Although we sat inside- the front veranda was probably the most impressive part of the building. Service was a little haphazard with our drinks arriving one at a time (there were three of us) and well after our food. Also, this is probably the only Indian restaurant I have ever been to that caters for nut allergy sufferers- usually I avoid Indian restaurants completely as they don't tend to understand the seriousness of nut traces in their food. Will definitely return.",1
3,"I was there yesterday for lunch. Nice place, authentic Japanese food in London's Chinatown.
I had a great sauce chicken katsu don - YUMMY ! The resto has a strong Udon menu but perhaps lacking in the sashimi department. 
I also appreciate its sustainable development policy re not serving tuna. 
Would definitely return.",-1
4,"""Do you like duck?""  This was the question that was asked of me (quite randomly I might add) by my friend while I was visiting him in London.  I do happen to be a fan of duck, so when he recommended we go to the Four Seasons in Chinatown, I was all for it!
The place is fairly small and looks like most Chinese places I've been to.  There were seven in our group so we were sat at one of the larger tables in the back that have rotating glass in the center (very good for family style sharing).  Since my friend had been here before, we let him do most of the ordering.
We started with hot and sour soup (one of my personal favorites) which was much spicier than what I've had here in the States.  I'm a huge fan of spicy food so that was no problem for me!  We then moved into our main courses of whole roasted duck and BBQ duck, both of which were absolutely delicious.  The whole duck came with thin tortilla-like wraps that we used with veggies and sauces to make our own duck wraps.  I'm not such a fan of the BBQ duck as it's a little fatty for my liking.
We also had a shrimp dish which was pretty yummy.  For whatever reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to order Lychee wine.....yeeeaaaahhhh....not the best.  It was way too sweet, strong, and just overall not good.  Wouldn't recommend it.
For dessert we had just plain old Lychee which WAS delicious.  Those sweet little balls made my mouth very happy (that's what she said).  When you're done with your entire meal, they bring you oranges (kind of like an after dinner mint).
The service wasn't too bad.  It was a little slow at times and one of the smaller dishes we ordered never made it to our table, but they were very nice about taking it off our bill.  Overall, I would have to agree with the masses and say that they have the best duck around.",1
2,"I went for brunch and had the sausage naan.  It was ok, but from the queue, I kind of expected more.  Maybe dinner is better.",-1
3,Good -- not great quality. Very Expensive. Beware.,-1
3,"Bland.  Bland, bland, bland.  
I visit family in London once a year.  This year my splurge was to go to Chiltern Firehouse.  It's a beautiful space with excellent staff and excellent wine selection.  The food presentation is exquisite.  And the food is... meh.  
-mini-doughnuts stuffed with crab meat -- the doughnut was tasteless,
-chard octopus had potential, even simply done with lemon it can be fantastic, but this preparation with a little pickled radish and a little chorizo was underwhelming, 
-the salmon was presented beautifully and it was fine but hardly worth a return trip.  
The best part of the meal was excellent brown bread with fantastic creamy, creamy butter.",-1
5,"Absolutely loved this place! The atmosphere, the food, the complimentary drink while queuing outside - outstanding! Very glad we stopped by this place which was one of the highlights of our trip to London.",1
4,"This place is fun...............Clean bright, modern and the staff are very efficient.
 There is a list of various dishes - fried, steamed, rice etc. All you have to do is tick the box beside your choice and before you know it you are set upon by various staff piling your table with lots of amazing plates of food, dipping sauces, pancakes, wine, water........... and as quickly as it came the empties are cleared away to make room for the next surge of food.
 In the main area of the restaurant there are big round turning tables, ideal for a larger group of friends who wish to share dishes.
 I came away feeling very full and the meal was really quite inexpensive. £50 for two of us which included wine and water.",1
5,"Tried dim sum for forst time in my life here. I am not much of a person who likes to experiment, but was dragged in here by a group of friends.
Liked the place very much, liked the dim sum very much also.",1
4,"Yauatcha is the place to go for meticulously made morsels of dim sum gorgeousness. I'm not experienced enough with dim sum - although I've enjoyed my fair share - to know just how experimental or creative it can be without departing from its essence or origins. But Yauatcha appears to both retain the familiar core of dim sum and push the boundaries of taste and presentation.
 At Yauatcha you could dine out on presentation alone: they take visual beauty very seriously. Each element is artfully combined to play colour against texture against size and shape.
 But most memorably, the clever an unusual combinations of basic ingredients (pork, prawns, scallops, soft-shelled crab, for example) with subtle spices and seasonings, encased in truly world-class pastry, amount to a sparkling dim sum fantasia beyond reasonable expectation.
 The highlight of the afternoon was quite possibly a lovely, moist, spongy, buttery pastry sprinkled with sesame seeds with a venison (yes, venison) stuffing that just oozed with sinful suggestiveness.
 Jade dumplings, so-called because of their green hue, stuffed with wild mushrooms were another inspired marvel.
 The tea menu is equally staggering in its breadth - we practically got high on so many delicate, aromatic teas.
 And all of this happens under the watchful eye of slightly dopey goldfish and miniature carp in a long fishtank.
 Service is somewhat erratic and indifferent, but when the dim sum starts flowing, coming at you in waves of colour, you are past caring.
 This is a damn fine restaurant.",1
4,"For a world class city, London has some pretty dreadful dim sum venues. Fortunately Yauatcha is one of the good ones. Yes, you end up paying a lot more for the food than you would at some of the other places in London (and certainly more than you would at most places in Hong Kong, San Francisco, Vancouver). Yes, you pay for some of the attitude and decor. Yes, the chairs are pretty uncomfortable.
In the end, it's all about the food and you have to admit that some of the dishes are pretty darn good. The har gau are excellent with clear skins and the right amount of bite. The venison puff (cha siu so) are excellent versions with a nice hint of black pepper and a fantastic flaky crust. I especially like the shrimp and beancurd cheung fun; it's their version of  zha leung but instead of a chinese donut inside, they use a shrimp and beancurd skin roll. Fantastic. Save room for the black sesame dumplings. Some of the best I've ever had anywhere with a truly handmade taste and texture.
I agree that some of their dishes (especially the non-dim sum mains) are overpriced. If you can avoid those, you can have an excellent dim sum deal for not much more than you would spend in London Chinatown.
My biggest pet peeve is that they only make one pot with each order of tea leaves. Some of the teas, especially the oolongs, actually taste better with the second brewing!",1
4,"Great food in a trendy and classy setting. The lamb chops were amazing, but then so was everything else. Imagine the juiciest chicken tikka, the most delicate naan and the crispiest samosas you've ever eaten. Then go to Dishoom and eat what you have just imagined. Get there early mind you, as it's a popular place and they don't reserve tables for less than 6 people for dinner.",1
3,"I'm gonna give this place a 3 unfortunately as they kept messing up our bun order (it arrived 3 times!). Also, I asked for some spicy sauce and they chargd me £1 for it. If it wasn't free (which it should be in a ramen place) then at least give a heads-up to the customer so they can decide.",-1
1,"Don't eat here!  Food is very mediocre, service is awkward, and it's incredibly expensive.  High price to pay for food poisoning.",-1
3,"Winter ramen.  Soup is good, prices anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds. Not so busy, so service alright.  No cockroaches on my food.  I'm not crazy about ramen but enjoy them from time to time.",-1
5,"When this place first opened-up, I wasn't sure exactly what it was! All you see outside are blue, blue walls. So one day, we decided to venture inside!
The amount of dim sum on offer is stupid! There is such a gorgeous, varied selection, it's unreal and each little piece tastes like heaven.
The amount of speciality / herbal teas they have here is also really great. We aren't made of money so couldn't afford the ones we *really* wanted but the Champagne Green Tea is one I definitely want to go back for and try out!
What a great dim sum place, I really couldn't ask for more at a restaurant like this. It's awesome!",1
5,"We would eat here every day if we could.  The food is so fresh, flavorful, so delicious it's okay if you're on fire everywhere!
We ate here for breakfast and dinner and there was a line and a wait both times (thankfully our luggage meant something and they found a way to seat us for breakfast before our flight)!
We ate all we could at dinner, the fried okra, the red curry chicken, the cheese naan, calamari, the very necessary yogurt sauce.  The fries.  It was all just the best Indian food ever!
I had my first authentic full English breakfast here and it was enormous and perfect as my last meal in London!  I also saw the only orange eggs here I've ever seen in my life and I bake frequently and have friends that raise chickens for eggs. 
The bottomless chai is also wonderful and really if you've never been to London or had Indian food, please do and eat here!  You'll see why it's the first place everyone else goes too!",1
3,They say it's the most romantic restaurant in London. I wouldn't agree. It's a nice French restaurant but there are many better options in the area.,-1

 She's a real sushi lover so we wanted to try what is supposed to be the best and yes, it was very good. Everything tasted very freeh and the flavours were very crisp, but 200 quid for two of us, it ain't worth that!
 I will go back but not as often as I would have done if it didn't suffer from quite as much of the London hype as it does.",-1
5,"We came here with some friends recently to sample the set menu - a very reasonable £20 for a delicious three course meal. You do take a hit on the wine, so it's worth coming here prepared to spend quite a bit of money but well worth it once you do.
 This place has a lovely cosy and relaxed atmosphere to it - especially if, like us, you are lucky to be seated at one of the booths. The food is scrum and the service was attentive without being overbearing. We were supposed to vacate our table by a specified time but the staff were v. relaxed and allowed us to leave in our own (reasonable) time.",1
4,"Going to Yauatcha was an exciting prospect after hearing so much about the restaurant. The experience did not disappoint. Dining at Yauatcha is an adventure. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant downstairs. There are enclaves in the walls with electric candles so the room is dark but candlelit. There is a long acquarium strip with fish brightly lit on the customer facing side of the bar. My date for the evening suggested that the noise from the music might be a problem for some diners, but it wasnt for us. In fact I enjoyed the level of noise as it gave us some privacy and also added to the ambience of the room. You can see the kitchen through frosted glass so you get a sense of how fast things are moving in the kitchen, which makes sense because the service is excellent 5/5. We ordered mushroom dim sum and prawn shui mai with chicken to begin with and these were served seamlessly right after one another. Next we were served crispy aromatic duck with pancakes and hoisin sauce. Again the service was elegant and prompt. After this we ordered egg fried rice and kung pao chicken which was excellent. The chicken was delicious and I could have eaten much more! The chilies were quite hot but not too hot to eat, apart from one. For dessert I resisted my primary urge to order the maccarons and instead ordered the chocolate pebble which was enjoyable. I could see that a lot of thought had gone into the dessert's construction and different textures as you might expect from this Michelin starred restaurant. However for me the dessert was not outstanding nor delicious. I am certainly a fan of Yauatcha and can't wait to visit again! I can see why it has earned its Michelin star as I found eating there an adventure and a delight.",1
3,"I'll keep this short, it's was a cold day in town & I needed to be warmed up....Ramen in broth perfect remedy! 
I was on my own & was seated promptly, tonkotsu ramen with extra egg was ordered. Broth excellent, eggs very good, ramen so so, pork, veg etc could've done with more, I enjoyed it but was left feeling I needed more & felt slightly short changed after spending £13.50 on a tiny bowl of Ramen....so off I went to Chinatown for a Chinese bun for dessert.
3.5 stars",-1
3,"This place has a lot of positives, but many negatives as well. 
I'll start with the negatives:
1. It's very expensive for the amount of food you're given. We were barely full after the meal.
2. The mango lassi doesn't taste very authentic. I can pinpoint what was off about it, but it didn't taste like a traditional mango lassi, like many other restaurants have.
3. It took a very long time to get our bill at the end of the meal (about 20 minutes). Our waiter forgot about us, so I had to eventually request it.
4. They should distinguish better between what water costs money and what doesn't. To clarify, request tap water if you don't want to be charged for a bottle of water or more.
However, I did enjoy some aspects about it:
1. It was beautiful! It used to be a library, which made for a very interesting & unique aesthetic during our meal. 
2. The service, other than my negatives above, was great. They sat us quickly and we had some good conversation with our waiter.
I probably wouldn't recommend this place unless it's a very special occasion.",-1
3,"This one Michelin starred restaurant assured me that one star can be bought. Food is ok but definitely not Michelin star calibre. Ambiance is cool and chic. Service is horrible. I had been here twice, once for lunch and another for dinner.
For lunch, I ordered some tea and they ran out of the tea leaves then decided to serve hot water without any explanation AND charge me the price of tea. When I complained, the manager came over and told me I will get a small dish for free.  Never a proper explanation nor APOLOGY. 
For dinner, six of my friends and I booked for dinner on Saturday, ordered over £1,000 worth of food and drinks, and this manager lady approached me and told we must leave before our two hour time allowance ends.  Never informed of such a ridiculous policy when I made the booking and this is unheard of in Michelin star restaurant to chase out diners. 
Venison puff is what's recommended, it was ok bit salty for my taste.
Har gau was good
Any spicy Sichuan dish is not recommended as this isn't the right place to have it. Just go for dim sums, if you must visit this restaurant.
Quite obviously, I will never go back to this place.",-1
3,"Pretty standard chinese food. Was a little confusing being told where to go and where to get seated at first. I ordered a rice plate with barbecue meats (pork belly, pork), which should have been the fastest dish at my table, since the bbq meats are cold and just placed on top of the rice, but for some reason my plate was the last to reach the table by far. A good amount of meat and a good amount of sauce over rice for a standard dinner. Prices are pretty decent too, I think around 6 pounds for my plate. Cash only.",-1
3,"This place is a good place to stop into after a show.  There isn't anything especially good but it seems like mostly a traditional Japanese sort of place and I appreciate there consideration of the environment in terms of over-fishing of tuna.
The service is slow at times which is unusual since the place is so small.",-1
4,One of the most intense dim sum experiences I have ever lived.  The setting here is truly amazing and a special place to eat a dim sum like you have never experienced.,1
3,"As a ramen junkie from NYC, I've been traveling around London's ramen scene to try and find the best bowl here. Shoryu piqued my interest due to the fact that they tout their Hakata roots, which is the region of Japan that tonkotsu ramen is specialized. So I had to come by and try the tonkotsu broth!
I stopped in around noon and was seated immediately. I ordered the Kotteri Tonkotsu Ramen, a chashu pork bun, and a grilled halloumi and shimeji mushroom bun.
The ramen came out first, which was a bit strange, but I started eating. The broth was not as rich as I like my tonkotsu ramen to be. It has what I've complained about most NYC ramen - I call it the ""Ippudo Problem,"" where the tonkotsu broth is the specialty but is not super rich. Tonkotsu broth should be thick, bony, and hearty, but the broth here (which was said to be extra rich) is pretty thin. Also, it was a bit under seasoned, a bit bland. I don't like my broths salty but I do like some flavor in the soup.
The noodles here are missing that signature bite that ramen noodles have (even when I ordered it hard), almost just like regular egg noodles.
You can thank Momofuku and David Chang for the steamed buns with ramen trend around the world, and the buns here have the same problem that the ones at Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC does - they are overly sauced with a very strong sauce that masks the flavor of the main ingredient and you basically are eating a bao with sauce and some meat/protein rather than getting a nice complex bite of flavors and textures. It's a shame, because I only really tasted the cucumber because it was not as salty as the rest of it. I actually had to wash it down with the broth (really shows you how bland it was).
I ordered kaedama and it came out quickly, but they didn't put any tare or sauce on the noodles, so when I put it into the bowl, it watered it down a bit and made it blander.
Overall, this was a pretty average bowl of ramen. There are many better bowls of ramen in London.",-1
1,"Went there one night on our vacation last week. The restaurant was around the corner from our hotel. I have been to numerous nobu restaurants and i can't believe that this is a nobu. are all the other reviewers blind to the decor. half the experience of a restaurant is the experience and ambiance. this truly looks like a cafeteria. there is literally nothing on the walls, the tables and chairs are pine and there is zero ambiance...zero. the food was fine, but for the price...no way! i can't believe chef is putting his name on this restaurant. don't go.",-1
2,"Ping Pong's dim sum just isn't very good quality or tasty. It's also too expensive. However, it's a nice looking restaurant in a convenient location on the South Bank so you're probably going to end up in here eventually. There's not much more to say really. If you want dim sum in Central London, I'd suggest New World in Chinatown.",-1
3,"Very simple and understated décor. Not great for a date... Just simple work lunch with a mate is fine, not for a business lunch. Seats are high chairs which I am not a fan of, same goes for high benched tables. There is no privacy and intimacy to be expected. Food is great thou. Ramen is excellent and if you feel like a casual quick lunch with your mate, then pop in. :-))",-1
1,"I completely agree with Eve L's assessment.  We tried out the restaurant on a friend's recommendation, and were majorly disappointed.  The place was packed with Asian clients, so it looked promising, but I guess none of them were Japanese, because this was not a RAMEN experience, it was entirely something else.  The ingredients on top were cold, as Eve mentions (pity I didn't read her review before going) and the broth was warm at best.  Although my Tantanmen 2 dish promised sesame, chile, chicken mince and bok choy in a chicken bone broth, what it had was massive amounts of PEANUTS!  It was so rich it tasted like peanut butter.  Since when has ramen tasted like that?  Perhaps I ordered poorly, but my wife also agreed.  Our children had the Soy Ramen and that broth tasted as though they'd simply throne in a few Knorr chicken stock cubes and some soy sauce.
Sorry, but this isn't a Japanese restaurant, IMHO.
Oh, I almost forgot to mention the highlights...the Clarence Court egg was impressive (and delicious), as others have mentioned, and the beer was VERY cold!",-1
2,"Really no need. Dumplings have been made with more taste and variety in any Chinese Restaurant. This place is very Europeanized and modernized. For posh people and young couples. Good coctails but dark , noisy, expensive restaurant.",-1
2,"Expensive, swankified dim sum is nearly always a disappointment. Ping Pong is no exception.
Imagine a huge restaurant filled with bustling carts piled high with steamers chock full of plump dumplings, plates of just sauteed vegetables, dishes teeming with crispy fried squid, pushed by no-nonsense ladies who don't speak English and cut your taro root with scissors in front of you at your crowded, noisy table of 8 people about to burst with tiny dishes. Makes me hungry just thinking about it. 
Pong pong is nothing like that. Portions are small, the decor is trying hard for a lounge feel, and they serve pricey martinis. But even if you really want a chichi martini with your pork dumplings, at least those pork dumplings and those martinis should be good. And you should get more than 3 in an order for a dish costing over £3.
I realize I have high expectations for Chinese food, particularly dim sum. But this place is a perfect example of promoting atmosphere over taste and charging way too much for something that is designed to be cheap and delicious. If you're not going for the food, maybe you'll love it!",-1
4,"Theres so much hype associated with Bone Daddies and it's (mostly) well deserved hype! A very interesting menu of fusion Japanese food, that spans across way more variety than its #1 rival (Kanada-Ya). However, you should go here to try the ramen. It's 
bomb.com
, and on most days, gives other ramen joints a real run for its money.",1
1,"Went to check out what the hype was about! It was a Monday evening n we reached the place at 7 pm.. there was a long queue and these guys don't take reservations. We were told the wait time is an hour and 20 mins! Stood in the queue n were finally ushered in. We got a table in the noisy basement. It was already too crowded n too loud. For the next 10 mins, 3 servers came around n asked if we want water, but no one served it until we placed the order n requested again for water. The service could be much better for the price.
Please start taking reservations when you know it gets busy.",-1
4,"Ever since hubs saw the menu and found out there was eel with black bean sauce on the menu he was sold. This was the first sit down restaurant that we headed to in London. 
We went here for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening and were seated on the basement (may be called the ground floor) and service was prompt and efficient. We ordered the eel, hot pot with tofu and Singapore style thick rice noodles. Hubs loved the eel since this is not something we have in the USA or at least in Michigan and ate all but two pieces. The tofu hot pot had fish tofu as well as the regular braised tofu. As is typical with everywhere but the US, the hot pot was smaller than what I was expecting but tasted on par with the average hot pot. Lastly, the Singapore thick noodles were pretty tasty, but I found the curry flavor be not as strong as it's done in the states. The flavor was still good and contained mini shrimps, BBQ pork, onions, and sprouts. 
Given the price of around 25£, it's a great place to grab a reasonably priced, some may even say cheap eat when you are looking for a Chinese fix in London.",1
4,"This is a great place for a old catch up with family or friends. The vibrant atmosphere sets the tone that this is a place where one can let your hair down whilst enjoying some great food and drinks.
The lichee cocktail was great and the waitress was especially attentive when suggesting items from the menu. Our group was divided into two non - veggie meat lovers and 5 veggies. So, it's interesting to see how our relevant dishes went down. The non -veggie seafood dishes are Amazing ! Our favorite was the dim sum shrimp with beancurd and the prawn toast balls ( which we re-ordered) . Other dishes we tried included chicken noodles , jasmine tea ribs , scallop din sum and a few others , all great. Our vegetarian companions largely enjoyed their dishes too, apart from two that not one of our party , including the non- veggies very much disliked. Truffle is normally something that all of us enjoy , but not this time - the truffle flavored dim sum was awful and the taste just felt wrong ( for all 7 of us ). Likewise we had the same issue with the truffle spring rolls. We could not place it but something was not right as these dishes did not impress and left an awful taste and the gooey texture did not help. The manager was very accommodating and did not hesitate to remove the dishes from the bill , a gesture of goodwill which was much appreciated. Aside from the strange tasting truffle dishes we all love this place and my suggestion would be to try each and every one of the seafood dishes , appetizers and mains as these were fantastic ! If it wasn't for the truffle experience, this place would have got a 5 for sure .",1
2,Average. 2 hour wait for small sliced up steak! I'm a South African and I know my meat....I wont be going back for it. Way too expensive.,-1
4,"My first time at a Ping Pong. We had to wait a bit to get a seat so we sat at the bar and waited for a long while to get served- you may need to accost a waiter to get a drink, they seem a little ""toff"" biased.
However, we chose 3 dishes between the two of us, from a VEGAN menu- yes folks, I was really impressed that they had a seperate menu, awesome huh? That's pretty much why I rated high, because I found the food to be really tasty, especially the vegetable-y rice packaged in leaves, and the mushroom parcels. Although, the 3 dishes between us and 3 drinks came to nearly £30, I went home and devoured a sandwich. For a solo meal, perhaps 2 dishes would be ideal as you get 3 bits of each so you can share.
Anyway, great food, slightly squished seating, the toilets were clean and smelled LOVELY (a bit like bubblegum), and the service was fairly slow getting the order and paying but not sniffy, just busy although the food arrived nice and quickly!
The flower teas are beautiful, and if you live in East london near Shoreditch, They even deliver- lucky!",1
5,This was the best Indian food I have ever had. Too bad I had to go all the way to London for it:). Go early or late to avoid the long wait. It's worth it if you have to wait though:).,1
5,"Loved the food. Great for lunch not recommended to dinner. Had two dishes that server suggested and both delicious. Next time, will try to seafood options. Not sure if this is something Robert would like.",1
5,Never disappoints - love this place. Venison Puffs are a MUST!,1
4,"Great selections, lovely space, good service. I would go back again on a day when I had time to wander along Southbank,",1
4,"Yoatcha is a plush place to have a meal. Booking a table is advisable as both floors are packed, though if you go for lunch, it will still be busy but you will get a table.  My first visit a few years back, I booked a table and still ended up sitting on a large round table with a few other couples, which was fine, but I did want my own table, especially as I booked.
The décor is modern with massive fish tanks and black marble floors. The service is typically first class by the Japanese and the food is exquisite, on my last visit I had venison puffs, which were great, Ostridge dumplings, great! I didn't like the whole fish I ordered, which was haddock, at £30! The spicey squid and rice sticks were delish. They have a great dim sum too. Everything is expensive but you will definitely attentively waited and the food will be great. 
One downside is that on my last visit, me and two friends booked a table, but we still had to wait 20 minutes or so, they gave us the menus so we could get ahead of the game, and I didn't really like that, they really are so busy. 
On leaving the restaurant, you can buy some goodies or teas and herbs to take home, the shop is right next to the exit as if it were a museum, but they do have some nice deserts to take home.",1
5,Exceptional place! The food is amazing and it would be a shame if I didn't mention the guys' effort. The management have obviously done an excellent job  everyone in there knows they're doing and do it with passion and a smile.,1
5,"Absolutely obsessed with this place. I have been to the location in India and this was ten times better! I will say the menu is very similar to Hakkasan. Definitely order the spring rolls, edemame dumplings, prawn toast and the halibut. Those were the highlights of our meal!!",1
4,"Oh Yauatcha, you had me at spicy szechuan wontons....
My friend sent me a list of restaurant recommendations for a quick trip to London and this was at the top of the list. I was skeptical that any dim sum restaurant could be michelin-rated. Dim sum is dim sum. Boy was I wrong...
We arrived early for our reservation. After standing around for a few minutes, they took us to a table downstairs. The place was packed. I started with a peach tea smoothie. Yummy, but nothing I haven't had before. Then the food started arriving.
First up, spicy szechuan wontons. One bite into the thing and I was convinced. Dim sum is not just dim sum. After we ate the wontons, my husband proceeded to lick up the spicy sauce. 
Next was the pan-fried turnip cake. I didn't even order this - I ordered the pan-fried taro cake but my American accent must have tripped them up. Oh well, I ate it anyway. And boy was I glad I did. This thing was awesome! It was pan-fried with eggs and chives (or scallions?). Mmmm...best mistake ever. 
While everything was good, those were the two dishes that really stuck out at me. Other things we had - crispy duck roll (kind of disappointing), prawn cheung fun (good but not that different from other dim sum places), sticky rice in lotus leaf (good but, like the cheung fun, it was similar to what you'd get at other dim sum places), poached peking dumpling (spicy but delicious), spring onion puff (good, not great). I can't remember what else. 
Then came the egg white and salted fish fried rice. This was a bowl of deliciousness. I still crave this. After all of this, we were stuffed. But we ordered some more szechuan wontons anyway. My husband complained about being too full but drank all the sauce again anyway. 
I'm kind of bummed we didn't try more stuff from the menu. I love dim sum and Yauatcha was a nice surprise.",1
1,"If the food was as good as the staff is inattentive and pretentious, then the food would be extraordinary. 
Alas, the food tastes very, very average. 
Combined with high prices, it is not a place I would recommend. I will NOT go back.",-1
2,"I love dim sum but this is mass-produced and not well done. Service was average. We had several different waiters yet it was difficult to catch anyone in particular to order more food, drinks or the bill. We ordered a second round of dim sum which became confusing on the order sheet but rather than clarify with us, the waitress just put in an order for 6 extra dim sum of which 2 items were forgotten and 2 were wrong. She put through higher priced items that we didn't order which was irritating and we received no apology or offer to re-make correctly. I hate service charge being added to the bill and in a place like this it seems to discourage any effort from the staff. The area has many better options nearby which I recommend you try instead. A very small plus - the flavoured ice-teas were good, so the 2 stars are for the tea.",-1
4,"The week wasn't progressing well in terms of food. One overpriced and bland experience after another. Yauatcha was a relief and a reminder that good food is out there in London. We had two dim sums as starters. Completely forget the names, but they were amazing. Had the home made spinach tofu with mushrooms as a main course. Very original and tasty.
Food took long to serve but that was us being unlucky because everybody around us got plated up in no time. Yeah, it was that kind of week. But at least we were waiting for good food and the waitress was nice enough about it.",1
5,"WOOHO! This is now my favourite place to get dim sum! 
they are extremely delicious and they have a nice combination of dim sum on the menu going on. Also if you are crazy for sea food and veggies you can't go wrong there! 
I did not have the chance to try they drinks or dessert but I'll be coming back from it! they looks so tempting !",1
3,"My wife and I walked into roti chai with a lot of high expectations because last year we were here, it was fantastic.
We were seated straightaway but it took sometime for a waiter to come and talk to us.
We ordered two masala chais. two pani puris and a fentiman's rose lemonade.
The pani puris were very good and felt very well on the palate. The pani had the correct amount of tang, sweetness and hotness to it.
The masala chai, however was a disappointment. it felt more like someone had boiled some hot water in a hurry with a tea bag and a drop of milk in it. I mean, an establishment called roti chai serves a deplorable chai and that's a bit ironic.
Nevertheless, 3 stars for a good pani puri, quick seating and decent customer service.",-1
4,Food was great and the service was good. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for an Indian dinner.,1
4,Really good Indian fusion. It's an Iranian twist to Bombay styled Indian food. The chicken biryani was really good. We also had shredded lamb fish but would go for lamb chops next time. Very busy so make reservations ahead of time.,1
5,"The one at Clos Maggiore was an amazing experience. This elegant French restaurant, rated in the Michelin Guide, is perfect for a romantic dinner. The food was excellent: we had the fortune to be served by an italian waiter who recommended and explained us some dishes otherwise a little ""misterious"" and even if we spended a bit every dish was worth the price. Absolutely recommended.",1
4,"Bone Daddies is definitely a great ramen place to check out in London. Went with two other friends and we ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Kimchee Ramen, & Dipping Ramen to share among us three.
1. Tonkotsu Ramen was on the saltier side. Definitely good, but nothing particularly outstanding in terms of how tonkotsu ramen broth. The noodles were a very good level of not too hard and not too soft. I definitely enjoyed the noodles, and was a bit let down with the broth. It was simply just salty and nothing particularly flavorful. Nevertheless, it was wonderful with a cup of water on the side.
2. Kimchee Ramen was super spicy. You need a strong ability to handle spiciness to take on this broth. It came with a lot of seafood which was wonderful and very fresh. As someone who personally cannot handle anything too spicy, this was definitely something not in my zone of comfort. However, my friends who love anything super spicy were really happy with the flavor of the broth.
3. Dipping Ramen was a very unique experience where all the ramen ingredients came on a platter next to a cup of sauce. The sauce appeared clear but was extremely flavorful. I personally really enjoyed this dish because it was not only a unique ramen experience, but also something well-flavored and worth the price!
ADVICE: Arrive at an early dinnertime! There will be a line! The line will most likely be outdoors so bring a nice coat to wear. There will be hooks on the wall inside of the restaurant, so you can hang up your coat when you're seated.",1
3,"Having lived in New York, I've been spoiled for unlimited delicious ramen options and my personal opinion is that Bone Daddies is overhyped.
My friend and I came on a weekday night and there was a long line outside the shop. They took in pairs faster than groups, so my friend and I were seated after ten minutes. The inside of the shop is dim and crowded. There are only stool seats and seating is pretty tight. 
My friend and I got the Agedashi Tofu to start. This was pretty good! The portion was big and the tofu is silky with a light and crispy battered shell. The sauce was flavorful too. 
For ramen, I got the Tonkotsu and my friend got the Mushroom Ramen. What I liked most from the Tonkotsu ramen were the egg and the black garlic oil. However, everything else was a bit overwhelming. The pork broth was advertised to be simmered for 20 hours but it wasn't all that flavorful and definitely too oily. The ramen noodles were very thin and way overcooked so it was quite mushy to eat. I also got to try some broth from my friend's mushroom ramen and it was pretty good. 
Overall, Bone Daddies was a little disappointing and I'll be continuing my search for the best ramen in London.",-1
4,"Waking up from an evening of seeing London's bars and clubs with some friends, two of us looked at each other and said Japanese food.  I had bookmarked this place from the last time I was in London and didn't make it here.  Weekend lunch crowd equaled a short wait for the 4 of us, but we took the time to look over the menu and enjoy the ambiance.  
One of us was skeptical because he is a true Ramen Nerd, in the end he felt content, not overjoyed, but satisfied. I had the T22 with extra noodles and that was pretty good, enough soup and ingredients to cover the extra noodles, the broth was flavorful, not intense.  It wasn't the mind-blowing experience others would say, but I thought it was pretty good.  I might stop by again next time I am in town, but than again there are a lot of good restaurants in London and SOHO.",1
4,"Clos Maggiore has a well-deserved reputation as London's most romantic restaurant. It's convenient to the West End theatres, and open late enough to go after the show.
The food is reliable and elegantly presented, and the wine list ad Bas Armagnac are extensive and top notch.
But above all it's the romantic atmosphere of the garden-like (but completely indoor) dining room that draws us back.",1
3,"I thought it was okay, perhaps a little pricy with smaller portions. We were seated in the upper area, which had an incredibly strange layout because they had clearly moved tables around to accommodate other parties - so to the left of us was a giant gaping hole in the middle of the dining area which just looked rather strange.
We opted for some kind of prix-fixe corse that related to the Royal wedding, it said it was a traditional Bengali wedding course. It came out on a platter and each dish was about the size of 1 cup (sorry, American units) and for me, was really hit and miss between all of them. Whatever dish the giant prawn was in though, was one of the best Indian dishes I've had of all time. The bread was dense, but a bit overly greasy. The service was slightly inattentive. The locale was hard to find (it's not labeled from the outside) and if someone hadn't seen us looking so confused and asked us if were looking for the Cinnamon Club, we probably would have walked past it a few times. The interior was beautiful, but we were seated in the upper area so we could barely see/appreciate any of it. It was a neat place to come but I was a bit disappointed that we were seated upstairs because that defeated most of the reasons why we had decided to come here in the first place. I probably won't be back anytime soon.",-1
5,"Hakkasan is far from being the new kid on the block, making its bold debut back in 2001 it was full of Eastern promise. Fast forward 15 years and this kid has still got style. Hakkasan is a gorgeous space, the dark interior with well placed spot lights, delicate gold tapestry, plump noir pillows and pattern carved screens to section off the room and enhance the intimate feel.
Hakkasan is special. You should make an effort to go as its interior will certainly upstage you. Glam, classy and stylish is what you should go for as its a place to celebrate. Beautiful place, food, drink and people. With all this effort on the packaging, what does the content have in store? Well follow me on my birthday dinner journey and you will see. 
We selected a ""Tast of Hakkasan"" menu for £38 per person. It included a three course meal and cocktail. Value money if i do say so myself and as we roll on, it will become clear why. My cocktail of choice was the Lychee Martini which was absolutely delicious. No scrimping on the Vodka, you could taste the Belvedere. Sam Vanilla, my birthday host, had the Hakka, a mix of vodka, sake, lychee, lime, coconut and passion fruit. Cocktail are a thing at Hakkasan. For years I have heard how amazing they are and they were not a disappointment. 
As we started our michelin star dining experience, it was a dims sum platter and crispy squid with avocado mustard dressing and caramilised walnut to start. The dim sum selection was a medley of colours and gorgeous ingredients. I tasted king prawn, shitake mushrooms and much more. A delicate devil of a starter! Sam Vanilla loved her subtly coated squid with the right balance between crispy and tender.
We settled on a meat feast for our mains with black truffle roasted duck and tea plant mushroom. Wow, truffle is my favourite so the aroma was very tempting. Unfortunately this was not my main choice, so i had to do with a cheeky little fork full of meat and pat the truffle filled air into my direction. I tried something a little different with the wok-fried lamb in a spicy mint sauce. I hit the jack pot too as the lamb was amazing. To describe the food is near impossible as it really is a food journey of loveliness. The sides comprised of baby crunchy asparagus and sticky rice. Again, no taking the eye off the ball, even for the accompaniments. I was truly delighted with this place as a birthday treat! A big thank you to Sam Vanilla, but also a big thank you to Hakkasan for standing the test of time.
Now it was time for the dessert. Not being one to have a sweet tooth, it was a stab in the dark for me. I was delighted when my milk chocolate, hazelnut praline and rice krispies Jivara bomb arrived. There it was, the wee birthday candle and a message on my plate. Lovely. The bomb was heavenly. Sam Vanilla had the lemon and sesame tart with candied lemon and meringue. A picture of perfection and zest filled dream.",1
3,"It's Chinese fast food. It was busy mid afternoon and we shared a table Chinese-style with another couple. The food was forgettable, but fast and cheap. Three stars for it being a step above the overpriced tourist traps that comprise the rest of London's Chinatown.",-1
4,"Though not really 100% authentic dim sum, I really did appreciate their efforts to blend east and west cuisine. The food is pretty good, but also very innovative with some creative twists on the classic cantonese style of dim sum. 
If you're looking for somewhere that's different, or perhaps an introduction into real authentic chinese food, this is the place to go. It has a nice ambiance and the wait staff is very friendly. 
The only slight problem I had was that I believe they charged for tea? That's quite unheard of for a dim sum restaurant. 
Otherwise, it's a good place to unwind and eat some dimsum.",1
2,"Cannot say how disappointed we were last night. Our halibut came out cold, yet tasted like someone tried to finish it at the last minute with a butane torch. All other items were bland or over-sauced. While the room and scene were all superior, we cannot suggest anyone go here for the food. Just really poor.",-1
5,"We definitely went overboard in all the dishes we ordered, but it was gluttony at its finest. As we didn't know what to order, and everything looked delicious, we simply went crazy, but everything we ordered was delicious. This is why these are opened all over London, they're simply that good and really unique. 
I think the prices are pretty reasonable, especially if you don't go totally nuts with what you order. Wines and beers are around £5 and a lot of the dishes are just a few quid. 
The spicy lamb chops were excellent. Definitely a good portion for just £11.90. The House Black Daal was excellent, as were the lamb samosas. Paneer Tikka was tasty too. Really everything was very tasty. Order a bunch of things that look tasty and you won't be disappointed. 
We also really liked how the service was quick and food just comes at you in an avalanche. When we came in there was no wait, but I imagine even if there was a wait it would move quickly.
Dishoom come to America!",1
5,"Hakkasan is the parent of Yauatcha, another favourite restaurant of mine.
This is an exclusive and tranquil restaurant, which means eating here can be expensive and that also means I dine here only on the occasion.
It has a trendy ambience to it. It is located on a quiet road, and on entering you walk down some stairs into a basement, its dark and romantic, with the decor mixed with modern and oriental influence.
 
Menu is Chinese cuisine but more gourmets with some interesting flavours fused together which comes up with interesting tastes. 
I love my deserts, but dont tend to go for them in the Oriental restaurants, but on my recent trip here, I had a a pineapple cannelloni, which I never heard of, it was brilliant, but on the small side, I just wish there was more of it.
This is somewhere I would recommend you take your partner for a romantic meal, it's got a lovely, romantic setting and it's a great way if you want to impress somebody. However it comes with a price tag, drinks are relatively highly priced, and so is the food, expect to spend roughly £150 for starters mains and drinks for two, i have never spent less than that in here!! 
However, its definitely worth it for a nice treat. The whole experience is tops!
The service is of high quality as expected and the music is really funky, lounge with latest DJ's mixing their music. There is a small bar where you can have a few drinks before you dine, they have thought of everything at Hakkasan. I love it, and wish it was a little cheaper!",1
3,"We took a colleague from India here and he felt that it had some of the most authentic Mumbai food he had seen in London so far.
To be honest, I thought it was ok rather than great. We were in a booth downstairs which was actually very nice, but the service was a little slow / unhelpful. 
The food when it came was fine, but to be honest I have no strong desire to go back.",-1
2,"I have been to Japan and while I know good ramen, I am not super picky. 
When you first walk in, you will notice it is super dark. You can't read the menu if you are seated in the corner. From a distance, I thought the place was closed.
I ordered the IP Tonkatsu ramen. It came looking nice but I notice black spots on the ramen , as soon as I stirred, it turned the whole broth deep brown. This was not the color of ramen that I wanted nor is expected. It should be a creamy oily white broth.
After a few bites, I couldn't eat anymore. It tasted overwhelmingly like soy sauce. There are soy flavor ramens but this was just too strong of soy sauce. 
I thought ok, let me order another ramen and maybe it was just a one off. I showed a picture of what I wanted and they said it was spicy miso.
The spicy miso appeared nothing like the photo I pointed to the waitress. All the ingredients were the same yes but again the color of the broth was wrong. It was a pale red dull color. The taste was better than the tonkatsu but still not what I wanted.
I basically ordered two ramens, ate half of one and paid £30. Oh guess what, they also tack on service charge 12% and force you to donate £1 to charity in your bill.
The worst experience I've had in London so far. 
The two stars is for the fact that the ingredients themselves were very good. The noodles were not typical ramen firmness or cut but were still very delectable. The corn is from a grilled cob and sliced off in small stacks. The egg is soft boiled but might have had too much soy flavor or that was due to my broth I'm not sure.
The service in general was nice but they should have known better or tried to accommodate me in some way when they knew I didn't like any ramen even after ordering two. I'm not asking for free food but it would have been nice if they at least asked if I enjoyed the food after I said I didn't enjoy the first ramen. I think that means they don't genuinely care and just want your money.
Watch out.",-1
4,"I love their barbecue meats (roast duck, bbq pork, roast pork, etc). I have gone with family and friends, and it's always been a hit. You can get a selection of three barbeue items for under a tenner, and it's a good way to try a little bit of everything. Service could be better, but the food is definitely worth coming for.",1
3,"We enjoyed our meal here at 6 pm on a Monday night.  My husband ordered from the pre-theatre/lunch menu and i went for the regular dinner prix fixe. The menu had some interesting and unusual items that would not be found at a chain restaurant.  Our starters were lamb kidneys in mustard sauce and mussels prepared like snails.   I didn't really like the latter more than the usual types of mussel dishes but enjoyed the novel approach.  My husband was happy with his bouillabaisse.  My lamb shanks were very tender.  The tarte tartin was less tasty than others I have had, with a rather soggy bottom crust.  Overall it was a good experience with attentive service and reasonable prices.  I would give it a 3.5 ratting if I could. Maybe it even deserves 4 stars, not sure.",-1
5,"I typed up a massive review saying how great this place is then my computer crashed and i've lost it all. So to summarise, this place is INCREDIBLE! Everything about it is fantastic and it thoroughly deserves that Michelin star!",1
4,"This is my type of restaurant, if i don't go to eat great food. It is so forgettable, but the place is a masterpiece visually. The Dim Sum starter was extremely hot and the Ginger Rice was a disaster. This is one of my favorite restaurants in London. Cosmopolitan, chic, cool,sophisticated,  a hot spot. The music is loud , something i like in this kind of places. It was jazz and house, nothing out of this world, but good.   A memorable experience",1
2,"I am fortunate enough to live in NYC where there is nothing you cannot find, food wise. I have been to many a great restaurant and many a bad one. I recently came to London on holiday and expected a similar experience n diversity. With that said, I wanted to go to dinner to a place that I ""knew"" would be good. I chose Nobu based on the reputation that their NY locations had, which is very good. 
I am sorry to say, I was severely disappointed, mostly by the service. I the food was very good, which is why I gave 2 stars and not one. The thing is that it is not hard to give good service OR good food but it is hard to give both. I expected both from Nobu. The guy barely spoke above a whisper. He didn't know his menu well. and had a very laxidasical about our satisfaction. In fact, he did not ask once how everything was. 
I have been to various levels of restaurants.  The thing that is always done is to check to make sure that everything came out as ordered and was satisfactory. This is at the crappy Applebee's all the way to the top restaurant that you can think of. For such a poor level of service to come from Nobu, especially at the $130 per person price point, is embarrassing for them.",-1
2,"Very popular place and we loved the fast service, really fast!! However, the food lacked authenticity and we have had much better Indian food elsewhere. Next time in London we'll try someplace else.",-1
4,"Arriving in London and being sick really made me crave some hot broth. Also because I was traveling throughout Europe I was really craving Ramen. I looked up some Ramen restaurants and saw that Bone Daddies were spread throughout Central London and I was close to one. 
As I entered the restaurant it was packed with people and I thought this was a good sign of the food prepared inside. I went in solo and because of this I think I was sometimes forgotten as other tables were getting their food before mine. In the end... the result was that they actually forgot to put my order in the kitchen, however I was compensated with extra chashu meat in my ramen. 
The ramen broth did the trick and was very warming while I slurped the broth and dipped my noodles in it. The charting on the meat was also perfect as it gave an unique taste to the meat. The eggs were also boiled to a perfect runny Golden State which is usually a pivotal point of the ramen for me. Another good item that looked amazing is the Korean style ribs. Although I didn't order any the people next to me got them and they smelled and looked absolutely amazing.",1
3,"Don't  be fooled by the size of the downstairs room- the restaurant runs across several floors and has a lot of space. I came here as part of a party of 10, and we fit in very easily. The restaurant itself is nothing special to look at, but candle lit and simply done out. We each had a three course meal with drinks (wine), which came to only £26 a head, which is very reasonable. The food was served promptly and no-one had any complaints. My steak was cooked rare to order and was really good. The starter was OK - a bit basic, but others' looked really good.
Service was friendly and on the whole food and drinks were very good for the price.",-1
2,"I'm really disappointed at the quality of this restaurant. I ordered a Karaage and Shoryu Ramen .Karaage was good but the Ramen did not have much of a taste.  the noodle was not japanese one it maybe Chainese noodle ??.......it was too soft noodle.
I will try ohter Ramen shop .........",-1
2,Generous portion with below average's quality of food. Prices are very reasonable but don't expect to have good quality of food.,-1
3,"The decor was very nice but the food was ok for how much they charge.  I have a nut allergy so our waiter was only able to suggest three items for me to eat. I had the tomatoe soup- lovely, the prawns- very bland and the Bharta. The Bharta was good as well but not authentic. Being Indian, I thought the food was very mild. The other three in the party had the tasting menu- which was decent.  All in all,  I know there are far superior places to eat Indian food in London so definitely not worth the 300gbps!",-1
5,"The wait for this place was quite long and I could see why. Not sure I would wait another 90 minutes for this place, but as a first-timer it was worth it. During the wait, a server was kind enough to be passing out mini chai teas or a type of shot to the people waiting in line. Also, the people waiting to be seated are allowed to go to the bar area first and order a drink, which definitely helps pass the time. I ordered a rose drink, which was a fragrant rosy yogurt drink and a perfect alternative for those who aren't feeling in the mood for alcohol.
The décor was impressively well coordinated -- I'd describe it as a rustic shabby chic, with its quirky lettering on the walls (""no flirting with the cashier, no heavy petting"" -- haha!). 
The food was pretty tasty too. I recommend the chicken tikka, which is one of their family handed down recipes. The chicken's texture was succulent, and so soft that when I dipped it in the sauce they would split in half. The garlic naan was also very good; it came with its own yogurt based sauce but I chose to dip it instead in the trio of three sauces that are offered to every table, since they were the more flavor packed alternative. I also got a lamb biryani, which was a combination slow roasted lamb and flavored rice in a pot. It was also good, but the real winners for me were the chicken tikka and the naan.
For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake with chili ice cream -- quite an odd combination, but they somehow suited each other. As a fan of lighter, and more refreshing dishes though, I preferred the mango kulfi I ordered, which is the Indian version of ice cream on a stick.",1
3,"3.5 stars. The food wasn't bad, but I expected more. Not sure if it deserves a Michelin star. Trendy and modern, but there was a sorta strange smell, not sure if it's from the kitchen.",-1
3,"I have to confirm that their roast duck Cantonese style is delicious. It's the their speciality here. The skin tastes good, the flesh is tender and juicy. We ordered half of a duck (£11) but we could not even finish it! Fortunately they do takeaway.
 The rest of the menu is not interesting. We had some Fu-jian rice, with carrotts, asparagus, duck and scallops; it was greasy and insipid. I would rather come back for the duck only!
 The room is clean and commonplace, the service is OK.",-1
4,"Decent, authentic Chinese food for £4 - £5 per head. Could it get any better?
Yes. The service is amazing. Well, when I say amazing, I don't mean amazing in the way that you might be thinking. I mean amazing in that they're so blunt and rude that it becomes amazing in a quirky ""it's cool to be uncool"" kind of way.
For example the service goes something like this...
US: Walk in door
WAITRESS: ""Yes, wha you want?""
US: ""Table for 3 please""
WAITRESS: ""No, sit here"" (on someone else's table)
US: ""Sure, thank you?""
WAITRESS: ""Wha you eat?""
US: ""Can we see a menu""
WAITRESS: Rolls eyes and reluctantly gets us menu's
WAITRESS: ""Ready?"" (Before we've had a chance to open the menu's)
And it goes on like this. It's rude, but in a good way, it's part of the charm and the fun of it. It's no-nonsense and totally worth it for the quality of the food and low price.",1
4,Best ramen broth I've had in London (although slightly on the salty side).  That is pretty much the most important thing when it comes to Ramen.,1
1,"I had a very very poor and disappointing experience at Punjab restaurant.
I ordered mix grill, yellow lentil and mix vegetable curry.  The lamb in the mix grill was completely dark black and I wish I have taken a picture to prove it. The other meat on the grill I couldn't even Identify what that was cos it was so black and tasteless. The yellow lentil and veg curry was  like a dish from the buffet because of complete lack of excitement and freshness.  The only that's fresh was the nan bread.  This place is a tourist trap, we are all fooled by ""the oldest northern Indian food in London"" slogan! There are plenty of other good authentic Indian restaurants in London. Please don't waste your money in here. DISAPPOINTED.",-1
3,"Pretty good, authentic enough Chinese food. I had the schezwan prawns. The food was just spicy enough without being overbearing. The prawns were cooked very well.  Might come back.",-1
4,"The noodle soups here are so good... and SO cheap, actually the cheapest I've found in Chinatown.
The staff are definitely not friendly or warm, I can't comment on any of the other dishes on the menu because I've never tried them (and probably never will) I love it here because it reminds me of traveling and because I have a noodle soup addiction and am in need of serious help.
(... Oh and theres free tea)",1
3,This is the place to have a authentic Japanese ramen! The menu variety is not that big. Service is quite fast. Bathroom was dirty - I would expect a cleaner environment for these prices. Thank you for delicious ramen!,-1
2,"I'm sorry, I just wasn't feeling it. I wanted to like it. God, I wanted to have an awesome meal when I took friends out to thank them for helping me move, but it just didn't happen.
I went with a couple of friends for whom Japanese food is not a specialty and so weren't sure what to order. I gave some advice, but their tastes (ie meat!) are different to mine so they asked the waitress. Very unhelpful. There was just no sense of 'oh try this' or 'if you like that then this is for you'. It was as if she hated being there and was nervous about anyone saying anything that resembled a question and didn't know what to do when it happened.
We ordered edamame to get things started.... which was fine until one of the party found a live maggot crawling over them... ok, so you don't eat the skins, but... just..... no. not for me, thanks. After the earlier 'conversation' with the waitress, we felt at pains to point it out, and we were tired anyway so didn't want to kick up a fuss.
The rest of the food was fine. Nothing spectacular but a good cheap option in a great location, just set back from Charing Cross Road, a minute from Leicester Square station.
I'd like to go and try it again to see if I caught a new girl on a bad night, but I just don't want any more maggots on my food.",-1
4,"What can I say? Fantastic food!  Went here for Brunch with during my trip in London.  
BEST MEAL in London.  
We ordered the 
(bottomless) porridge
Omelette 
Fried Chicken Liver 
Coffee!!! 
Everything came out wonderful especially the chicken liver!  The waiter was extremely attentive and asked about our trip.  On top of my recommendation list for my friends who's ever considering visiting London! 
Will be back for sure, if i'm in London.",1
2,"I had reserved a table for two, mentioning a birthday as occasion. Seriously, we felt we received the worst table in the house, next to the cashiers desk. We refused to sit there and were seated to a very nice table right away. 
It all went downhill from there. 
The service was pestering us the whole time, pushing and pushing and pushing. We felt they wanted us out as soon as possible. This is what ruined it for me. Management should have a look at that. But why really, when all table are taken always. 
The food: I ask myself how they received a Michelin star! 
I had the Dim Sum platter and Green tea smoked chicken. What comes, is the bare chicken. Rice and vegetables need to be ordered seperately. Which feels like a joke to me. 
The food tasted good. That`s it! Seriously my lunch-chinese in Hamburg offers the same taste for 10 EUR. And I make the same morning glory at home. No special twist, no interesting aroma, no nothing.
The noise level is overwhelming. 
This was so ridiculous.
How can all these people think that this is the best food they ever had? This is a mystery to me. 
I admit, the interior is spectacular. And that was worth seeing. But that was the only thing that I didnt fall into depression when leaving. 
It was so not worth it. Sadly it was my birthday. We should have gone to Muriels Kitchen across from the Ampersand Hotel instead. And would have had a fab time.
Think twice before you come here. There are far better options in London.",-1
4,"If I were only reviewing food I'd give this place 5 out of 5. Because without a doubt the food here is good, tasty and worth the asking price.
The main detraction however is ambience. My partner and I were sat downstairs in a small white box of a room, packed with tables and customers. This I can deal with, but when the number of patrons impacts the service I start to become wary.
My meal was excellent, tasty and felt authentic. However the venue for the meal lacked any ambiance or class.
I came here because of the good reviews, and my food lived up to them. The over-all experience though was tainted by the lack of ambience and friendly service. Don't get me wrong - the service was good. I just wasn't classy enough to make me smile.
In a nutshell, if you want tasty Chinese food in Chinatown you can get it here. If you want a more pleasing environment in which to experience it go elsewhere!",1
1,"After a stellar experience 2 years ago I decided to visit today. Unfortunately the quality and experience of the food has dramatically dropped. It's now just another average Indian restaurant. The door staff was extremely rude and condescending. Overall, won't be coming back here again.",-1
3,"It's good but don't expect traditional dishes. Creates a big hole in the wallet, not somewhere I will think of straightaway when i want some dim sum.

3,"Came here with some friends on a Thursday evening. Very busy with lots of late night shoppers from Oxford Street and the surrounding area. I think I counted three other guys in there, everyone else seemed to be twenty or thirty-something groups of women (can't say that I was complaining!) 
I'm not a big fan of chains and prefer to support indie restaurants when possible, but sometimes when you're out with people you just want quick and easy 'safe' options. 
Ping Pong is a very safe choice. Everything is fine at this branch. 
Drinks are ok. Good taste, but weak measures + too much ice) 
Dim sum is ok, but a bit bland and pricy for what it is. 
Service is good, lots of staff, typical of this sort of high-end mainstream type of restaurant (think Strada, Bertorelli etc.) 
Same goes for the surroundings, clean, well designed, with moody colours and lighting, but a bit soulless. 
All in all, if you want a safe option, very close to Oxford Street tube, you could do a lot worse than Ping Pong. It's close to a 4 star rating, but expect to feel a bit rushed if they're very busy and they also don't accept American Express, which is pretty poor considering the number of restaurants in their chain + their enormous margins.",-1
5,"Ha Ha Ha, glad everyone else has had the same experience here! I went to London for the first time a couple of years ago and was taken here in the evening before a night out.
White tiled floor ceilings and walls everywhere,cash only, the staff are very surly and almost slammed my meal down in front of me, put on a table next to loads of strangers, I was really out of my comfort zone but enjoyed every minute. 
The food was great and really cheap, the real menu on the back looks really interesting, stir fried tripe anyone?
 Tried going back here for lunch the next day I liked it so much but ended up getting completely lost!",1
3,It's a good dinner but just prepare to wait in the long line around the corner. It's all you can eat so you do get some bang for your buck. I do think there are better places  to get steak. The meat wasn't particularly good and the tight tables are a bit claustrophobic.,-1
4,"I've been here twice, once for a nice lunch - and last week for dinner. The latter definitely suited the place, which is dark, seductive and framed by blue neon lights.
Yautcha does tea well (on street level), complete with great cakes, but this place comes alive at night. Each time I've been there, I've sat downstairs, where the tables are packed in, but it still doesn't seem crowded or uncomfortable.
The best food on the menu is the dim sum (the steamed mushroom dumplings are to die for, and I love the venison puffs), though there are larger Asian dishes and curries if you fancy something more hearty. Make sure you have a dessert as well. I had a ginger and white chocolate cheesecake that knocked me for six for a while as I floated away in a pudding-induced daydream.
The waiters do a fantastic job of recommending dishes if you're unsure (the first lunch I had here, one of the guys just brought us a selection of their best dishes and man, it was good).
Not exactly cheap (I could probably get just-as-good dim sum at Ping Pong - which I prefer as a destination), you're paying again for the place itself. The swanky designer decor, the attentive service and the oh-so-hip atmosphere. That said, I think it's worth it as the food is yummy and it's the sort of place you feel happy having a long conversation-fuelled dinner in and not being rushed.
I'll definitely be going back, if anything just to try the cocktails (the list looked intriguing, but my dinner guests weren't drinking). Next time gadget.",1
3,"I've never been excited by Dishoom. Maybe I've ordered badly, or been in a mood. But I've always heard great things about the bacon naan so I was pleased we were in town early enough on a weekend. 
We were quickly seated in the busy restaurant and our order taken relatively quickly. Drinks came as expected. Then we waited. And waited. And more waiting. Outer waitress never came back to our table. 
My bacon naan was tremendous. Loved it. But waiting for 45 minutes beforehand? Not cool. Paying was also time consuming. 
I'm still not excited by Dishoom.",-1
2,"Thought I'd give Bone Daddies another try. Whilst I'm too scared to go for the Tonkotsu Ramen (don't think I could take the potency of the Pork broth), I opted for the equally distinct flavour of their Tantanmen.
....What a bad choice I made.
Way too much Sesame paste used in the Ramen, could barely taste the Chicken Bone broth they claimed to have included in the bowl. The Sesame paste was soo intense I almost felt like heaving.
Sorry Bone Daddies but I don't think I'll be visiting you again, blame the heavy-handed chef you have...",-1
4,"Make reservations and try this place at least once if you like Dim Sum. A good friend of mine recommended this place and we tried it at the beginning of the New Year.  I didn't think to make reservations but luckily my wife and I was seated strait away. Get ready it is expensive here but the service is wonderful and the food is brilliant (it was 50pounds for the 2 of us). This is quite possibly the best Dim Sum in all of London. My favorite is the very popular pumpkin puff, venison puff, and the jasmine ribs. The environment has a modern design but comes with classy service.   
         The reason I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 is I didn't have a chance to try dessert. And this would be a splendid restaurant to bring a date but it is in Soho.",1
5,"Hands down my favorite Indian restaurant in London, maybe even ever ( apart from being in India). This place is always packed! I've come for both dinner and lunch and lunch appears to be the easier time to get a spot. Dinner time, the lines are massive and you're likely going to wait for 1-2 hours, IT IS WORTH IT. 
Last time I was in town, I waited close to an hour and we were starving! But it gave us more of a reason to order everything on the menu. I heard today that they are finally taking reservations, so that's an option! 
The patio seating out front is amazing. The weather was great today and we were able to snag a table right away (it was 12:15! So we were lucky). We ordered quite a bit of food for two people, but we devoured it. The black daal is a must order! Get some butter naan and garlic naan to go with it. You will not be disappointed. We also ordered the paneer which was nice and spicy.",1
3,"Some places lose a step when they aren't busy, this place, with the high art that is the timing of fries and thin meat, loses about about 10. The salad is still great, but not overly generous. All this even after I got a free bottle of wine. Hmm?",-1
1,"Do  not go if you expect good service. Never consider if you like great service. This is my first trip to London and based on yelp reviews, I decided to go there. I was told that there is 30 min wait. I said ok. But the guy at the front desk was least interested in taking down my name so that he can put me on the queue. Then I asked him about downstairs area. That's when he told me that there is no wait downstirs. So I went downstairs. There my family and I were seated immediately. But no one showed up to take the order. Or wasn't even offered water until I asked 4 times. 
I was getting flustered so I asked the manager to see if he can help provide better experience. But still no one offered to fill up water or came to check if I need seconds. 
Lastly no one showed up to collect the credit card for bill payment.
But they were quick to charge 12% tip/service charge.
How does this place get so much raving reviews.  Or Does the quality of service depends on skin color?",-1
1,"This is the worst restaurant in London. We have the worst experienced, the receptionist lady is very rude and un accommodative, she showed us a table and prepare the table just wiping it with wet clothes and sat the utensils down on the wet table, so dirty We are very shocked by her action. The whole place looks really dirty and unhealthy",-1
2,"It was really just ok....and I cannot understand the hype of this establishment other than the fact it's from New York and therefore that MUST mean we should all love it for the ''New York chicness'' or whatever.......
The decor was very French bistro, the lighting all soft and yellow toned so you felt as though you walked right into an instagram photoshot. I'm sure it would be a very ''chic'' place, there is no other word but chic for this place, to hang out for brunch on Sundays. But I was not impressed with the food selection nor the quality of the seafood. 
The chairs also had no cushions on them so you were sat in this hard wooden chair for the entire evening which makes your bum sore and your skirt sticking to the back of your legs. The tables were tiny and they tried to squeeze as much cutlery, bread plates, bread baskets, glasses and what have you, on this tiny (again hard topped) table. 
There were also A LOT of tables crammed into the whole place, as if the proprietors were trying to simulate a cosy, vintage style, café atmosphere....but actually, to me, did nothing more than to increase the noise levels and made everthing appear very messy.....
Verdict - dislike!",-1
3,"The tamago was awesome, but the black sauce in the tonkasu ramen was an overkill, way too salty. Be sure to ask them not to be too heavy handed with it",-1
5,"I had my eye on this restaurant for months! And when I booked my table I hoped and prayed to be seated in the middle of all the floral glory, with the warm lighting reflected on the mirrors surrounding the room. 
To my pleasant surprise, I managed to be seated with my partner, on my birthday in this beautiful room I had imagine for so long. 
It is the most beautiful restaurant I have been to till date, without a doubt. However, I do feel that with all the reviews and pictures I had previously seen, I was not taken aback by the fact that I was in the room...
... quite simply, the excitement of the restaurant is so highly televised that I was not taken with surprise the way I had imagined. 
Yes I was in this beautifully decorated romantic restaurant
Yes, it was in my birthday
Yes, with my partner 
And yet I expected more. 
The restaurant itself is very small and you feel very intimate not only with your partner but with everyone else in the room. The mirrors make it appear deceptively bigger than it is. 
One thing I cannot fault, is the service. Neither my partner or myself are the most flamboyant or immaculately dressed, however, we received a very warm service. 
If you are not used to fine dining, you may occasionally within this small boogie setting, feel out of place. However, if you're like me you know you came with enough ££ to cover your meal... simply eat and enjoy.",1
5,"Roast duck. Crispy skin, fat, and juicy. Do I need to say any more?",1
1,"Had dinner here last Tuesday (Dec 2,2014)and what a disappointment it was. First off, the bill for the two of us was $203.00. I don't drink and my partner had one glass of wine.Waiter was inattentive and bordered on being rude.Decor is tired.Food was just so-so.Certainly get  better here in Northern New Jersey. Just another tourist trap.Mad at ourselves for ever going there.",-1
5,"Pricey, above mid-range. Quality dimsum. If you're on a budget, just try their dimsum.",1
5,"The decor is hilariously colonial but it's kinda cute in an endearing way. The food however, is AMAZING. There was 5 of us and we were able to order a LOT of food which was probably the best way to do it. The okra fingers were so lovely but I think the show stoppers were the daahl and the chicken ruby curry. It was super crowded though and took us a while to get a table, but once we did the food arrived relatively quickly. Honestly, it was so good I'm still dreaming about it.",1
5,"Another trip to London another Dishoom. After experiencing the bacon naan during our previous visit I knew it was going to be a #1 priority for this one.
The shoreditch location has a super cute outdoor space with plastic walls that shelter you from the elements. It has cozy (but very worn and not so comfortable) sofas where you can sit and enjoy a leisurely breakfast to start your day. We ordered a bacon naan roll each as well as chai (endless refills) each and a buttery bun maska to share. 
The food came out quickly and was all around excellent and delicious. This will definitely be on my food list for my next visit as well.",1
4,"The place had really nice, light, friendly feel to it and some nice design touches in the decor but as this is Shoreditch the ceiling was stripped back, exposing big silver air pipes and old concrete.
The breakfast menu is full of intriguing dishes, based on familiar classics but with a hint of India. We ordered a few dishes to share, Akuri - Spicy scrambled (akuri or bhurji) eggs--an Irani café staple. Piled up richly on Fire Toast and served with tomatoes grilled on the vine. Sauage Naan Roll - a Britisher Cumberland sausage, placed in the midst of fresh hot naan with chill tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs and a Bombay Omelette - a crazy-paving omelette of chopped tomato, onion, coriander and green chilli. Served with tomatoes grilled on the vine and Fire Toast. which were all served with a lovely tomato and chilli based dip and also tried the Green Darjeeling Tea and the House Chai which was perfect for a cold Winter's day, full of balanced spices and a nice hit of ginger.
All the dishes we had were very good, just the right amount of chilli heat in the Akuri and Bombay Omelette and complimented by the Fire Toast, which is 'toasted' on the grill to give it a nice smoky flavour. The Naan for the Sausage Naan Roll was fresh, crisp and light and would probably be a great hangover cure.",1
5,"This was my first time eating Dim Sum! It was amazing quality and great flavor. The prices also were pretty great. My best friend and I ventured into ping pong on a whim and it's safe to say we loved it. I will be bringing my sister here as well! 
Everything was so soft and tasty. The menu is a la carte and everything is definitely shareable. They also have set menus that are done per person. I'd say experiment a bit and go with the a la carte menu. The potato and edamame cakes were amazing! We also ordered chicken and prawn + spicy veggie dim sum. It was so good. 
Honestly, I can't wait to go back!!",1
3,"They do not take reservations after 6PM and it is a long wait. 1 hr they say, it really is one hour. Delicious food but small portions and expensive. Good atmosphere if you are upstairs. Downstairs is dark and low ceiling. After all the wait, you hope for a good table but they sit you where ever available. The coctails are notting special. Naan and lamb was great but chicken was avarage. Buryani was good basmati rice avarage. So, better to try for lunch but not for dinner.",-1
5,"Michelin star dim sum, that should be enough to get any dumpling lover in the door. They offer both entrees and dim sum style dumplings in a very chic modern style restaurant. Very fun atmosphere and they did become packed very fast upon our arrival.
They have very high quality dumplings served as you order them, no cart here. They come about 3 per order, more on some items. The selection is about as good as a dumpling house can get. Really fresh stuff and they stand out for a reason. I also tried their chicken soup which was excellent. They have awesome desserts, you can look as them on display. We tried the macaroons that were a lovely way to finish our meal.
The price was very fair for the location and accolades. I would definitely check them out.",1
4,"Absolutely nice duck! The duck sauce is amazing, definitely worth a try. The restaurant itself is quite tiny and the waiters rude but I'm guessing thats what you get everywhere from a chinese restaurant in China Town.",1
4,Bowls for days get in here and rattle ya bones for some tasty noodles you'll slurp right in wash it down with some sake to ya.,1
5,"This place is beyond amazing. I've been many times over the last few years and still love it. Try the crispy duck salad. They have a dinner special now - 35 pounds for three courses, which is a good deal as it's quite a pricey restaurant.",1
4,"I lived in China.  Did I ever tell you that?  Yeah.  Soz.  I totally did though.  And then I came home to Engerland and was all ""show me the dimsum"" and some people did but they were wrong. WRONG.  It wasn't proper dimsum.  It was stupid.  I didn't like it.  And then my boss took me to Yauatcha and I was all . . . what is this?  Amaze.  They've got turnip cakes and chicken feet.  But it's POSH.  This is culinary mentalness on a whole other level where the level is one of joy in my mouth.
I used to think that all they served was cakes cos that's what they have in the windows - you know, those well pricey macaroons and stuff - and the windows are fully glass and blue (like, bright blue) and it looks Expensive and it is.  But dimsum - well, it ain't cheap, not even in China (where I lived), depending on who's paying, so you can't really go with an empty purse or expect to skimp and still get the good bits.  It's not peasant food, like beef and tomatoes or special fried rice (which are nice too but not in the same way).  Still you get used to seeing the same old crap in Chinatown and some of that's here but this is the Good Stuff, like stuff from China, the original stuff.
Yeah, the starry-ceilinged downstairs with background reed flute music harks of Chessington World of Adventures and the bathroom is very S&M dungeon (with Aesop hand-soap) and the tables are so low that the waiters can't hear when you order, but blimey is the food tasty.
I've always been too full after stuffing my face with dimsum and a main course (it's not how they do it in China, WHERE I LIVED, but when the boss is paying, you do what you're told) so I've never had a pudding, but they look utterly epic.  One day I will.  Somebody take me to Yauatcha and buy me a macaroon, won't you?  And I'll order the dimsum since I know these things (from when I lived in China) so everyone's a winner.
The oolong tea costs £8.  Don't order it.",1
3,"The sushi/sashimi at Nobu's is not the freshest and would make the best sushi chefs cry. But, overall, the chain produces a consistently pleasant dining experience, with some signature dishes that people happily go back for: kelp salad, artichoke salad, rock shrimp tempura, miso black cod, chocolate bento, etc.",-1
4,"Fantastic Indian food in the heart of Shoreditch. The atmosphere alone is worth a trip, and then you add on the delicious food and it is near perfection. We enjoyed tika masala, paneer, and lamb, all with deep, complex, and spicy flavors. The tea was the perfect accompaniment to our meal. Definitely worth the trip if you find yourself in Shoreditch!",1
3,"I never thought I'd judge a restaurant by its entrance door, but I did.  Sign of a quality time ahead, I say.
I've passed by the restaurant dozens of times but never stepped inside.  It's deceptive on first impression as the space appears to be small, but the sign at the door that says ""seating for 100 people"" sums it up pretty well.  We were taken to the seating downstairs, where we were joined fellow diners in a windowless basement.  We promptly ordered the £8 Oyaka don (chicken pieces with scrambled egg and brothy rice), and a fried chicken bento box which was a bit of a letdown for £16 (you get several pieces of fried chicken, 3 pieces of salmon sashimi, some veggies).  I'd recommend the rice bowls.
Overall, it's decent.  I'm a bit obsessed with Japanese food so I'm glad I found it.",-1
5,"An impressively designed and decorated place from the entrance to this branch to when you walk into and dine at this location. There are beautiful flowers along the entry path with picnic benches for enjoying cocktails and food al fresco when we have sunny weather. They now have a fab summer verandah. Amazing cocktails created by the knowledgeable bartenders at the well-designed The Permit Bar; a relaxing environment for drinks// cocktails and catching up with friends in an eye-catching bar. They create a wider variety of drinks and cocktails than the Covent Garden branch, perfectly made to original cocktail recipes but adding their own unique twist, like nimbu pani and the Bombay Martini; plus they will create variations of cocktails on the menu to customers requests without hesitation, like a whisky chai, whereas the Covent Garden branch bartenders were unwilling to go off the bar menu. Fabulous food created by the kitchen team, lead by the pleasant and friendly Head Chef Yash, especially the street food like samosas, fresh and crispy bhel puri and vada pau (the Indian version of a chip butty). Save space for their mango or malai kulfi (which has a lovely addition of caramel) and their melt-in-the-mouth nankhatais. Pleasant and efficient service. Overall, great place for Indian and Asian food, and would recommend in a heartbeat!",1
1,"This place horrible. I don't understand how people rated it that high. Food was terrible, price was high for the quality and quantity, and ambient is noisy, waiters are not polite. Our waiter left us in the middle of taking orders to do something else. Dishes did not come in the order we asked for. I don't know what to say about food, it is not even close to Indian Irani as they claim for, sambosa was horrible, fried ocra was half salty and dry, fish tikka was horribly grilled, with no taste, needed a lot of hot chutney to take the soapy taste away. I assume they have other branches. This was a complete waste for us visiting London for a week only.  Avoid this place!",-1
4,"I can recommend this restaurant which is said to be the most romantic restaurant in London, and it sure is intimate and romantic. Do however remember to ask to be seated in the conservatory when booking as it is by far the best ambience wise. The food is Provencal french and superb to say the least. The wine list is equally impressive and the staff are friendlly, attentive but without being in your face.",1
5,"If you're looking to impress your other half take them here - simply the most romantic and impressive restaurant I've been to in London.
 We sat in the conservatory under the blossom - which is definitely the place to be. The service was warm, friendly but not overbearing.
 We tried a few dishes on the menu and I can't rave about it enough. Superb.",1
4,"The food here is so, so good. Here is why:
* The Tonkotsu stock is boiled for 20 hours, giving the stock the rich, lip sticking quality that tonkotsu should always have
* The pork is the best I've ever had in a ramen, it's so meltingly tender it's hard to pick it up with chopsticks
* Theres a bottle of hair-ties on the table, to avoid any stock + long hair combos
* The condiments (which are free and unlimited) are incredible, delicious garlic, ground sesame seeds, chilli oil sauce and soy sauce
* The egg in the ramen is SO AWESOME, it almost outshines the other amazing additions
* There are napkins in a holder on the table. More noodle soup places need to do this
* The fried chicken is awesome
*  The Asahi smooth head is really great (never seen it in the UK before)
*  The food really is so, so good
But it just misses 5 stars because:
* I don't like the atmosphere, it's too loud, crowded and I'm pretty short (5'4) which means I am so far from the ground on the stools it's slightly concerning
* There's nowhere to put your bag or coat if you're on the side of the table nearest the door
* The service is erratic. Doesn't bother me so much but our fried chicken we ordered came half an hour after our ramens, even though we asked after it twice, which was slightly annoying as it would have been delicious before, but after we were all a bit greased out
* Please, please give your noodles a little more spring and bounce! For me that would crown this the perfect ramen!
* My bowl was slightly lacking in stock, there wasn't enough to slurp with each spoonful of noodles and I felt I was running out
Next time I would come at an unusual time so it wasn't SO packed (although the food was so good I'm perfectly happy to queue for 20 minutes again. I'd also order extra noodles for £2 and hope I also got a little more stock. Also, top tip - bring antacids, this food is RICH!
I love the food here, I can't wait to come back!",1
3,"This is a small shop located across Bubblewrap and every time we walked by, their were little to no customers around. I personally feel like this place is more authentic than the other places on Chinatown which may account for why it lacks popularity.
The person who served us was relatively polite and nice but one of the ladies working was pretty rude to us. 
We ordered beef noodle soup, fried rice, Chinese spinach, and seafood soup. The fried rice was good as was the spinach. The noodle soups were just ok and were not anything special.
Overall, this was a subpar place and I probably wouldn't go to it again. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great.",-1
5,"Wondering how we missed this Chinatown gem for so many years! Missed their signature roast duck, all finished just as we arririved.  We ordered their seasonal menu and the food was delicious! I ordered frog legs with bitter melon and minced grilled pork with lotus root, hubby ordered spare ribs and conegee with pork and oyster! Shame we couldn't order more.
Portions are generous but what's the harm in getting a doggy bag to enjoy it at another meal!",1
5,"Best Chinese in a clean, forward , cool setting.  Chinese food does not need to be in a dingy, loud, elbow to elbow setting.  We came in after a day of going about town.  We had out two girls with us.  The waiter graciously offered to 'build' us a meal based on our 'hunger level'.  We had an assortment of dumpling appetizers, but I still think about that prawn cheung fun a month later.  These paired well with their refreshing drinks.  We also had the chili fried fish.  The finale was equally amazing, kids were so happy with the eye candy desserts that were just divine.  We hope to back when we are back in London.",1
3,"A Michelin Chinese restaurant in Soho London that specializes in Dim Sum. It opened in 2004 by Alan Yau who also created Wagamama and Hakkasan. Rated as one of the top restaurants in London plus multiple locations worldwide.....I was excited to try this place. But what a shocking disappointment in regards to the food. 
This place was highly recommended by some friends. They said this place offers some of the best Chinese food in London......I would 100% disagree. Maybe for non-Chinese people (which is all I saw in the restaurant).
The inside is a cool and sexy contemporary vibe. The ambiance with the bright floor, star-lit ceiling, neon lighting, and aquarium bar in the basement is a clever refreshing way to bring light to this otherwise dark and cave like space. 
When we arrived the hostess took our coats and bags and seated us at the bar downstairs for a few drink while our table was bring prepped. It was at that minute I noticed not one other Asians were eating here.....
At the bar downstairs the drinks were divine. My husband got cognac and me some tropical lychee non alcoholic drink. The bartender was excellent. Drinks were delicious. 
Dishes are colourful with strong flavours and texture contrasts according to the website with dim sum as the highlight. 
Once are table was ready they brought us to our table to start ordering. Here is what we ordered:
Scallop shui mai
Char siu bun
Crispy duck roll
Prawn cheung fun
Wagyu beef puff
Stir-fry rib eye beef in black bean sauce
Every tasted off. The stir fry rib eye and crispy duck roll was the closest to authentic...even that was a far stretch. I looked straight into the kitchen and saw only Chinese chefs......I should have asked to speak to a chef and asked him to cook me something off the menu. My husband ordered so much because he was simply hungry. But I asked him to stop ordering, grab the check, and let's head to Chinatown to eat after here. I was not about to waste precious macros on bad food. 
Service was pretty standard and could only get so good as it was super busy. The bartenders offered great service though. Definitely deserve a mention. 
I can see how this would get a Michelin Star for interior design, service, and playing/presentation. Food though no offense reminded me of PF Chang's in the states. I don't see how it get a Michelin Star. But that must be why not one Chinese person was seen here eating when I visited. 
Go if you want a sexy and fun dinner. But not if you want authentic dim sum.",-1
5,"'Value for money' are 3 words you probably weren't expecting to see in a Hakkasan review (unless preceded by 'good luck getting your') but if you can get there by 6.30pm for dinner then congrats you're in luck!
They serve a 'Taste of Hakkasan' menu of three courses and a cocktail for £35 per person - it's tasty, filling and a steal for the price. A friend and I had a catch-up there after work to treat ourselves, and were given a wonderfully polite welcome from the start with no sign that we were there for last orders from the cheapo menu.
The only choice you need to make is meat, fish or veg - my mate and I went fish and meat respectively and shared which was perfect. We both enjoyed our Ling Ling Collins and a trio of dim sum to start - har gau classic, scallop and something yummy with chives. Her aubergine and shiitake salad then arrived but I think we were both more excited by my jasmine tea smoked organic pork ribs. I couldn't taste the tea per se but they tasted delicious with a good amount of meat on them. I liked the nice touch of slicing up the rack at the table and the way they kept it classy by serving them with finger bowls. My main was a generously sized spicy prawn dish, though this time I liked my mate's grilled seabass and honey better. We finished with a delectable trio of macarons in espresso, matcha green tea and passionfruit flavours which (unusually) I could barely finish.
The restaurant had gradually filled up around us and it was only on the walk to the toilets that I realised quite how big the place is. The low lighting keeps it feeling intimate while you're seated though, and combined with plenty of dark sexy decor and how beautifully the food is presented I think this would be a good date place. Go between 5.30-6.30pm or after 10pm for the set menu and you can impress them with your savvy bargain-hunting skills too!",1
3,"I would like to give this place a 4 star, but it just lacked a little something to push it into that category.
I love Japanese food, and it's quite possibly my favorite cuisine out there. I can't tell why I wasn't too impressed by this place but here are my general thoughts on my dining experience here:
1. I thought the prices were just a tad higher than for what they were offering. 
2. I was hoping they would have more options on the menu. I know this is probably a silly thing to say considering how extensive their menu already is, but I was really expecting an izakaya style place and this was not it at all! And if it is, it is a very limited menu for an izakaya.
3. The food was just filling enough.
4. Despite the Japanese speaking servers, I still felt this place didnt feel Japanese enough, it feels like I'm in Chinatown...probably because it is in Chinatown =P
In the end, maybe my expectations were just too high before I came, or I just have my own idea of what good/inexpensive japanese dining should be like.  It's a good fill your stomach on a decent variety of food, but nothing about it deserves special attention.",-1
5,Nothing to complain about here. Except that it's hard to get a table! But what can you expect from a top notch restaurant that does everything right. Enjoy.,1
3,"My first visit to Yauatcha was more than 7 years ago when Londoners were yet to get their fair share of upscale Chinese food.  Dim sum lunch was usually taken hastily in one of the tacky eateries in China Town and there was almost no place offering authentic Chinese cuisines and western standard service and decor. Against that backdrop, Yauatcha was an easy standout.  I was particularly impressed with the quality of the dim sum.  Coming from Hong Kong, where one can get quality dim sum aplenty, I was always skeptical of these new age chinese restaurants but Yauatcha was the rare few that delivered quality with just the right amount of innovation that justified the steeper prices it fetched.  
Times have changed though but my recent visits to Yauatcha have been disappointing.  First off, food was still of consistent quality. My favorites include the venison puff (venison in a slightly sweet puff pastry case where in the usual case it would have been bbq pork), the three style mushroom cheung fun (a steamed rice roll stuffed with mushroom) and the jasmine tea smoked rib. There is also a good selection of tea and desserts.  However, there are multiple things that were problematic. First and foremost, service was slow and inattentive, and frequently I seem to get the ""dont-seem-to-care-less"" attitude from everyone working there.  Friends have received the same treatment. Just not the kind of service you would expect at this price point.  The interiors also look a bit worn and old now, maybe time for some touchups?  If you want quality dimsum at reasonable prices, you are better off going to one of the Royal China's around town.  And if fusion is what you like, there are plenty of choices around. One good thing though is that you can always get a table at Yauatcha, if you have the cash and time to spare.",-1
5,"If you're looking for the closest thing to authentic Ramen outside of Japan, this is it.  With communal tables, this isn't the kind of place you'd go for a privacy but it's a great place if you want to be a little cheeky and eaves drop on your fellow diners conversations. Being in such close quarters with them, it's difficult not too - but expect others to do the same to you!   
BD's can get busy, but the staff are quick to keep an eye on the seating and getting you to a table so don't worry if the line is out the door - it goes down a lot faster than you'd 
expect.at
   
The TANTANMEN 2 dish is my favourite, it's a little spicy but full of flavour with minced chicken, crispy nori slices, egg and endless noodles in a chicken bone broth.  
Turn up hungry, the food here is very filling so you won't be wanting desert, instead you'll be dragging yourself out in the best possible kind of food coma.",1
4,"Dined in the flowery conservatory for my bday (waited 4+ months for the reservation!). The atmosphere and food was so beautiful, even though I really did not take a liking to the veal I ordered (first time trying veal). But my appetizer (Italian burrata, tomato and shaved truffle on pesto bread) and strawberry millefeuille dessert were incredible. My husband's chicken dish was actually much better than my veal. But...everything else was SO good that I already want to return.",1
4,"Nice environment quirky way of been served you tick the items off the menu & they serve as as soon as its ready things come in cool banquets and you give order 3-4 plates each a share the food which is cool, we were seated on a table with a group of people we didn't know this was nice as you got to interact & chat to people you wouldn't normally. Food was really tasty & dessert was lovley would recommend",1
4,"It's a tradition in my university sports club to eat here so I may be biased, but I absolutely love this place. However, this is not recommended for any delicate diners. The food is actually incredibly good for the most part, with some of the best duck soup noodles and soft shell crab locally in my opinion (a lot of the local competitors use a lot of veg in their soup so a lot of the rich duck flavour is lost). It is very good value for money, with massive portions, and is very cheap. You can tell it's cheap from the decor, the tableware and the fact that Wong Kei is infamous for it. Do not expect Western-style service. You will not get it. The waiting staff are very quick and also very to-the-point and for the majority of times I've been there, are not going to faff around. I personally have no problem with this but I know it's not for everyone. If you are a couple, you may be seated at a large table with other people if they're very busy. You could always wait for a smaller table to become available but it could be said to be part of the Wong Kei experience. This has only happened to me once and I've been as a pair several times, usually being seated downstairs on the smaller tables.
Great food, great price for said food, and exceptionally fast service.",1
3,"Inaptly named. Nice food, poor service. In a restaurant w few people folks itching to get their bill. Food was tasty, especially chocolate mousse, and good price, just slow and hard to get attention w service",-1
4,"Cutest little hipster restaurant! Best tonkotsu ramen in town. Fantastic artichoke when in season. Insane ribs - and im not not one really like ribs!!! 
 
More often than not very busy with queues.... Try Sunday for a late lunch!",1
2,"This was the most bland indian food we have ever eaten. Did they run out of spices tonight? The black daal, a recommended dish, just tasted like cream and beans. The paneer was too dense and bland. The stuffed eggplant was really good, but that was the only standout dish.",-1
3,"Seems that whenever I am in Chinatown, I pass by this place. Since I often go to Chinatown to get my Chinese fix, I have been ignoring this place until today. This is a very down to earth diner. The food is well prepared and delicious. You can get Bento, noodles, sushi, and your standard Japanese starter dishes here. My friend and I ordered a sashimi plate and Agedashi tofu to start. At first we thought 10 pound for a plate of sashimi wasn't a bad price, but when we saw the 7 small pieces of sashimi, we realized it wasn't the deal of the century. The Agedashi tofu was really good. I had the Katzu don which I liked. It was different from the Katzu I am used to, in this version, Katzu was cooked first and then cooked with eggs to form a pancake that covered the rice in the bowl. It was very yummy and very filling as well. 
What I like about this restaurant is the attention to details. You will find the most comprehensive menu here with information about gluten and nuts/seeds content for each and every one of their dishes. They also clearly stated on their menu that they don't accept tips! Overall, a good place for a quick meal.",-1
2,"Meh. The first time I went to Dishoom about 3 years back I was blown away. I did an unconventional breakfast with a big group of people at the restaurant off of St Martin's Lane. The chai tea was delightful and I remember leaving with a full and happy belly.
This time around, I guess a number of meh parts about the meal contributed to the perfect storm.
1) Weekend brunch is served til noon.  Okay, you may say, just get up and go - but on a Saturday mid-day, sometimes I just want want to sleep in and crawl to a hare of the dog breakfast for some eggs. Luckily I showed up early for a breakfast date planned for noon with a girlfriend and held the waiter hostage with promises that he would continue serving us even as she arrived at 12:01.
2) Food: Actually not bad at all - the price is right here and I had the Akuri spicy scramble - only thing is the food came out kind of cold and when I was done, I was still starving. This sounds like a waaah complaint but I found myself looking longingly over at the Albion only across the road, serving brunch all day long in perfect proportions.  Next time I'll review after choosing differently, perhaps more wisely. When I finished this course, even if I was hoping for more food it was going to be off the regular lunch/dinner menu which I just wasn't prepared for so early (ish) in the weekend day.
3) Drinks -The Dhoble - the description of a refreshing breakfast coctail of OJ, gin, maraschino liqueur won me over - but first sip was wholly alcohol. This is not what I meant by Hare of the Dog!  At 9 quid I wouldn't say this is a must - next time I'll leave the day drinking up to one of places nearby, like the rooftop Boundary around the corner. 
All in all I was a bit let down this time - I think I'll hold off on the Dishoom brunch and stick to dinner for the next round...",-1
3,"First time I went I loved it.  And the second too.  After that the novelty wears off and you start to notice the Dim Sum is not the best nor the cheapest.
But every time I take someone new they love it, especially if they haven't had Dim Sum before, so we end up going back.
Really good cocktails and atmosphere.  Try the cumquat mojito and the chinese tea with the flower in it that grows while you watch.  Great for groups.  Part of a chain there are a few around.",-1
1,"They are definitely feelin' themselves. Don't be a fool and buy the hype. Your money is better spent at Roti Chai (downstairs dining area). It took them 30 min, at least, to serve us water. When we asked the waitress about it, she blamed it on the bus boy. The food was decent, but not worth the 200 bucks we spent there. I ordered the homemade organic paneer, layered with green herbs and green mango, and finished off with nutmeg and cardamom. Very good. My cocktail was decent, but still pretty sweet (although the waitress smirked when I asked for it not to be too sweet, and said, ""Oh no, it's not sweet at all""). Wrong. I had the veggie crescent platter, and the only standout was the paneer tikka masala. Even then, it wasn't nearly as good as the veggie dishes we had the previous night at Roti Chai.
One last thing, we asked for naan to accompany our takeaway (we figured we should take our leftovers for a late night snack, since we'd forked over $200 for them). The waitress seriously went into a 5 minute explanation about how it would taste chewy if we reheated it later and she didn't recommend it. Lame. Give us what we ordered, we are paying for it.
She then brought the naan out 10 minutes later, on a plate, as if we were going to eat it there. She explained, ""I brought it out like this because the chef gets upset if people order takeaway, but I can pack it now bc it's been served"". WTF. Who says that? Doesn't the client always come first?
She never came back to give us our check. We had to ask the bus boy for it, so that we could GTFO.
Suck it, Veeraswamy.",-1
3,"We had the street food upstairs. The food is tasty but the portions are really small. You would need to order atleast 2-3 dishes to have a full stomach. They also need to add more on their menu.
Also, the place is not particularly kid friendly. If you have really small kids, i would not recommend this place to you.",-1
3,"You know, sometimes where you really look forward to try a place, it really lets you down.  This is what happened with Savoir Faire.
I am not sure whether it was the terrible weather or the fact I just came back from Paris, but I kinda expected bistro food at Parisienne prices and Parisienne quality.  That, unfortunately, Savoir Faire was not.  The price atmosphere and level of service was about right, but the food was a little off the mark.
It was also very slow, and who wants to wait ages for their food on what was perhaps the first real wintery evening of 2009?",-1
5,"First time eating Indian food and what a great experience it was! The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor verandah style seating, which makes you feel as if you are eating dinner in the family room of a house. Low coffee like tables, sofas and a fireplace set the mood. 
We decided to try and share a variety of plates and some drinks to make sure we experienced as many of the menu offerings as possible. For drinks we went with the Kingfisher beer, typical Indian beer, which was light and refreshing. We paired the beer with the Dishoom Calamari to snack on. The calamari deserves a shoutout as it was not only crunchy but the Dishoom drizzle really made it spectacular with its not too potent garlicky and sweet taste. 
As the main entrees we shared garlic naan bread, basmati rice, the Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Lamb Boti Kabab, House Black Daal and the Chicken Ruby (chicken curry). Everything was uniquely spicy and flavorful. The lamb was tender, the chicken curry sauce creamy, the Chicken Tikka well marinated in ginger juice and the lentils went perfectly over the rice.
To finish off our meal we shared the Dishoom chocolate pudding, which was reminiscent of a molten lava cake and some liquor infused chai - naughty chocolate chai and bailey's chai. 
Dishoom definitely set the bar high for Indian food and I hope I can find similar places back home. Otherwise, I'm back to London for some more Dishoom!",1
5,"Dim sans were beautifully presented, excellent taste and vg service. Worthwhile coming back.",1
5,"Yes it is hyped and it is busy. But the food is unique and stands apart from the typical naan and Butter Chicken you get at regular Indian restaurants. I would suggest looking past the hype and making a reservation for lunch -- as they are less busy then.
My husband and I have been eating at Dishoom since they had their first branch at Covent Garden. The Shoreditch branch has a more laid back vibe.
The Far Far is a snack that is reminiscent of the fermented rice crackers you get in India. The Black Dhaal is delicious if Dhaal is your thing. The Chicken Berry Britannia is a biryani topped with cranberries that give it a tangy edge. If you like Paneer, do try the Paneer Tikka. If you just want a snack, try the Bhel. If you want silky, soft, roti then get the Roomali Roti. If you can't decide, the Chicken Ruby is a fool proof choice. You might be tempted to lick the bowl. The staff won't notice. #JustSaying
The Chai reminds me of the street Chai you get in India. It tastes the same!
If you have food allergies, ask for the allergy menu where they have marked the possible dishes that you can eat accordingly.",1
4,"I come to this place as a treat, it's a little bit more expensive than most other yum cha (dim sum) places, but you get a much higher quality of food.
The restaurant is on two levels and stylishly decorated, they can cater for groups or couples. I would book if I wanted to take more than 4 people though. I found the tables a little uncomfortable when sat at them but not something that would prevent me coming back.
The service is high end, with the staff being very attentive and 100x more friendly than your usual Chinese (get em in, feed em, get em out) restaurant. 
The food is probably one of the best dumpling places in central London, they have a great selection and its all made to a high quality. I also like the small quirky takes they have on classic dishes. 
The best way to sell this place from me is... I don't really like Chinese food but I can always be persuaded to come here (especially is someone else is paying!)",1
3,"Good place to taste delicious Indian food. Good service. Ambience is a bit posh. Nice place to take your inlaws if you're willing to spend some money.
Glamourous bar downstairs in de the basement, although a bit quiet when we were there, even on a Saturday night.",-1
4,"PROS - Absolutely loved the rambunctious music upon entering. I mean, what do you expect from such an awesome restaurant name, ""Bone Daddies""? Very straightforward menu with great descriptions. I'm always a sucker for Tonkotsu based soups so of course I got that and it tasted dreamy. My friends got the Spicy Miso (lots of flavor, almost overwhelming but in a good way) and the T22 (a chicken broth based soup, he got it because it said ""cock shavings"" haha but my Tonkotsu still had more flavor than the T22). 
Hopefully the hair ties don't get reused but that is hilarious touch. I also dig their bathrooms. 
The ramen is solid, but could have been more generous with the noodles and broth (or maybe I'm just a piggy). I would like to try their chicken karrage next time as well. 
CONS - None really, I need to update this review once I try the neighboring competitor, Shoryu. ;)",1
3,"For my first trip to the UK, I was really looking forward to trying some LEGIT Indian food. A co-worker recommended Vivek Singh's Cinnamon Club, so we made a reservation. It sounded conceptually awesome! As we jumped out of our Uber, it was hard to tell we were at the right place, as the entrance is a bit unwelcoming.
The atmosphere was very contemporary. From the bright lighting and modern furniture to the service, we were set up for a fine dining experience. But that's not actually what we experienced...
We started with a selection of chutneys. 3 arrived... one was delightfully spicy and the other two were siiiiiickly sweet. I've had my fair share of stateside naan and hoped my UK experience would be even more flavorful. Not at all... all of the bread was fine at best. The varieties were lost on me.
My tablemate and I decided to share the ""Old Delhi style"" butter chicken on the bone which came with, black lentils, pilau rice and more garlic naan. We added the chilled bitter melon, pickled shallot and cucumber salad, and the home-style split yellow peas with cumin.
First up, the sides were mediocre. The only thing that stood out was the bitter melon salad, which had an incredible flavor and texture. Everything else was surprisingly bland! Like, scratch your head bland, why is there no salt on the table bland.
And for the chicken? The sauce and flavors were INCREDIBLE. Deep, dark, full of mouth feel and just... wow wow wow. But... for some bizarre reason, as it was prepared table side, I was served only wing parts, while my companion got thigh and white meat... cutting through and trimming meat off the bone when I just wanted to eat was beyond disappointing. We only realized the strange serving error as we shared notes after the dinner in our cab.
Will I be back? More than likely not. For the price and flavors, it's just not worth it. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibly lovely restaurant. But for the price, it should be perfect, which it is nowhere near.",-1
5,Cheap good Chinese food! There's plenty of seating and yes the free tea is a great plus. Service is fast and all the waiters speak perfect English. You have to pay 50 pence for a takeaway box by the way. I got sweet and sour chicken over rice for £5.20 and it's a pretty good sized portion too. I would definitely come back and try their other cheap options!,1
5,"Fine food, excellent service!   Everything we ordered was tasty.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!",1
4,"Food was good, service was fast. Not traditional dim sum, but still very good",1
3,"I'd been meaning to go to the NY location for ages and was excited when my friend suggested we grab dinner here. We got here around 7 PM on Friday and there was no wait at all, perfect. Our server was super nice and patient! We hadn't seen each other for years so he let us catch up a bunch and was nice about the fact that we hadn't even opened our menus the first two times he came around. 
I had the Rocket and Spinach Agnolotti as an entree. Loved the bitterness of the arugula and the simple flavors worked well together. The hazelnut also added a nice tough. It seemed unnecessary oily though and felt heavy in my tummy. My friend and I then split the Creme Brulee. Good thing we did because it was massive. I enjoyed the sugary crust but the rest of it was just okay. It could've been creamier and more flavorful.  
We left around 10 PM and there were way more people than when we got here. Guessing it attracts the post-theater crowd. Good vibe and nice service, but mediocre food.",-1
4,"Dessert. In the window. Then dessert, in your stomach.
And brilliant.
Macaroons? Yup. And good.
Dark chocolate with roasted sesame seeds? Yes, try that. No scheisse. It's fab.
Dark chocolate cake with buddha's hand and mangosteen reduction? That too.
I hear the food is good, and the service better - looks a bit spendy, but I can never get a table.
But you can always go in and get sweets. And I'm not a sweets person.",1
3,"I've only had small plates and cocktails at the bar at this Nobo so perhaps it's an unfair comparison, but I like the food at the Park Lane Nobu better. I tried a few of the dishes and was most impressed by the asparagus (and we ordered a fair share of different sea food options). My 'martini' was more like lychee juice with a splash of vodka and I was thoroughly unimpressed by it. It's a good place for people watching but if you're trying to have a conversation, don't sit at one of the tables in the middle, the acoustics are weird and you won't be able to hear what the person a foot in front of you is saying.",-1
4,Really love chicken wings!!! And sadly I was so devoted chatting with friends my noodles doesn't taste well... :),1
5,"One of the best roast duck dishes I've ever had. We arrived around 8pm on a Sunday night. Pity they ran out of the roast pork as we heard it was delicious too. We ordered a whole roast duck (£24), sliced beef (which was savory and slightly sweet, but so juicy and delicious), choi sum vegetables stir fried with garlic, tofu with prawn stuffing, and a herbal pork soup with black and white pepper which was a milky white color because of the carnation milk they added (we took a chance with the soup because it was so cold and we were so glad we did, it was so yummy and helped clear out my sinuses).  The total bill was around £100 but the food was amazing,  definitely one of the best I've ever had from both the U.K., and the USA.  The restaurant was fairly old and small even though it has two floors. We sat in the first floor and there were 6 tables. The staff was incredibly attentive. When we arrived, they took a few minutes to set up a table for us (3 adults and a toddler) and the toddler seat was set up before we even asked for one.  Once, we had dropped a chopstick, and the owner (manager?) immediately  grabbed us a new pair of chopsticks. When all our dishes arrived, our table was quite crowded and they quickly lifted up the extension of the table and gave us more space.  The staff spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin and I felt completely at ease conversing with them in Cantonese as they were extremely friendly and customer oriented. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for amazing Cantonese food. They also own ""Little Four Seasons"" which was more on the main side of Gerard Street but I have not yet tried it.",1
5,Lives up to the hype but the service is a little weird. Still you should try to go!! Get in line early and it shouldn't be too bad. Definitely have the lentil dal with the roti- delicious and I think about it all the time.,1
5,"Over many visits to this Chinatown staple I have sampled many of their excellent dishes and I can honestly say that I have never once been disappointed. Four Seasons is known for their barbecued meats and for good reason. Their Peking Duck is succulent and tasty. I also have their Crispy Aromatic duck which is very flavourful and crispy- the most perfect incarnation of this dish that I have ever had. In terms of other starters I have had the Peking Dumplings (strong flavour and very 'juicy') and Vegetarian Spring Rolls (Crispy with a high amount of vegetables inside). In terms of Main Course I have a group of dishes which are some of my favourites in the world. The Pork chop in honey and pepper sauce (from the Chef's Specials) is delicious, the pork chops are always flavoursome with a crispy exterior, the sauce is absolutely delicious and sweet with an almost caramel texture this combined with chopped up onions makes an absolutely stunning dish. The Black Bean dishes are also very good. The Beans themselves are as tasteful as ever and are slightly soft as (in my opinion they should be) and with a kick of chili it is very good. I would recommend the Beef in Black Bean sauce rather than the pork as the Pork is sometimes a tad too fatty for me. The Singapore Noodles are also very good with another hit of Chili to add to the flavour. As someone who is a huge fan of Mushrooms the Chicken with Chinese and Straw mushrooms is delicious and always comes with a hearty helping of various Mushrooms. The straw mushrooms are especially delicious!! 
Even though I have visited many times and have eaten many dishes there, there are still loads of dishes I want to try, the Fish dishes will be next I think. Anyway it has a great range of dishes at very competitive prices; we spent about £25 a head and had more food than we could eat. The only negative for some people may be the service. It is not always particularly efficient and/or 'chatty' but thats exactly what gives this place it's authentic charm.
Overall:
Price: Very good for the volume of food (Around £15-25 a head)
Favourite Item: Pork Chop in Honey and Pepper Sauce.
Worst Aspect: I honestly cannot name one.
Would recommend? Definitely I plan to go back as soon as possible.",1
3,"So it's a good place on the cheap which means no reservations and just work on luck. We found a table and I ordered Korean chicken wings, this is more of a tomato based chicken wing and not authentic Korean wing but tasty anyways. The ramen, so I ordered the pork and found that the base stock was rather salty and very thick. I think I will just select a miso base next time. Good drink selection.",-1
2,"I agree totally with Kirsten C ! Spot on. Went there tonight and was very disappointed. Main course arrived late and cold. Didn't even get a proper apology from the waiter forget about anything to make it up. Bad service! Never again! You can really eat good sushi with that money!!!!!! So yes, food didn't throw me on my back at all. 
Sorry but no, thank you Nobu :-/",-1
5,"This place is beautiful and the food, while not the best Anglo-Indian I've ever had, was still amazing. 
I had come in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon back in December. Even though I was only dining by myself, I still had to wait about 20 minutes or so before a table was available for me. I sat in the adjacent sun room, of sorts, that is just outside the main entrance of the restaurant.
 
Once seated, I ordered the bhel puri appetizer to start, and then the paneer tikka with rice and garlic naan on the side (because, ya know, you can never have too many carbs). The bhel puri was pretty good and the paneer was just as I imagined it would be: a little dry but rubbed nicely with the tikka masala mixture. Portions were large and the service was quite good. As weird it sounds also, the bathrooms were also nice, and I liked their old-fashioned toilet tanks and wooden seats.
 
You can certainly get much cheaper Indian food in the area, but I think this place is worth a visit if you're looking for a more posh dining experience.",1
4,"I have been eating here for over 20 years and I have to say, it isn't because I love their food..it is purely the entertainment value of the staff. If there are a more surly bunch of customer facing employees anywhere in the world, then they must be on a Pirate ship. I have never seen the manager smile and he doesn't so much as show you to your table, as frog march you to it!
I love it!",1
2,"Great drinks service at the bar, otherwise totally unimpressed service wise. Having been to Nobu in three other locations in the states and Matsuhisa on many occasions, with the reputation behind them and the prices on the menu I expect more. I've had better service at a pub eating bangers, beans & mash. The menu and quality of food was consistent with other Nobus (not my favorite Japanese but also didn't choose the restaurant). However, with the name Nobu, the address, the decor and the attitude I expect better service.",-1
3,"I would love to have been able to give this 5 stars, but the service was poor enough to bring it down to 3 stars.  (and I'm really generous with customer service, check my other reviews if you don't believe me!)
We had the lamb and the black lentils.  The black lentils were incredible!  Honestly, I think they were the best Indian dish I have ever had.  
Just a note to americans, rice isn't included with the dishes.  Be sure to order it or naan.
Its worth going to, but brace yourself to be treated poorly by the staff.",-1
1,Horrible atmosphere. Extremely loud. Stupid and unthoughtful opening times. Definetely not worth the money but food is good.,-1
4,"I drank the Kool-Aid that is Bone Daddies bone broth. 
I LOVED this ramen, real talk. And how 'bout that sesame grinder ... eh? eh?
Fried chicken: Bite sized pieces of crispy crunchy chicken - nothing new there EXCEPT, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice from slice provided and go ahead and grind some sesame seeds on top of that. Heaven
Edamame: Standard, but served in a good sized portion for two or four to share.
Tonkotsu with roast pork: Exactly what I hoped it would be and more. Broth was buttery and creamy and rich. Egg was perfectly cooked, noodles too. Meat was roasted perfectioness. Presentation was great too - didn't have to go hunting for the meat slices or that egg. I added cock scratchings per another reviewer's advice but it didn't do much for me. In fact, it pushed the flavour over the brink of salty/rich-ness; will not do that again. Didn't get the pipette of fat either and have no regrets.
I had a cocktail that did not bowl me over (despite the waiter's enthusiasm for it). Can't recall its name, the watermelon one. I'd stick to beer next time.
Tips
DO NOT USE APPLE MAPS TO FIND THIS PLACE. Just ... don't.
With all the other reviews I was worried it would be obnoxiously loud but I had no problem with that. But I don't feel I was warned about the cramped space. I mean really. Expect to be bumping elbows and brushing asses at every moment. Wait time was about 5 minutes for two on Saturday at 7p. No dessert menu. Two apps and two ramens was a tad too much food for two people, and way too much salt (even for this savory food addict).",1
3,"Dinner for one. Service was quick and efficient (rather than warm and welcoming) but got a table straight away. Starter of Pumpkin Curry Puri was fine without being worth a special mention, Main course of 'Grandad's black lentil dhal' was OK, but (for my taste) a bit runny as a main; I'd have it again as a side. Rice, chapatti and a pint of Cobra gave a bill just over £20. This included a 10% service charge of £1.87. If they'd left it off, I'd have left a bigger tip.
Turnover was fast: business is obviously good. Overall OK, but a bit wham-bam-thank you ma'am.
Go for a quick bite to eat rather than a night out or you'll be in bed for 10.",-1
3,"Stept in for a quick lunch. Clean, not too shabby. Wouldn't come pver from the other part of town for this but it's good for its price.",-1
4,"In short:
4 stars for food
2 stars for service
We came here for my husband's birthday as he loves asian/chinese food.
I thought they had a michelin star but I think it's only the mayfair branch that does, which may explain the sub-par service.
Anyway, we arrived and were escorted to the bar which is pretty cool. Took a while to get served for drinks but when we did they were very good.
We were then seated at our table. It's a busy, vibrant dining experience so don't come here for a quiet romantic dinner. It's cool though and I liked the vibe.
To start I had the veggie dim sum platter which was huge and very tasty. For my main I had the crispy fresh water prawn with dried chilli and cashew nut which was amazing. A mix of beautifully crispy prawns with whole dried chillis and nuts. Honestly loved it (as did my husband). 
However, our waitress was pretty terrible. She was rude and spoke limited english (I think she was eastern european) and not very accommodating. This may have just been bad luck but I was not impressed. I think partly this was because I was expecting michelin star service so maybe service is better at the mayfair branch.
I would go back, despite the price, because the food is great.",1
3,"It is a tad unfair to review a French restaurant after spending a week driving around the south of France in a convertible gorging oneself on French food and wine, but that's the situation I find myself in.  One must persevere in such conditions, although I suspect the juxtaposition of eating in the south of France with eating in the middle of the tourist district of London is why my star rating is lower than others'.
Savoir Faire is reasonably priced by London standards; 2 entrees, 2 mains, 1 dessert, and a carafe of house red cost under 50 quid.  I was underwhelmed by the food, however.  I had the beef carpaccio and the lamb shanks, and while both were fine, they weren't exactly screaming with flavor.  My co-eater had a tarte tatin for desert which was the least genuine tarte tatin I have ever seen in my life:  it looked like someone had taken apple sauce and placed it on top of pastry, and then covered the whole lot in custard.  Maybe it was designed for 80 year olds who had lost their teeth and couldn't chew?
There are some pluses though.  The cafe has a nice family feel and it was packed when I went which is always a good thing.  Also the waitresses actually spoke French which meant I could flirt with them in the language of love.  Normally waitresses in London speak Polish which I don't speak and is also the language of sausages, not love.
Overall not bad and if you were going to the theatre and needed a quick dinner beforehand you wouldn't be disappointed.  I don't think I'd take a date here.",-1
3,"This was my second time eating at Dishoom, and I must say I was not as impressed as I was the first time. Their signature chicken curry dish is absolutely amazing, I have go give them that, but I found their other dishes subpar. My boyfriend ordered a paneer curry dish that lacked in flavor and spice, was not even comparable to the taste of the chicken curry that I ordered.
Wait is often incredibly long, and it is crowded and loud in the restaurant. Maybe I just went on an off day this time, but I was not as impressed with it and believe that there are other more authentic indian restaurants with less wait and hype in the area.",-1
5,"The best Indian food I've ever had. And the ambiance is totally hip and cool. Definitely get the Black Daal and Chole Bhatura. So flavorful and comforting. Everything we had was delicious though. We also had the Fish Tikka, Mattar Paneer, and Garlic Naan. I want to come back and try the Fried Okra and Pau Bhaji.
The drink menu is to die for as well. I had the Mango and Fennel Lassi, which was an amazing flavor combination. It was great to have a yogurt drink to balance out the heat from the hot orange-colored sauce that they bring to your table.
If I lived here, I'd eat here once a week for sure!",1
3,"I've had a lot of ramen in my life & although Bone Daddies is pretty good, I just don't like the thick broth. It makes it so much more heavier than it should be.
I've been here twice and have ordered the tantanmen both times. Flavor wise, it's fantastic. I love the garlic press at the table and you can even ask them for extra chilies to make your ramen spicier. Like I said, I just don't like the thickness of the broth... personal preference if you will. 
Other than that, I love the casual atmosphere and communal high-top tables. Service is very friendly and pretty good.",-1
3,"Came here for over-priced dimsum and mainly to see what's the fuss is about. The restaurant is located in a sort-of alleyway hidden somewhere behind Tottenham Court Road which was a little difficult to find at first. 
When we got there, there was the scent of joss-sticks which is nostalgic of the wrong sort. It reminded me of Chinese temples or the altar room I had back in my home. Having this scent permeate a Michelin-starred restaurant was quite odd and the dark and dim lighting reminded me of the time when I visited Abercrombie and Fitch sans the loud music.
Good service was expected of a Michelin-starred restaurant, so at first impression they were doing OK, then I started finding flaws later on. Our coats were collected before we were seated but before we were even sat, my friend noted that one of the waiters gave her and us a once-over. How rude! I know we weren't dressed up posh but it's not like we came from the slums either. Nevertheless, his attitude was quite off-putting. 
Choices of dimsum were severely limited. Despite this, the food that we ordered were good and well made. We enjoyed the standard selection of har gau, siu mai, etc. but it was quite disappointing that we were made to share when the dishes came in either 3 or 4 pieces per dish. The waiter could've told us this when we ordered or made exceptions so all of us could happily have one each. Perhaps I am expecting too much but 13% for service (0.5% more than the standard 12.5%)??
Overall, the food was good but the service was meh. I expected more out of a posh restaurant because that's one of the key points (besides the food) that sets it apart from the normal non-starred ones. 
Honestly, for the service, I can get better elsewhere. (even normal-posh Chinese restaurants overseas have way better service... with better lighting as well).",-1
5,Minus the long wait to get in it was well worth it. Everything tasted terrific and gulub jamon was the best ive ever had. So happy i went.,1
5,"Michelin star? No. Service is average so don't expect a Michelin star restaurant. That said, the food is excellent, the menu is really for any taste and the desserts are just delicious.",1
5,"I really had a blast at Dishoom, a combination of friends and family going for dinner. We arrived rather late but still an hour wait in the bar for a company of 4, we should have booked a table and will the next time because I can assure you that we'll be coming back there. 
The food was really the best part, I simply loved everything. One of us has spent quite some time working in India and it was apparently the best Indian food she's had outside India. 
Staff were friendly, not pushy and attentive enough.
Considering that this is something we'll remember for a long time I think that the price we paid which ended up at just under 30£ per person after tip, including beer at the bar was definitely worth it.",1
5,"I did not have dinner at Yauatcha but visited the shop part of the restaurant where they sell their pastries. I hesitated a lot but finally decided on the milk chocolate and jasmine mousse with honey panna cotta one and it was delicious. 
The mousse was very light and the panna cotta soft, the chocolate cake moist and the addition of the popping candy was delightful though I wish there had been a bit more. Entremets often lose on texture and taste because of the gelatin they use to make them but this wasn't the case and I could have eaten another one of these right away!
Service was perfect, the lady described all of the cakes and answered all my questions while I was trying to decide and even offered to let me sample a raspberry and chocolate macaron which was out of this world!
You can go in there with your eyes closed and I will be looking forward to an occasion to eat at the restaurant, even just for the dessert.",1
4,"I visited Bone Daddies before it had it's official opening on a friend's recommendation telling me it was better than Tonkatsu. Price wise I would say the ramen was the same (the 20hr pork ramen costing £11). We arrived early, at 12pm to ensure we wouldn't have to queue for a table and good thing we did. 
The place isn't huge and we were seated at the bar type of seating, not really wanting to share with another party. For two of us we ordered the fried chicken starter and the salmon sashimi. Originally we had wanted the soft shell crab but due to their soft opening the night before they had sold out! The fried chicken was perfect, not overly oily and with a squeeze of lemon gave the perfect sharpness to accompany it. The salmon sashimi was fresh and came with a lovely light sauce on top with little crunchy balls on top (no idea what they were, but they were good).
Of course we both had to order the 20hr pork ramen which came with bamboo shoots, an amazing egg which looks smoked and was just perfectly cooking with a runny yolk. The broth and noodles were both tasty and the egg was my favourite accompaniment. To drink I ordered the fresh carrot and ginger juice which was fine, nothing special but I expected what it said on the tin. 
When we got our bill we had been given a goodwill discount and only ended up paying £26 for two of us for allll that food/drink. I assume this is because it was still during their soft opening period. Without the £20 off it would have been rather pricey for a bowl of ramen.
Upon leaving space was quite tight and we have to squeeze to get out of the place, but all in all a great place, albeit a little pricey.",1
3,"Low price casual eatery with plates £5-8 and complimentary tea with equally cheap casual deco and free sullen service. Crispy fried noodles disappointing, soggy non-crispy noodles, weak gravy, fish balls flat compressed bland. Dry beef hor fun much better, tasty and fragrant though greasy. This dish just saved from otherwise lower rating.",-1
2,"Typical Tonkotsu place.  Nothing special, frankly, it's really over-hyped.  Ramen could have been out of preserved or dried packages, Kimchi was not especially tasty (probably made more palatable for unsophisticated western's taste) and the shrimps on the seafood's Tonkotsu seemed straight out of the refrigerator, they were cold inside the warm soup which was an unpleasant contrast.
I finished ordering a Macha ice cream which didn't certainly taste artisanal.
If you want to get real Japanese ramen in Europe I'll suggest trying in Düsseldorf.",-1
1,"Would give 0 stars! Very poor customer service. The two women up front who are ""helping"" to seat are very discriminative! They let people in according to their whims and fancies. Would not recommend this restaurant.",-1
5,Easily the best ramen I've had in London to date. The 20 hour pork broth was awesome. The food easily made up for the poor service,1
3,"Our Monday night experience at Nobu was MEH and only made it to A-OK thanks to attentive staff and management. The food alone would NOT have made it to A-OK. 
Going to Nobu for her birthday after the completion of The Championship (aka Wimbledon for folks that are not interested in tennis) is our friend's tradition. So we looked forward some treats. All three of us love sashimi, but for variety, we thought the seasonal tasting menu would be a good idea. Wrong! The tasting menu was MEH at best. I rarely had worse. And it is hard to get less value (£100 per person). The tapas size dishes were generally over-sauced. On the seafood starter plate had salmon, but - in my opinion - salmon doesn't belong on a sushi/sashimi plate (unless you are feeding kids that are afraid of raw seafood). The marinated hamachi was one of the few enjoyable bites. It would have been better without the marinade as I like to taste the ingredients. Do not get me wrong. We all love spice and spicy dishes. I mean extreme spicy as long as the spice doesn't cover the ingredients' taste. Here Nobu generally failed. It got worse with their Wagyu course. No idea where that old cow came from. There was no sign of tender fattiness that Wagyu is famous for. Just pieces that remind one of shoe leather: both in texture and taste (and I am only exaggerating slightly). It was time for a call to management. They actually brought us a replacement dish. A Peruvian  style beef dish that was simmered rather than fried. It wasn't a great dish either, but the cooking method seemed to be more compatible with the beef they offered. The spice - a sauce that tasted a lot like tabasco from a bottle - didn't really agree with beef. The manager said that it is a traditional Peruvian spice. If true, I conclude that I do not like Peruvian spice. 
Frustrated with the food so far, we ordered a few pieces of sashimi and finally Nobu didn't mess up. Mackerel and o-toro were excellent. The scallops might be good for the location, but living in New England spoiled us, and therefore cannot win awards. The razor clams were out. Otherwise, the fish choices seemed pedestrian. Mackerel and o-toro are the winners. 
On the beverage side, I asked about their Daiginjo. Our waitress said that the Daiginjo is very bland and she recommended one of their other dry sakes, Onigoroshi (at half-price). As I was hesitating, she offered to bring us two cups to try. The recommended sake was not bad, but had too many strong flavors with a hint of a bitter, chemical aftertaste. We stuck to the Daiginjo and were very happy after three large carafes for three people. The standard Nobu Daiginjo has a typical, clean, delicate Niigata flavor. Definitely done right! May be too delicate vor the Peruvian side of the restaurant. 
Eventually we made it to dessert, which was pleasant and covered some of the earlier pains. Picture to follow ...",-1
4,"I heard about this place through a work friend who is a massive 'foodie' so i knew it would be great. 
Centered just off Wardour St, it's a perfect location for this rock n roll ramen eatery. I love Soho and i love it even more now I've been here. 
I had fried chicken to start - not as tasty as i would have hoped. The main however did not disappoint. I went for the pork tantanmen.
This was a great dish, lots of noodles, pork mince and lots of spice, yum. I also wore the bib!
A great place to head to after work for a quick dinner.",1
1,"Walked into this restaurant on our honeymoon with my Chinese-Canadian husband at which time we were promptly seated upstairs with the rest of the non-Asian people (I am white Canadian) and were immediately and absolutely appalled at this racial segregation in 2017!! The floors stunk of chlorine going upstairs. Then we were seated at a ""shared table"" when there were plenty of smaller tables for 2 downstairs. There were also tables of 4 upstairs which I was told when we asked to be seated alone. We were on our honeymoon after all. We walked out, absolutely appalled by this service. This separation would never happen in a Canadian Chinatown. Disgusting - what way to turn away customers.  No matter how good the food, this is not ethically ok and clearly for appearances sake only. This restaurant should be ashamed of its behaviour.",-1
4,"Yauatcha is an excellent dim sum restaurant. Its interior design is also magnificent. 
Truffle oil is all the rage at this place, the food is absolute artistry, and the cocktails are fantastically, deliciously strong. The dim sum was beautiful in every possible way, and the ribs are the best ones my husband has ever had. I've honestly never had such perfect, gorgeous dim sum. 
That being said, it still has its flaws. 
I've only been to one other michelin restaurant that was so unaccommodating in regards to allergies. My husband is allergic to sesame and nuts. The waiter straight-up told us we shouldn't even being dining there with when we have someone with nut and seed allergies. Some time later said waiter returned with about six items that we could order (out of a menu of perhaps a hundred). All of them were wonderful and delicious, but it was a little sad that those were the only items they could give us. The vast majority were vegetarian. On the same note, the only desserts we were able to have due to the allergy restriction were ice creams, which were wonderful but slightly disappointing with all the other wonderful things available.
I really, really recommend Yauatcha-- but if you have a friend or family member with nut and/or seed allergies, maybe consider somewhere else.",1
5,"One of my favourite places to eat, they really are little parcels of heaven! They have great set menus to help you choose but my personal favourite is the all you can eat sumdays (on a Sunday) all you can eat bar the specials and desserts. I have been known to graze for hours on. Lovely Sunday afternoon and the south bank branch has a little outdoor seating area which is great for people watching. Highly recommend! 
Oh and if you love it get a loyalty card, I've had many a free lunch of the lazy sumday points!",1
4,"I came to this location because of the high yelp reviews. Atmosphere was very nice. The food portion was tiny though. I'd say the food was better than the dim sum back in the US  (Bay Area), but pretty pricey for teeny tiny pieces. But I guess this restaurant is one of those places you should try if you're in London. Service was okay, but I expect more especially if I'm paying that much for dim sum.",1
4,"The place is simple: they serve very cheap, good tasting, filling meals. On this, Wong Kei never disappoints.",1
3,"Solid flavor, but not enough noodles. (I got thick; those with thin noodles seemed to have larger portions). I also ordered a beer that didn't come until I was halfway through my meal and water that never came. Really expensive, but that's probably because I'm an American who isn't used to the pound.",-1
3,"Really wanted to love this place, and although the food is good, it just doesn't justify the prices to me- I've been able to get some food that's just as nice or better for so much cheaper in London. Seating is very crowded, but I actually like that. Be prepared to wait if you have a big group or go on a weekend.",-1
5,"The ultimate dimsum restaurant, this funky, cool and popular restaurant sits proudly on the southbank down from the BFI and National Theatre. It literally does one thing, and does it well - offers dim sum. And lots of it. You are presented with menus and a piece of paper reminiscent of a cluedo sheet, which you mark according to what you want to eat, not with what implement you think Colonel Mustard used in the Ballroom. They then take the sheet and return with plates and plates of delicious goodies. I particularly recommend the duck spring rolls and the crispy prawn balls, but the har gau dumplings are amazing and you must eat some of the sticky rice which comes wrapped in a leaf. Oh, and you can't leave without trying the kumquat mojito. Summink Else!",1
5,"Fresh Maine Lobster, Scallops and Prawn Tortellini in Langoustine Bisque...this was the starter. Full of flavour. Every bite was an inspiration to the palate. The bisque was just the right consistency.  The service was impeccable and surprisingly quick. The ambience was beyond words. We were accommodated in the Conservatory - the romance of which melted my partners heart! They even celebrated our wedding anniversary with a complimentary platter of chocolate truffles. Definitely a five star experience!",1
3,"Meh. I'm surprised this seems to be the best London has to offer. Got the IP Tonkotsu. The broth had a rich creamy flavor but was VERY salty with little depth of flavor. The ""spicy"" IP sauce was anything but spicy. Could have done with a bit more chashu and some more varied ingredients. They also use thin, straight vermicelli  noodles, which is not necessarily bad, but it didn't satisfy my craving for springy wavy style egg noodles. Our waitress also disappeared completely after dropping our bowls which was a bit annoying. 
That said, it wasn't the worst ramen I ever had. The chashu was good and overall if you're craving ramen you'll be ok here. They also had a huge selection of toppings on the table-- crushed sesame, fresh garlic with a garlic press, spicy sauce and vinegar. I was really impressed with those options.",-1
1,"Business is good and all that, but the floor manager's got a cocky attitude and basically told me ""you will get your table when your name is called"" when I asked him politely about the wait time. Left immediately without looking back.",-1
3,"Food was good. Service was not what you would expect from an upscale restaurant and for the prices that they charge. As for Chinese food, there are many choices with better values just a few blocks down in Chinatown.  Don't think I will go back or would recommend to my friends.",-1
5,"Worthy of its Michelin star as far as I'm concerned.   Almost every dim sum dish we ordered was excellent (except for the Szechuan wontons, which were surprisingly lacking flavor).   We came for dinner on a Friday without a reservation, but came early and luckily got a seat immediately.  Also thankfully, unlike other reviewers, our server was super attentive.",1
4,"Delish food. And shockingly easy to get a table, considering the neighbourhood. And even better that the waiter brought our table free shots of the sake of the week before we'd even ordered. 
One star off because they did mess up my order, but as soon as I pointed it out they made it right on the quick.",1
3,"Made a reservation about a month in advance with no problem.  Was looking forward to a great meal with family.  The decor is definitely interesting as it still houses the vestiges of its prior firehouse incarnation.  There was a young and hip vibe with the clientele and we looked forward to a relaxing dinner.   The waitstaff was attractive and efficient, but certainly not warm or inviting.  The food came quickly and looked beautiful, but it lacked deep flavor, and the fish was overcooked and dry.  We seemed to be in a high traffic area (somewhat near the bar) and while many waitstaff ran past our table, our waiter was quite scarce.  Water glasses were left unfilled, and wine was not poured as needed.  
Overall,  that Chiltern is quite consistent.  From the moment that you arrive you will enjoy the look of the venue, the beauty of the staff, and the presentation of the food.  At the same time, the venue, staff and food lack any real depth and all seem to be going through the motions.  There are too many good food choices in London to pay top dollar at Chiltern Firehouse, only to leave feeling like something important was missing.",-1
5,"If you're in London, this little gem off Covent Garden is a can't miss.
For starters, the restaurant itself is beautiful.
The service is impeccable.
The food is some of the best around.  Between the two of us, we had a tomato salad (actually a side dish that we got as an app) and a spring mix salad with truffle as starters.  Both were delicious.
Main courses were papparadelle with mushrooms and truffle (see a theme?) and fish.  While the fish was good, the pasta was the clear winner.  Wines were great and masterfully paired (we both got by the glass given our different main courses, and the somm matched them very well without resorting to the ""Coravin"" glass list).
Eat here...you won't be upset you did.",1
3,"This is your typical Chinatown restaurant, and if you're looking for that sort of vibe, this is perfect for you and your friends! I was asked to meet a few friends here from Hong Kong for dinner before we went to the theatre. They heard it was famous for their bad reputation so they wanted to try it. I personally do not understand why they came all the way from Hong Kong to the UK to have Chinese food, but there is neither here or there. 
Food: If there's food in front of me, I'll eat it! I completely forgot what we ordered, but my friend pouted and said they all looked the same: stir-fried bbq pork, stir-fried vegetables, stir-fried a whole bunch of stuff and deep-fried tofu with chillies. Whatever we ordered, it came quickly and that was a good thing for us because we were in a hurry.
Atmosphere: It has a typical Chinese cafe-style atmosphere: busy, tacky oriental art, and a slight layer of grease on the wall that comes with a dive like so. Where the chairs are from an 80's diner and the plastic cutlery and crockery has been used so much, their logo is wearing off. If you're looking for 5 star dinning, you've come to the wrong place. If you're looking for fast, cheap eats, look no further than this lovely dive full of oriental tourists getting upset that it's not up to par with their home cooking or Chinese students that miss home and did not want to have instant noodles tonight. 
Service: The service wasn't that bad. I do want to say, it was surprisingly good based on their bad reputation. We walked in, told them how many people and were seated accordingly. In typical Chinese fashion, sometimes you may need to wave them down to get some service, but I feel that is the norm for busy restaurants.",-1
3,"I used to come here a lot, but have mostly stopped going since finding out that there is meat stock in all the katsu curries, including the vegetable one which leaves only maki and other cold dishes for vegetarians :(
 It is otherwise a fun, if slightly cramped, experience. This is great value food for central London, and it's a good relaxed place for a quick meal if you're catching a movie in Leicester Square. I just wish they did more I could eat!",-1
3,"Based on the cheaper £35 taste of Hakkasan menu, this place isn't bad.  Considering a cocktail is over £10 and you get one, plus dim sum, a main and a dessert the deal is pretty good. 
It's kind of classy in a 90s kind of way, it's dark and modern but at the same time it feels a bit bit dated for some reason.  Service was good and the atmosphere was good, food was ok. 
Comparing it to the best Chinese, the dim sum was a nice modern twist in terms of flavour but the steamed dim sum's pastry was too thick and floury, and the balance of the filling in the duck spring roll wasn't quite right.  
The beef in Merlot sauce was very good with great aromatics, the pippa duck was probably sitting on the pass too long as the skin wasn't that crispy and the cod with champagne and honey sauce was awful.  The cod dish smacked of something to put on the menu to try and elevate the place, why ruin the delicate flavour of fish with such a sickly sauce?  In true Chinese cooking sugar and sweeteners are used as seasoning to bring out natural sweetness not make the dish sweet.  The cod aside it was a pleasant meal (though I wonder why we were offered garlic chilli paste as a chilli dipping sauce) and good value.  The ambience of the place suits a venue to impress because of the all round adequacies but there are better tasting Chinese plates around London.",-1
4,"I tried this out on a Friday night. We had pre-booked a table but still had to wait 20mins at the bar until one was ready which was a bit annoying. The food (asian) is fantastic. The duck, which I am not normally a fan of generally, was really tender and tasty and I would definitely recommend it. Best to get dishes to share on the table with your friends so you get to try lots of things. Had heard previously it was riduculously expensive so was surprised when it came to about £40 a head (I thought it would be double). The items on the menu really vary in price - you have some mains for £15 and some for £60 so I guess it depends on what you order.",1
5,Beautiful place with delicious food. Dim Sum heaven.,1
2,"This is a very strange restaurant. Styled after Irani cafés of yore? LOL. No. Styled after PF Chang's? Quite possibly. Food is just fine--over-spiced and lacking subtlety or variety of flavor but made with fresh ingredients. A request for ""extra yogurt on side"" got me a vat of the stuff. Chai spice is VERY PRESENT but fails to complement the tea, masking it instead. The food may have the right components, but the soul necessary to combine them properly isn't there. The ambiance is Corporate Chain inside a Mall of America. Staff was pleasant!",-1
5,"Epic good!!! We had the black daal and okra and a few other dishes. The daal was so deeply flavorful, rich and almost meaty (even though it was vegetarian). My daughter said it was one of the best meals of her life.  Do come early, otherwise you will be in line. We came at about 5:00 
 or maybe a little earlier on a March afternoon and walked right in. Right after that, the line began to form. As Southern Americans we shared our fried okra with an elderly couple from Norway who had never tried okra. That was a sweet memory. And now when I fry Southern fry my okra I use chickpea flour (graham flour) in my batter. When you travel you learn things!",1
4,"This restaurant was recommended by concierge of the four seasons at park lane.
Quite good dim sum restaurant. xiaolongbao (eastern Chinese steamed bun); soup dumpling was very good.Another We orderd a Gōngbo Jīdīng(little bit too sweet) and singapore fried noodle.Noodle is quite good.I recommend this restaurant to any body.",1
2,We went on boxing day as a party of 5 + 1 small kid. We decided to eat on the street food section at the top rather than dining in the basement. The street food was pretty average. Bhelpuri had too much tamarind and was sour. The Dhokla was not very fluffy. The manchurian was again a bit on the sour side and lacking sweetness. The lemon juice or nimbu pani tasted more of soda water and ice rather than any lemon flavour. Service was also slow despite it not being a busy night. The only good thing that I liked was the burger. Will not be trying the street food area again. The dining area for which i have reviewed before was a much better experience for me.,-1
1,"The WORST dining experience ever had in my life so far. we were very angry and disappointed to the manager who is bald and wears black glass. Can't remember his name. But he had very rude and mean attitude to us asking us to leave and return back to our seat(which was in the main dining room) immediately while we were just taking photo in the conservatory, at that time there was only a few guests sitting there. After I told him that I just want to take some photos from here, this guy used loud and serious voice said :' other customers do not want to see people staying here( the conservatory), and do you understand what I mean?'  Well, i never seen a waiter being so rude and unfriendly to their customers from the Michelin star restaurant. And I guess I will write a formal letter to the institution tell the whole unhappy experience.",-1
4,"Has anyone watched that Five Guys YouTube video where the guy takes a bite of his burger and says ""Dayum..Dayum..DAYUM"" - that was my reaction when I took a bite of the Bone Daddies Ramen soft boiled egg. Mine was perfectly cooked in my Tonkotsu Ramen with the yolk a perfect golden syrup but not too runny that it melted into my broth. It tasted divine with my noodles and I thought it could have been a dish of its own but actually, since they marinate the eggs first (kudos as not all ramen restaurants do) it might be too salty to eat on its own. And surprisingly everyone's dish around me also had a perfect looking egg. Not easy to clone perfection! Okay, enough about eggs.
Unfortunately, you won't get your choice of staggering ramen permutations here, i.e. there is no option for soft or hard noodles and I'm not sure if they will give the option upon request. Try next time and tell me if it works! The noodles I had were thin springy goodness and not too soft, but not al dente either. Eat quickly before they get soggy. Noodles don't taste homemade but I can't have it all! You're probably not likely to ask for lighter broth either; it comes very rich and creamy already but if you want even more thickness, you can add extra fat!! Oh, and the bowl is super big but the broth and toppings only fill half the bowl. The bowl was begging for me to fill it with more noodles or broth so I will make a note to order extra next time. Overall, for 11 pounds, I'd say the meal was pretty worth it. 
I also had a Mr. Sparkle which was a virgin drink with orange juice..grapefruit juice..and oolong tea...there might be something else but that was basically what it tasted like. Contrary to its name, there is no sparkle - as in, it is not bubbly. It didn't particularly stand out as you can tell I have a hard time describing it ..unlike my rambling soliloquy about eggs. However, if you're looking for a clean and light grapefruity drink to try, then order this. Otherwise, go bold with the sakes :) 
Ambience-wise, the restaurant was really quite loud. The place was popping on a Tuesday night. I went during dinner and needed to shout to communicate and had a hard time hearing others. But most of the time is spent stuffing your mouth with food anyways, so it's not too unfortunate.",1
3,"I would really like to give this place 3.5 stars.  It's good.  And great for the price.  Three of us showed up at 930 on a Saturday without a reservation, and we were seated despite the place being busy.
The service was friendly and fast, and the food was well seasoned.
Two of us ordered the duck, while our third companion stuck with a starter.  The duck was tasty, and the mash and cabbage it came with were quite good.  However, it was realy very overcooked.  And it wasn't just mine, it was both of us.  Now, at £8, I really wasn't inclined to complain, and I will still go back.  As I said, tasty.  Still overcooked duck is just not ideal.  3.5 stars it is.",-1
3,My first review...  Just ok. Not too bad. Kinda disappointing when you've had really good ramen in Japan or SF or LA or NY. The noodles are too thin also (at least for my taste).,-1
3,"Outstanding cocktails & food, cool space but loud atmosphere (place to be seen and apparently also heard). Three stars due to horrifically snooty incompetent hostesses (yes, plural).. The outdoor area was fairly empty but hostesses insisted on seating us in a walkway. We finally ended up with a decent table thanks to our server and persistence from my husband.  Service was good but slow. Started with super stiff excellent drinks -- gin & tonic and old fashioned. Had to have second each despite generous pour. Then shared spiced watermelon, steak tartare & Iberian bbq pork. Could have order seconds on all but instead tried four desserts, all fab. Would we come again?  Not sure unless with a regular to get decent table. We had reserved but clearly counts for nought.",-1
3,"For Chinese people, the concept of expensive fusion dim sum is a bit strange. Not to mention in general £5 for an order of crab siu mai is a bit ridiculous.
The idea of venison puff pastry/pie at a Chinese restaurant is a bit strange, but we went for it. We also ordered the standard dishes - cheung fun (rice rolls), fried rice, siu mai, har gao etc. Some of the dishes were standouts such as the har gao/siu mai/turnip cake, but we were definitely let down by others. The noodles were greasy and bland, and the fried rice was burnt. 
Service here is...unique. Transport Chinatown service to Soho and that's what you get. Not a single smile, exasperated looks thrown at me...not really sure what our table did to warrant it! We ended up having to send back the fried rice because parts of it were actually black at the bottom. We also had to wait over 20 minutes to get our dessert of glutinous rice balls covered with peanuts. When I asked one of the servers how long it would take, he told me it takes time. No kidding, I realised it takes time. Then I told him that we waited over 20 minutes for the dessert. He then gives me a quizzical look and questions me, unconvinced that I was telling the truth.
By this point, I was a bit fed up, so I just told him to cancel the order. I guess we attracted enough attention because five minutes later the manager comes up with a plate of macarons for us, ""on the house"". With the exception of the chocolate macaron, the four of us all agreed that they were too sweet, stuck to our teeth, and we couldn't even discern what the flavours were supposed to be. 
I've been to Yauatcha on previous occasions, and there was not a single occasion where the service was acceptable. Really good quality dim sum but I have no choice but to take points off for burnt rice, and the repeatedly rude servers.",-1
3,"Average.
The sushi menu was limited.  I read a little anecdote on display about how the Japanese will travel across the country (of Japan) for freshly prepared soba noodles.  But, um, the soba noodles I got were so obviously not fresh.  
Is this a dishonest or an ingenious marketing strategy?  I can't decide. 
In any event, Okawari is just down Lisle Street, and it has a bigger sushi menu and lower prices.  If you want a more stereotypically Japanese dining atmosphere, stick with Tokyo Diner.  But you'll get more for your money at Okawari, and that's what counts, I think.",-1
5,The staff were very helpful and friendly. They even made sure that I got a meat free menu. I had lovely cocktails and dim sum and will definitely come back!,1
4,"I've been to this place a few times for dim sum. It's not bad at all. Like lots of the places you can eat round here there is nothing especially different in terms of what is being served but I have always found it good.
Some of their non-dim sum dishes are very good. I would recommend giving the place a try, if you feel like it. There's definitely nothing to fear.",1
4,"Loved Ping Pong and plan to return on our next trip to London. I will admit I come from Southern California and we don't have awesome dim sum, so my comparison might be poor, but I thought this dim sum was great, on par with what I can get in the Bay Area, maybe better. We waited about 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all. Price seemed very reasonable. Service was pleasant, our server made some suggestions when asked for that were all happily accepted and enjoyed when served.  And we didn't feel rushed which on a Saturday night is very appreciated. I hate it when servers try and rush you out so they can get their next table, if I'm still drinking they will still get money. I was very happy overall.",1
2,"I love noodles and have been eating them at least twice a week, more so in Japan (at least 4-5 a week).  So I have been looking forward to Kanada-Ya's opening.  Sadly I was totally disappointed with their Ramen.  
We ordered one Moyashi and one Chashu Ramens.  Their Tonkotsu soup was simmered for 18 hours according to their menu and tasted justifiably so; however it simply lacked depth.  It just tasted congealing pork fat/bones with soya sauce and nothing else much.  Adding lots of black pepper did not help.  Good Tonkotsu soup should have different layers of flavours.  The thin noddle was cloggy/starchy; it should have been boiled in a much larger pot and shaken vigorously to remove as much starchy water as possible.  I didn't see the point of Kikurage (Woodear Fungus) as it only gave texture but was bland.  The only good bit was Chashu in Chashu Men; they (Collar) were leaner than those (Belly) used in other two types of Ramen and tasted as good as you get in Japan.
The menu was limited to three types of Tonkotsu Ramen and Rice Balls (Onigiri) and they were way too expensive.  Why the prices of Ramen are so high in London?  You can get very decent ones for around £4-5 in Japan and the quality you find in London does not justify the price tag.  Even in Paris, you can get nicer Ramen for around 7-8 Euros.
Very disappointing.",-1
5,"Clos Maggiore is a romantic oasis in the heart of Covent Garden. Their warm and intimate influence comes from the country inns of Provence and Tuscany. Clos Maggiore is ranked one of the worlds most romantic restaurants. It feels magical even on the outside of the restaurant. It was the most magical anniversary celebrated since our wedding day :) 
As one enters Close Maggiore, you are immediately greeted by the hostess to check in and have your coats received. The hostess will then bring you into the waiting room with a beverage of your choice. The waiting room is dimly lit for a sexy and foxy ambiance.  
Hubby made a late reservation at 9:30pm. Feedback states you are most likely to get a seat in the observatory with a later reservation than with an early reservation. This feedback was true as we had did get a table in the observatory. A nice cozy corner table to snuggle together under the stars on a romantic and magical December night :) 
The whole restaurant is beautiful and breathtaking, but the observatory is unforgettable. The conservatory is a fully retractable glass roof that is normally adorned with cherry blossoms. When we visited it was adored with rustic wood branches intertwined with greenery, Christmas lights, and Christmas ornaments. The lighting was romantic with a fusion of the starlight sky above, crackling warm fireplace in the back, Christmas lights everywhere, and a delicate candle lit on our table. 
Chef Marcellin Marc's love of Provencal can be experienced not only in the decor, but also in the cuisine. The dishes created from sourced local and seasonal products throughout the year to create their awarded AA-rosette award menus. One can read more details about the sourcing of ingredients on their website. It is quiet fascinating. Hubby and I both ordered items from the seasonal tasting menu. The quality of the ingredients are exceptional. One can taste the quality in every bite. 
Clos Maggiore believes that wine is a fundamental part of dining. Therefore they a dedicated team of Sommeliers that visit vineyards and taste hundreds of wines a year. This teamwork has produced a globally renowned wine cellar that boasts an extensive 2500 options from 18 different countries and four centuries. The restaurant has won multiple awards for their wines including one of the highest and most prestigious accolades - 'The Wine Spectator Grand Award' - one of only 70 restaurants worldwide to have achieved this honour. Lastly, they now incorporate ""Coravin"" wine preservation system so you can order by the glass. 
Such a fabulous restaurant is not fabulous without its staff. The service deserves a round of applause. Outstanding from the minute of arrival to departure. Intimate service never left me sit waiting for the next course, or with crumbs on the table. Truly wonderful. My favorite was the surprise was at the end. The staff provided a special ""Happy Anniversary"" dish. This topped off an already beyond perfect night. Thank you! Words cannot express enough how thankful I am to the staff. 
London has so much to see and offer. I would highly recommend making time to visit this restaurant. It is on par with several one Michelin star restaurants in London. In addition, it's not just a restaurant, but an experience you will remember for many years. 
Thank you Clos Maggiore!",1
3,"A little too expensive for the food quality, but definitely ask for the chicken wings.",-1
3,"Have to say I was looking forward to coming here Bc I love ramen but was disappointed. Maybe this is the best ramen in London but it pales in comparison to ippudo in NYC. That said I didn't expect it to be as good as ippudo but when the soup came - my noodles came out hot, broth Luke warm and the yolk on my egg was COLD...guess that shows they pre make the egg. Normally the eggs are supposed the be deliciously warm and runny and cook in the hot broth. I hate leaving negative reviews but hopefully it helps the restaurant for the future....warm up your broth its soup for goodness sake.",-1
3,"The food was average in my opinion. 
Wife was craving noodles and after some really bad ramen at Wagamama (we went there because it was close to our hotel and we didn't want to travel far. Now we know to never go!) So she looked up Yelp and she decided to give this place a shot. 
We arrived before dinner rush and there were already people waiting. Since we were a small group, we were promptly seated in the basement section. My wife ordered her noodles, a tofu with veggies, the mixed plate of duck and pork. 
Its decent Chinese food. We did order the famous duck that everyone is raving about and its good - I have to give it to them, but its not ""the best I had"" kinda good. Think HK, NY, or SF! Maybe its consider the best in UK (maybe Europe)?
The pork was not as good because it got soggy from soaking in the soy sauce mixed in with the duck. The surprise was the tofu veggie that I really liked. Sorry - I don't know the official English name because the server recommended it in Cantonese. 
Anyways, I think this restaurant is decent. Wouldn't mind going back again if I was craving Chinese food in London.",-1
1,"Dined here with my family last night .... positive reviews on Yelp. We were tired after a long day of touring. This spot had such positive reviews on Yelp and it fell SO FAR SHORT of our expectations. Pros were quick service & good green tea. Cons were the food ... ordered the Chicken Katsu Bento ... fried, breaded chicken cutlet - dried out, no flavour. My sons had the Chicken Teriyaki... soaked in sauce. Husband had the Salmon Bento - better. Seafood salad was forlorn & limp. Chicken was dry and without flavour. Cold, cooked veggies accompanied the meal and had an odd taste to them. Beyond disappointing.... DON'T GO. A disappointing & a disastrous food experience.",-1
4,"I brought my parents to this place and maybe took them a bit out of their comfort zone but I didn't really care because I was excited to try everything! They offer so many different lovely exciting things. I had never heard of some of them. 
My dad got the Kung Pao Chicken dish because he's scared of trying new things, but he really loved it so that's good! 
My mom and I shared: 
prawn and bean curd cheung fun
scallop shui mai
steamed vegetable dumpling
mushroom spring roll with black truffle
king crab dumping
Everything we ate was very delicious. I had never tried cheung fun before but it was really interesting! It was a delicious prawn and bean curd filling in an incredibly crunchy layer with a pasta-like cover. Lots of textures and flavours. 
The spring roll was also a win because the truffle flavour was amaaaaazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetable dumpling just because it was nothing special, but for the most part everything was very delicious and the service was great. 
I even got to see the lady at the table next to me dump all of her ribs on her lap, wrap them in her napkins and put them in her purse! I suppose she's got a dog at home? Also, by the way, they don't offer take-away containers, in case you couldn't figure that out.",1
3,"I'll keep this one brief:
- Good selection of dim sum, but expensive.
- Great cocktails.
- Fast-paced, busy atmosphere.
On Sunday they do a £20 all-you-can-eat deal.",-1
5,"I love this place.  I hadn't been here in 3 years but it was just as enjoyable.  The design/atmosphere really can't be beat.  The cocktail list is exotic and everything I tried was good.  I loved the vegetarian dim sum platter, you get to try a little of everything.  I highly recommend the roasted silver cod with the champagne/honey sauce.  Yum!  Also got the tofu claypot which had a really good sauce.  Ok so things are overpriced but you're paying for the experience, which for me was worth it.",1
4,"Nice setting in a prime central London location - lots of hustle and bustle outside yet they were able to capture a very serene and tranquil dining atmosphere inside on both levels (really enjoyed the lower level by the extra long aquarium). The dining is ideal of those of us who are vegetarians as suitable dishes are marked with an appropriate 'v' and servers are quite knowledgeable with all ingredients. Super nice to find in a London restaurant - progress!!! The food itself is high quality, absolutely fresh and delicious. We ordered a sampling of dim sum which were absolutely gorgeous and artwork in and of itself. The main course entrees were very tasty and enjoyable. Loved the experience and I'd return for lunch or dinner any day! Well done.",1
5,"I went the first time and loved the drinks the little containers holding hair ties for women to keep their hair back as they slurped, etc. I just wasn't a huge fan of the ramen. I got the 22 hour pork one and the broth was so thick it was almost like pasta with lots of sauce. But I went back the next week and had a miso ramen with extra hard boiled egg. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It was delicious. The cocktails, I've tried mostly sake ones, are delectable. Definitely go, but talk to your waiter about what kind of ramen would be best for you. 
Fast and good service too.",1
5,"I have been to bone daddies more times than any other restaurant in London. Highly recommend the tonkotsu ramen, I have tried them all and keep going back to is one. Also the chicken wings are to die for, you will want to ask for a straw to drink the sauce. No complaints other than that one time I was there, my ramen was warm, not hot, but that only happened once. Recommend to go right when they open between 5:30 and 6:30, there will be no line. Amazing place, enjoy.",1
3,"I heard great reviews of Ping Pong from Londoners before visiting myself.
I think this place is pleasing because of the atmosphere.  There was special effort put into creating a modern ambiance for enjoying dim sum.  Regardless, I thought the food fell short.  
I ordered the vegetarian special menu.  It's a great value because I was extremely full for only about 12-13 pounds.  However, I wasn't in love with any of the 6-7 items I received.  Everything seemed to lack flavor or have an oddly mushy exterior.  Nothing tasted bad, but it there were no moments of culinary interest.  Also, things felt a little too commercialized with the open demonstration of pulling pre-made items out of a fridge and plopping them on the steamer.  Efficient, yes.  Appealing to showcase, no.
I think this place is great for a social gathering, where the focus is more on the company and less on the food.",-1
3,"I really wanted to love Dishoom...
I'd actually call it a 3.5, if I could. We tried to go at 5.30pm on a Wednesday, before a movie premiere, but were told there was a half an hour wait. We were told then too that you can make reservations up until 6pm so we decided to leave it and come back the next day, ahead of yet another movie premiere, with a reservation.
So the next day we turned up at 5pm and the place was busy but not full. Since it was so early for dinner, we just had a few things. We shared some lamb samosas, and I had paneer tikka, and my husband had chicken tikka. We also shared a garlic naan.
The samosas had a good taste, and went well with the lovely chutneys, but judging by the slight softness and the speed, they were not fried to order.
My paneer tikka was fine, but the paneer was a bit bland and the spice paste just didn't really stick to it well so it was mainly plain paneer. I love paneer so it wasn't a total lost cause, but it took a fair bit of the chili chutney to make it tasty. The bread was the highlight, fresh and just like we had in India. We spent most of our time watching the man making the bread at the tandoor, as we were sat next to it.
I didn't have any of the chicken tikka, as it was thigh meat and had skin - just not my thing.
It was pretty expensive for what we had - it came to around £30, with our drinks (a Limca and a Thums Up). I think I'll try it again, but I'm not running back.",-1
3,"A little wait time, hot and sour soup was pretty vinegary and steamed shrimp dumplings were missing some flavor but customer service was pretty good during bank holiday",-1
2,"Went to Ping Pong for dim sum with a couple of friends a few weeks ago, and I find their dim sum selection is as good as those offered in China Town. The prices are slightly more expensive than China Town, and the quality is about the same. I am not hugely impressed by the quality of food. However, on the positive side, you will be eating in a nicely decorated (contemporary) environment. Recommended if going with some friends whom you are trying to impress.",-1
4,"This is my other half's favourite haunt for roast duck. It's not hard to see why as their Bayswater branch is famous for it, they have won countless awards (and glued these to their window and walls, including newspaper clippings for you to read while you wait!)
A quick summary before we begin:- If you want tasty roast duck, come here. If you want excellent service to go with it, please look elsewhere because you will not find it here.
To elaborate, the roast duck is the juiciest duck you will ever taste. Sometimes it may be overly fatty but the fat is what makes it taste so good. The soya sauce that comes with it is really sweet and I can only imagine the amount of sugar that has gone into it. However, I cannot complain as I have a sweet tooth and generous helpings of this sauce with the roast duck makes me a happy bunny.
I usually get the roast duck for takeaway to eat at home, unfortunately the price has gone up recently, it's around £18.50 for a whole roast duck. If you are ordering takeaway please ignore the queue outside and just go straight to the till to order. 
Sometimes if you come really late in the night (I actually mean 9pm) they would have sold out of roast ducks. Have no fear, they opened another branch about 3 min walk away down the end of Gerrard Street, at Wardour Street. They usually have a few roast duck hanging up even though this branch has run out.
Onto the issue of service. Inevitably you will see a queue start forming here as early as 6pm. The restaurant is tiny and there are just too many people trying to eat here all the time that you end up freezing outside while you wait. If you do manage to get a table, you will get one of these two:- get ignored by the waiter for refills of drinks, or get hurried by the waiter to pay up and leave so they can sit someone else down. If you are lucky you will get both treatments!
Tip: maybe stick with takeaways and cook your own rice at home!",1
5,"During my trip to London, my friend took me to this place really raving about it. I don't enjoy eating Indian food outside very much because it's usually the same everywhere. But this place was pretty exceptional!
We went for dinner time, the line was very long and started from outside the building. Probably waited about 45 minutes to an hour in total. I got a beer from across the street to keep myself occupied while waiting. When you get a little closer to the entrance they offer you some small drinks- and brandy and juice (or lemonadeI forgot what). Once inside (which I had to chug my beer bc they wouldn't let me bring it in, but it's okay because the guy was a good sport about it), you wait more but you can order drinks. Their chai is phenomenal! I got the Bombay Pimms bc I thought it would be fun to try the whole East meets West thing. Anyways, that was good too! Surprisingly strong bc I remember feeling buzzed by the time I was done...
It's pretty dark inside and feels fancy like classic and rich. You would take someone on a date here to really impress them. Where we were seated, we could see them making all the naan, that was exciting for me. My friends and I (4 of us total) ordered probably 6 to 7 dishes and were stuffed after. I freaking adored the paneer naan. Yes you heard me...whatever chicken we ordered was my favorite as well. I found the shrimp to be too spicy for me (but I don't usually do very spicy).
Definitely glad we went here, we had a great meal and were able to just walk to nearby bars to enjoy the rest of our night in Shoreditch!",1
5,"I love the Shoreditch venue! Every. Single. Time.
The overall design of the space is engaging and beautiful, imbued with humor and delightful details.  
We finally went for brunch last weekend, after friends had stated (time and again!) that it was their favourite brunch in city. Once again the food impressed me. We all had the sausage & egg naan roll and shared the yogurt & granola.  Each were absolutely delicious!  Unfortunately they were out of chai when we ordered (really??!) but if you're lucky enough to order you do get unlimited refills. 
This is the same chai they graciously serve down the line while you stand for an hour (rain or shine) waiting for your table!*
I've been for dinner several times - and at both locations - and each visit has been a great experience.  No matter who I take with me, they enjoy it too.  The staff are adept at helping to construct a table menu that is well balanced; just point out what you have your heart set on and they'll recommend other dishes to complete the meal.  I particularly love the grilled paneer skewers.
*There is always a bit of a wait, so I recommend going during the week to avoid the worst of it. You can wait in the bar on weekend mornings when you simply have to endure the crowd to enjoy the brunch, since they stop serving at noon.",1
3,"Not bad. It's not too traditional, a bit of a modern twist to the snacks and chaat. Overall everything we ordered was good. 
If I come back then I would definitely eat downstairs at the restaurant. They have a cool bar area that you can sit at while you wait... drinks are good too.",-1
4,Great Place! Very nice people/waiters. Food and Cocktails are great! :D I keep going back for more,1
2,"Wow, so uppity and snobbish which might have been worth it IF I hadn't found a bone in my sea bass sashimi. In their defense, they did give me my dinner and a free dessert (ice cream filled mochi which were really inventive and good)! Still, been to sushi all around the world and have never experienced a bone before!! Overrated...",-1
3,"Love the atmosphere but im really not sure why it's so crowded! The food isn't really special, I prefer masala zone",-1
4,"Having made our reservation weeks in advance and from thousands of miles away, I had no idea what we were in for. Yauatcha wasn't what I expected. 
There are no trolleys delivering steamed dishes. What you DO get is the option to choose a dim sum pre fixe that leaves your palette dazzled. 
If your thing is variety, service, chic ambiance and umami for days, this is the place. 
I've deleted one star because there is a no take out policy that kept us from taking the abundant left overs home or to the homeless.",1
2,"Had samosas to start and the butter chicken with naan and raita for dinner.  We were excited after the samosas,  they were delicious.  But the chicken on the bone (it was actually the tandoori chicken) difficult to eat with the sauce. Oh, and the sauce, so greasy,  oil was floating on top. Our poor naan was overcooked.  Service was fine.",-1
4,"The place has a good vibe. Food is decent more authentic than other Indian restaurants in London. Butter chicken was really tender, chai was awesome, same goes for the pav bhaji. The samosas were bit of a let down but that's a minor gripe and the espresso more than made up for it.",1
2,"Service was great. So, it's sad to say, but it was two stars at best as a ramen joint.  Three stars as an izakaya-ish place.
Noodles of ""Tonkotsu Ramen"" were totally overlooked and broth was not even warm. (Sad ...) Plus, broth didn't have good thick flavor. I also tried ""Vegetarian Mushroom Ramen"" that my partner ordered; it was flavorless as if they were trying to make a flavor by just adding too much salt to mushroom dashi. ""Fried Chicken (Karaage)"" was delicious though.
Also it was VERY LOUD.  We were sitting next to each other, but we could barely hear each other.
This is the 4th ramen joints I've tried in London and the least favorite.  I'm glad I tried but would not go back.",-1
5,Dishoom was recommended to us by multiple different people. It was absolutely delicious! Decor and atmosphere were both wonderful. The food felt authentic with a little twist of fun. Will definitely be back!,1
4,"People come for the duck so get the duck. It's consistently rated as the best in London and we got the boneless Cantonese duck which was very tasty. Also had the pork belly, morning glory & a shrimp fried rice. Food was very good and service was what you would expect in any Chinese restaurant in the Western Hemisphere. The wait was about 30 minutes, which was reasonable.",1
1,"More like One Season.
I don't mind a grubby Chinatown restaurant, hell I don't even mind rude service as long as the food is good. But all of above combined left me fuming.
I visited Four Seasons on a busy Friday night with the missus and after a short wait we were seated. Not much to say about the interior or staff, so we promptly ordered our food.
Starters were brought out after the Mains. Our Roast Duck was tepid, and judging by the sauce that had dried on the plate it had clearly been sitting out far before we had arrived. When we explained that it was cold, they took it away and warmed it up in the microwave, my initial bite mark that returned with the dish proved this.
Terrible all around. Your better off ordering from your local Chinese takeaway.",-1
3,"My friend was sad. I decided to take her out to dinner to cheer her up. Problem was, I was also broke. But no matter - there was a great deal at Pizza Express. 
Unfortunately, my friend (of expensive taste and one never to miss out on an opportunity for free food) had already booked us into the Cinnamon Club. 'Don't worry,' she said, 'I've got a TopTable special!'. 
In order to qualify for this (2 courses with Bellini for £19 or 3 courses for £22) we had to be seated by 6.30. As I don't finish work until 6pm in North London, I duly arrived at 6.40, a giant ball of sweatiness and immediately felt intimidated by my 'rah' surroundings. It didn't help that as I sat down with my friend her first words were 'Ha! you look like a nurse.'
*yay*
The surroundings are beautiful - wood-panelled walls, a balcony dining area and crisp white table cloths. And quiet... Admittedly it was fairly early and therefore not too busy but you did feel awkward speaking at anything above a hushed whisper. 
Anyway, onto the important bit - the food! The Set Menu was limited - 3 choices for Starter, 3 for Main and 3 for pud. And it was a different Set Menu on their website from which I'd dribbled over earlier that day. I ordered the Grilled Plaice and Lamb Chops. Grilled Plaice was delicious, definitely more so than my friend's 'M&S' style tandoori chicken chunks. The Lamb chop was good although the portion was decidedly too little! My friend had the mullet which looked and tasted divine. The Bellini was most exquisite - it tasted of spice and exoticness.  I could have easily made my way through a pitcher. 
My only alarming moment was when the waiter snuck up on me until his face was pretty much 3 inches from mine and asked 'DESSERT?'. I almost punched him. 
All in all, the food was pretty tasty if a little on the small side, the atmosphere was rather hushed, and it was pretty expensive, even with our TopTable offer. An additional glass of wine and side dish bumped up our bill by £20. I'd go again, just as long as someone else was paying! For me, it's def a special occasion visit.",-1
4,"Crispy aromatic duck was amazing!  Loved the decor, food and vibe of this very crowded restaurant.  The staff had a bit of a problem with our order for a wine flight but eventually got it to us with an extra glass to make up for the wait.  The wines were all top notch.  Would recommend this restaurant.",1
3,"Had lunch with my husband at Punjab today...
Ambiance was nice enough and the restaurant was about 1/3 full on a Wednesday afternoon at 2pm.
Service isn't friendly AT ALL ... not sure why? 
Food was pretty good but the biggest problem was that the spice level was pretty intense. If my mouth hadn't been on fire the whole time I was eating I surely would have enjoyed the chole, the bhindi, and the aloo gobi much more. The rice and naan were good (no spice obviously).
Prices are quite reasonable.
Overall I just wish the food wasn't so spicy! If we could somehow get mild food we'd definitely return.",-1
5,Quite simply the best value for money Chinese in London's Chinatown. Superb quality.. Sorry Shell Crab starter is truly brilliant.,1
3,Good dim sum. Decadent desserts. Excellent service. Pricey.,-1
1,"I just want to say, WHAT?!
This place is bad, and not the kind of super-cheap-chinese-restaurant-bad, it is just plain bad. The interior and decoration is disgusting, everything is old and covered in dust. The table I sat at was slanting so much that I felt sea-sick, it was slanting so much that it felt like I was in some kind of fun house at Disney land. But the worst part was that they did all the dishes behind me, yes right over my shoulder. The sound of plastic dishes clashing together was not pleasant at all. And when I thought it couldn't get worse, I saw the waitress drop and pick up clean dish from the dirty floor and put it back on the ""clean"" pile again.
And then again when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I got the most grumpy and angry looking waiter in the world, the only thing he said throughout my experience was ""what do you want"" and ""thank you"" (when we paid). Everything was rushed, the food came out fast but so did the check.
The food was very bland/bad, everything was off, the char siu I ordered tasted like hot dog! But hey! the famous duck tasted OKAY!
I do not recommend this place at all!",-1
3,"This ramen place used to be one of the best in London.  However, it has now been surpassed by Japanese branches especially Kanada-Ya.  I would say Ippudo is the second best.  Bone Daddies has a very hipster vibe in there where you can order sake and sit for a long time in there and no one would chase you away.  Whereas in a real ramen place, you are expected to eat and leave straight away.  The queue here used to be really long and I remembered queuing just to get in here.  
The noodle here is not up to my liking.  They are probably the thicker and they cooked it for too long so they are not springy enough.  The broth here is also diluted with no depth of flavour.  I won't be back unfortunately after I have found the other 2.",-1
5,"I am a NYC foodie on ""holiday"" in London 
Went here with my son on recommendation by a friend in NYC we ordered many dishes to try and share... loved all of it especially the mattar paneer and samosas 
Tried the Gola ice dessert and was pleasantly surprised 
We are definitely returning to this place when we return to London 
Also love the fact that is located in Shoreditch!",1
5,"One of my favourite restaurants in london. 
The first time we went we were fortunate enough to be sat in the conversatory, which is very beautiful and definitely got me some brownie points with the girlfriend!
 Unfortunately not managed to get a seat there since but the food and service is excellent whichever partf the restaurant you end up being sat in.
Throughly recommend and always visit when its a special occasion.",1
3,"Substandard ramen. I don't know why everyone praises it. It actually takes a while for the food to come out-- what is up with that. 
Some of the appetizers are quite good though. 
The stools are uncomfortable-- beware.",-1
5,"Yauatcha, part of Alan Yau's growing restaurant empire, is an ultra hip tea house and dim sum eatery. It is my favorite place for dim sum and drinks. The stunning interior reminds me of something out of Tokyo. Upstairs contains a cozy, relaxed environment to enjoy with friends and a pastry counter which has some of the best sweets ever as well as teas, candles, and other treats. Downstairs is dimly lit with the kitchen overlooking the crowded space, best for an intimate dinner. I dream about Yauatcha's dumplings, pork buns, and desserts. You will to after trying this Soho hot spot.",1
4,"Pingpong is a personal favourite and All you can eat Sumday is a treat! You really have to eat a lot to make it worth while financially, but that is just the kind of justification that let's you say ""we'll take one of everything!"". Great location for exploring Southbank",1
4,"As others have mentioned, service was a bit disappointing at times but the food was good enough that we left feeling satisfied. Will likely not be back but no regrets",1
4,Came here for a team dinner when we were visiting from the states and the food was really good. They were able to seat our large party all together and serve us quickly. They have food options for vegetarians and can also accommodate other dietary restrictions.,1
4,"Clos is beautiful and romantic, maybe the ambience is a littel bit too hushed if you were going with a big group of people for a birthday as we were, but if you're a couple who want to stare into each others eyes then it's perfect! Service was the perfect level of unobtrusive and the maitre d dealt brilliantly with a request for a wine from ahem the less expensive regions of the list! I also think the sunday prix fixe menu is fantastic value. Consideing that they are in Covent Garden one of the most tourist trappy places on earth and could churn out rubbish they really don't need to be this good.",1
5,"If you're looking for a romantic, quiet, and intimate place: go to Clos Maggiore in Covent Garden.
I went for my first time (but definitely not my last time) last week.  I highly suggest the prix fixe menu, I had foie gras and egg bread, grillled cod with vermicelli noodles, and an apple crumble with creme anglaise.
In addition, if you're mad about wine, this place is perfect for you. The wine list literally goes on for days.
Really nice atmosphere and impeccable service. Well worth the money!",1
3,"I know, I know. It's Londoners' official favourite restaurant and yet, only three stars from me? Who do I think I am to contest the opinion of the masses eh?
Well, to be honest, I just didn't find the food to be quite up to speed. The cocktails were fabulous, and so is the decoration (those mirrors!!), the staff was lovely and pudding was quite wonderful, but the rest could simply have been better. 
It was mainly lacking the balance and complexity of flavour I was expecting from such a high reputation restaurant. 
... So as far as I'm concerned, the quest for London's best Indian restaurant is still on!
(I still have to try Dishoom's breakfast, which I've only heard good things about though... i'll keep you posted)",-1
3,"I don't eat pork and presume their tonkatsu is their signature ramen, but their wafu chicken ramen isn't great.  The stock is ok, albeit a bit unappetizing in hue, and the chicken karaage is passable at best.  Kaarage is meant to be marinated, typically chicken thigh and coated in a thin dusting of potato starch or flour; theirs is chicken breast and in a tempura type batter which does not suit being submerged in soup whatsoever.  
Overall a dish not worth spending money on - if they're going to offer a chicken ramen they should at least make a chicken bone broth like Bone Daddies; regurgitating the vegetarian soup and adding chicken seems like a cop-out.",-1
4,"Authentic Chinese food. You know it's going to be good when the restaurant is full and the menu has squiggly characters (that I can't read) as well as English. I somehow decided that something different would be a representative choice and rather than stick with something I knew, like Singapore Noodles or King Prawns, I stepped (more like leaped) outside of my comfort zone and ordered the steamed eel in black bean sauce. I still shake my head because I have no idea what I was thinking. I know I like the eel sushi, so how different could it be?
I have no doubt that it was good, for being eel. It was served extremely hot and after a few minutes of waiting for it to cool down, I picked up a slice with the chopsticks. Do you eat the skin? Oh, there's bone in there too. It was messy. It was... interesting. It was... odd. Would I have it again? I think I can safely say I would have something else, though I would absolutely return to the Wong Kei. But I'll stick with what I know next time!
Service seemed decent. No one was rude or short with me. I wasn't rushed at all. My tea was refilled without prompting.",1
5,"I often find myself disappointed by well recommended restaurants, and with Dishoom being given top spot for Yelp's best 100 restaurants based on people reviews, the expectations were high! 
It did not disappoint. We sat in the veranda which had amazing decor, giving the feel of street side markets in India. We selected about 9 things between 4 of us, including their signature 'Black Daal' (divine) and an array of grills, and paneer dishes. The flavours were excellent and the meat succulent. The only thing I love more than a great meal, is several great meals in one. We arrived early as you can't book and got a table no problem, but just 20 minutes later (7pm) there was a queue forming and this was a Tuesday night! The street food style of this place makes it different from the standard curry houses, and the waiting staff were excellent and super friendly. They also brought us some amazing passion fruit martini shots as it was my boyfriends birthday, and a free desert! When can I come back?",1
3,"Excellent food, abysmal service.
Yauatcha is an upscale Chinese place with a very long menu.  Virtually everything we ordered tasted great, but the portions were small.  We had a table of four and most dishes came with two or three bites, maximum.
The biggest hit at the table was the kung pao chicken.  Everybody loved that.
This place is very fancy, but our servers disappeared for long stretches of time.  We might have ordered more if we could have tracked them down.
With drinks, expect to drop $60-$70 per person.",-1
4,Not a dim sum expert by any count; got the the midday tasting special; liked it all. Great presentation and good food. Great deal.,1
5,"Indian restaurant in Shoreditch center!
Bombay style interiors and corresponding menu that takes excellent score in everything; friendly staff, tasty food (tried brunch and loved it!), nice prices.
Don't just turn up - the queue is quite long all the time. Instead, book your table through their online system in advance.",1
4,"Wong Kei (or 'wonky's) was a firm favourite when I was studying in London. Wong Kei makes its money by selling decent Chinese food at an electric pace. They can have you in, fed and out in under half hour but the experience is not to be missed.
There are a lot of horror stories about how food the service can be but it's more clinically efficient than out and out rude. You are told where to sit, you might be sat with a stranger, there is little banter with the waiting staff but the quick turnover, the meeting with strangers and the cheap, quality food make for a great experience. Enjoy.",1
5,"Great atmosphere, very good service, and excellent food.  The chicken ruby is awesome.",1
2,"I went to Nobu with a coworker and was looking forward to an excellent dinner. To start with, the restaurant is very posh, everyone looks better than you, but at least its dark so you can't quite be sure. I really do like the vibe and the music playing during dinner.
We decided to get a few sushi dishes (both nigiri and rolls), some cooked dishes (some tempura calamari, some sort of lobster, etc) and overall the food was just ok. I am from San Francisco and believe we have fresher tasting fish in the bay area.
If you plan on going, I would suggest to stick to a variety and ask for waiter recommendations (though ours, to be frank, was not very good at suggestions). Overall, if you remove the ambiance and good looking folks, this place is just mediocre, and I would have to say all hype.",-1
4,"Been to Hakkasan only twice in my life. The first time (mid-2004) was shocking, mediocre food, poor servicereally did not intend to go back. Having revisited the restaurant during late August 2008, I'm in a totally different space. What a place! I've eaten in a host on Michelin* places in Europe and the USand this meal was excellent. Sesame prawn toasts, crispy duck salad, hot & sour soup, duck spring rolls, topped off with a couple of bottles of Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir. Excellent. We'll be back.",1
4,BBQ pork on rice is still very good at this fast food chinese restaurant.  I love the vibrant atmosphere of Wong Kei and the smells.  Still good for cheap chinese food after all these years.  Not sure how long it has been there but I know it's a long time.,1
5,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS AND WONDERING IF YOU SHOULD WAIT IN LINE, WAIT IN LINE!!
Y'all. It's a serious wait. Ours was at least 40 minutes outside followed by another ~20 at the bar. I can't lie that that's a long time. But it is SO worth it. We got there around 8:30 and were leaving the joint at 10:30.
Things not to miss: 
black daal: eat it with a spoon, sop it up with naan, baste it on everything. I don't care.
chicken tikka: so tender, so juicy.
toddy tapper: this drink was lit on fire. I repeat: lit on FIRE.",1
4,"Modern, expensive, but exquisite.  You could easily drop a few quid here without blinking, so choose carefully.  Everything we ordered was excellent.  Not your normal dim sum restaurant, so if you're expecting large helpings of cheap, greasy Chinese food served on carts by old Chinese women that don't speak any English try somewhere else.",1
3,"I enjoyed visiting Le Mercury, the food was good and reasonably priced and the atmosphere was great. We were a party of 22 and they were able to accommodate us. The service was very good, if a little slow when it came to billing us which then meant the Manager tried to kick us out, saying we were delaying his restaurant when we were all attempting to pay and had been trying to for a good 15 minutes. 
I would probably come back here again, just not in such a large party.",-1
4,"Turn the lights down low enough and everyone in the restaurant looks beautiful and mysterious.  The lighting here is dark, but to be honest, the strategically-placed spotlights work well.  And it all adds to the atmosphere, which is most of what this cool restaurant is about.  The food was a bit pricey for what it was, but it was also unique and memorable, as well.",1
5,"We got a table under the blossom, near the fire, in the conservatory. It was just beautiful and so romantic as a setting.
 We had the tasting menu and it was very good. Interesting mix of flavours and textures, everything very well executed.
 The sommelier was brilliant and found us a brilliant wine in our budget.
 Service was attentive without being over-familiar.
 A really lovely night.",1
1,"After hearing so much hype about this place finally tried it out on our visit to London.  The most horrible food I had ever tasted.  Was totally disappointed with the menu.  We waited one hour and half to get a table.  It was way too noisy.  As we were sitting down the waiter was telling us what the kitchen currently cannot make.  Due to them changing the oil he had said no fried food, and he will let us know when the kitchen will start serving it.  He never came back to let us know.  After looking at the other tables getting fried food I asked our waiter who said he will check the kitchen to see if I can order Vada pav. There were couple of things the waiter mentioned that could not served. Wish they had told us this while we were waiting.  There was nothing special about the food at all. Everything was a bit too sour for my liking.",-1
3,"This place has a Michelin star?  Ha thats freakin funny.  I wonder if people really understand Chinese food.  I've had a lot of Chinese food in some of the most heavily populated immigrant communities and across several continents.  This is not even the best Chinese food I've had in UK.  The food isn't bad but worthy of Michelin star.  Pretty funny is you ask me.  This place is gorgeous and the layout is absolutely gorgeous as far as restaurants go, especially for Chinese.  The macaroon display at the front is beautiful but I didn't especially like them, a bit too sweet for my liking.  The other reaon why I think I didn't enjoy the meal as much was the price tag for dim sum.  It was on the corporate card so I shouldn't care but it's the principle damnit.  
Food was good with a bunch of hit and misses among the bunch.  The har gow was nice, well made, good texture to the wrapper.  Har gow was ok.  Some of the other shrimp dumplings we had were also very nice.  I also enjoyed the duck rolls.  There were definitely some low points with the noodle and meat dishes.  Did any of the people who reviewed the restaurant actually review based on food or the fact that this place is Michelin rated or that the space is stunning?  Come on people let's do better.  This is not a 5 star restaurant, maybe 4 if you order smartly and get their good dishes.",-1
5,"Restaurant Yauatcha
What a treat that you can find so many great asian food places in london!
In the well known busy theatre and restaurant area Soho, there is for instance Yauatcha, from the same owner as the very famous restaurant Hakkasan. If you make a reservation and that is quiet necessary, ask for a table downstairs and then preferably for table 21( for 2 persons), table 16 or 20(both for 6 to 8 persons). From these tables you have a lovely view into the kitchen. Start your evening at the bar and try out one of their delicious cocktails. We, as non alcohol drinkers, tried the lime-cucumber-yasmin ice tea. Devine drink.
From the dinning menu we tried and shared the following dishes; lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar, spinach ball with prawn and cuttlefish, steamed king crab roll, fried chili squid, crispy duck roll, hot&sour soup with trumpet mushrooms and our absolute favorite of the evening ; spicy aubergine with sato beans, okra and french beans with peanut. What a treat! And last but not least, the deserts are finger licking good. You can also go there for lunch or make a reservation for their outstanding high tea.",1
5,"I enjoyed our visit to Ping Pong and would definitely stop back for some dim sum!  I'm kind of curious why they chose the name Ping Pong, but I won't lose any sleep over it!  Just remember this:  Dim sum is not an arithmetic calculation gone wrong, its the name of steamed, bite-sized, Chinese dishes with a variety of selection to please any palate. 
The pre-selected order had a nice variety, but the server also recommended the beef and kimchi dumplings. This was by far my favorite dish of the evening!  The perfectly seared dumplings might as well have been little fireworks exploding with flavors in my mouth. There was the right amount of spice, heat, and flavor to make my tastebuds smile like the Cheshire Cat. 
I fell in love with the decor, but I'm a sucker for koi. If I lived in London I'm sure you'd find me here regularly... I can't wait to come back.",1
5,"Hakkasan is one of those places that just has ""IT.""  It is kind of hidden down an alleyway off the main road.  A woman at the door checks your name and then sends you in and down the stairs.  There is a little bit of smoke and incense on the walk down and it just adds to the aura.  
You are met downstairs by a hostess who checks your coat, and if the table isn't ready, escorts you to the bar.  We only waited a few minutes before our table was ready and we were seated.  Our server took our drink orders and got us on our way.
The menu is huge.  Really huge.  We decided our best bet was to order several small items and get a broader taste of what Hakkasan has to offer.
We went with the Supreme Dim Sum Platter, Crispy Duck Roll, Morel Mushroom and Vegetable Spring Roll, and the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs.  
The Supreme Dim Sum Platter is amazing.  The presentation was outstanding.  The platter came with eight dumplings total.  It consisted of two each of the following: gold leaf lychee and lobster, abalone and chicken shumai with caviar, Royal King Crab jade, and black truffle and Dover sole.  I wish I could do the taste of the these dumplings justice with my words but I just don't possess the vocabulary.  It was flat out absolutely delicious.  
The duck roll, spring roll, and pork ribs were also extremely tasty.  You can't go wrong with any of these orders.
The place is a bit loud so be prepared to speak up and have an amazing experience at Hakkasan!",1
3,"Better tasting than Bone Daddies but really expensive for what you get. And the seating wasn't as comfortable or as inviting as Bone Daddies. And there was no super awesome cocktail menu either.
First impressions were great - 98% Japanese diners. Felt like I was in Tokyo again.
One neat aspect of this 24-seater restaurant is the way they handle their queue of customers. There are two benches outside of the restaurant, positioned end-to-end to create one long bench. If you see people sitting on the bench, then there is a queue, so follow these guidelines to join and ""work"" the queue: People seated on the bench closest to the door are at the front of the queue and people seated furthest away from the door are at the end of queue. As people from the front of the queue are seated in the restaurant, everyone on the bench slides down toward the door. Don't bother asking the hostess for available tables, just get in the queue.
Secondary impressions were good - diners seemed to be enjoying themselves slurping their bowls and such.
Tertiary impressions were just OK - I found £11.50 for a bowl of Moyashi Ramen a bit too expensive. On a good day, the bowl was worth £8. Why? The lack of pork. There were three small and thin slices, possibly an ounce in total weight. A shame, really.
The broth was good and the noodles were cooked perfectly (forgo ordering Kaedama (an extra portion of noodles) as you likely won't need any. I found there to be too many noodles in my bowl for my liking. 
There were a few condiments on the table, none of which included fresh garlic which was a huge disappointment. I've never eaten ramen without fresh garlic and loads of it.
Service was prompt and attentive, our server even kindly provided me with a fork so I didn't have to whip out my BYOF as I did whilst eating my way through Japan.
Overall, just OK ramen that overpriced.",-1
4,"Ling Ling @ Hakkasan is the bar of the famous Chinese restaurant Hakkasan. The bar is really good with a mix drinks including cocktails and special chinese drinks, they are prepared in front of you which is cool and the atmosphere is great in there. This place is perfect to have a drink before the supper in the Hakkasan or just to have a chilling out session in.",1
4,"Highly recommend this restaurant for your Ramen fix if you're near SOHO. It offers a nice selection of ramen options, with new 'daily specials.' 
Fried Chicken 7/10 (tasty, well seasoned)
Edamame 7/10 (great starter, quite small)
IP Tonkotsu Ramen + egg 8/10 (very flavorful & filling)
Assorted Mochi 9/10 (favorite was sesame & chocolate)
Make sure to arrive before 7pm to avoid the long lines!",1
4,"Chinese cuisine at its best, amazing decor, quite unique! contributes to the special feeling , the anticipation that this restaurant creates.
The tastes, the smells, all wonderful and lingering long after you leave.
Fantastic and delicious!",1
3,Discovered the place only last week. Sushi was excellent quality and my girlfriend was in love with the dessert. Very chic atmosphere. Great for once in a month treat.,-1
1,"I have been in food service now for 33 years.  I have eaten at many Indian restaurants in five countries and numerous states.
It was a Tuesday night around eight and the place was busy.  The prices on the menu included a $130 tasting menu and main courses as much as $50.  Starters began at $18.  I am translating to US dollars @1.4 to 1 pound.
1.  The first thing to arrive at my table was a Mango Lassi.  It was a very small drink for $10 and came with a soapy aftertaste.  
2.  The garlic naan was cooked incorrectly TWICE, something that even children in India are tasked with.  To make matters worse, the first attempt was served after it cooled(see #3). The tandoori oven was too hot causing it to not rise correctly while cooking... In India I saw a monkey that was in charge of a tandoori bread oven, so can you imagine how easy it should be.
3.  I had an asparagus starter that was sent to the table after it lost its temperature.  The flavor profile was nice, despite it's delayed delivery.
4.  I chose the butter chicken for a main course since there were only three or four meat options, while most Indian restaurants of at least fifteen different options.  It was an over cooked breast without enough sauce to accompany it.
5.  Dessert, not a chance after that train wreck.
In summary, this is a businessperson's(tourist) environment in a nice building with fancy table cloths.  Selling alcohol is CLEARLY the priority.  Service was horrible relative to the price.  My server had no support staff and that is insane for the amount they are charging.
I later learned of a place call Brick Lane(?) where locals go to get REAL Indian food.",-1
4,"We ran the gamut here, family style...
Scallop Shui Mai - 'Mai' favorite. 
Steamed Halibut - Spicy, juicy, tasty...triple threat, baby!
Crispy Duck - All its 'quacked' up to be!  Perfectly fried and rice pancakes were great.
Chilli Squid - Hot tentacles coming through!
Soft Shell Crab - Such a softy.
Gai Lan w/ Ginger - Yum! 
All of it was good. I don't have anything negative to say about this place. It was buzzin' with excitement and although really busy the wait staff was always right on time. The atmosphere is relaxed and pleasing to the eye...a WIN in my humble opinion.",1
3,"So I went to London and was offered a free place to stay by my friends who were working there. Everything in London is expensive. They say Tokyo is worse, but definitely not when I was there. Every time I bought anything it was like I was getting hit by a football in the groin. Even McDonald's was expensive. Now the exchange rate is much better at least.
Apart for the UK pricing, this was a really good restaurant. All the food we had was excellent, and they made some interesting cocktails as well. I definitely liked all the fish tanks. All the decor was well done. We had made reservations so there was no wait. There were some people waiting though who had not.
After all was said and done it came out to be about $80 a person. Of course my friend I was traveling with and I paid for the two friends who we were staying with so it became a cinder block to the groin night, and not in a good way.",-1
5,"Great place to go for lunch with a girlfriend. Delicious dim sum - little Chinese parcels of yummyness which come with a selection of dips. Good quality but reasonably priced. Our bill was 15 pounds each with drinks included. The interior is modern and stylish, the service brisk and efficient. Do try the sweetcorn and coriander parcels, they are truly delicious. Oh and the lemon vanilla vodka cocktails helped wash it all down very nicely. Highly recommended.",1
4,"Perhaps the only place where you go to eat *because* of the bad attitude and rudeness of the staff.  Actually, that might be part of the charm initially but we keep coming back because we love the no-fuss food and the great prices.
The actual building might be related to a tardis because it appears to never end. On various visits we have been sat, down down stairs, in the middle bit, in the weirdly more upmarket upstairs bit and now and then in this weird 'down the hallway' bit that takes so long to walk to I think we were actually in Leicester Square by the time we reached our table.
More often than not, we order the same set meal for two because it is such a good value (under £8 per person) and because we love everything they serve as part of it. It is served family style and comes with sweet and sour pork, steamed Chinese vegetables, black bean beef ,chicken with mushrooms and a large amount of white rice.. We agree that their sweet and sour pork is the best we have had anywhere. 
Don't get me wrong, Wong Kei's is the 'greasy cafe' variety of Chinese food but since I am a non-flashy type of gal that works great for me. I love the little quirks like the waiters being just the right side of rude, the cheap plastic plates and the luminous pots of chilli sauce that are always sitting on the table.
It is wise to have some competence with chopsticks if you eat here but I am sure the waiters that do speak a bit of English would have no problem humiliating you a bit as they found you a fork.",1
2,"Really?  this place is way over hyped!  How in the world do you drop so much money on such little food.  Especially when right around the block there is better dim sum and 1/3 the price! 
I really think its just people saying look at this posh place and watch me drop my life savings down the poop shoot.  It was good but my wallet is much much thinner after the meal than before.  
I say go there if your money is buring holes in your pockets.",-1
5,"Everything we ordered were excellent! 
You must not miss the Dim Sum. The corn soup was fantastic.",1
4,"I loved this place. First time I've seen an Indian fusion concept done on a large scale for sit-down restaurants. The restaurant is meant to imitate and maintain ""dying breed of Bombay cafés."" 
From walking in, the decor and set up was very reminiscent of that in India. From the ambiance to the furniture, signs for café rules, and the silverware; the environment was very well considered.
The menu itself had many items that included traditional Indian/Bombay cuisine as well as fusion dishes. I tried the Lamb Raan, which included a sandwich with minced lamb, veges and chutneys; Bombay cole slaw; and salty snacks on the side. The flavor was not the best I've had for Indian, but the execution was very strong and well presented. The Bombay cole slaw was surprisingly good, seeming to be made with masala powder in the standard recipe. The Chaijito (mojito with chai syrup and ginger) was pretty good as well.
The best was the chai at the end, made authentically. Will definitely be returning to try more of the menh when back in London!",1
2,"I have a dear friend in London who recommended this place, as I walked in I thought this could be a big mistake but I took the plunge....OMG this was horrible .. Not for localvores aka organic eaters.... I fear I will regret this later!
My stomach went upside down with the tea, I knew I was in the wrong place for my tastes....cheap food and boy you can taste it.
I made it through the night, .. This place is well worth the experience, cheap Chinese.. Gotta  love it. The fried chicken is so salty and pressed dry like a salt dish bomb #195 ... The sweet n sour pork # 79 or 78 was boney like waitress said would be ... Quite tasty but pineapple was so canned, I knew if I did not stop I would not do well later. Would not trade the memory or experience for the world, total must do at least  once. Thanks Abigal....",-1
3,"Nobu is a reputable brand known for it's quality foods and elegance worldwide, however Nobu London has fallen short in delivering the same quality found in it's American counterpart.
I've been told not all Nobu's are the same, especially if you've eaten at their New York or Los Angeles restaurant you'll most likely be disappointed. Location is good, situated in the posh parts of London Old Park Lane, Mayfair. Decor was mediocre; not their usual modern-ellegant 5-star themed interior design. Since it wasn't busy when we went service was good, prompt, & a bit over staffed. Food was reasonable for England, fresh, tasty and it really is the best Japanese food restaurant around just don't go comparing it to the US. 
Note: Unless you have money to spend (£70-100 per person) or familiar with the Nobu brand then I wouldn't recommend it value for money.",-1
1,"I went here three times; first because I wanted to check out what the hype was all about. Second and third time because I kept reading reviews about how good it is, so I figured maybe I ordered the wrong thing?
I still remain disappointed. To me the broth tastes very one dimensional- donkotsu was super greasy and creamy (like cream of mushroom consistency, or for Americans, thanksgiving gravy consistency!!) but did not have multiple layers of tastes (the way the broth does at Ippudo New York for example, or the many ramen places in Tokyo.) same for miso and shoyu ramens. They make such a big deal of the fact that they ""stew the donkotsu for 20 hours"" but what's the point if all you can taste is pork fat?! I had to sprinkle 4-5 teaspoons of hot chili oil to make it more palatable (and I don't normally like spicy food) but even the red chili oil/sauce had no kick at all. (I am now thinking that maybe I should have ordered the spicy miso...) 
They are also super stingy with the toppings and the amount of noodles. I ordered some additional nori and they gave me 2 small sheets the size of half of my palm! (And turns out the the original doesn't even come with nori to begin with...) the amount of noodles was so small, I couldn't help but wonder how guys bigger than me could possibly be satisfied with just one bowl of ramen? The noodles do not have a good texture. They are almost somen-like. And I still ended up paying 12.60 pounds for it..which I guess is a good deal for a sit-down meal in central London.. But still. (And as a side note, what's with this custom of automatically including service charge on the listed price?  It's not a huge difference, but I find this slightly annoying since it feels like some sort of gimmick to charge you more without making you realize it.
Back to the ramen: I have come across ramen places of this style in Tokyo too (super greasy but one dimensional broth) and I didn't like it there either, so maybe it's a matter of taste. But a part of me is thinking that if I am the only asian-looking person there all three times I went, it's not particularly a good sign... I don't think I will come back; I much prefer shoryu and I am still having a hard time understanding what all the hype is about this place.",-1
2,"I was very excited to try this restaurant, but was unfortunately let down.  I was personally not a fan of the restaurant's setup.  The chairs that we sat in were uncomfortable and really low to the ground, and the tables were so close to each other that any movement to the side results in you rubbing against the person sitting next to you.  The service also leaves much to be desired; it was really slow, and it took forever to get a waiter's attention.
Some of the dishes we got were pretty good.  The pork and prawn shui mai and the prawn and beancurd cheung fun were our two favorites, and we really enjoyed them.  The crispy duck roll was pretty mediocre; you could get something better at other dim sum restaurants.  When we ordered the chicken cheung fun, however, the dish came out very soggy and the chicken was really bland and dry.  The edamame truffle dumpling had a weirdly crunchy texture, and the flavors didn't blend well at all.
I probably would've given this restaurant a 3-star rating if it did not have a Michelin star and was less pricey.  I don't think that the restaurant is worth the star or the price, and would not go back here.",-1
4,Very good steamed dim sum although I was not a fan of the fried or the puffs. Too much pastry for my liking. Trendy restaurant though with fish tanks everywhere. Nice setting and definitely good value for money. I will be back.,1
2,"I've only eaten here once - and I don't even remember the name of the dish I ordered.  It was one of the recommended ones, and it was good.
However nowhere near as good as how much it cost.  Maybe 3 quid is standard in London for a plate of plain white rice, but this meal was only marginally better than what I normally pay half as much for.",-1
3,"Disappointed. This is a great brand and the Honolulu location blew me away twice last year. It could be the crowd, the new staff or both. The food is fine, but the service has slipped a bit and it's not because of lack of people. There were plenty of them standing around.  It just doesn't have the energy it used to or of the other locations. Nobu, this one needs some attention.",-1
3,Overpriced but delicious 'modern' dim sum - there are plenty of great dim sum places in london so i would suggest giving this place a miss.,-1
3,"Food Hunting goes to Roti Chai
After a very long week at work and university all we could think about is when we are going to get our next bite of scrumptious gol gappes and bhel puri.
Determine to try a new restaurant we hunted down Roti Chai, which we now call ""Our little box of Indian heaven"". It's located behind Selfridges making it easy to access and very convenient.
Roti Chai has two floors; the ground floor is called ""The Indian Kitchen"" where you get all the yummy Indian street food, set in a very colourful quirky yet incredibly retro Indian décor and downstairs is more of a sophisticated ""Dinning Room"" with dim lights with beautiful table arrangements.

5,"Since there were mixed reviews on the duck by yelpers from HK and LA, we just asked them if they could make ""fire duck rice noodle"" instead. It's a good bowl of noodles when it's cold outside and you had enough of ""ghost people"" food and want some ""people eat gei food."" The soup is a bit heavy with star anise so be prepared. 
We also ordered the ""pig stomach chicken pot."" This hotpot was very heavy with white pepper so be prepared your throat will burn. It's a good dish for the cold winter though. 
Also, this place was crowded with tourists so we went to the modern looking one next door which bears the same name and serves the same duck. Much more quiet and better service there.",1
3,"I wanted to like this place, i really did!  I became a huge fan of ramen whilst living in NYC where people queue for blocks to get into some of the best ramen houses...but bone daddies just didn't cut it for me.
I went on Saturday and had the tantanmen ramen, as i was in the mood for something spicy.  However, the chicken stock combined with the seaseme oil and crushed peanuts gave this a strange aftertaste that lingered long after i had left the restaurant..
Thinking i had made the wrong menu choice, i went back today and had the only ramen with pork broth. The Tonkotsu Ramen is the benchmark upon which all good ramen should be judged!  Again the broth, although very thick and velvety, lacked any real complexity. Further the addition of what seemed like sweet soy sauce, gave this ramen a strange unfamiliar taste.  Even the ramen noodles themselves miss that delicate nutty taste you get from a great freshly made ramen.
Although this place is lacking authenticity, this is still not a bad place to go for some winter warming soup.",-1
5,"When I was posted in London for 6 weeks, this became my favorite go-to lunch spot. If you told me that my favorite lunch place in London would be a ramen shop, I could've (rightfully so) called you a maniac. This place pleasantly surprised me though. Whenever I went I always got Tonkotsu Ramen, since who needs anything else? One time my coworkers got some appetizers which were pretty good too but let's face it: you're here for the ramen. Having been to Japan and living in the bay area, I feel lucky to have tried so many good ramen places and Bone Daddies is up there--maybe even better than most in SF. The broth is excellent, the meat was cooked just right and the portion size is perfect for a quick but filling meal. The price for a bowl is a little expensive, but hey, it's London and luckily for me, I was reimbursed me for my meals.
If I'm ever back in town you know where I'll be for lunch.",1
2,"I don't get it at all. This is not how I like my dim sum: unauthentic and overpriced dim sum served in a dark basement (we were downstairs) by unhappy waitstaff that know little or nothing about the food. 
The chicken feet were way too sweet and the pork ribs sour ($@%!), both of these staples of any dim sum meal. The jook (porridge) was okay, but nothing to write home about, as were the rest of the dishes, including the French macarons, which is supposedly one of the features that sets this place apart.
In sum: food bad, service bad, atmosphere not great. The only nice part of the night was the fish tank. It was pretty.
The Michelin folks need to be a lot more choosy in disbursing those stars.",-1
1,"Incompetent. Made a reservation for 7 people at 9:15pm. Had a long conversation, the man took the booking, wrote down my phone number and wrote down my name (even asked me to spell it). 
When we arrived, the man acted like we never made the reservation while my party of 7 waited outside. They claimed they dont make reservations. Complete utter disregard for us. Yelled at and everything. Avoid just to not support this business.",-1
4,"Yauatcha does the most fantastic generous afternoon teas. I highly recommend ordering one to share between two as an alternative to late lunch. They always serve a small selection of dim sum (including venison steamed buns which they are famous for), along with demi versions of their cakes, macaroons and truly wonderful scones. Quite often I taken friends there on a Saturday at about 3 for a late lunch. I usually order a couple of other plates of dimsum and then share the tea. Otherwise, if you haven't tried it, the cactus lime truffles are heavenly.",1
5,"UH-MAZING. Crazy expensive, but fantastic ambiance, delicious food and friendly, kind and attentive waitstaff.
A+'s all around.
Order the Hakka or Lychee martini; they're both delicious. The roasted duck pumpkin puff, Jasmine tea smoked ribs and crispy aromatic duck are all delectable.
Also, just realized that once you think ""Yauatcha"" is ""Yamcha"" from DBZ, it's impossible not to see it. Possibly worth a bonus star for nostalgia.",1
3,"Ping pong is a definite must. 
The atmosphere and feel is just great, as is the food. 
Must have's: 
Chicken puff 
Chicken and peanut 
Spicey chicken 
Crab claw 
Anything with prawns 
Ask for some dipping sauce. They really compliment the dim sum. 
Menu does change, so beware it may not all be on there. 
Selection of wine and beer is good. Their cocktails are heavenly! 
The reason I have given it a 3 and not higher is because of the consistently poor service and the over pricing.  Food is def a 4.5, if not a 5.  The service and prices is minimal.",-1
2,"The atmosphere is good. I ordered their vegetarian dish, which is probably not their best dish but given the reputation of this place it should still be better than average. It was alright.
Would have been 3 stars overall, but lost a star for service, they were a bit rude, an older woman was either the manager or owner was a bit pushy. We showed up just to order drinks, and they said they were only seating dinner, that's fine. We returned an hour and half later for ramen, but we got the impression they would rather not have our business. There were open seats.
And there was a Stan's dad, whole foods thing.... I don't know if you have ever seen the South Park episode where Stan's dad Randy buys lunch at whole foods and Whole Foods auto opt in for donating to a feed the children charity. Same deal. Check comes and they've already adding the donation for the charity and hand me a brochure for the charity. They could have at least said by the way, ""Tonight will include a donation to such and such charity"". 
Overall, 3 stars.",-1
3,"Maybe I'm spoiled for choice in NYC with ramen joints, but Bone Daddies really just did not do it for me.  I got the classic Tonkotsu Ramen, and didn't enjoy it enough to finish (and trust me - I eat a LOT).  The broth was nice and thick, but lacked flavor, and the texture of the noodle wasn't as chewy as I would have liked.
They did have this awesome brussel sprout appetizer though - the pomegranate seeds added a great kick to it, so an extra star for that!  I would go if you're looking for a quick meal but nothing worth going out of your way for.",-1
3,"The decor is nice.  The staff is okay.  We went with 3 kids 2 year olds and a 12 year old.  We requested to be seated at the bottom level and they said we couldn't be seated there as they were close to closing it was still an hour and a half before they closed.  I realized when I looked below that it was all adults seated there and the guests with kids were seated upstairs.  It's not really kid friendly as it is kid tolerated.  The food was okay, I ordered a lychee martini which was decent but they forgot to wipe the bottom of the glass which was wet so when they settled on the table it was wet as well.  Our server did his best but with one server waiting on 7 tables it was just okay.",-1
1,"What about this place? I have been at alot of fusion asian places espacially in N.Y like Buddhakan, Tao etc, i love asian fusion restaurants and food.
Strange bouncers at the entrance(more night club style)-not good feeling
Closet-very proffesionel
Toilet-boring, nothing special, why dont put some effort to decor?
Now i had looked forward to this place and food, heard alot of great reviws. The food was total out of flavour, it was so bad everything from starter to main courses, dessert was ok. 
Drinks was also bad.
Prices where ok, but comparing whit the bad food it was very high
Sorry to say but a big misstake go to Hakkasan",-1
3,"Oooh shoryu ramen is another good place to stop for a bowl of noodles, although like Vicky, I liked it, but didn't LOVE it. Maybe all the other new-ish (excellent) ramen places have made it harder to impress me in London?
I was really impressed by the variety of soups here! The menu was massive and it seemed like you can order almost all kinds of noodle-joy. I tried the Sapporo Miso, and my other half tried the wasabi tonkotsu. They were both pretty good...so I'll have to come back and try some other flavours to see if I can bump this place up to 5 stars.",-1
5,"On a international trip to London with my gals, we were HIGHLY recommended to go to this restaurant by an American ex-pat living in London. Many of us tried the same things, but there are some things that I have had at this restaurant that stand out as being the best Chinese I've ever had in my life. We all split the duck with the pancakes. I was quite hesitant to try duck, as I never have been fortunate enough to see this variety in my daily diet. It was amazing! The pancakes (of course, I had not known what this was since Americans have a different cultural knowledge of pancakes) complemented the appetizer so well, that I wanted more! But I'm really glad we didn't. Our main course came, and we all sampled the variety of duck and chicken in many different sauces: sweet and sour, orange, and kong-po. I know there were some other dishes that were ordered, but I do not recall at the current moment. We had visited here on our first day in London, and decided we loved it so much that we made reservations for the last day. What a great decision! When I come back to you one day, London, I will enjoy this wonderful restaurant again!",1
5,Large vibrant space with warm atmosphere in homey setting. Speakeasy style with period music playing. Good menu for sharing or for left overs. Decent prices. Quality food - all was good. Spicy. There are vegan/veg/dairy free menus all on request. Hidden in an alley around the corner from the  main street near by. Open late - came late at 10:30pm and avoided the wait. Friendly staff. Good cocktail menu and nice beer. Seems it would be good for large groups as well as couples. Low light.,1
4,"Nom. Just, nom. 
The tonkatsu ramen is delicious. Perfectly cooked noodles, broth so thick and pork bone-ish it's almost white. The right amount of spring onion, bean sprout, crispy garlic slices, bamboo shoots, and a little picked ginger right in the middle. Perfect eggs, perfect slices of pork. Topped off by a little house chili oil sauce, and wow. I ate the whole bowl and would have licked it if I could have fit my face inside. 
Just noticed I used the word ""perfect"" three times! So it's just not getting that fifth star because I think £11 is a bit much, and a pint of Asahi for £4.5 is a bit steep too. A beer and a bowl of (admittedly totally delicious) ramen coming out to £16? I happily paid, but secretly wished was more like £12 (£9 for the ramen, £3 for the beer) - then it'd get 5 stars. Perhaps I trifle. 
Anyway, as I said, nom.",1
1,"Overall left very unimpressed by Yauatcha. Walked in around 6pm on a rainy Sunday evening and were seated only after some fuss and the promise to leave within an hour and a half despite many empty seats available.
Next, ordered two appetizers, but the waiter (who didn't seem to understand English well enough to not mess things up) brough three - one of which we had not ordered. He didn't apologize or offer to take it back. All three appetizers were underwhelming: chicken steamed shu mai, pork buns and something else we had not ordered. Greasy and not particularly great flavors.
We then ordered fried rice with long beans, which for ten pounds I expected would be delicious, but was greasy and tasteless. Beef in black bean sauce - greasy and chewy. 
We took a couple of bites but didn't want anymore of it so asked if it could be packed to take away. They said no- they don't pack food to take away.
Overall a very very underwhelming, over priced experience with cold staff. Would not return.",-1
5,Great place for dim sum that is extraordinarily good and for that quality it is actually very good value. I would focus on the dim sum. I come here regularly and the place never lets you down.,1
4,"Consistent. Consistent douche bag servers, consistent awkward seating arrangements with complete strangers, and consistently the cheapest yet fastest Chinese grub in London's Chinatown.
I got to hand it to WK, it's complete equal opportunity. You are not a special butterfly or some prefab diva. You are equally treated like an inhumanely kept dog, fed only the basic food for sustenance, while sat by some complete stranger that both you and him/her are making it like the other is some white elephant in the room. But you know what? This establishment only cares about two things: feeding you the fastest way possible and getting you out equally as fast so that the process can be repeated with the next human being(s). And that's why I still have love for this joint. 
WK hasn't let me down once. The bar is set (low).",1
5,"I personally not a big fan of Indian food.  But this place completely changed me, the food is so delicious and perfect.  Even the washroom is nicely decorated.  The only downside is the wait time, we came here twice and both times we need to wait for at least 1 hr and of course no reservation can be made.",1
4,"Summary: 
+Great soya ramen 
+Lighter broth compared to tonkotsu (pork) based ramen
+There's usually a queue. So watch out. 
+Quirky atmosphere 
Overall:
I went to one of my go-to noodle places in central London. Bone Daddies is one of the specialist ramen restaurants that opened in 2012 in the midst of what surely will be remembered in history as the First Ramen Rush. (I made that up.) This was a truly glorious time for ramen aficionados in which three specialist ramen restaurants opened one after another in central London in a period of less than 10 months. It is generally agreed in our enlightened circle that significance of this series of events matches that of other events that took place that year such as London Olympics, the phone hacking scandal or the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. OK, that was an overstatement. But it was a good year. 
Anyway. I arrived at the restaurant five minutes before their opening to have an early dinner. After a few minutes of waiting, a friendly waiter showed me to a counter seat by the large window that oversees the street. Across the street, I could see people cleaning large glass windows of what looked like a new juice bar that was about to open. I tried to remember what kind of shop was there before but I couldn't. I guess it didn't matter after all. If they had food, I would have remembered something. 
By the time I ordered, there was already a few more groups in the restaurant. The restaurant calls itself a ""ramen bar"". Appropriately, the counter tables and high stools decorate the hip dining space along with quirky Japanese posters from the 1960s. 
Food: 
I ordered their signature dish, soya ramen. 
The soup is based on clear chicken broth and soya sauce mix. The result is incredible richness without the excessive grease of pork-based broth. The soya sauce and slightly burnt green onion adds a hint of bitterness and flavour to the broth. 
The thin noodles are relatively easy to manoeuvre with chopsticks. They go very well with the delicate broth. I wonder if what people say about pasta (fat pastas for creamy sauces, thin pastas for light sauces) also applies here. 
The mild peppery taste and the crunchy texture of fresh mizuna leaves are a lovely addition. I previously never understood the appeal of this understated green vegetable but I have now revised my opinion about it.",1
5,"! A Londoner suggested we give this place a try. What a great experience! Awesome dim sum & service. The sticky rice was yummy. My husband liked the mushroom spring roll. 
We plan on going for dinner before leaving London. 
We recommend this place!!!",1
4,"Try to reserve a seat in the room under the flowers.  Beautiful sky light. You'll feel like a scene from a fairy tale.  
Tastes classical French.  We had the prix-fixe menu.  The roasted chicken I had a good texture. Moist and fragrant.  I still think I would be happier with fried chicken.  Thrice cooked fries is pure, mild fragrance. Exquisite crisp outer texture and soft fluffy inside. But you might be bored if you want a stronger flavor or impactful sauce.  
Basically, food is standard French. Atmosphere is magical.",1
3,"We got there by sunday lunchtime on a cold day and there was already a couple of people queueing. it didn't take too long though (luckily it wasn't raining) and we were shown to our table. the place is rather small and these were two tables joined together, with table 2 already occupied. i don't know why they couldn't have separated the tables before we took our seats but that's fine, we did it ourselves.
I had a steamed pork bun as a started and the price was quite steep for what is essentially a mini sandwich. The meat was somewhat flavoursome, but a bit dry and sat awkwardly inside the bun, trying to escape as I bit into it. I don't know, presentation wasn't great and I felt there was little value for money. 
I had the traditional ramen with two lovely half eggs and bits of pork that were ok, but not mind blowingly good as the ones I had in Tokyo. The broth was substantial and nicely flavoured, but I must be honest and said I've had better here in London. The price is honest for what you get, though, and I've heard you can get a second portion of noodles free if you still have lots of broth left. For drinks I've ordered a frozen kirin but it came mildy warm and without the foam cap it was supposed to have. I was disappointed to say the least.
Overall the food ain't bad, it's just not awesome enough to make me queue or even go for another visit. And I believe you could have better elsewhere.",-1
3,"I can't remember how many times I've walked past this place and thought ""I should eat there one day!""..... Today was indeed that day!
The restaurant is divided into street food upstairs and more traditional downstairs. Both were busy and either choice was a 10 minute wait. We opted to go down stairs where we were politely greeted and directed to a comfortable waiting area.
Annoyingly a couple who came in after us were seated first, but upon realising their mistake we were quickly seated in a place set for 4 (we were a couple) in a bit of a hurry we immediately made our order and pleasingly it turned up quickly.
The food was ok, portions were just right. My partner always has the same thing in Indian restaurants, butter chicken. Comparatively, it was very good!! I went for a chicken dhansak, this tipped my scale at ""average"" the accompanying bread were all ""average"" also. 
To summarise,  the place is welcoming with friendly staff. The food is good but as there price point is at the higher end of what you would want to pay for the cuisine I would want a bit more. If like me you've passed it and thought you should try it..... Give it a go. (Unless your heading towards covent garden, then go to dishoom.... The place this is aspiring to be like)",-1
3,"My girlfriends and I have decided to do a monthly noodle get together - Luckily one of them in a Hong Kong native and major London foodie so we are all setup for a mouth-tastic adventure.She had the idea of us checking out Bone Daddies as this is the new ""it"" spot for Ramen in the city.  We got there around 6:30PM knowing they don't take reservations. They were nice enough to take my word that my two friends were on our way and sat me down ahead on stools in the back.  That being said, I see the merits in waiting for the full party to be there as the two guys in front of me said they had a table for 10 and took up one of the coveted tables, only to have 6 in their party ultimately arrive - leaving us in the kind of awkward side by side seating in the back where it's a bit difficult to get your stuff together and have a dinner conversation. The staff, though, was quite friendly and accommodating even the small space.
But anywho, on to the food - 
The starts 
Appetizer: Fried chicken: Delicious  - A must order. I wouldn't have even thought to order this at a Japanese restaurant but you won't be disappointed - it's perfectly crispy, comes with a squeeze of lemon and really hits the spot - perfect for sharing.
Yellowtail sashimi - Fresh and delicious - a nice compliment to the added fried chicken calories!
I went for the Sweet 3 Miso Ramen and...eh. I mean, don't get me wrong it was good as Ramen - the broth was hearty and the noodles were right on but as toppings and meat go, I just needed more to offset the saltiness of the broth.",-1
4,"The short is that Bone Daddies is a great Ramen place and worth your time.
Seating is a little close quarters due to the small space and need to pack as many high standing stools as close as possible. Service is prompt and pleasant. Due to the small space, your proximity to a staff member is always less than 2 meters in any direction.
I ordered a Tantanmen Ramen. This is the spicy minced pork variety. When it arrived it looked amazing. But I was a little disappointed as it was thick with oil. Upon tasting the broth was quite bland to the point I actually asked for a plate to remove some of it as I'm not a fan of food served like this, even if it was chilli oil. That removed, suddenly the flavours of the broth came through and it was delish. A side of fried chicken rounded things off nicely. Fried to crisp perfection, in bite sized pieces and without bones. Mmm.
On drinks, I ordered the Red rocket, a fizzy bright red concotion of raspberry, Yuzu and Soda. Delish and refreshing, but perhaps a bit much with the Ramen broth but great as a drink in it's own right.
So in all, Bone Daddies isn't a place you'll want to linger long in. It isn't designed for comfort and service is prompt and quick for a reason. It wasn't particularly busy when arriving there around 12.30pm but by 1pm it was pretty packed so advice would be to get there early as I don't believe they take bookings.",1
2,"The food is... ok. But it always feels like you're paying as much for the decor as the food, and the whole place is trying a bit too hard to tell you how cool and urban and happening you are. There are half a dozen places around the corner in Chinatown you could go to for better food (Top of the Town, maybe) - just ask for the dim sum menu and point at random.",-1
2,"Not bad, but not the greatest by a long shot. Good for a cheap and quick dinner or lunch, but not much else.
Ordered the chicken katsu, which was pretty good and miso soup. Pretty standard, but when you're cold and freezing (as I was back in January 2010 when I ate here), miso soup is AWESOME. 
If I'm ever in town, probably won't make the trek over here...",-1
3,"Reasonably priced dim sum. Good selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails. My favorite dishes were wasabi peanuts, spare ribs and squid.",-1
5,"Fun find for dim sum located in an alley out of the way.  The dining area is subterranean, dark, and mysterious that feels like a scene out of The Matrix or Bladerunner.  Fun, fruity cocktails and mocktails accompany the courses.  A few modern twists on traditional dim sum that keeps your palette guessing.  All of the waitresses are dressed in the same boldly colored dresses and perform with the demeanor of automatons.",1
5,"Definitely my favourite place in London, even better than its older brother Hakkasan.
I need to admit I don't really like Chineese food, but Yauatcha is an exception.
All the times I have been here, I always asked the waiter to bring a dim sum selection (they can tailor to your taste if you tell them what you like) as starters: my favourite is the white roll with mushrooms, don't know the name though. Also try the crispy duck salad, is really tasty.
As main, there is only one option for me: the crispy duck! It is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, litteraly my flatmate and me have been addicted to it for months last winter...it is tasty, the meat is tender, the sauce is great, pancakes are good...the best main you can have here. All the other stuff are pretty good too, but this one deverves to be tried at least once. 
You might think that Asian places don't serve good desserts, but here you have some delicious ones: my favourite is the Coconut Charlotte, but also the chocolate delice is very good. 
There are some very nice cocktails as well, fruity and colourful, and a good wine selection, even if I always end up taking the asian beer (I think Sapporo is the one I like better).
The place is very nice, the street level floor is elegant and clean, but the best part is the lower ground floor with a blue lighting and a huge acquarium at the bar: Since the first time I came, I felt like to be in a ""movie restaurant"", the places where the characters usually meet for a date or a chat in the movies.
The only problem is that it is so popular these days that finding a table and even making a reservation is a nightmare, over the weekend tables are booked since mid week! They offer various time slots, at 6.30, 8.30 and 10.30 for dinner and if you are lucky and call on the same day you can find something at 6.30 only...
I can't wait to go back to London to come here again!",1
4,Very good dim sum!! Portions are small so getting many dishes is definitely an option. A little pricey but I would go back. Atmosphere is very sleek modern and fresh.,1
2,"Decent food. Rude and curt staff. Didn't check in one between ordering food and drinks and when I asked for the bill. When I asked for the bill, the waiter finally asked if I wanted I refill on my drink which I had finished 20 minutes earlier. There are better places in London with less entitled staff.",-1
1,Worse restaurant I have been to. No service.Roast duck rice was full of fat.,-1
5,Very good restaurant. Just near the Oxford Street. I really love the dim sums and desserts there. So delicious!,1
2,"Good food, terrible service. Our waitress was nowhere to be found, so I had to take my drinks to the bar to get my own refill. I had to walk up to the manager to ask for my bill after waiting for 20 minutes for the waitress. The manager did not care.  Worst part is they put a 12% tip on my bill.",-1
5,"I stayed for a week in London and ate here five times!  Yes, I ate here five times.  The prices are a bargain compared to other Chinatown restaurants.  For example, I had eel with black bean sauce over rice for 5.7 GBP and the comparable dish is 13.8 GBP next door.
Granted, their try to rush the customers through, but I still enjoyed eating here and will definitely return.
If you speak Cantonese, you will be treated respectfully.",1
2,"Wong Kei is notorious amongst local Chinese for serving cheap traditional Chinese food fast with rash (i.e. rude service) in very simple (i.e. old and down-trodden) surroundings. The colours on dishes and tea sets may be worn, I have found lipstick on a cup before, hair on the plate of food, etc. 
Having grown up in London and been a frequent visitor of Chinatown I have known what to come to expect of Wong Kei, and that is not to expect much in terms of quality but you can be fed with speed and at low prices compared to all its competitors in Chinatown. 
Many locals can feel at ease eating here even on their own (unless you feel embarrassed to have anyone you know spot you eating here). It is basically cheap (and not so cheerful) but it does its job and has served a useful purpose in London's Chinatown for many decades.",-1
2,"It started off promising: I arrived just before the lines started to form and was seated right away. The server asked if it was my first time and if I had any allergies; I said I was vegetarian. She then went through and marked all the vegetarian options on the menu for me, which I didn't find necessary; I can read. But, it was a nice gesture, unless it was because she assumed I was illiterate for some reason. I ordered the okra fries as a starter. It came very quickly. It was a bit overcooked and some pieces were too stringy to chew. Then I waited a long, long time for her to come back and take the rest of my order. I debated just leaving, but the ambiance was nice and I was hungry. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wave her down but she was always rushing past. After at least 10 or 15 minutes I finally got her attention and ordered the veggie curry and basmati rice. The rice was beautiful, long-grained. It's possible I have never had proper basmati rice before. Five stars if I was just rating the rice. The curry was good, but I thought of the microwave veggie curry meals I would get from Trader Joe's, which cost 20% the price and are about 90% as satisfying. After my meal, I walked out of the restaurant past a line of maybe 20 people outside and vaguely considered myself lucky to have been seated without a wait. I also wondered why they hadn't been better about checking in on me, to get me out of there faster and clear out a table, but whatever.
And also, as another reviewer pointed out, only two types of curry?! In London?!?",-1
3,"Lovely restaurant, loved food and sake. i and my friends were there last week, I like it, of course I prefer Berkerley, it looks more romantic and chilled out place",-1
3,"After viewing the menu online I was extremely excited about our planned dining experience. The menu has so much variety. I met a group of friends at the restaurant, great location, just a short walk from Oxford Circus underground station & perfect for a group of girls. The service was spot on, the staff were friendly and welcoming, the restaurant has a great feel to it with gorgeous interior decorating and warm lighting. After viewing the menu for a second time I was so excited about ordering food. We decided to go with the set menu, extremely cheap for central London and looked amazing. I think we paid £15 for a 3 servings including dumplings. When the food came out it looked great but was cold and unfortunately not all that tasty. Rice dishes weren't fresh, dumplings slightly over done. I would give this restaurant a second shot but I wouldn't go for the set menu. They also have gluten free options available which is great!!",-1
3,"I was recommended Hakkasan by around a billion people (which is coincidentally about the population of China), but it was my old flatmate's words that got me here in the end.
""Just came back from Hakkasan... guess who we saw there? Jordan. And The King of Jordan""
Haha, what a perfect double-celebrity sighting! I had to go.
But sadly for me there was no celebrity sighting just boring nobodies around me, I wonder if the people sitting on the tables near me thought the same of me. Pah. Of course not... they'd be honoured to be sitting near Tom E off of Yelp.
So with no celeb sightings what else would Hakkasan offer? Well, the dark chocolate feel of the comfortable deep tones and wood made it certainly feel chic, modern but also perfectly functional inside. Kudos to Alan Yau once more for his skill in design. The service was impeccable as expected and the salt and pepper fried squid was beyond superb. I can still taste it in my dreams.
But for the price (high as a Hong Kong block of flats), other dishes were just not on par. Specifically I'm thinking of...
1. The dumplings... good but not orgasmic, and
2. Mapo Tofu - a limp excuse for 4 times the normal price of my all-time fave chinese dish.
[sad face with tear coming out of one eye]
Still, it was a great experience I'd love to try again but not until I've been to little sister Yauatcha about a million more times. That's where my loyalty lies.",-1
2,Food mediocre.  In our case Wiener Schnitzel just horrible.  Wine by the carafe reasonable. Service only OK.,-1
3,"I was invited out to lunch by a friend and we decided to go to Ping Pong; I had heard about them and she had already been. I love dim sum and wasn't too disappointed; it isn't the BEST in London, but it's tasty enough, the price is right and it's served on a decent environment with good atmosphere and sleek, modern decor (typical dim sum places can be noisy, too brightly lit, uncomfortable and that cliché ""chinese takeaway joint""  decor can put one off).
You are given a menu and a list where you tick your selected dishes - quite fun and makes ordering easy. Each portion comes with around three pieces and most are under £4. The baskets come to the table all at once and will be stacked high if you order a lot; tables are on the small side, so it can become a bit awkward juggling all that stuff. But you'll manage. :) It is the right thing to do here, though; the portions aren't huge (they shouldn't be; it's dim sum after all) and it would be very time consuming to keep refilling your table everytime you finished a basket, increasing waiting times.  
If you're not too ravenous you could order two or three + a small main meal (one of the rice dishes, maybe). If you're really ravenous, well, you're going to spend a little more or go elsewhere. If you're going for the set menus they are good value, but remember you'll get mostly individual pieces instead of a portion of three as in the a la carte.
Almost everything I ordered was tasty, especially the honeyed chilli chicken and mushroom rice pot (not a big portion, but it's only over £6 so I certainly wasn't expecting a bucket). The char sui buns (steamed bun with BBQ pork) are ok; I've certainly had better, but also much worse. Loved my drink called Hibiscus Spritz; you are given a glass of fizz with a flower inside an ice cube in which you pour a concoction of liqueurs; very ""chemistry class"" and deliciously refreshing. Didn't have time for more cocktails and dessert, but will do next time - the drinks menu look particularly appealing and I really liked the one I tried.
Apparently they are always changing the menus with the seasons. A good trick to get you coming back, and I intend to. :)",-1
3,"For a true Asian - probably three star at its best, over priced dim sum with some fancy ingredient twist. 
Portions are small and the flavor is not particularly different even with the superior materials. The wagyu beef puff is the only thing i enjoyed of our ordering.",-1
1,"If I could no stars for the head asian hostess I would. Very rude and not welcoming by any means. She needs to be retrained to work at the front. After speaking with many people, apparently they have gotten the same treatment. What a shame for a restaurant to have one person cause so many customers to leave and return their establishment over that type of behavior.
The food is slowly going downhill too. It used to be much better! Time to redo the menu.",-1
4,"I liked the place. The atmosphere, service and food were very good.
I will definitely go back there next time I am in London.",1
2,"Not worth the wait in line if you're craving the taste of real Indian food. Samosas had a tough plastic like skin. Chai was good but very sweet. The corn was like any other corn and extra salty. Potato was bland. Okra fries wasn't great. Overall I've had much better Indian and can get far better in nyc for the same and less money easily. 
You pay for the hype and ambiance here. That's it.",-1
4,"The food here is really pretty good. We opted for prix fixe option in the back of the menu and were not disappointed in quality or quantity. It loses a star for being overly loud and crowded--they need to lose about 20% of their tables to make this a more enjoyable dining experience. We were practically on top of the tables either side of us, and privy to every aspect of their conversations.",1
5,Best meal  in England--one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Worth a wait. They serve you drinks and chai in line as you wait and you can order drinks and small plates once you get to bar.,1
5,"Fantastic! The line went faster than estimated and the food was great. I recommend the Okra fries, samosas and calamari as small plates. The Chicken Ruby was excellent as a main plate. I can can see why this place has such great reviews. The atmosphere as on point as well.",1
5,"Was skeptical about coming here as I was dreading a long wait, but am so glad we decided to try it! The queue outside was long when we arrived, but we were promptly checked in and given warm chais while we stood in line. The line moved fast and we made it inside to the bar area to complete our wait with drinks in hand. We were seated before we knew it. Staff was warm, efficient and helpful throughout. But let's talk about the food! We ordered a lot of it, and all plates and bowls were mopped clean by the end. Ruby chicken curry, chicken tikka, black daal, bowl of greens, naan, roti, rice. The flavors were outstanding- no surprise why this place is so popular. Will definitely return next time we are in London.",1
5,"This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in London... It's walking distance from the Soho Hotel which is a plus for me as well. The dim sum here is very good but my favorite dish here has to be the duck egg rolls. 
It is not traditional Dim Sum, which is one of the reasons I think I find myself craving it when I'm back home. This is a must eat before I leave restaurant for me every time.",1
3,"Searching for Indian restaurants near our Marble Arch area hotel, this looked like the safest bet. We got there and were encouraged to eat at the proper restaurant downstairs. The space is very nice but the staff did feel very standoffish. While there were seats open throughout, we were seated by the kitchen. 
The food was very good but since we were in the mood for traditional Indian fare, the fusion elements were lost on us. It's also on the expensive side and for the price I regretted not going to La Porte des Indes a few blocks away.",-1
4,"If like me you believe that eating should be a question of taking on fuel rather than some kind of quasi-religious social event then the Wonky in Soho is the place for you. The minute you're in the door you're basically grabbed by the scruff of the neck and shoved down at a table, often one that's already occupied by some Chinese person loudly slurping down noodles. A demand is made for what you want and a pot of Chinese tea is banged down in front of you, followed seemingly just seconds later by the dish of your choice. In my case this is usually lemon chicken and boiled rice: mm lovely! The place being something of an institution you can buy a Wong Kei t-shirt just like the waiters wear. Some say the waiters are rude here. A diner in Soho (possibly here) once had a request for a second cup of coffee answered with a barked: No: you pay, you go!. But to me they aren't rude, they're efficient. And I wear my t-shirt with pride. Be warned the place don't take credit cards though, so take some cash and spare yourself an embarrassing mid-meal trip to the cash point. And don't even think about using the toilets. Apart from that, absolutely great.",1
5,"London's love for Dishoom runs deep. Apparent from the growing list of accolades that the restaurant has accrued, ranging from customer reviews to the platitudes of food bloggers and critics alike. While the playful yet meticulous décor, the obliging staff and the complimentary 'Chai-Fi' all play a part in generating such a loyal following, the food is ultimately the lynchpin of Dishoom's success. Vibrant, experimental, filling and affordable- it's a rare fusion of these factors. Few restaurants in the capital have such highly recognisable dishes- they are so photogenic that they reappear on foodie Instagram feeds and are retweeted by your brunching acquaintances on Twitter. 
While it's not a quiet success, there's no shame in fighting for a table at Dishoom. The atmosphere is spirited, service is timely and the food is fun and satisfying. Why would you travel further afield for a potentially lacklustre pop-up? 
I made my inaugural visit to the Shoreditch location for a Sunday brunch in February 2016. Immediately, I was impressed by how large and lively the location was. The front of house staff and the servers were warm and congenial- we were seated in an area with plenty of room and our server was patient as we scrutinised the menu. Options range from healthier fare- including a bottomless porridge- to cooked breakfasts and the widely celebrated (and much photographed) naan rolls. There was no real competition: we succumbed to their reputation and ordered one bacon and one egg naan with masala beans on side, a breakfast lassi, a Virgin Mary and a round of Americanos while we waited.
Plenty has been written about Dishoom's naan rolls with earnest reason. And everything you've heard is probably true. Freshly baked naan is pulled from the tandoor oven by an assembly line operation in the open kitchen downstairs, arriving as a springy soft casement- still warm from the oven- for every filling. Amply substantial and a thing of beauty- especially compared to any stodgy white bread variation- this elevates the bacon roll into luxury. The filling is equally laudable: my two eggs oozed with golden yolks, mingled with the hot sweetness of the chili tomato jam, the mild creaminess of soft cheese and the hint of fresh coriander. It arrived with extra tomato chili jam on the side, which I took as an impetus to cast cutlery aside and dig in with my hands (nimble fingers were required to dip small chunks of bread into the small ramekin).
The masala beans also triumphed, evading a sugary and gloopy tomato sauce for a robust, mildly heated and fragrant base. They were delicious paired with the naan roll, especially for those who are ravenous (and we were). The breakfast lassi was a thick blend of oats, yogurt, banana and mango, resulting in a rich smoothie. It coats the throat and is a deliciously fruity liquidised meal that completely lacked the syrupiness of a cheap mango puree-based drink.
Even the coffee hits the right notes at Dishoom, where Malabar coffee is served, made from Arabica beans 'from a single estate in Sunticoppa, Karnataka, are bared on wood to the monsoon winds' (in their own words). It was full-bodied devoid of any bitterness, making it a strong and easy palatable cup.
At under £5.50 for the bacon naan roll (and £4.90 for my two egg roll), Dishoom offers superlative value for a deliciously filling brunch. We left with full bellies, licking our fingers and wondering just why we had waited so long to visit. 
Maybe we subconsciously knew it would be a floodgate for future Sunday trips- better to start now because we have to start making up for lost time somehow.",1
5,"Book early, tables are difficult to come by.  Make sure you have plenty of disposable income too, because it wont be cheap.
But, by golly, this is the best contemporary Chinese in town !",1
5,"The latest in our Ramen Club outing was to Bone Daddies, the hip new noodle joint in Soho that's staying true to Japanese way of life. It's the latest in the trend so the core challenge is to differentiate itself. Now we (mostly me, but this is based on discussions with said Ramen Club too) judge ramen on a number of categories: Noodles, veggies and associated toppings, meat, egg, and of course the all important broth!.
Noodles - Cooked perfectly with just a hint of resistance in each bite. I find that too often the noodles are cold (not enough time out of the fridge before the broth is poured in) or mushy (cooked and then broth is added). So this was a noodle win topped only by Tonkotsu's offering.
Veggies & toppings - The veggies in my bowl were crunchy and flavourful so my one gripe would be that there weren't enough of them. The toppings were sparse in the bowl but I appreciate that you can add from a variety of items on the table. There is a sesame seed grinder (I've never ground sesame into anytime but it helped bulk out the broth) and a garlic press with fresh garlic cloves (brilliant idea!). The one thing lacking was extra fresh chilli although to be fair there was some chilli oil (just not my thing).
Meat - This was the disappointment in the dish. I found the meat to be lacking in substance in both form and flavour. Cocoro still wins in my book for best meat although Ittenbari would be a close second.
Egg - Let me qualify this by saying I don't like egg. I have it scrambled and occasionally poached with salmon but it really isn't my thing. I haven't enjoyed it at any other Ramen place but at Bone Daddies it was incredible and I wanted another one. Yes, it's that good.
Broth - I opted for the 20 hour Tonkotsu broth. It's thick and rich and full of meaty (and fatty!) goodness. If there isn't enough fat for you, you can opt for an extra pipette of fat for 50p. One of the better broths in London and perfect for a cold wintry day (like today) and only beat by the spicy Tonkotsu from Cocoro. Man, I wish I could have a bowl of it now!
Overall, it was one of the best bowls of Ramen I've had in London. Individually, I don't think most of the components were worthy of the top spot but put together it's incredible. Also special note to the manager for his impeccable customer service in dealing with our large group (and remembering YGO who came a few days earlier), the bartender for taking the time to talk about Japanese whiskey with me (and gave me a free taster), and our sassy waitress for impeccable banter.",1
5,"So ok, this is probably the best dim sum you can get in London.  However, they are on the pricey side so be prepared to pay more than your normal cheaper dim sum place like Oriental or Royal China (best 2 cheap dim sums).  And their dim sum are served in odd number of 3 as oppossed to the normal 4.  Which also shows how pricey they are.  That's said, it is by far the best dim sum you can get in London.  Try not to go there for the normal Chinese food as they are just OK and they are cheaper elsewhere.  Just come for the dim sum on weekend and on Sunday, I believe they have the dim sum menu for brunch so only go for this if you want.  If you go on other weekday dinner, their dim sum is extremely limited and only for appetizer (unless they have changed this but I encourage you to check the time they will serve their extensive list of dim sum.  Cocktails here are great too as they have asian flavours in them.",1
2,"5 stars for the food, -3 for the poor service. I had extremely high hopes for BOTH the food and service, but I was sadly very disappointed. My friend and I had a reservation for 5 pm and were immediately seated upon arriving. Good. Then, we sat there for a good 5 minutes without a menu - heck, we weren't even acknowledged. We had to ASK for the menu. I mean, really? Is it not logical to bring the menu when you seat someone? Anyway, we went for the ""Taste of Yauatcha"" since it included a nice selection of the dim sum options for a great price (28.88 for 2 people). For drinks we just asked for tap water...which arrived 10 minutes later, after having to ask twice. The first six dishes arrived fairly quickly, which was nice. The spring roll, baked venison puff, har gau, prawn shui mai, and siew long bao were all incredibly tasty - definitely the best dim sum I've ever had. After that though, our experience went very downhill.
We waited 20 minutes before our next dish arrived, which might have been understandable except for the fact that the table next to us - who ordered around 10 minutes after we did - got their next dishes (they ordered the tasting menu too) before us. They weren't even done with the first six, which we had finished long before their first six even arrived. What made me even more upset was that I could literally SEE the dishes sitting on a nearby cart as the waiters stood by nonchalantly minding their own business, chatting amongst themselves. After a while we also decided to ask for a tea refill, but were told that a refill would incur an extra charge because they don't reuse the leaves. Ummmm ok, whatever.
Our last 2 dishes came about 1.5 hours after we first ordered. The cheung fun and stick rice in lotus leaf were both absolutely amazing. Again, they were the best I've ever tried. After finishing, we considered getting dessert but the service was so annoyingly inattentive we figured it would be more efficient to go to order directly from the patisserie bar. So we paid and did just that. 
Overall, all I can think about is how utterly appalling and slow/inconsistent the service was. The waiters were not at all attentive - not once did they check in on us - and they also treated us very coolly. Whenever we asked for something, they would just briskly set the thing on the table and leave without glancing once at us. Same thing when we asked for the check - they literally dropped the bill onto the table and left. No ""thank you"" or ""hope you enjoyed your dinner."" Just ""here's the bill ok bye."" Even when we were paying, the waiter didn't even have the courtesy to ask us the amount we wanted to pay - she just punched her own number in and stuck her hand out for our credit cards. Sorry lady, not that easy. It actually mattered this time because the amount we wanted to pay was different from the receipt because the service was SO bad we didn't want to pay the service charge - which we've NEVER done before. Honestly though, they didn't deserve it AT ALL.
Yauatcha - sure, your food is good. But your service is also terrible. So no, I will not be back, and I would not recommend anyone to visit either unless they're ok with sloppy, disrespectful, and terribly disappointing service.",-1
1,"UK's oldest North Indian restaurant serves perhaps the oldest and driest Tandoori meat. 
I must say to the 4 of us visiting this restaurant this came as a shock as it has gotten tons of high marks. The seehk kebab was as dried as the chilly used in it, the Boti kebab was chewy as an old dried leather belt and the Tandoori chicken bland. Chicken tikka on the tandoori menu was the only piece of meat that was somewhat up to the standard. In general the tandoori menu felt not tender nor marinated long enough. 
Butter chicken or Acharri gosht are the items to go for, but then again they are no better than much less exclusive and less up-scaled Indian restaurants in London. 
The portions, and we are not Americans, were too small for the price asked. Basmati rice and nan are good but nowhere as good as the prices indicate  nor are they any better than other Indian restaurants. 
The service is okay but deceiving, they do love to accommodate but they also love to sell and perhaps the worst I seen in London happened here when spring water bottle could not be opened at the table because it was ""slippery"" but conveniently  was replaced in the bar with another bottle which had already been opened. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book and at these prices and with this reputation  it shouldn't take place here. 
For a party of four and only 2 bottle of beers being the only alcoholic beverages served the sum of 114£ is much more well spend somewhere ells than Punjab.",-1

Tightly packed together tables in a dark buzzy basement with low ceilings and house music oozing out of the speakers. Waiters who look like they came out of Sex And The City. It's fun, why knock it?
And the food isn't bad either. A couple of legendary dishes like the venison puffs and the tea smoked ribs. I had both again and they were as usual delicious.
We wandered in on the off chance at about 11pm on a Sat night, and although it was packed and buzzing, they were able to accommodate us in no time which I think deserves the extra star I'm giving it. 
The menu has plenty to choose from and I applaud the authenticity of much of it. (They have congee if you dare order. Yuck.) You might think it's style over substance but actually there's a lot of good food too just like their sister place Hakasaan.
I've had my battles in there like the time we over ordered and they wouldn't provide us with a doggy bag to take the rest home. Looked at me like I was mad when I made that suggestion. Certainly not something ladies who lunch often ask for. They are all skinny as a rake anyway.
But you aren't fleeced for the experience. It's the sort of place you feel will cost a fortune because of the smart surroundings but actually if you pick wisely it's not that bad. You certainly feel like you've had a run for your money when you roll out of there anyhow.
All in all, for a lively, stylish, buzzy experience in the middle of soho in cool surroundings with beautiful gossiping people, you can't really go wrong if you get a table here.",1
5,"This was the best Indian food I've ever eaten. The only complaint I'd make was that my waitress wasn't as attentive as I'd expect. Took so long to bring drinks to the table that the Bellini was flat. 
I would definitely go here again.",1
5,"How can I not love this place?!!!!
It's the fusion Chinese restaurant with unique style. I love the bar while you are waiting for your seat. 
The dim sum here are delicious. Worth the wait.",1
5,"Came here for a quick lunch. Was seated right away no problem. 
The waiter was extremely nice and went into detail of their menu for me as well as how he recommends I should order, which was great. 
The food came out fast and was amazing. The presentation was beautiful, especially for the lamb chops. I ended my meal with a nice Chai, which was phenomenal.
Definitely recommend it and I will for sure be back.",1
2,"Have had 2 visits in the last week to this highly rated restaurant. A week ago I visited with 2 friends without a reservations and we were escorted to a table behind the staircase adjacent to a register being actively used by multiple waiters. After we received our drinks we were bumped repeatedly and asked to be reseated. The manager was very gracious about moving us to a table in the larger downstairs room with a view of the huge fish tank. Dinner proceeded uneventfully and we enjoyed our meals. Tonight visited the restaurant with friends who had not been there before but this time I called to make a reservation and asked to be seated in the large room with a view of the fish tank. I was really surprised when we were seated at the exact table behind the stairs I had been given a week earlier. This time I immediately asked for another table and told them I was assured that there would be no problem sitting in the large dining room. We sat a short while and then were given another table by the kitchen but improved. 
Then came issues with the service. We received one of our appetizers. Then we received another. Then we got our three meals. We finished them and Then we received another appetizer. Then we requested the bill and then along with the bill came soup we had ordered earlier. We thought the late appetizer and soup had been forgotten. Then as we were paying my one friend said ""there is a bug in my beer""  I looked and saw a sizable live bug waving around in the beer. I wondered how many might have been in my meal. We won't go back.",-1
4,"While I'm not the biggest Hakata-style tonkotsu ramen fan, Bone Daddies does good.
There's usually a queue at night, but you can easily pass the time by ordering a drink.
The tonkotsu ramen has a milky collagen-thick soup with rich garlic flavor. The eggs are perfect, with a creamy soft yolk. Adding chicken scratchings is a nice local touch, but I didn't feel they did much texture-wise.
The sides are hit and miss:
- Deep fried soft-shell crab? Dericious.
- Kara-age? Yes please.
- Cabbage and miso? A little too literal. Pieces of raw cabbage served with miso paste to dip. Feels like something I would eat when the shops are closed and I'm rummaging through my fridge.
I think Ippudo in NY generally does a better job, and rumor is that it's coming to London this year. While I appreciate London's sudden ramen binge, it would be nice to see more variety without a focus on Hakata-style tonkotsu.",1
4,"Hahahahahahhahahahahahahaha.
Best value Chinese restaurant in the area.
Portion sizes are decent (even for Americans).
Service is fast and brutal.
It is inexpensive.
Order the Singapore fried noodle. Its a little salty but otherwise tasty as a futhermucker.
One of the few places in London where people (and for this read women)
can eat on their own without feeling uncomfortable (no upstairs for you!)
I miss the days when they were incredibly rude and threw the menus at you *sigh*",1
4,"I would give it a five, but because the dessert section disappeared, I'll only give it a 4. The desserts were just too damn good! :) I remember a passion fruit soupy/ice-creamery dessert that was heavenly yummy!
Anyway - the dimsum are fantastic. Quite surprising for a posh place like this. I am used to eating dimsum in shabby, dark chinese places ;) But here you have the glitter and the taste all at once. A must-visit if you are around.
If you can, choose to sit downstairs. With the aquarium bar, and the soft lights, it's really cosy. Good place for a date actually :)",1
2,"Good food, terrible service.
A week ago we went to another Shoryu location (Carnaby street) and after a short wait in line we were promptly seated and served impressively quickly.
At the New Oxford location today, we arrived and were seated without a wait but then we waited over 25 minutes to have a server show up and take even our drink order. This was despite asking various servers multiple times to place an order and always being deferred. The place was almost full but not really busy so the poor service was pretty inexcusable.
After eating (tasty food), our bill had major issues twice (once it was just unrelated; the second time it had a number of extra items). Finally, a manager had to help correct the bill. We had to ask twice for the service charge to be removed.",-1
5,"That's an unforgettable place to eat when I visited London, coz' their ramen not like the traditional, the taste absolutely awesome.. I order soft shell crab ramen, cream & rich favor.",1
3,"We were looking to go to Dishoom, but the darned place always had a 90 minute wait, and I wasn't planning on standing in a line outside in the cold weather (yes, that's what they make you do in many of the  UK restaurants!), so we came here. 
Even though we were here at 9:30P on a Thursday night there was still a 10-15 min wait. The service was generally very friendly, especially the hosts. 
The food was a bit of a hit/miss. Excellent butter chicken and Chole, and pretty good tandoori chicken. Very mediocre lamb biryani. Lots of meat but the flavor wasn't particularly good. Chicken tikka masala was okay and the naan was ok.",-1
1,"Absolutely appalling services. Will not be returning. Although the food is decent we cannot put up with the services! There were five of us and we were placed at a table for four (which is quite crowded) and we asked whether we can moved to a larger table when it was not busy and they refused with a terrible attitude. When we sat down as well, no one offer any tea or drinks to us - which is typical in a Chinese restaurant- and the attitude is horrendous. When we were ready to order the waiters just ignored us and carry on to talk instead of coming over and help us. When we trued to order more plain boiled rice, they ""forgot"" and we had to ask them again before giving us the rice. 
The most disgusting thing is that they charge a compulsory 12.5% service charge and even ask for more tips at the end. Why would we pay any tips for the appalling services they gave us?",-1
5,"Just thinking about this place makes me sad. Because it's all the way across the pond and it's by far the best ramen bowl I have ever had. Yes, I've had deliciously salty and warming broths with ramen noodles before, but this one takes the cake. Wonderfully dark-yoked egg halves, crackly crunchy bits and warm complex umami flavors still haunt me in my dreams. Til next time, bone daddies, til next time.",1
3,"Food was exquisite, very reasonably priced. Customer service was top notch. Great evening overall.",-1
4,"My husband and I had dinner here last night. It is a cozy place, very intimate. The service was slow to start however, picked up after the first few minutes. We had just sat down and were given the menu when a seemingly nervous server asked if we would like an appetizer. I believe what he meant to ask us was if we would like an aperitif however, we asked to look at the menu first, and were given a lot of time to do so. Our Server was wonderful though. We ordered the seasonal tasting menu, my husband had the wine paring and I opted for a cocktail. The food was spectacular! The foie gras was to die for!!! Overall, an excellent dining experience.",1
5,"I've eaten lots of tonkotsu, and this one is great! It's a 20 hour stock, so yes, it is fatty. I would eat here all the time if I lived nearby. Really hit the spot after a day of travel and jet lag from NYC.  
Friendly waiters, but it took a long time to order and pay the bill. Slow service seems to be the norm in Europe. 
The fried chicken wasn't like karaage, though it doesn't claim to be on the menu. We still enjoyed it with the sauce. The yuzu margarita paired great with the tonkotsu.",1
3,"Nice, authentic, home made flavors and feel to the food. Service was great and the ambience was cozy while feeling a bit dated, which is likely intentional. Overall, good experience and I would dine here again.",-1
4,"Delicious dimsum but quite expensive compared to the nearby restaurants in china town. But you get what you paid for I guess as the atmosphere and service are nicer and you wouldn't have to deal with the chaos at normal Chinese restaurants.
I love their 3 styles mushroom cheungfun, you can't get this anywhere (or at least all the many Chinese restaurant I've been to). They have great selection of teas too and the smoothie fruity teas are my favourites.
If I'm craving for a quick dimsum fix, I'll go to Chinatown. If I'm in the mood for better quality dimsum (esp for dinner time as most restaurants in china town stop serving dimsum from 5pm) and nicer atmosphere and staff who treat me like their customer I will go to yauatcha.
Make sure you make reservation I you wanna go here for dinner on the weekends, or prepare to wait for apprx 1 hour. This place is packed and noisy at dinner normally on Fri and Sat.",1
5,"In the centre of Soho, Bone Daddies is a new ramen joint. It seems to be a mark of hipness not to have a  name or sign anymore on new places lest you might be guilty of not being cool enough to need a sign ...(hint it's next to Byron burger which does have a sign)... in fact I didn't see it at first because I thought it WAS Bryon burger. OK I clearly failed on that test of personal hipness.
Inside it has a utility interior - fairly compact and packed  already just a few days after opening with high counters and stools. Our group of Yelpers managed to straddle across the counter and the some of the window seats. The vibe is dim lighting,  loud music and competing conversations.
Started with the yellowtail sashimi which was really good. Presented on little wooden stakes it was very fresh and with a flavourful dressing plus coriander.
I had to order the Tonkotsu ramen which is always tempting but also more challenging to deliver successfully, apparently. Our orders arrived quite quickly which was good. The Tonkotsu ramen was the best I have had so far on our Ramen outings.
The stock was perfect. Rich, flavourful, savoury, complex, fatty without appearing oily. Perhaps that's the magic of the claimed 20 hour cooking where the stock and bony goodness emulsifies together. This one delivered. The noodles were great too. Special note to the toppings and the super good egg, as others have noted. The pork was the best version I have had  in London and super tender and melt in the mouth fat and meat. 
Quantity wise it wasn't a huge portion but was rich and had plenty of noodles and I have to admit I was fully satisified afterwards. Perhaps a bit more stock would have been good.
The only slight negative was that it wasn't very hot so didn't need to do that loud slurpy thing since it was cool enough to eat direct. Would have preferred it a bit hotter.
Accompanied by a nice Sake in a box.
Service was prompt and enthusiastic.
The only minor gripe for me was that the music was too loud, set at the volume level where you have to shout a bit, even to speak to the person sitting next to you. I don't know if others prefer it that way, maybe it's just me.
Pricing was relatively reasonable compared with other places and the quality was high and the meal was very enjoyable so a great combination overall.",1
5,"Very nice Cantonese restaurant and actually pretty authentic - as a person raised in China. As other reviews already mentioned, prawn dishes generally are good, and all the cheung funs are fantastic",1
2,"Beautiful ambience, but i've had a better meal for £5 in Chinatown. We tried a dozen different dishes, and not a single one was memorable.
The pricey cocktails were also a disappointment - for £10 and 10 ingredients, you'd think you'd get something other than a gin and juice.
Shame all this sexy atmosphere is wasted, but silly me, this is clearly a feast for the eyes, and not the tongue.",-1
5,"What do they put in their food to make it so tasty? I'm almost scared to ask. Fantastic hot and sour soup. I also enjoyed their shrimp dumplings, tea smoked ribs and famed venison puffs. Very trendy vibe in the restaurant, perfect for taking your lady friend though sadly I was flying solo on a business trip. Would love to go back for more.",1
1,"Don't waste your money. Service was average and we went at non-peak hours with very few other tables there. The food was incredibly underwhelming, very inauthentic. There were very little spices and nothing tasted like the many Indian restaurants I have enjoyed in the past. Of the many dishes we ordered, not one of them was memorable. The portions are tiny, and the prices are pretty ridiculous in my opinion (we paid about 35£/person and we're all very hungry after). If you are looking for real Indian food, skip Dishoom. Dishoom doesn't have the ambiance, tastes, smells, or service that its prices reflect or of a quality Indian restaurant. Pass on Dishoom, London has excellent Indian food elsewhere for half the price that is far better and more filling. 
TLDR; expensive, bland dishes, small portions, average service.",-1
1,"Couldn't be more disappointed. 
They ran out of all good sake and we were told that the house 'would be fine'... not sure we were looking for fine... 
Then I ordered more noodles and waited 15 for them to arrive before they arrived and my broth was cold.",-1
4,"Originally founded by Alan Yau, this Michelin-starred restaurant serves high-end dim sum. Craving Asian food in a sea of fish n chip restaurants and pubs, my travel buddy convinced me to give this place a shot. 
FOOD: 
1) Lotus wrap
-Standard dim sum, but very good. 
2) Jasmine tea braised ribs
-Ahh the famous tea braised ribs! I found the ribs to be good, but since it was served without rice, it tasted almost overseasoned with sauce. We ended up ordering white rice, which took ages to arrive, and the rice ended up being dry. Overall, a good dish, but did not live up to the hype for me.  
3) Pumpkin puffs
-My absolute favorite part of my experience. Presented as 3 mini orange pumpkins, the exterior is fried mochi (a little firmer than ham sui gok). When you crack open the puff, the inside has pine nuts and shredded duck. The interior is similar to the inside of a pumpkin- stringy with seeds. The taste was amazing and the design was so creative. It was very memorable!
SERVICE:
The hostess was friendly and seated us when our table was ready. 
The server was constantly unavailable. After putting in our orders, he never came back. Different servers brought us food and we had to flag down a random server to order rice. By the time the rice arrived, the braised ribs were cold. We should have cancelled the order. No one checked up on us. We had to flag down a server down to bring us the bill. 
In a nut shell: Mediocre service, good food.",1
3,"Very run of the mill Chinese food. But cheap and plentiful. Get the set dinner menu, they will just bring out a bunch of food... no decisions have to be made. One of the dishes was fried something... we thought it was just fried fried.",-1
4,"Good location and we were seated right away on a Sunday afternoon. The food was quite good, I had the salmon poke and I really enjoyed it for £10. It has a nice atmosphere and I would definitely go back.",1
5,The lovely food and the rustic environment only complement each other at dishoom. This restaurant provides a very good overall dinner experience for any one who visits,1
3,"Like the other reviews have said, the workers are not exactly the most welcoming or helpful and at times rude. As a first-timer at Wong Kei who was a little overwhelmed at the many choices, a waiter came over after 2 minutes of seating us told us to stop wasting her time when we couldn't tell her what we wanted to order, even though the restaurant wasn't packed. But regardless, we were starving, and the food came quickly, was cheap but a good value for the huge portions, and tasted decent enough for poor college students in London. 
Restaurant is cash only!",-1
3,"We came here based on the Yelp reviews. Being a friday evening, there was a large crowd gathered outside which is always a good sign. We didn't have reservations and we were told the wait would be an hour. However, it ended up being far shorter (maybe 30 min?) and time passed by quickly as we made small talk with other customers. They serve complimentary drink samplers which are delicious while you wait for your table.
The place is extremely clean and the decor is modern eclectic, lighting is a bit too focused, like spotlights on you, rather than ambiance lighting. it gets pretty loud in the rooms but not annoyingly so. Service is very good though the busy night left the hosts a bit frantic. 
We started with the Far Far, a crispy appetizer with spicy sauces. Delicious and my favorite dish. A crispy treat with a nice spicy kick to it. Next came the Bada Pau, a potato mash on dinner bun, which I enjoyed as well though my wife didn't. The potato was well prepared though my wife felt that it wasn't nothing special. The Spicy Lamb Chops followed. This was the most disappointing dish for us both. The meat was overcooked which made it dry and a bit too fatty. I understand that the fat is likely left on to keep the meat moist but they still missed the mark on this one. The Black Daal, a lentil based dish, was my wife's favorite. She enjoyed the perfect creamy consistency and felt that it was seasoned perfectly. She felt that it was perfectly paired up with the Garlic Naan. On the other hand, I felt that it was lacking in flavor and was a bit too watery. The Roti was a bit too rubbery and lacking the toasted softness that is typical of a good roti. 
All in all, I was left disappointed while my wife was a bit less so but commented that she would return to explore the menu more.",-1
5,"The food was amazing! The items I tried and recommend:
Okra Fries
Gunpowder Potatoes
Lamb Samosa
Get them all!",1
3,"Maybe I've been spoiled by other ramen shops. Maybe I'm becoming a ramen snob. But whatever the case may be, the ramen at Bone Daddies was a major disappointment. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and tantanmen ramen, and they both came out in decent-sized bowls (I wouldn't call them large, though), but the ramen inside was just... not ramen. The noodles were some kind of flour noodles that you don't see in typical ramen, which made the entire texture of the dish very strange. On top of that, because they were flour noodles, they tended to clump together if you didn't separate them right when you got your bowl.
On the bright side, the soft-boiled egg was made perfectly, but sadly, that's the only highlight that I can say. The atmosphere of Bone Daddies is unique enough, but it's not a place I would frequent again or recommend to anyone for ramen.",-1
3,"I've been to the Southbank branch a few times and always really enjoyed it, so I was excited to bring friends here. I booked a table for 3 on a Weds eve and we were given one of the solo tables rather than being along the shared bar which was great as it's much easier to talk when facing each other!
Unfortunately it all went a bit downhill from there as the service was inexcusably bad. We had around 45 minutes of happy hour left when we arrived so were pretty confident we could fit 2 drinks into that time, I ended up chasing the waitress down in order to get our second drinks ticket in on time. We also had to wait around 20 minutes for them to pick up our order sheet, despite the fact that we filled it in straight after ordering our first drinks. The biggest bug bear was after our food arrived my friend asked for a fork as she can't use chopsticks, and after at least a 10 minute wait sitting with our food going cold she had to go and ask a second waitress to be provided with one.
I've given 3* rather than 2 as the food  and drinks were good and reasonable for the price we paid. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is buzzing, but on this occasion the service could have been a lot better.",-1
1,"The food here is a total overstatement of good Indian food. Their menu is very pricy but the attention given to the actual served food is poor,to say the least. They seem to be trading upon their presentation skills rather than anything else. I love good quality Indian food and go to Indian all the time. This place was meant to be a treat for a friend but i have to say I was embrassed to have bought a friend. It certainly did not live up to it expectation or maybe that was the problem-having any expectation?!",-1
5,"Yauatcha truly lives up to its Michelin star reputation. I was skeptical about their food at first, but was genuinely impressed with the authenticity and quality of their dim sum, unlike many other 'Chinese' restaurants in London. As good as the dim sum starters were, it was no where close to the matcha dessert I tried (yes, the one everyone seems to rave about). It was amazing, and no doubt I'm going again just for this. The Lychee Charlotte looks spectacular, but doesn't quite taste really good; far too sour for my liking. All-in-all, I definitely recommend this place for anyone! Good food, great service and even a bar (with a wide range of unique cocktails) makes it a winner in my book.",1
5,"Great atmosphere, great customer service and great food most importantly! They have a unique sauce that's really good!",1
3,"My wife and I were in London as part of our London/Paris anniversary trip. We were craving some good asian cuisine, and she found this neat little Ramen shop. The ambiance is great. Rock n' Roll music and communal tables. We got seated at a couple of bar seats looking out the window. The menu was easy to read and we both opted for two ramens, a chicken kaarage appetizer and I ordered an Asahi Beer.
About 10-15 minutes later, other folks that arrived after us started getting food, and we had not even received our beer or water. So after telling the staff, we got our drinks 3-5 minutes later. Then the food arrived and I had specifically asked if there was bean sprouts. He wasn't sure, so I said, okay, if there is, please put it on the side. 
Guess what I got in my ramen when it arrived? That's right, bean sprouts.  The food itself wasn't bad. Decent broth, plenty of noodles and meat. A bit too oily for my own taste, but oil in broth is individual preference.
Then we wanted our check. I asked for it, and that alone took another 10 minutes. We waited and waited. I finally started to lose my patience and asked again, this time I told the waitress that we've had a pretty poor experience here. The manager came back with a fair discount and apologized for the experience. Apparently the original waiter was a trainee, which begs the question why wasn't he ""mentored"" by an experienced server. Anyways, the manager's response and sincerity saved this review from being a 1 star. I don't believe this is typical service, so I'd still recommend folks to try them out. Cheers!",-1
3,"An Indian fry up?
In theory, bacon in naan bread smothered in chutney should have you telling your usual bacon butties to move over, dhal-ing.
In practise, it could do with a bit more tandoor oven care. 
My breakfast didn't blow me away. So when I'm nursing a hangover, I'll pass on Dishoom. Meet me down in the British caf. And pass the brown sauce.",-1
4,"Excellent food and fun environment. Nice and spicy. It's good if you have enough cash to buy a bunch of things, some wine, and chai to finish off. The rice was nicely cooked and the service helpful. Some folks in my party thought sitting in the basement was a downer, but it had nice ambience. Sadly, no opium pipes available, as a sign said.",1
5,"It's no wonder this place was packed with a 30 minute queue at weekday lunch. Thankfully we found seating at the bar and were able to order off the full menu. 
Service was fast and friendly. They have it down to a science but the only theory you need to know is that they make amazing, mouth watering food.
Starting with the fried okra that was well seasoned along with three dipping sauces. Then came the heavy hitters of spicy chicken tikka masala, perfectly baked garlic naan and lamb biryani. The biryani was served in a clay pot sealed with dough to lock in the warm goodness. Tender chunks of lamb accompanied the beautiful coloured rice. A cool raita helped it all go down.
Let's not forget about their interesting drink menu, featuring traditional Indian drinks or jazzing up classics like their sweet and smooth take on the Old Fashioned. 
Before finishing the meal and seeing the relatively inexpensive bill for a full meal with cocktails, I already proclaimed my desire to return. I can't wait to try more from their tempting kitchen.",1
5,"This is hands down the best (and consistently good) dim sum in London - I cannot rave enough about it. A friend of mine introduced Yauatcha to me a few months back. Now, having tried Hakkasan I didn't really have high hopes, but it rocked my taste buds to the core.
We usually go for dim sum (lunch) and have on occasion been for dinner. Between three of us we order about 10 dishes and drinks which only comes out to about £25 each. Some may think that is extortionate for dim sum, but how many places my friend, can you get perfect venison -melt-in-you-mouth pastry puffs? None. I've seen that Royal China have tried to add them to their menu - but they just cannot compete.
Other dishes we order frequently are the pork and chive dumplings, shanghai soup dumplings and all other regulars, think pork buns, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf etc. I have to admit I come here about once or twice a month, that is how much I love it. Service used to be a lot worse but I've seen some improvement in their waiting staff. The hostesses on the other hand could be a little friendlier. 
I also like, that unlike Royal China, you can make a booking and not have to show up at 11am on a Saturday morning just to get a table. As I've said before, hands down, best dim sum in London - and coming from someone who lived in Hong Kong for 18 yrs of my life, I am serious about my dim sum.",1
4,Not as good as the last time. Food is lovely but this just isn't running like a smoothly oiled machine like you would expect at a Michelin starred restaurant. I would come back but it just isn't doing as well as it did six months ago.,1
3,"Hmmm. Good idea, and nice and buzzy. Reasonable menu, with a few unusual dim sum, although portions are smaller, and prices higher, than Soho. But it's still good value  our lunch for two was £32 with flower tea, four dim sum and pud. Forget the tea with a flower  looks ok but not as nice as proper Chinese tea. I have enjoyed two meals here, but won't be deserting my Soho favourite  Joy King Lau.",-1
5,"I was secretly hoping to go to Hakkasan for a meal, so I while we were shopping at MUJI nearby I dragged hubby in here for a light dinner.  This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in London and I recommend Hakkasan to anyone who asks.
Super classy sexy place.  I liked the idea of the ""list"" and bouncer upstairs at the entrance.  Gives a feeling of exclusivity.  Of course we didn't have reservations  :-(.  But they just called down and it was no problem.  And they didn't seem fazed by the fact that we weren't dressed up at all (jeans, boots) and were loaded down with shopping bags.  When we got down the stairs they were expecting us, and took our jackets and seated us right away.  I liked the service was snappy.  
Although Hakkasan can be expensive, it doesn't have to be.  I might have mentioned this in my initial review but the dishes range from under £20 to over £30.  And there's plenty of choice throughout the entire price range.  Since we weren't that hungry we ordered the shanghai dumplings, dimsum platter and mapo tofu.  They also have an extensive cocktail menu.  Though not cheap at £10 each, they are incredibly good.  Real cocktails, not just cosmopolitans.
The shanghai dumplings were good but not as good as I've had living in SF.  I remember the dimsum platter being amazing, and while still good I think I've had more experience with high end dimsum.  I still think it's the best I've ever had but the comparison gap wasn't as large.  The map tofu was made with beef and it was amazing.  We were already full after the 2 starters but just couldn't stop eating the the tofu!  
Total meal was less than £50 for 2 starters, main, cocktail and tip.
Funny story about their obsession (good) with appearances, when tipping for the coat check we noticed that the dish had 3 pound coins arranged in it.  We added one more and received our coats to put on.  When we turn around they've removed one of the coins so there are only 3 again.  Only someone obsessed with design and aesthetics would ask the staff to do it.",1
5,"I had never been to an Indian Restaurant before this. I heard that London had some of the best Indian food in the world, so I decided it was the best time to try it. The atmosphere was really nice, and had a great setting to go with groups of friends. I had the spicy lamb chops and the cheese and garlic Naan. Service was great, would definitely return on my next trip to London!",1
4,"It's taken me years to finally make it to Ping Pong. Don't ask me why -- I've seen it around town and always meant to go, but for some reason I was never able to get around to it until yesterday. I'll set the scene. Its a frightfully Grey and painfully cold Monday. My Monday morning blues are immense and the vibe at my office is bleak, so my colleague and I decide to head out for some comfort food on our lunch hour. We headed for Southbank and the genius revelation to make this the day that I visit Ping Pong for the first time came about. Upon entering we were greeted by a lovely hostess who took us to our table and informed us of their lunch offer. £8 for an 8-item set meal plus a signature tea drink. Amazing and yes please! We placed our orders and I could feel the Monday blues leaving my system immediately. 10 minutes later we were surrounded by a plethora of food. For a mere £8 we each got.....4 steaming hot sticky chicken and prawn dim sum balls, sauteed mushrooms, steamed broccoli, hot and spicy chicken won ton soup, a steaming bowl of honeyed chicken breast and rice and a bottomless flowering green tea. By the end I literally felt like a Dim Sum. I was stuffed to the brim, happy as a clam and....ready for a nap. Sadly, we had to head back to the office, but my £8 delight definitely kept the spirits up all day. 
Our waiter was so lovely as well. He was extremely helpful and attentive and made our meal that much more enjoyable. 
Thanks Ping Pong! I'll most certainly be back...but I may have to skip breakfast next time around!",1
3,"Was not happy with the service.  The lady did not comprehend what I was asking. I ordered the regular ramen w the fried shallots and I had asked her if it was simply the basic ramen w the Pork and egg plus the added ingredient of fried shallots. Took me about Three minutes to ask what I needed to ask until I gave up and went with it. And she still didn't understand. Service was terrible overall 
The ramen was ok. A bit oily. I prefer kanada-ya ramen over shoryu",-1
4,"Only had a few dim sum (steamed) selections off the menu but they were all excellent. Very fresh tasting with great flavors. 
A more fusion feel that is probably very much Soho. Lots of Trendy crowded drinking at the bar while awaiting tables. My only complaint would be that we were seated at a table on the edge of the bar which makes for a bit if a non relaxed dining experience. But maybe this is because they fit us in without reservations. - not sure. Would definitely go back. Best to do with a colleague or someone else anyway.",1
4,"Love love this authentic Bombay cafe - I have heard about Dishoom almost as long as I have been in London and was excited to try here for dinner - there was minimal wait and we were able to wait at the bar anyway trying the whiskey sour and the far far chips (its made of lentils so should be healthy) for mains we went full veggie and got pau bhaji (delicious melt in your mouth), black daal (good if you like the creamy kind - felt like someone just dumped a huge vat of heavy cream in there mm) ans the mutter paneer which I adored since I am in love with this dish and this was one of the best ones I have tasted. Will be back to try their dessert and chai!",1
5,"This is possibly one of my favourite restaurants in London. Nestled only a short walk away from bustling Covent Garden is this extremely cute little place.
What is most striking is its interior. It is in a Georgian townhouse, and as soon as you enter you just feel like you're in a different world. Their website describes it as a 'romantic remembrance of stylish country inns in Provence and Tuscany', and they couldn't be more right. 
I have always dined in the conservatory of the downstairs dining area, with only around 7 tables, the space is very small, however you don't feel cramped at all. The ceiling is high, topped with a glass roof, allowing lots of natural light, and accentuated with the soft yellow glow of side lamps dotted around the room. Cherry blossom flowers are weaved around the walls, and at the end of the room is a fire place, it is simply the epitome of cosy and intimate. 
Unlike many high-end restaurants, the food comes in decent portions, and is well presented in a very creative manner. The menu is warm and filling from just reading through it, with a fusion of French flavours, and the ingredients are always fresh and  according to season. The dishes are hearty and sumptuous with such things as 'roasted fillet of 'Duke of Westminster' venison with prune and turnip gratin and bitter chocolate sauce', or 'treacle caramelised breast of Gressingham duck with poached figs, ruby port sauce.' 
The desserts are always perplexing to me as I can never seem to envision what exactly will be served from just looking at how it is described on the menu, but nevertheless, I am always impressed. 
They have a 3 course lunch menu for just under 20 pounds, an extensive, award winning wine list, and the staff are friendly and extremely attentive, but they don't linger. 
All in all, a very impressive place worth every penny for a visit!",1
4,"One of the most beautiful and impeccably-decorated period-style restaurants, with one caveat: you cannot book a table. This place would surely be 5 stars if they instituted a booking process. Waiting for an hour or more in the (a more than 50% chance of) rain is not the best way to start out a dinner. But the fact that we muddled through this uncomfortable process and still managed to enjoy our meals is probably testament to how great the atmosphere and food inside actually are. 
As other reviewers have mentioned, Dishoom is modeled off of Irani cafés that sprouted in Bombay in the early 1900s. Trying to emulate that upper-class convivial café culture while offering exotic twists on high-end cocktails, Dishoom has hit the nail on the head for Indian Chic. Everything is good. The garlic naan is luscious. The curries are outstanding. Don't forget the dals or chickpea dishes. Sublime! They service breakfast as well. The vibe here is ""come in and hang out."" If you can get in the door, that is.",1
4,"We went for a dim sum lunch, and I generally enjoyed it. 
Dim sums were good, ranging the shu mai, har gow, wild mushrooms dim sum and prawn cheng fun. We also had the beef hor fun noodles, which went nicely with the dim sums. Lastly, they had a rather modern and western desserts menu, which we enjoyed to top off the meal.
Having said all that, I wasn't so sure if it lived up to all the fame and hype. Everything was good, but I felt lacked a differentiating personality. 
Service was overall good, though our waiter was quite curt. He seemed to be in a bad mood, and our interactions were not very pleasant. 
Ambience was posh -- possibly the most modern and western dim sum place I've been to. A good choice if you're looking to impress whilst also enjoying down to earth dim sums. 
Overall, would recommend it, but don't keep your expectations up too high.",1
2,"Came here for breakfast with a group of Yelpers. The other half and I were the first to arrive at about 10:45. We sit there looking at the menu. The place is fairly empty. Ten minutes go by. I start staring at the servers (as there are TONS of them) to get someone's attention. I do. She says hello. She walks away. FINALLY one says, ""Has anyone been by to take your order?"" UH, bad start. We order water and two Bloody Marys. They took about twenty minutes. People who arrived at our table after us got drinks before us. Granted they weren't ordering booze, but in no way does it take twenty minutes to make two Bloody Marys. The server claimed that ""they take awhile to make"" but in reality she never really put the order in. They came eventually and were actually quite tasty.
The food was also very tasty. We ordered a bacon naan roll, sausage naan roll, egg naan roll, some spicy eggs on toast and a toasted bun to dip in Chai. The chili tomato jam that goes with the naan rolls (although they were just folded in half, not a roll) was pretty spectacular. The eggs on toast and bun were great too. 
It's just the service. It was so terrible. I'd understand if there was only one server, but there were tons of servers and it was so difficult to get ours to come by. We had to flag her down on multiple occasions to order something because we were ignored. The other half almost had to get his own water because it felt like the water wasn't going to come after we asked for it. I get that we were a large table, but we weren't really demanding, so why ignore us?
Also, I'm not sure why they don't serve their whole menu all day. The breakfast was good, but it would have been nice to supplement it with some of the regular menu (which also looked great).
Not sure we'll be back until they lose the laid back Shoreditch attitude. I want servers who actually want to work and not just stand around being hipsters.",-1
1,"A comedy of bad service. Don't buy the wine. They served probably the worst expensive Chablis I have ever had. They also failed to have almost any of the gluten free items on the menu. 
Finally they did not deliver one main. It was my main and I can't review the food because after a long wait I didn't eat. 
Dead loss.",-1
4,"I walked by this place for about a year until I realized that it was in fact a restaurant. Prior to that, I thought that maybe it was a post-production house (they're close to Technicolor and Deluxe) or maybe a bar or club. Or some other kind of trendy office type place. Turns out, it's a dim sum restaurant. And a good one, too! I went here with a lady who didn't seem to understand what good dim sum was. That's OK. I did. Or I pretended to. The menu is a little expensive but worthwhile, though I'd go to Ping Pong over this, any day. Really.
Awesome bathroom sink in the men's room. I know, who gives a shit? I don't know. It's the coolest bathroom sink I've seen in a restaurant. So, take that for what it's worth.
Sit upstairs if you can. Downstairs is darker and louder.",1
4,"So the whole entrance experience is pretty amazing - I felt like I was entering a James Bond villian's lair. Scary looking bouncer at the front checked the reservations list before letting us go down to the mysterious, dark-stoned lobby, where we were greeted by a clique of model-esque hostesses in hot pink dresses.
The restaurant is huge by London standards, very spacious with beautiful, modern Oriental style carved wood panels.
We had the Taste of Hakkasan set menu deal which was fantastic value. The miso cod was delicious as was the Rice Krispie dessert with pop rocks (!). The cocktails were also very tasty.
This place is just a shade away from being a bit too pretentious and overpriced - but I can thankfully report that the service, food and atmosphere were all great.",1
2,"Ridiculously expensive. I mean more than you think, much more!
We spent over £200 for 3 people, and the food was average, at least I thought it was. One of my guests thought the food was good. Either way, I won't be going back.",-1
1,Took my parents for their anniversary. Staff were very slow - took them 30 min to take our order and then even longer to serve us water. Manager came and apologised at end and offered to half the service charge - I said no I want it removed completely as this is horrible for a 5 star restaurant where we have paid 200 quid.. not worth food either - short menu nothing stands out and I wish we had gone to Gymkhana - much better service and you get what you pay for.,-1
5,"This is by far the best dim sum I've had in London.  It does not come cheap, for sure, but it's one of the restaurants that lives up to the hype.  Everything I tried was fantastic.  The only place where I saw a bit of room for improvement is in the fruity cocktails, which tasted a bit art artificial.  But overall, great stuff and I look forward to going back.",1
5,"Wow!  The cheapest, tastiest Chinese meal I've had in London.  A huge restaurant with 4 floors, and so efficient.  For people dining by themselves, sit on the main floor.  For larger parties, keep walking upstairs.....  
Like most Chinese restaurants, waiters are brusque and very fast.  Empty dishes seem to disappear in the blink of an eye.  The bill comes almost telepathically to your table.  
The food.... so good.  I had a roast duck noodles, which was all of £4.20?  Seriously?  It was delicious and filling and just what I needed.  I shall be back again.  
BTW - my rule of thumb for Chinese restaurants - usually it's good if a) there is a lot of bad grammar on the menus, plastic tablecloths, lots of people, it's slightly dirty, and brusque staff.  All achieved with Wong Kei.",1
4,"Is this place cheap? No... not at all!
But when it comes to a decent Indian food night, dishoom is definitely the top choice!
From the cocktails to just the quality of food, you can't fault anything (besides the price so get your wallets ready)!
Personally I thought for the price i expected even better but none the less it's a restaurant I'd come back to!",1
5,"I was a bit apprehensive to dine here after reading mixed reviews from Yelpers especially about whether it was deserving of its Michelin status. After one of the best Asian cuisine dining experiences I've had in London to date, it's a must! 
For the folks who want to try Yauatcha / those who might've been and didn't rate it all too highly - this is for you!
I don't ever post to sway your decision to return to a restaurant you mightn't have rated 5 stars on your first visit, but thought I had to share some dish recommendations that you absolutely need to try (disclaimer: I went with a group of friends, including one who gave it 5 stars (after a forgettable first time visit last year)) 
Here's what you must, must, must order!
- Jasmine tea smoked ribs
- Crispy duck roll
- Roasted duck pumpkin puff with pine nut
- Sticky rice
Make sure you save room for desert! 
- Raspberry delice 
- Any of their macarons (yes!)",1
1,"We had dinner on 10/22, meal was fine.  We paid our bill with our credit card, no problem.  Several weeks later we got out credit card bill and we had 2 charges for our dinner, one without the tip ($37), the second with the tip ($40.81).   
We've enjoyed dinner here in the past and haven't had any other problems.",-1
3,"Slow service. We were nicely welcomed and taken to our seats. Our waiter immediately got us started with drinks, but when more joined our table, he took their drink orders, but never delivered. I guess that's why you should write orders down :). Then we were left to wait around 50 minutes before he even got around to our food order. It didn't appear the place was short of staff, but efficiency was just not there. Perhaps we were unlucky.
So after over an hour, our food started to arrive. Portions for starters were small. Never have I seen samosas so small and only 3 to a plate for around £5. This place is pricey. But then things took a turn for the better. Extremely nice mains easily sharable for 6 people. The rotis are great with pretty much any dish. The gunpowder potatoes were sublime whilst the black dahl is perhaps a smidge overrated. Get the Chai tea and try some of the stranger desserts. The Pineapple and black pepper crumble was interesting. 
So if you have time to burn and a little cavalier when it comes to value for money, this place is an impressive modern indian fusion restaurant, particularly when it comes to the stranger choices on the menu. Better service would probably help this to 4 stars if I ever make it back.
Note: I was at the Shoreditch branch which was not particularly busy at the time on a weekday.",-1
5,"Loved this place! Great ambiance, felt really authentic, and very attentive service. The food is much more interesting than many of the Indian dishes I've eaten in the U.S. The cocktails were lovely as well, and prices on par for the neighborhood. The staff was also very accommodating when my friends and I were running late for our reservation.",1
2,"All flash no flavour.
As other reviewers have mentioned, the way, even on a Thursday night, is about 45 minutes to an hour. While you are awaiting,  you can hang out at the bar downstairs where they have Indian inspired cocktails.
My friend ordered the Boybam Pina Colada which was okay. It just tasted heavily of coconut milk and some 'Indian' spices. That being said, the atmosphere was lovely, the decor is very classy and the lighting makes for a great vibe. 
We ordered the samosas to start which were £4.00 a portion. Not. Worth. It. They are the packaged kind that you can get at any Sainsbury's or Tescos so avoid them if you can. The papadoms are delicious as is the naan bread. The curry is mediocre. Nothing you can't / won't get at a local Indian delivery place. 
In summation, go for the vibe but not the flavour.",-1
3,"OK, everybody has heard about Wong Kei - especially how it 'used to be'. Well, now, I think most people think of this place as 'where can I get a good portion of Chinese food at a good price?' - well, this is the place.
 First tip upon entering is to ignore the waiters on the ground level trying to get you seated straight away on this level - they only do this so the tourists outside will see a busy restaurant and think it must be popular. I would continue walking passed them explaining you have friends upstairs waiting - as the nicest tables and environment are upstairs. My experiences of unfortunately being seated on the ground level is noise, bustle, flies (in the summer) and drafts.
 The food is plentiful, and usually tastes very good. My personal favourite is the Sweet&Sour Chicken with Rice. But the cheap Jasmin tea isn't something to savor, so I'd skip it for a beer or coke.
 We often bring groups of friends here for dinner, so much so that 'Mr Man' (the manager, I am told) often throws in a free extra dish :-)",-1
1,"Walked in randomly for dinner Because there was a decent number of people inside... Thinking this must be great food. 
I was abruptly rushed to seat w strangers - ""share table"" the guy said. So I sat down and ordered chicken drumstick w roast pork over rice. 
I ate a few bites and I'm like this sauce is gravy and it's totally not what I'm used to in real Chinatowns like NYC. Our sauce is more soy sauce w some oil and it's definitely more fragrant and tasteful. 
I barely touched my food. I arrived back to my apt and the food was not settling well in my stomach. I had thrown up. Afterwards I had a small snack or two and I felt better. 
I will not come back nor should you visit this restaurant",-1
2,"Good service. All the waiters and waitresses are nice. However as a Chinese from Canton I have to say, the dim sum here is not good. There are a lot of English-Chinese dim sum. We ordered some classic dishes like Ha Gau and it is not salty enough. It's not expensive but I won't go again.",-1
3,"Slightly disappointing, but maybe because I expected too much.
 Some tables are better than others. My table was too close to the next one, and didn't have the sparkly pretty lights near it! :-)
 Food was good without being exceptional. Service was a bit slow and didn't feel special.
 Very pretty restaurant if you have a nice table, with/near the fairy lights!",-1
3,Went there at 10pm for a quick feed up. Taste almost the same as the ramen I had in US. Nothing special except being a bit too oily for me though but still not bad.,-1
2,"Please avoid. Cheap but untidy. Doesn't taste bad per-say, but I certainly wouldn't say it tastes good. I'm a tourist from New York City, and this sure left a bad impression of Chinatown on me until I visited other restaurants surrounding this place.
London Jade Garden down the street is so amazing and authentic, please don't come here and ruin your appetite.",-1
3,"The food was pretty good, portions not huge and glasses were a bit dirty. Overall it was a good experience, but the waiters were a bit too pushy with drinks and food, continuously suggesting to get double of everything and more of this more of that. If you're in central and craving Indian this is good place",-1
2,"mediocre food, mediocre menu. Should've gotten a 3 but the place was ridiculously chaotic in my experience. I made reservation for 2:30, they made us wait near the entrance where kids and strollers are running around all over the place. Stressed out with low blood sugar level, it was a bad start to begin with.
To the menu. I saw guotie (potstickers) on the menu, it was a chinese wait staff so I spoke in Chinese. and she repeated my order saying that it's steamed dumplings. I was like guotie HAS to be fried. that's the meaning of the words. She pointed to the english translation that it's steamed. If that's the case the chinese name should've been jiaozi  definitely NOT guotie .
To the hongyouchaushou  . It's a shanghainese dish and shanghainese dumpling wrappers are different from the cantonese ones. Ours are made with just white flour. The fact that they used Cantonese dumpling wrapper for my hongyouchaushou   is borderline offensive.
Overall the quality of the food wasn't that great. I much prefer Shanghai Blues for similar price and much better ambience. The bill took forever to come and the place is just poorly organized. I'm glad that I tried it and checked it off the list but probably won't go back there again.",-1
3,I came back in two years and it hasn't changed much. Food was good. Prawn tempura was perfectly cooked and ramen had good flavors. I would give it a solid 4 stars but the service. There were too many of them but not well coordinated. They seemed to trip over each other.,-1
5,"So good! From the House cocktails to the finish. A co-worker recommended and I'm sad it's my last day, so I can't have again before I leave. Definitely on the list for next trip over!
Everything we had exceeded expectations. Watch out though! Some of the dishes are spicy! But so full of flavor, you can't regret it.",1
5,Fantastic fusion.  Great take on traditional Chinese food.  Makes me want to move to London.,1
1,"*Very rude behaviour*
Apparently there's a rule that the order should exceed 15 pounds per person.
We were a party of four visiting - one of us wasn't too hungry and our order fell short initially. The waiter first pointed the rule out to us with a rude ""can't be done.""
After finding out about the rule, we told the waiter that we'll order dessert in the end to cover the difference. Yet again the waiter in his border line accusatory tone said ""what if you don't?""
My Rating is not because of the rule - the restaurant is entitled to keep it. However, I do think the waiters could do a much better job of explaining it to customers understanding that they're not thieves trying to trick them.",-1
2,"I've tasted fantastic Chinese food and this place definitely is NOT fantastic Chinese food. 
We ordered beef ho fun noodle and wonton soup noodles and they were both subpar, according to my Hong Kong parents. The table next to us was eating Peking duck, and the duck looked like it had been hacked by an amateur. 
Service is where it gets bad. They looked mad when we asked for extra bowls and chopsticks. And, when we asked to ""add tea"", the waiter looked at us in disbelief and said ""add tea??"" He then took away our tea pot and didn't return it for the duration of our meal. 
What kind of Chinese restaurant is surprised that it's customers drink tea? Tea is like, all Chinese people drink. 
Finally, the servers got mad when we walked up to the counter to pay, as if they were afraid we were going to run. As we left, a server was arguing with a customer, who yelled that the server ""didn't know how to treat women."" The server just stood smugly at the door with his arms crossed and didn't let those customers in. We didn't get the whole deets but you get the point, service is terrible. 
To be honest, when I look back at this experience, it's so ridiculous it's funny.",-1
2,"Went here for lunch on a weekday afternoon and sat outside on the patio. Loved the ambiance of the area. The food was also quite good, if not a little overpriced. I ordered the sea bass, and had a good crab donut starter.
However, the service I have to say was one of the worst I've received at a restaurant. I don't know if it was the way we were dressed (didn't dress too formally, it was lunchtime) or something else, but the waitress was rude and not friendly at all. It's a shame as the environment is so beautiful. If you're going to be paying £30 for a single dish, the service better be up to par! Won't be returning.",-1
3,"For celebrity-spotting you go to Nobu, but for politician-spotting you go to the Cinnamon Club - Westminster's top-choice for power lunches and after-debate drinks. I GUARANTEE you that if you get lunch here mid-week you'll see at least one cabinet minister. After all, Cinnamon Club is sandwiched between ministries and it's much more patriotic to be seen eating Indian food than French or Japanese. Such is our perverted world.
You dine in a beautiful old hall lined two-floors high with books on all walls. The lighting is good and it's real excellent white tablecloth service through and through (as you'd expect from the high prices). It's worth also visiting the dungeon-like basement which has a small but stylish cocktail lounge. 
So far, so good. But what of the food? Almost a decade ago Michelin made it the world's first Indian starred restaurant and Gordon Ramsay isn't shy at telling everyone how much he loves the cuisine here, but I found it underwhelming. My lamb dish lacked the sucker-punch I expected of sub-continent cooking and the mouthfuls I filched from my lunchmates solidified my thoughts... if you come in here thinking of the rich flavours and tastes of Indian food you'll only be disappointed, if you come in here having spent the last month dining on the bland subtleties of French food you'll love it.",-1
3,"I booked a table at Veeraswamy as it brought back childhood memories and  was disappointed that the authentically dressed 'bouncer' wearing turban and massive sabre, who terrified me as a child wasn't standing vigil on our arrival.
The restaurant is extremely snazzy and has a great ambience. The service was attentive without being intrusive. The food was very good, although portions were small considering the prices, but that's Regent Street for you I suppose. 
We enjoyed our meal, but were starving first the next morning. I am disappointed to say that it didn't quite meet my expectations having dined there regulary 'some' years ago.",-1
3,"Yauatcha is stunning Chinese restaurant by the world famous Alan Yau. The restaurant is very chic with alluring nightclub décor. The tables are quite close together and the restaurant is always busy so the atmosphere runs at quite a high tempo.
The reason for coming to Yauatcha though is for the food. The menu is a playground of different flavours some of which are truly innovative.
With over 24 different Dim Sum, 150 teas and a kaleidoscope of brightly coloured pastries on display that can be boxed and taken home, Yauatcha is a place to indulge and spoil yourself, but be warned, it is expensive.",-1
4,"The original Hakkasan on Hanway Place gives sexy cool a whole new meaning. The entrance is a bit hidden in the corner but once you locate the bouncer at the door, the location is easily given away.  We arrived at 8:30 on a Sunday night and the place was hopping. You have to make your way down a dark staircase to the Uber cool cavernous space which opens up to a giant multi-room restaurant with super high ceilings and very minimalist and tasteful decor. The bathrooms are so well hidden the panel doors look like part of the wall. They're very beautiful inside once you find them! 
We made our way to the bar for a cocktail after we requested a table with side by side seating (which they were happy to accommodate with a modest wait). The bartender has apparently been with the hakkasan family for 8 years starting in Abu Dhabi and now taking up residence at the original london location. He informed us that despite the crowd we were seeing that evening that this was a particular quiet night and that the place is usually so packed that the wait at the bar can be quite long. We opted for the London only cocktails specifically the Tusan Fizz  and Mountain Peak. Watching the bar tender make these cocktails was like watching an artist at work.. and they were just as tasty as they were beautiful. 
We decided to try the three style mushrooms and the London only spicy okra for our vegetarian dishes. We also ordered the spicy prawns. But the two stars without question were the crispy duck salad and the sweet and sour pork....omg...heaven on a plate. 
The desserts at our neighboring table looked elaborate and yummy but we were so full. The service here was so wonderful. We chatted with several servers during the course of our meal and they were attentive, friendly and doting without being overbearing. 
We loved this place so much we vowed to try the NYC location as soon as we return stateside. And we will be making our way there with very high expectations in just a few weeks! 
From what I understand the newer Mayfair location in London has parking and is busier than this one, but there's something about this venue that just oozes ""trendy"" and the mystique is just hard to replicate.",1
2,"Stopped in at around 2000 hrs on a Saturday evening. There was plenty of seating, so I sat in the main dining room and ordered the beef chow fun. The version they served was a gloppy, soupy mess, with pieces of noodle and beef swimming in an unidentifable sauce. It was definitely not the sauteed rice noodles I expected. So I'd stay away -- given the huge number of choices in the immediate area, you can do a whole lot better elsewhere for about the same prices.",-1
5,"I had an absolutely wonderful time here. We brought a group of 14 people (which ordinarily would be quite chaotic) but we were well fed and watered by the end of our two hours here. I would easily recommend the Chicken Berry Britannia biryani as one of the better biryanis I've ever had, and the raita is worth the extra 3 pound splurge in my opinion. Also make sure to have some of the chai if you can! I would easily recommend this place to friends.",1
3,"Good ramen. Has a nice spice to it and plenty of broth.
Service could use some work. They had us wait for 30 minutes, I got up and asked what was going in, then they informed me there was a mix up in the kitchen and our order was coming soon.
If someone had proactively said this, I would deal with it.. but I saw 3 people that got there after we ordered get their food, so they had plenty of time to let us know. The whole thing just soured the experience.
The manager compd our appetizer which was nice, but I didn't like that no one bothered to acknowledge the screw up before I had to go and ask.
I might give this place another try, but not if they are too busy.",-1
2,"Yelp, you really effed me over on this one. Dishoom was by far our most disappointing meal of our 10 day U.K. trip. London is known for their top notch Indian food so I was expecting this place to blow me away. Instead, it just made me homesick. 
I toughed out the 90 min wait because I knew London on a Saturday night would be ridiculously crowded. I hated that we couldn't leave the restaurant while we waited like you often can in the states. They still use the old beeper system, and it took 20 min to get to the hostess stand to get it. We spent the rest of the time in the bar. 
Service in the bar was awful. The waitress got orders from three other parties around us, but we were ignored. We flagged her down when she returned with their orders quite some time later. We snacked on the pau bhaji which was spicy and unique, like Indian sliders. I got some chai to warm up, and that did the trick.
We were seated three different places. First the hostess offered to seat is ""somewhere more quiet"" when a large party took over our area. Apparently, ""somewhere more quiet"" was directly next to the fiery hot kitchen on a high top. No thanks. The third place was just right. 
I got paneer tikka, and my husband got prawns korma, some of our favorites at home. Dishoom's versions were way more expensive and not nearly as good. My husband's prawns were small and didn't come with the creamy sauce we were expecting. My paneer tikka was just pieces of cheese with a slice of bell pepper in between. That's it. Luckily, we did get the black lentils and garlic naan, and those were standouts. 
Anyone going to London, please ignore the high star rating of this place and try somewhere else.",-1
2,"We booked Balthazar for a pre-theatre supper on my birthday. First impressions were great as we arrived early to have drinks at the busy bar. It had a buzzy atmosphere at 5pm and we ordered drinks whilst we waited for our table. I had an Aperol spritz which was watery and rather expensive for 9.50 but we perused the menu which sounded good and got shown to a nice corner table. This is where it all started to unravel. The wine list is ludicrously expensive and we ordered two half bottles as the house wines did not appeal. I ordered saffron risotto to start which had 1.1/2 (!) scallops on the top. It arrived with a skin on it so had either been sat waiting to be served or had been microwaved to high heaven. My boyfriend's game pate was not pate, more like a thick over seasoned terrine. Bread was a little stale and butter ice cold. My main was 1/2 a lobster which arrived served on a bed of ice with no fork or cracker to open it. Every time I tried to get some flesh out it was submerged in a slushy, icy bath and it felt like I got an 1/8 of a lobster! Pretty revolting and served with what appeared to be Heinz seafood sauce. My boyfriend's duck shepherd's pie was greasy, small and swimming in fat. All in all the bill came to £160 which we certainly anticipated, but for this price range you would expect high quality French food. We will not be returning, considering brasserie Zedel is not too far away and has a far more spectacular ambience for half the price I cannot believe Balthazar gets away with the terrible expensive food it has to offer. Please save your money and go elsewhere! London has so much more to offer than this overpriced mediocrity!",-1
3,"Well Maintained, has a very long bar... was the longest in london for a while... however for a chinese person there is f***g good food. highly recommended. :)",-1
3,"I was really looking forward to this place, and the food was definitely good, but it was incredibly expensive for what we were served. My husband and two kids spent $300 on lunch (lunch!) and the food was good but didn't blow me away. I don't spend that kind of cash to have a decent lunch.",-1
3,"The line up was an hour long so was it was it? In my opinion, no. Overall it was ok but I just don't see what the hype is about.
You can tell it was full of tourists that come because the number of reviews.
We had the fried okra and calamari for starters then the dahl which was good, the lamb chops which tasted a tad burnt then the cheese panner which had a nice tomato tasting sauce. The namm is a small portion.
The place a machine, in and out.",-1
5,"Dishoom, literally a stones' throw away from my office in Shoreditch, had long since been a haunt of ours for after work drinks. Somehow over the last year or so, our post-office sessions had taken us to a pub down the road, but I think that had more to do with the arrival of new faces, replacing our favourites who went on to open the new Kings Cross site or moved on to new adventures. That said, the guys are still friendly and all is well, but there is just something that is always welcoming about people recognising you, knowing your tipple of choice, having a bit of banter and showing their appreciation for your interest in their passion for making cocktails.
Recently, I re-kindled my affair with Dishoom, not just once, but twice in a 5 day period. A catch up with an old friend brought us here for dinner and we were not disappointed. Now, we had wanted a quiet one, so debated going here because it can be quite loud with the music and people packing out the bar. My recommendation is that you do not let this put you off, as the terrace area provides the calm if you are not up for the chaos.
This was to be a night of feasts, so we ordered a selection of small plates including chilli cheese toast (cheddar), okra fries (fried, well-seasoned and a great snack) and calamari (tiny tender calamari, but no skimping on the portion size). For my main, it was Masala prawns, served slightly charred with a side of lime. Meaty and tasty. I also had some cheesy nan on the side. Valentina had the Lamb Raan bun which is slow cooked pulled lamb on sourdough bread with a side of Dishoom slaw, sali crisp chips and fried green chillies. The lamb was so delicate, so there is no doubt that this is produced slowly. The combination of all these bits piled individually on the wooden serving board, complement each other so well. Be wary of the green chillies, they are spicy! My overall advice would be to also take a raita if you are opting for non-sauce based dishes, otherwise it will be quite a dry meal. 
For drinks, we started with a refreshing prosecco, followed by a Sicilian white for me (Parva res Catarratto) and a full bodied red from Puglia for Valentina who is Sicilian (Terre di Montelusa Primitivo). Complimentary water is provided which is a great touch.
Dishoom has four sites now, in great locations. What I like is that each has their own specials, this helps retain individuality. There is no chance that this will become some boring chain as the food has bags of personality, the concept is sexy and it has what all restaurateurs covet, a team of good solid folk working there.",1
4,"The place was quite fancy inside all the waitresses/hostesses were in red so easily seen.
I sat and ate at the bar. The dim sum was really good.
Cocktails were good to and had lovely detail.
Highly recommended but recommend booking.",1
3,It used to be a great restaurant. Management changed and not the same anymore. Avoid on sundays since there are 3 main dishes only.,-1
3,"There wasn't a line at all when I went on a weekday around 12:30pm. The place was mostly empty with a few people dotted here and there throughout. Service was quick and efficient but not exactly warm and fuzzy. It did fill up in the next hour with people mostly there for business lunch and a few solo female shoppers with masses of shopping bags. 
The meal itself wasn't bad. Steak medium was exactly medium, served with more fries than steak. The sauce looked mustardy and oily and tasted bland. I actually added mustard from the jar on the table to give it a kick. Walnut salad was iceberg lettuce drenched in a bland mustard dressing but had no walnuts. Baguette was near perfect though. A glass of wine came filled exactly to the pre-drawn line. 
Overall, this place was ok but I wouldn't wait any amount of time. Branches in other cities, including the original Paris location are fairly busy but there is usually no wait.",-1
5,"delectable dining, hidden away from the hustle and bustle of w1. dark, delicious interior with fantastic lighting, professional service, sleek design and, most importantly, divine dishes that will raise the bar when it comes to 21st century chinese cuisine.",1
5,"GREAT time! The dining room was booked, so we ate in the bar--even more fun! Seek out bartender David for exceptional drinks and service!",1
5,"Last time i visite London, i wants to eat sth. from asia.
So i go to this restaurant and it was amazing.
It was tasty and delicious.",1
5,"I celebrated my upcoming 40th with 14 of my friends here. I was a bit concerned about the service considering it's a hot spot and we were a large party, but I have to say, their service was superb, I wish I could remember the name of our waiter since he deserves a public rave. 
I'm not an Indian food fan and dishoom changed that. The food was simply incredible and every dish was full of unique flavours. 
I highly recommend this place.",1
3,"This is my third time coming to this Dishoom location, as I make it my priority to visit any time I am in London because the food is AMAZING, but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of the 5 it had in my heart before is because of an experience I had on April 20th. My boyfriend and I arrived around 8:30pm to the restaurant knowing it would most likely be a long wait because of how popular the restaurant is and the time of day, but this was his first time in London and I was determined to have him try one of the best restaurants in the city. We wait for about an hour but we're offered complimentary drinks and able to look at the menu beforehand, so we had no issue with that. 
This is where things went left. When we finally were seated, our waiter asked if we'd been there before and after he hurriedly explained the menu it took him another 20 minutes to take our order (after we flagged him down of course). After we received our food from another waiter we did not see our waiter for the duration of our meal. No refills, no asking if the meal was good and everything was to our liking, nothing. He constantly checked on his other 2 tables and laughed it up with his co-workers. He even reached over our table to give his co-worker a receipt but didn't address us at all. It wasn't until we asked another waiter to get a manager so we could explain the situation. that he finally came to the table, but this time...only to clear our plates. He still said nothing. The manager had to check us out and offered a free dessert for the problem, but it was not about a free dessert, as we declined. It was about the blatant disrespect and overt dislike for people of color from this waiter that we wanted to bring to the manager of the establishment. It's an Indian restaurant for goodness sake. Do not hire people who clearly are not willing to serve everyone.",-1
3,"OK if you're on account but not worth the money if you're picking up the bill
Pros: The conservatory in the back with the ceiling that opens up is nice, and if you don't mind a bit of camp the foliage decor can be sweet. Solid service.
Cons: Decent food but not worth the mark-up. For a nice meal, there are so many better options in Covent Garden. 
Not much more to say",-1
3,"Amazing space - very nice withour being too pretentious. I really just loved looking around. (Be prepared for the camouflaged toilets though!)
 The food was good, but my verdict at the end of the night was 'Michelin star Chinese food is still just Chinese food'
 We had a couple starters, calamari and duck with mango, which were both lovely.
 For mains we had pork belly and some sort of chicken. Both were just ok. Definitely not worth the price, but better than your average takeaway place.
 (But for as much as you pay here, it better be a hell of a lot better than just your average takeaway place!)",-1
3,"We wanted to go to Homeslice around the corner but the wait was too long and so decided to go here instead since there was sort of a small queue and we always passed by it wanting to try it out. The food is good. The daal Makhani tastes like my moms and that almost brought tears to my eyes :') the service is O-Kay at best and the ambience is also a bit strange. Overall good food, but I don't know if I'll go back again!",-1
5,"You always know it is a good restaurant when you see a long line of people waiting outside, even when it is cold. Bone Daddies is such a place. I passed by it several times without knowing its name, but only identified it as the busy Japanese place in Soho. 
A few days ago, I took advantage of dining out on my own and presented myself to the host as a lone diner and got seated immediately. As I was rushing to something else, so I just ordered Tonkotsu (Pork) Ramen, which seemed to be the only option in my opinion, because all other ramen comes with chicken broth. I am no expert in ramen, but I have eaten enough of it to develop a taste for thick and creamy broth that only seems to come with pork bone broth. I was not disappointed, as a matter of fact, I think it is the best ramen I tried in London! The broth was thick and creamy, the noodle was al dente and the eggs had semi-runny yolk. It was perfect. If I had to complain about one thing, I wish I had a bit more broth! Oh, yes, don't forget to help yourself and add some extra fixings to you bowl: you can grind your own sesame (please do, it adds so much taste to your noodle), mesh you own garlic (only for the brave and no meeting other people afterwards eaters), and chili oil. All I can say is Yummy! I can't wait to come back and give the chicken bone broth a go and also try out some appetizers everybody raves about.",1
5,really good food. the wait can get quite crazy with a line out the door. if you've got the time for that you won't be disappointed. cocktails are interesting and delicious as well. black dal and mahi tikka are to die for!,1
4,"Confession: it's controversial, but I don't think I really like ramen. I've tried supposedly good places in the past and not been impressed so thought I'd give it one last crack at the grand daddy. Bone Daddies was actually great. I don't think I'm a convert but it was definitely good, super tasty! If you're a ramen lover you'll like it!",1
3,"A good atmosphere with nice decoration, which attracts a lot of customers - the place is pretty much full by 7pm. 
We tries 8 dishes, to be honest, the taste is average...xiao long bao was overs-teamed and dried up inside, so are a few other dishes. The only best dish is the special dessert green tea custard bun - however green tea paste is more like green bean paste with green colouring. 
The service is often delayed here but not fault of the waiters or waitresses, this place is just understaffed!!",-1
5,"Amazing place with the best Indian food I have ever tasted, great atmosphere, and all dished out in really genuine and polished service. Had the Ruby chicken (out of this world), black daal (amazing), and cheese naan (crazy good).  Loved the place. Wish we had one in the States.",1
2,"OK I know I'm going against the grain here but bear with me.  I went a couple of weeks ago for the first time with Lucy who raves about it so I had high expectations. A major bonus was the fact that due to volcanic activity (what else?), mutual friend's flight was seriously delayed so we arrived about 45mins after we had the table booked for.  There was no problem with this, despite the fact that it is nearly always fully-booked so that was great. Lucy noted that the prices had gone up since the last time she'd been, so while still cheap (7.45, specials of the day around 9 or 10 pounds), not as cheap as they used to be.  My starter was great, my steak was cooked to perfection but not of the highest quality as I was still chewing it over literally 10 minutes after Lucy and friend had finished. Not a good look! The sticky toffee pudding (a passion of mine) was a little dry and not as sticky as it should have been.
I thought I'd give it another go for boyfriend's birthday meal as everyone else seems to think it's amazing so I wondered if I'd gone on an off-night. 
Not so, sadly.  The maitre d' sat us, a waiter brought over some wine (complementary wine! How thoughtful!) but it wasn't ours and turned out to be the first of many errors of the evening.  After some time, the maitre d' took our order without writing it down (why do people do this? I've been a waitress and could NEVER remember orders without writing them down - it turns out that this guy couldn't either) so when the starters came, I got the soup I'd ordered, boyfriend got something he didn't.  It was replaced quickly though and we had complementary bread and butter to keep us going which is a plus. 
My soup was a disappointment though. French onion is another passion of mine but I make it far better than what I was given - watery, thin, with little flavour.  Boyfriend's poached pear with blue cheese was lovely though. 
Some 45 minutes after we had had our starter, I asked where our main courses were and they arrived soon after. I think 45 minutes is a very long time between courses and we were filling up on bread.
Anyway, for main I had pork belly which I'd expected to be a slice of meat layered with fat and with a nice chunk of crackling on top. Again, not so. It was a huge lump of tasty pork, not a scrap of crackling to be seen and not enough jus to counteract the dryness of the meat.  I ended up drinking so much water with it (I can't leave meat, an animal has died for this so I'm not wasting any of it!) that by the end of the meal I was absolutely full to bursting. So much meat and you only get vegetables / chips etc if you order them (1.95 on top) which presented another problem. I ordered a side salad (mixed leaves, 4 slices of cucumber with only the slightest hint of dressing, 1.95 seems very steep for that) while boyfriend ordered chips and a vegetable selection which it seems the maitre d' forgot.  When we reminded him, we were shortly presented a plate of beans, new potatoes and the oddest carrots which looked like they had been boiled, then left in a low oven for many hours so that all the water had been removed from them. Wrinkled, dehydrated and burnt around the edges. Very strange and not nice to eat! 
By the end of all that, I wasn't hungry for dessert which is just as well as it took another 20 minutes to get the bill.  
Not bad in that the whole thing was 35.00 for 2 people with a glass of wine and a beer but I wonder if we're all mistaking good value for cheap?
Let me know if I'm wrong, but I'm not charmed by Le Mercury.",-1
4,"When I walked into Bone Daddies with a friend, it was really crowded, but we only had to wait a few minutes until we were seated. The server was friendly and the ramen was really good. Broth was flavorful and I liked the option to put different toppings on. My only complaint that it was too salty for my taste. However, that's more of a reflection of my individual taste because my friend didn't agree with me.",1
5,"bit on expensive side, service can be slow at times when busy, but food is delish! Been a few times already. Can't think of one dish we didnt like and coctails are amazing",1
5,"Obviously this place is Amazon and it's Michelin star is well deserved.  I think the only thing I would call out is that next time, I may just come back for the dim sum.   It was probably the best I have ever had and the black pepper rib eye was only very good.  The same dish is probably topped by the Chinese restaurant at the Royal Harden Hotel, which is amazing.",1
4,"+ Perfect soft-boiled egg
+ Full-bodied flavor of the soup
+ Nice appetizers (try the spareribs, YUM!)
+ Great touch with readily available hair ties to hold back the hair when working on the ramen!
+ Hooks on the wall for purses and jackets!
- The seating.. not a fan of bar stools.. need that back support
- A bit on the pricey side for a bowl of ramen.. but I guess this holds true for all areas with not a big Japanese population",1
3,"Visited this bakery a couple of times now for lunch. They do really tasty sarnies, and normally I'm not a huge sandwich fan. The bread they use is really good and the fillings are quite interesting - I've tried the roast beef and celeriac slaw in a focaccia and the ham and butter baguette - it has hidden tiny gherkins! Yum! They sell salad boxes and lots of different yummy looking cakes (unfortnately haven't sampled any yet).
The bakery has a couple of counter style seats inside but not many. The place is quite pricey for a bakery but I would say worth it if you need a lunch time treat to brighten your day!",-1
5,"My husband and I have decided that Dishoom is probably one of our top two Indian food restaurants. I've had Indian food in LA, NY, DC, Virginia, Tanzania, every gosh-darn place I've lived (unfortunately India is not on that list) and still Dishoom is  a top two in my life. First, the ambience is really elegant and comfortable (except for the privileged jerk who was seated next to our table who treated the servers in an incorrigible way). Despite having to deal with the prick, the staff was gracious and patient. 
Like what many reviewers say, this place has an hour long (or more) line but they gave us chai tea for free as we waited. We ordered their signature dishes: lamb raan, black dahl. No words can describe the flavors experiences from the lamb tan. It was exquisite. As for the black dahl, my husband threatened to become a vegetarian if he could have this dish every day, and the man is a tried and true carnivore! I've never been to a place where the side dish was actually the centerpiece of our meal. We couldn't have enough of it! Great Indian food and if you're a visitor in London looking to experience the best Indian food there, like we were, look no further.",1
2,"The food was okay (though a warning, the hot pot isn't like shabu shabu, it is literally rice in a warm pot) and the portion sizes were pretty good. The service was very brusque and it felt like we were being rushed out the door. Compared to the Chinese food I've had in the US, it wasn't particularly good and seemed very greasy. Though it was better than Panda Express and it was a pretty cheap meal, I won't be going again.",-1
1,"I had my doubts about the place from the moment we stepped in and saw the drab, dingy, stained, and discolored carpets, matched by carpet-upholstered chairs.  As we were ushered to the back room we were hit with the stench of industrial cleaner that permeates the restaurant.  What odor(s) are they trying to hide?  The stench was ever-present, and we didn't get used to it as the dinner progressed.
They tried to seat us in the back room in between two busy, loud tables even though every single other table in that room was open.  We asked to be reseated to a table in a different row, and after they checked with the host at the front, they obliged our request, but appeared to be unnerved that we had disrupted their normal seating pattern.
The food?  In a word, subpar.  I started with a mango lassi, which normally should be cool, thick, and creamy.  Punjab's mango lassi was tepid, watery, and bland.  I strongly believe that it was pre-mixed or came straight from a carton before being watered down substantially to cut on costs.  I didn't finish it.  We ordered a few of the dishes that had received rave reviews on yelp -- the chicken tikka masala, grandpa's daal, a saag dish, and garlic naan.  I wanted to like these dishes -- even just one -- but all were unflavorful and disappointing.
If this restaurant were located outside the touristy Covent Garden area, I highly doubt it would survive or would earn the same *shockingly* high yelp ratings.  I would rate Punjab among the bottom tier of Indian restaurants I've eaten at in my life.
Don't go.",-1
3,"FOOD & DRINKS
We had TanTanMen (veggie & non veggie version) and the soft cocktail. The cocktail was very refreshing but the watermelon is a bit lost in the cocktail. If you were looking for a deep watermelon taste this might disappoint you. For me it was not amazing but pretty good.
I had veggie and non veggie ramen in London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, San Diego, Toronto... and I have to say that the ramen I had here are not in my top ten. They were good but it already started with the presentation. I couldn't see any love there. Even a ramen for 5 bucks in Tokyo sometimes had a better presentation than the bowl I had in front of me. As for the taste I had to say it was a tad to bitter for me. But that is just my own preference. I think the quality was ok and the meat was very tender. The egg was amazing!!
You also can add fresh garlic and a chili paste to your ramen. Top!
SERVICE
I think the staff were nice and attentive. Only can say good things about them and all of them look pretty cool. 
ATMOSPHERE
Well it is different from a japanese style ramen restaurant. I would describe it as hip or alternative which is also reflected by the staff working there and I absolutely love it. Why shouldn't a ramen shop not be cool, hip or just different? 
RATING
I think I would have given this restaurant a 4 if it had left a big impression on me since I already had ramen in other places in London. I must admit I like the ramen at other places more. Maybe next time I will try a different ramen and then the rating will be better!",-1
2,"I  am so disappointed!! 
I love Indian food, and after reading all those good reviews, I decided to give it a go. I went once, I won't go twice. 
Me and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch, the restaurant was empty, which was good after hearing stories of queues in front of the restaurant. 
I ordered Chicken Tikka Massala with plain rice. What a shame. The chicken was well cooked, but my tikka massala sauce was just disgusting. It was way too salty and just not good. Didn't taste of tomato at all. I have made tikka massala myself and I know what goes in there. No idea what they put but it was not good. 
My boyfriend ordered Lamb Korma. We had tasted better. 
In all, Marks and Spencer is better quality and it actually tastes better... If you feel like Indian good, honestly, don't waste your money, or else, go somewhere else.",-1
4,"The reputation of the place precedes it, which often means that there is tendency for high expectations and middling reality...but Yauatcha (with endless vowels in its name) delivered. It proved to be an excellent brunch spot (my favourite meal, obviously) - delicate teas, freshly prepared dim sums and other hot foods with excellent ingredients, a very stylish clientele and responsive but unobtrusive service. I heartily encourage everyone to save some appetite for the excellent range of desserts on offer too.",1
5,"When I first visited Dishoom, I was greeted by a staggering queue on a cold, London winter night. But thankfully I stuck around. We were served shots of their naughty cholocate chai, which instantly quelled my frosty nose and met with very helpful, friendly service to guide us through our wait.
I've returned to both Dishoom locations many times and have always been met with fresh, zesty cocktails, impeccable atmosphere, perfect service and of course, absolutely mouth-watering food! Every visit prompts me to order the simple, yet delicious far far, ultra-rich and satisfying black daal and the ever-tasty okra fries topped off with a refreshing East India gimlet.
Both locations have a great environment for socialising and sharing plates, and with reasonable prices a visit (or three) is a must!",1
2,"Perhaps this restaurant is only cater to customers who live in London that are not Chinese. Thus my review will be bias. But, at this price tag, i expect something better. Something better than the cheap DimSum shops that sells SiuMai @ 3 for $1.50 (USD). Bellow is a list of what we ordered.
Tea Smoked Ribs - It was tasty and falls right off the bone. However, it has no tea flavor, false advertisement. it is not different than those BBQ Ribs you find at your local Chinese BBQ shop for a fraction of the price.
Pork SiuMai - It tasted and looked exactly like those you can find at your local dimsum shop for a fraction of the price.
Beef Rice Roll - I actually loved this dish. They used Sukiyaki grade beef instead of the traditional minced beef. the only dish I enjoyed. 
Chicken Feet - what can i say, it was chopped in half, not an whole feet. too many small broken bones that irritated the sh*** out of me. 
XLB - I prefer this dish at either DTF or any other XLB shop. 
The atmosphere was a miss in my opinion. The waiter sat us at the street level where a low table paired with small/low chairs, very similar to those you see in child care places.",-1
5,Went to Hakkasan for my brother's birthday! The price for our meal was on the high side but it was well worth the money!,1
5,"The Saturday afternoon set menu is very good! We were very full after the meal and tipsy as well!!! It was definitely a very impressive meal with various elements! The service is superb, however it can get quite noisy at times. The lobster was amazing and we love the dimsum! It was worth a visit for a good treat at central london!",1
3,"The wait was ridiculous.  The food was ok.  The atmosphere was weirdly nostalgic over colonial times.  
I had the fried okra.  It was ok.  The sauces were nice.  Also had lamb chops, which were not bad.  The lassi was ok.  The daal soup was the best thing I had, but overall, the quality of the food is unremarkable.",-1
5,"Yauatcha is the perfect combination of good food and good atmosphere.  Reservations are a must on Friday and Saturday night.  I prefer to sit downstairs, but it can get loud when you have screaming drunks next to you.  I highly recomment the Tea soaked Ribs, but relally everything tastes great here.  And don't forget dessert.",1
5,"Yummy ramen, with a few options to pick from. You can add your own crushed garlic which i thought was great. You have to try the chicken wings. The sauce is to die for. Me and my friends were scooping it off the bottom of the bowl. To add to the fun, you can wear big plastic bibs to protect your clothes and they provide hairbands to keep long locks away from the ramen!",1
4,"The rock -n- roll of ramen. If you want a hip spot that satisfies your craving for warm noodles, Bone Daddies is your cool friend. There is a good variety of ramen, from the spicy to more traditional, even curry and vegetarian options. It's also open late.
One thing I wasn't expecting was the amazing Brussel sprouts - yes Brussel sprouts! - side dish that was packed with fried green goodness, citrus and pomegranates. It's so much better than your generic edamame and sets them apart from many other ramen joints.
Get ready for a burst of flavour as the broth is quite thick, and their tonkatsu comes with a black garlic sesame oil which can be quite overpowering if you are looking for something more subtle. However if you are in the mood to rock, you will take comfort in this wild take on a Japanese classic.",1
5,"I could probably live on Venison puffs alone.The price is high, but the quality is always stellar.",1
1,"Horrible service! Got seated and waiter took our order, but we waited a good 20-30 min without getting any drinks or food. Tables seated after us were getting their food before us. When asking manager what happened, he was very rude and dismissive, asking us to leave if we were unhappy with the service! We left without getting our food or drinks, and every other dining experience here in London has been great up till now. Would not recommend this restaurant nor will I ever return. Good riddance!",-1
3,"This was highly rated both on Yelp and Trip Adviser. When we arrived there was a line outside the restaurant. It was a bustling Saturday dinner crowd. The workers are very nice, we waited about 20 min and they ushered us in to the downstairs bar area to wait outside the cold. They also served some warm chai while we were waiting in line. 
On to the food. 
Most everything was pretty good, although portions a little on the small side. We had to order two extra dishes to be satisfied. 
For starters we got the calamari and fried okra. The fried okra was very good, not too slimy with a nice crunch. Calamari was OK, it had a slightly sweet taste which I didn't care for.
My favorite was the chicken ruby (not sure of the name). It's the only chicken curry on the menu. Flavorful with moist chicken chunks. 
We also got two of the grilled chicken dishes and the spicy lamb chops. The lamb had a good kick of flavor and not gamey, however for the price you only get three little chops.
The one thing I did not like was the must touted black dal. It tasted like re fried beans. Same texture and almost same flavor but with an Indian spice kick. 
Overall it was a good experience, the service was nice and food in general was good.",-1
5,"Ok, okay yeah you probably know that this place is hyped. But, is it worth it?
Ultimately, I would have to say yes, even considering that my friend and I showed up without a reservation at around 7:15PM on a Thursday, and then waited just over an hour for our seats. They let you in to the bar area a little bit earlier (about 30 minutes in to our wait), so at least they get you well liquored. Their drink specials are creative and impressive - a good sign. 
The food though? How is the food? Ok. It was....fantastic. My friend and I are both vegetarian, and we had plenty of options to choose from. Definitely the Black Dal. The paratha was great (although not good for scooping up the dal, as the server suggested but we're risk takers). The paneer? Excellent. The spice levels are just right, meaning they are authentic and yet inviting. I can imagine that someone who is afraid of ""the heat"" will still want to try. 
Lastly - super affordable given the atmosphere (and its trendy hype) and its food! Worth a stop if you're in the area and have a good friend to chat with during the wait.",1
1,"We didn't even try the food but the service was horrible. We walked in and it was packed. I stood in front of the door and I probably eyed every waitstaff there and didn't get an acknowledgment.  I didn't get asked for how many until a min later. The wait was about 10mins which was fine... I see it was busy. Then another table of 4 came in and they knew one of the workers there... And the guy started to look for a table for them. In short we were overlooked and our table was given to someone else. We weren't too happy about that, so we left. 
Doesn't matter who your customer know or not know you shouldn't be seating someone ahead of customers who came first when there is a table for them.",-1
2,"Was looking forward to this because I was having some serious craving for a good ramen in London. 
The broth was thick, egg yolk was flowy and good; but something just didn't quite make the cut. 
I would say, the majority of flavor I was getting, was the taste of noodles. That starchy taste. The soup wasn't as flavorful, the meat wasn't mouth-watering. 
A little disappointed because I saw great reviews on this. 
Perhaps I just gotten a bad bowl. Will look to try shoryu ramen next tho.",-1
4,"From the outside, you'd think it's a modern/contemporary restaurant, but it's actually a dim sum and dessert house.  The food is more authentic than not.  
I love baked goods and pastries, so I actually enjoyed that more than XLB and siu mai.  The green tea cake still is my favourite.",1
3,"We came here with a group from work to experience China Town and a local company tradition. The service is what they are somewhat known for, but with a twist. They can be loud, short and bordering on rude while always having fun. Lots of above average Chinese food for the price.",-1
5,"This is a contemporary Chinese restaurant nestled in the SOHO area of London just north Chinatown.  It is not your typical Chinese place. It is one of the few Michelin-starred Chinese restaurants. The ambiance is hip and has a night club feel to it. I'd compare Yauatcha to Hakkasan; I do prefer Yauatcha a little more.  
Except for the kitchen, I don't think there was a single Asian staff in the restaurant.  The wait staff is comprised of good looking young men and women that seemed like aspiring actors or models.  With that said, the service was professional and attentive. 
While the food (dim sum) is traditional the quality was steps beyond most dim sums I've had, even in L.A.  The non-Asian part of the restaurant is the large display of European desserts and hand-crafted gourmet chocolate.  There is also a 25-feet long macaron bar by the front window that makes every passerby stop and admire.  
The sweet and sour pork was delicious beyond my expectation. The batter was crispy, the pork seemed like lean pork tender loin and the sweetness and tartness of the sauce was perfectly balanced.  The softshell crab was served with garlic chips that looked like almond slices and, along the the Thai basil, added good body to the flavor of the lightly battered crab.  The various steamed dumplings were all delicately made and tasted great.  The biggest surprise of the meal was the baby bokchoy.  It looked quite simple without any garnish yet the flavor was quite complex.  I never thought that a plain vegetable like this can taste this good.  It tasted like it had been stir-fried with chicken stock and Shaoxing wine.
The desserts were all excellent and the presentation impressive. The tough part was to make the choice from so many options.
Expect to pay for the superb dining experience; but it is worth the money.",1
3,"I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars. I usually like to try a popular ramen spot whenever I travel to a new city. This place satisfied my craving and was pretty decent. 
I got the Tonkatsu ramen with extra egg. The eggs were exceptional! On par with the eggs at Ramen Dojo in LA. The problem was that everything else was mediocre. The noodles were thin which I tend to dislike in Ramen (but that is personal preference). The broth did not seem to have a very distinctive taste and the slices of chashu were pretty thin. 
If this were my first point of reference for ramen I think I would walk away pretty happy. This place is not bad but also not really distinctive if you have tried other ramen.",-1
2,"Overpriced, too focussed on who is there, not enough focus on what is on the plate.
The staff all think they should be in that dreadful Chelsea television programme",-1
5,"Walking through the dark Alleys of England, amongst some not so sober people and landing in this spot was the best decision I have ever taken. I have been to Japan and most part of asia and there is something about this ramen- flavor, texture, food combination , warmth and everything about it that makes it the perfect bowl of goodness. If you love spice, noodles and basically a good cup of ramen, then they boned it here!!",1
2,"Went here more than three times already but this time they gave me an unpleasant service. There were four of us and we ordered two dishes to share but the waitress did not want to accept our order saying each of us has to order one meal. She was rude to us, took the menu from our table without asking nicely and only said ""cannot cannot"". Clearly her English wasn't very good. I had better experience previously but this time they made me not want to go back there again for their bad service.",-1
5,"Omg the chow fun is amazing. I would go for that as its so different than any dim sum dish I've had. It's basically a greasy roll stuffed with toppings of your choice wrapped with the white rice paper with soy sauce. So so so so good! Never had that before. They also had some amazing desserts especially the chocolate cake with rice Krispy in it! Yummy 
It was also our friends bday so they gave us a candle which our kids loved more. 
Spacious as well with super nice service towards our kids. I wouldn't call it kid friendly with high chairs but they were very nice with them&",1
2,"As far as Dim Sum goes, Ping Pong isn't bad, but especially with it's proximity to China Town taken into consideration, there really are better options for those craving Dim Sum in London.
While Ping Pong provides a good atmosphere, with a unique layout and a well-dressed an attentive staff, one soon realizes that you end up truly paying for the atmosphere as opposed to top-notch food.
While not bad by any means, the portions are small and the prices high to the point where you really are better off simply taking the walk to China Town for a more authentic experience.  
If you're absolutely desperate for some Dim Sum, Ping Pong is worth it for their unique atmosphere, but if you're looking for an authentic, filling, or cheap outing, look elsewhere.",-1
2,"I am not sure how to follow Smartiboo's experience of Wong Kei, but I am always surprised by the number of English people who know about this place and actually claim to ""like"" Wong Kei.
 Well, I don't. I find the arrogant waiters ignorant and annoying, and even though Chinese waiters have been known to be a little short, these people have turned rudeness into an art form. As I understand Cantonese, I am also not too happy with some conversations I have overheard.
 I was here several years ago when the decor was ""Paint Peeling Off Wall"". They have since spruced it up a bit so that most of the paint is now actually on the wall. And that is about the best I can say, but this is actually not a criticism as lots of good places in China have somewhat basic decor, or worse.
 The food is not too bad, I have to admit, especially for the price, so if you want to eat well and reasonably cheaply, then this is definitely one place to consider. However, this place was a lot cheaper years ago. By the way, NEVER order the set menus - they are invariably crap and made up mostly of food they couldn't sell the day before.
 But whatever you do, please don't bother leaving a tip for the waiters - as they say, they don't expect it and it will only embarrass them! :o)",-1
5,"The best Kung Pow chicken I've ever head. I had them add a little bit of spice to the dish to make it all the more perfect.  I was not expecting to come to London and enjoy the best Asian Fusion food I've ever had, but I did. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meal as just as much as I did and raved about it. 
The restaurant itself is very trendy in terms of looks as well as clientele. It was exactly what I was looking for before a night on the town in London.",1
4,"Yauatcha is a 1 Michelin starred dim sum tea house.  Definitely upscale and posh, but didn't give it a 5 stars due to the service.  They try to be very upscale in service, so they literally whisper at you...this only works if you're in a very quiet restaurant.  This place is more happening and upbeat which naturally turns into loud in volume.  You must speak up people!  They also need more training in being more observant...there were more than too many times they walked away without looking.  They probably solely get the Michelin for their food, because food is absolutely stunning in its presentation, quality, and taste.  The desserts are so pretty here too!
The two of us ordered the set menu for two people which came with the following:
 Blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing and Asian vegetables
 Venison Puff - flaky pastry filled with yummy venison.
 Seafood dumpling in supreme stock - Fish maw dumpling! So good! Great broth and exciting texture of the fish maw in the dumpling! 
 Poached Peking chicken dumpling - Excellent
 Har gau - very nice skin with excellent shrimp inside
 Pork and prawn shui mai - Excellent
 Three style mushroom cheung fun - clean and woodsy mushroom taste with excellent skin!
 Fried chilli squid - So yummy!! Perfectly fried and little Thai chili peppers mixed in the loose batter gives it a good kick!!  There were also toasted coconuts which made it so fragrant and yummy!
 Crispy aromatic duck 1/4 - Quarter of a duck fried to perfection with inside meat juicy. The server shreds the meat for us so that we can make our own wrap.
 Chinese vegetable - crisp, sweet, excellent baby bok choy.
Then two of my kids ordered additional from the a la cart menu:
 
 Lobster Dumpling - Lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar with ginger and shallot. Yes! They're yummy!
 Pork and preserved egg congee - really nice and well cooked.  Great flavor!
 Char Sui Bao - So good!  First note, you smell a fragrant but subtle rose.  Then you bite into this fluffy bun and taste the amazing char sui inside!  I asked why do I smell rose, and they told me that the flour they use is ""rose flour!""  Amazing!!
 Scallop Siu Mai - Whole entire scallop per dumpling!  WOW!
After all that food, we were stuffed, but we had to try the desserts, because they're sooooo beautiful!
 Raspberry and lychee rose - velvety and amazing!  Looks like a beautiful hat with a edible silver leaf on top!  Mmmmmm
 Green apple cake - so tangy and yummy and lovely!  Gelatin on top and buttery pie bottom.  The apple looks real!
 Chocolate orange macaron.  OK this is the only item that's not out of this world...only because I'm used to the finest...Ladurée and Pierre Herme.  But still good.
We also had 4 pots of tea (there's no refill on water) and their pots are personal size, as well as 4 bottles of still water.
The bill was US $233, which's pretty steep for dim sum...but it was an experience to remember!",1
5,"I went here twice in 3 days. It's that good! I was worried that the second time would disappoint but not the case. First of all, be prepared to wait an hour (we went on a Friday night and on a Sunday night and waited both nights). But you can enjoy a delicious cocktail at the bar while you wait. I enjoyed the Viceroy Manhattan. Boozy and delicious!
My favorite dishes were chicken ruby and black daal. Holy moly. Talk about complex, rich flavor. The daal has a bit of creaminess (it's vegan so I don't what they put in here!) that I've never tasted in a daal and that I was so here for. The chicken ruby is just beyond words. Also good were the lamb mimosas, lamb chops, the puffed poori with chickpea curry, cheese bread and the roti.
The lamb raan bun (basically a lamb sandwich)  and the chicken tikka rolls were fine but underwhelming compared to the others that hit the spot.  
I'll come here (at least once!) every time I'm in London.",1
5,Awesome! If you have the chance to visit I suggest you do. The food was so different but great. There were loads of veggie dishes to choose from and they have protein in them! A rarity! The decor was so cool but understated. I loved the smell of the place most of all - they were burning incense which was warm and sweet as Bollywood music in the background.,1
4,"The thing I really like about this place is the variety it offers. The dim sum is amazing, but there are a number of other dishes on its menu that really are beautiful - for example, the baked cod, which was the best fish I've ever had. And yes, the Venison Puffs are unique!
 The venue itself is just on the right side of pretentious. It was relaxed, yet bustling and the decor was really chilled. However, it won't be long before it needs a refit, as I'm sure it will begin to look a bit dated over the next year or two.
 So, you may not want to believe the hype, but give it a go. I had an amazing meal and will be going back for yet another visit fairly soon.",1
4,"This is one of the best ramen places I've ever been to. I got tantanmen 2, a dish that promised a little spice, and it absolutely delivered. I've been having a hard time finding dishes that are actually spicy in the UK, so I was beyond excited to find one that was. Aside from that, the flavor was amazing. Just thinking about it now I'm craving it. It was perfectly creamy and spicy, and there was just the right amount of chicken. I loved my dish, but it was huge and I couldn't finish it, and I was leaving on a plane so I couldn't take it go to. I wish there were smaller portions. Also, I do prefer to not eat meat when I can, but the only broth they had was mushroom, which I'm allergic to, so it would be nice if they could get more vegetable broths. The service was also really weak despite there being 5 people working. They stood around and talked a lot and seemed kind of irritated to be asked for water or for the check. However, the food itself was so good that the rating deserves to be high. Definitely recommend this place even with the service not being the best!",1
3,"Bone Daddies changed all of my expectation. First we started off by the
sweet and spicy pork bones which are an amazing appetizer. They were ribs with
quite a bit of meat on them with a very spicy peppery sticky sweet sauce. I
couldn't stop licking my fingers. We also tried the hamachi sashimi appetizer
which was wonderfully fresh with a hint of ponzu. And for my opinion their
service was good and very nice, we stayed for an hour and they never rushed us
once, in spite of the queue of people waiting. Well done",-1
3,"Being vegetarian I should have been cautious about eating ramen at a place called Bone Daddies, however I was hungry, in a rush and wanted noodles. 
The please is nice enough and the playlist is great but as much as the ramen was nice enough, it wasn't to my taste.  
The single vegetarian option on the menu is a mushroom ramen. So if you're a mushroom hating veggie I would probably avoid this place. 
I love mushrooms, and they sure do put the effort into making their broth meaty - which fits their style but I much prefer my noodles fresh and spicy. The meatiness of the mushroom broth was way too british style to me. It was also very salty. 
If you're a meat lover I'm sure this place is great, just not the one for me!",-1
3,"Bottom-line-up-front: it's very solid japanese seafood, but the hype is so overbearing it crushes the place. The surroundings are... not my scene.
The vibe is basically that of any of the major Asian carriers' business-class lounges at LAX, but with more 60 year old men with 23 year old women.
The waiters are knowledgeable, and the menu is fairly impressive.
Advice: stick with the specialty cooked dishes, the sushi is nothing special. trust your waiter. get a view of the people, not the park - the former are infinitely more entertaining.",-1
3,Good food but a bit pricey.  They take indian food from ethnic to upscale fairly well.  I enjoyed the club feel bar - nice for a low key drink before dinner.,-1
2,"Went there on a Monday night at 6:30. Place was packed!! But we managed to get a seat for 2 within 5 minutes. Waiter was very accommodating and found us a table away from the doors.
+2/5 stars for the tantanmen 2. Brothy. Nothing special. Couldn't find the meat. Was supposed to have pulled pork and minced chicken but none was found!!! Maybe the waitress didn't get our order right. Idk. She didn't speak English as a first language. 
Had an Asahi beer to pair. Super good combo.",-1
2,"This place is pretty awful. Although this restaurant is the cheapest in Chinatown it is very easy to see why. The staff are always rude and they shove you on a table full of strangers. When my friends had a birthday party there they even had the cheek to ask for some of the cake! Some of the plates were also dirty. The toilets were a pit and extremely unsanitary. I hear the place was originally closed for refurbishment because the council forced them to clean up their act. My advice is that if you do use Wong Kei, at least get a take away to avoid the poor service!",-1
4,Excellent. Definitely worth the queue. Remember to try the fried chicken and also the soft shell crab. The ginger and lime sauce is almost as good as the crab itself. Broths are thick and rich and always benefit from chilli sauce in my opinion. Will be working my way through the whole menu in due course.,1
4,"Loved the decor, service and overall setup of the place. Had to wait for about an hour to get in - understandable given the popularity of the place. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, Chicken Tikka, Spicy Lamb Chops, Black House Daal and Garlic Naan. Loved the Chicken Ruby and Lamp Chops, though portions were a bit small. Found the Daal on the ok side - not exactly worthy of the hype. Overall a positive experience.",1
3,"This place is in the heart of the shopping district in London. After walking around in the cold throughout the day, my gf and I wanted something warm and came across this place. The service and location are exceptional, albeit a very touristy location. Obviously, I gravitated towards this location because all tourists get sucked into the ""tourist epicenter"" of any city. The food is good but not great (meat quality in the buns is not good) and definitely not worth the price. I understand rent is very expensive in this area and the high costs definitely pass down to the food. However, I was still disappointed with the quality of food based on the price. After paying for the meal, I thought about selling my semen to a sperm bank to help offset the cost of this meal. I eventually decided not to do it because I didn't want my biological kids trying to find me 30 years later during their ""finding myself stage"" to figure out what genetic similarities we shared. At the end of the day, I thought about semen for money for ramen. End of story. End of review. I didn't do it. I'm out.",-1
1,"Very bad service...
We visited with a group of friends 10 in the party.  As it was XMAS we all stuck to the set menu.  Before we could order drinks the food started arriving...  Within 10 minutes the first and second course was on our table.  Luckily by then a glass of bubbly arrived.  None of us could finish these courses before the next arrived.  Needless to say it felt like they wanted us out!  Then the long wait started...  Over 20 minutes before I could get the attention of a waiter who when I complaint said it is not her table...
In summary bad service and most of the drinks were out of stock... Skip this branch they don't care about customer service!",-1
3,"food not as good as it was years ago.
the daal was good and the prawns as starts was ok
Biriyani no so impressive",-1
5,"Possibly the best dim sum I've had in my life.
I've had my fair share of dim sum, the typical kind where they push the cart around and you gawk at the plates and point. This is not that type of shop.
Yauatcha is super modern and the food is exceptional. The prices are a bit on the higher side but the quality is worth it. 
Must have: Prawn and beancurd cheung fun, seafood dumpling soup, venison puff, spicy pork szechuan wontons,  and king crab shanghai siew long bao.
Service was great, make a reservation if you plan on coming on a weekend.",1
3,"What with all the five-star reviews of Savoir Faire here on Yelp, I was expecting to be served up a loin of unicorn with a side of fairy-dusted mash.
But it was not to be.  The food I received was thoroughly average.  The wine was potent and flowing, though, and the amount of time between courses was incredibly drawn out (and filled with more wine drinking).  So I wasn't entirely upset by the mediocrity of the meal at the time.  My fig and cheese starter was nothing special, and my fish main was overseasoned but cooked well.  I was too intoxicated by the time my dessert arrived to remember much about it.
In the end, I left with the impression that the courses were actually quite small for the price coupled with the inattentive execution of the dishes.  And I was kind of hungry.",-1
5,"What a lovely spot with interesting food.  It's not quite Indian - but rather, it's a Persian take on Indian - so you will get some distinctively non-Indian variations on otherwise Indiany food - like cole slaw or raw vegetables (there will probably never be raw veggies in any typical Indian dish!), or use of spices that you don't typically find in Indian cooking.  On the other hand, some of the food does not seem all that different from traditional Indian - like the signature black daal. 
The setting is fantastic - there's this amazing convertible outdoor area, with either table seats or low seating with somewhat overly soft chairs.  I love the photos hanging and the distressed wood.  The roof looks like it peels back for the rare sunny day - which it was on my visit. 
The menu has loads of choices, and though the server recommended 3 dishes per person, I think that's actually much.  Loads of veg options, and plenty of delicious meaty ones too, including their signature lamb dish - which comes in either a whole leg (or was it rack?) for sharing or the bun for one (which really is a lot of food and could serve as a real entree for one). 
Even though we over-ordered, the bill came out to just slightly over 20 pounds per person - which is not bad for our delicious bounty (by London standards - I am not from here and finding all food quite pricey here).  
Service is also lovely.  When my friend spilled his juice, he actually got a complimentary refill (and napkins and a rag right away). 
And remember - this is not meant to be an Indian restaurant! The staff are quick to correct you on that if they notice you making that mistake - and there is a section on the menu that explains this concept.",1
1,"Very disappointed experience, when they serve you warm soup...
Warm Ramen soup, and they dare to charge you £11 for it, is simply a joke. We went there and waited 20 mins for a seat on Sunday which is fair enough. Then when my Tonkotsu ramen came first and they brought out a wrong ramen, we were already give a sad face. (The correct ramen shows up 5 mins later)
To be served with hot noodles, but warm soup and cold char-siu, is simply a crime. The way they try to skip step to serve you a proper ramen soup is amazing. They heated up the bowl really hot, and really cooked their noodles (that's hot), Then they add luke-warm soup base, and cold ingredients on top. Thinking you don't know what temperature they are when they serve it because the noodles and bowl is hot, and it will warm everything up is very wrong.
We ordered 1 soft shell crab, 2 bowl of ramen, 2 greentea, and walk out needing to pay £20
We rather eat at home",-1
2,"I really, really wanted to like this place, as the food style and restaurant concept is truly right up my alley. However, abysmal service soured my whole experience, and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it. 
Right from the start, my server gave no greeting, did not ask if I had any questions, did not explain the menu (and it's quite a huge menu to navigate), just said ""You ready?"" and waited with his notepad. He was entirely unhelpful when I asked him to describe certain dishes, giving shrugs or an apathetic ""Yeah, it's good."" 
When I asked for recommendations, he asked if I had dietary restrictions. I told him I did not eat cilantro, and the one item he recommended (wild mushroom dumplings) had cilantro. After taking a bite, I left the rest untouched - but I never saw the server again, and even when I mentioned to another server what had happened, there was no attempt to apologize, or ask if I'd like to order something else in its place.  
The other dumplings I got (poached chicken) were excellent. I also tried the crispy duck - and while I wanted to like it because it was a different take on Peking duck (I have no idea how it was prepared as that was - of course - not explained, but the duck was shredded in front of you instead of sliced), it was so dry that it was inedible without the sauce (which my server said would be ""oyster sauce"" - it was not - it was the classic Peking duck sauce). 
Too bad. Hope you have better luck than I did at this joint.",-1
5,"It's my favourite place in London.  Don't be put off by the lack of ambience or the quick and abrupt nature of all the people working there.  It's incredibly fast, great food and huge portions at a wicked cheap price.
You can't go wrong, they've got everything you want from a Chinese restaurant and it's the best service I've had in a long time (honestly).",1
2,"If you're in this area of London and you want dim sum or ANY Asian food, you should just leg it across the river to Chinatown instead. I won't say the food was terrible, because it wasn't. In fact, the soft shell crab bao dish was really nice!! The dim sum though was... not great... Granted, coming from South East Asia my standards are probably higher than most, I can still count several other places that have daily dim sum that are better. For example, har gau is meant to look like a shiny jewel that you can just about see the prawn through. The har gau here was far too thick so it felt like the insides were not enough. I mean it tasted good, but considering the portion was as small (3 pieces) and not superb, I was let down. The iced teas were really nice so there was that. 
TL;DR - You want dim sum? Go to Chinatown.",-1
4,"Food: 5+
Atmosphere: 4
Service: 2
Price: 4
I've been here three times, and let me start by saying it is absolutely delicious.  Definitely a place to get a bunch of dishes with friends and try everything.  In particular, you absolutely must get the venison puffs (sorry, Bambi); they are quite possibly my favorite food in London.  The sticky leaf rice is heavenly too...as is everything else, so just order away and be prepared to be impressed!
Atmosphere varies between upstairs and downstairs.  Downstairs has a cooler vibe; while both areas are a bit on the noisy side, it comes across as lively in the downstairs area whereas it was a little more uncomfortable upstairs.  
This place loses a 5th star on service.  Of my three visits, the service was awful on two of them and acceptable on the third.  For the two bad times, they just seemed woefully understaffed -- it was impossible to get a waiter's attention, and they were rushed and unsmiling if you eventually succeeded in talking to someone.  Several times we were told someone would ""come over in a minute"", and then no one did.  Moreover, on one of the reservations, we had to wait for 45 min before they seated us...
Prices are reasonable for a trendy restaurant with nice food.  It's not cheap, but you get a large dim sum serving in each order.  Last time I was there, the four of us had ~10 dim sum courses + 3 desserts + 4 cocktails for ~45 per person and were very full by the end.
So all-in-all, I'd definitely go back and eat the delicious food, but only if I was with patient friends who wouldn't be bothered by the sub-standard service.",1
2,"Really disappointed after reading all be great reviews on Yelp - first visit to London and have eaten at several excellent Indian places. This was not one of them.  We came at lunch time and even though the place was quite busy, we were seated almost immediately.   The first thing you notice is how LOUD it is.  Really, really, really loud.   We had to flag down a server to get helped.  Seating was quite tight.  Food came fairly quickly lollipop chicken (fried and overcomes), curry chicken (meh, it definitely needed more flavor) and spicy vegetable rice.  It was OK.   Agains, had to flag yet another server down to get our bill.  Overall, there I had hoped for much better - certainly a lot to choose from in London",-1
4,"I like the price the most.. AND the food is pretty good. What more can you ask for?
Don't expect good service, though. But it's not as bad as before I hear.",1
4,"SETTING
Trendy but muted restaurant in Soho.
FOOD
Dim sum fare, absent the trollies. Sampled baked venison puff, Jasmine tea smoked ribs, Peking duck spring rolls, crab and caviar soup, hand pulled noodle with Shimeji mushrooms. Fresh ingredients, fine craftsmanship, and delicate flavors.
Dessert was spectacular. Had the ""Victoria"", Glazed donut with chocolate mousse and blackberry compote filling, and ""Tendance Cannelle"" a half dome of chocolate mousse enrobed in caramel with a cinnamon crème brulee center. Colorfully tempting selection of macaroons also available. 
SERVICE
Gracious. Lovely waitresses in stylish, white uniforms with decorative straps (of unclear function) strung around the derrieres.
WILL I BE BACK?
Pricey. Dessert worth a return visit.",1
4,"Authentic Cantonese food, just a bit pricy! The ground floor feels quite formal, but we had our meal downstairs, more chilled and relax!",1
3,"I first heard about Bone Daddies when it was mentioned in a ""must try restaurants in London"" article. It raved about this place, saying it was the absolute best ramen joint around, so I was quite excited to try it. 
I asked for a recommendation and the waitress said their tonkatsu ramen was the most popular, so I decided to go with that. The service was speedy! I got my food in less than five minutes. However, I found the ramen to be very underwhelming. The broth had so little flavor - I felt like I was just drinking soupy oil. The ramen and meat were alright, but nothing to write home about. The egg was probably my favorite part of my meal. 
Perhaps because I've had really good ramen in Japan and Los Angeles before, Bone Daddies just wasn't up to par.",-1
5,"We found the experience surprisingly wonderful. From the moment you walk in the decor stands out. Food wise, the dumplings were superb, especially shrimp and chive (i did judge it by the look). We also had the scallop and lotus main course, a perfect combo of smooth scallop and crunchy lotus. Don't forget dessert. We shared a beautifully presented macaroon filled with vanilla creme fresh, paired with a tart plum, just a perfect ending to a lovely evening.",1
1,"I've never been called to action to post before, but I was so taken aback by tonight's dinner that I must. I have never been treated so poorly and and with Such such disrespect! I went with friends to the cinnamon club for a fun evening away. As a host I was hoping to treat my company to a great dinner. I left midway through the meal to meet with the manager to speak about paying for the dinner as a good host. I was told that there was a man in my company and he was the host and he would make the decision! I try to explain that I was the host, and that I would be paying for it and do not want my my guess to see me pay for it. He abruptly turned away and walked away. I have never ever ever been so disrespected in my life. I truly feel that this was a slight and as later proves he walks the bill personally over to the only man in our group and placed it in his hands. I was so embarrassed as the man we were with then felt he must pay for everyone. It was truly an embarrassment and I am ashamed. I will never go here again.",-1
3,"Had the kotteri tonkotsu ramen and a beer. 
Noodles were decent, roasted pork a bit small, boiled egg was good. Soup tasted like it had noodle flour in it and also the kitchen had dumped a massive pile of pickled ginger on top which made the soup taste oddly fishy. 
The draft beer was Kirin, decent but not spectacular- on the menu it said that it would be served very cold but it was several degrees above that. 
Price for a bowl of ramen 12 quid, with today's exchange rate making the ramen at least 3 times what one would pay for the same food in Japan. Service was friendly if a bit disorganized on a crowded Saturday afternoon, but the buy 1 ramen get the second half-off coupon that I used made up for any slowness and probably saved Shoryu from a trip to 2-starland, for now three is the number of the stars thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.",-1
5,"We chose this restaurant because of the beautiful ""Most Romantic"" dining room, but we loved everything. They had an obscure bottle of wine in their ""bible"" that we had a long time ago on one of our first dates. The service was perfect. We also really enjoyed the cheese cart at the end of the meal. Definitely make a reservation.",1
4,"When Yauatcha first opened I didn't understand the hype. And then, I went for dinner one evening.. and ended up going back so often(4x within 2 weeks) I got heartily sick of the food..! ;)
 But that's not a criticism of the dishes, because.. had I not loved the food, I would not have gone back time and again, bringing different groups of friends there.
 These days, I still visit.. but less often. I usually bring friends from out-of-town there for dim sum with a twist... if they fancy having Chinese.
 I like the fact that chefs at Yauatcha have come up with an inventive dim sum menu (and unlike other Chinese restaurants, continue serving dim sum past 5pm).
 Although, to be fair.. these days, it's not so uncommon to find innovative dim sum dishes at other Chinese restaurants, still.. I go back to Yauatcha specially for some of my favourite steamed baskets: enoki mushroom & prawn dumplings, shitake & duck roll, shanghai spicy dumplings just to name a few. The mango spring roll is sweetly delicious - just be careful not to burn your tongue in your haste to get in a yummy bite.
 I'd recommend the Singapore Fried Noodles (altho there's no such dish in Singapore!) for back up, just in case you're not full by the end of the meal.
 Be prepared to pay at least 20% more for dim sum at Yautatcha. In fact, some of their prices are exorbitant but, if you fancy a treat, then by all means, tuck in! I wouldn't recommend ordering ordinary dim sum dishes at Yauatcha (e.g. Har Gau, Siew Mai aka prawn & pork dumpling, Char Siew Pau etc)... because these, you can get at any other Chinese restaurant, and at cheaper prices too. Always go for something special and different at Yauatcha, because.. after all, you're paying for it!
 I adore their tea cocktails (non-alcoholic).. and always order a Plum Cut Larrisa when I'm there. The Mama-Zhao is nice too, if you fancy a thicker smoothie sort of drink. But everyone who's ever tried my Plum Cut Larrisa insist they want to order that on their next round. So there you go, quench your thirst!",1
5,"Great cocktails, lively vibe, great outdoor seating, amazing chili cheese bread, lamb, chicken masala and more. Everything we ordered just hit the spot, alongside the music and drinks!",1
3,"Good ramen but a little overrated. Got the Yuzu Tonkatsu ramen, the fried chicken and the chashu pork and corn croquettes. The croquettes were delicious but the fried chicken was a bit dry. The ramen had a nice broth but it wasn't as flavorful as other ramen places in the area. The pork belly was nicely cooked however and the it had a nice mild kick to it. Overall good ramen but not worth the long waits at peak meal times.",-1
3,Kinda disappointed about the food and service. The interior needs a bit of a redo.,-1
2,"I heard from many friends' ""recommendation"" and visited this notoriously ""famous""  restaurant when I was in London seven years ago.
The food served there was dirt cheap.  I recalled it started at four and half pounds per dish.  The portion was extremely huge -- enough to fill up the stomach of two hungry customers.
Of course the taste is awful -- unless you have never tried any Chinese food.
And I could tell how rude those waiters treated the ""haole"" (Hawaiian word for Caucasian) customers.  But the restaurant was packed with haole on that day.  Why did they enjoy being abused?",-1
3,"Was the first dim sum place I ever went to so it has a special place in my heart, but i've found that the genuine chinese-run places are a cut above. Still, the food is good and tasty, and the cocktails are stunning for the price (especially the ones with lychee juice in them). Try out the sunday all you can eat menu - it'll fill you up in no time!",-1
4,"Really enjoyed our recent visit for pre-theater dining.  Very exotic decor, but oddly soothing.  Waitstaff was not overly friendly, but informative and very efficient.  One of our party had a shellfish allergy and they were really on guard after hearing this news.  ""Shrimp!  Don't eat that!  Eat this!"" ""This has only sweet potato -- you can eat this!"", accompanied by lots of vehement hand gestures.  Only quibbel -- we asked for 4 macaroons and they didn't offer us any choices.  We assumed (incorrectly) that choice was not an option.  We got 3 weird ones:  violet, popcorn and bubblegum (I would not have chosen any of these, voluntarily) and one normal one: tiramisu (yum!) So, definitely specify.",1
4,"Restaurant which specialises in Roast Duck. If you go here, you MUST have the duck. It is absolutely delicious. I like duck anyway but this is just lovely. My mouth is watering now thinking about it!
PS - I would rate this 4.5 if I could but Yelp doesnt allow half marks.
(Few days ago I wrote review for the wrong Four Seasons. Sorry about that. I have removed the other one now).",1
3,"I think this place is a little over-hyped.  I can't really fault the food - but it's not incredible, it's just a well honed menu that's cooked well...but it isn't ground breaking or any different to any other Indian restaurant around London really. I think it's mainly because this is a well decorated chain, that's the appeal.   We've had a few instances here where they haven't been able to adjust the menu even a little to suit our vegetarian friends - which is a shame as it wasn't difficult, then they kicked up a fuss about us, made us feel as though we were really demanding too much - so that's why I'm not giving it four stars.",-1
3,"Nobu is London's own Nobu partly owned by Robert De Niro and a trendy spot with real sleek and minimal decor. 
Food is great, I recommend the Chef's menu with a variety of the restaurants dishes, all perfectly sized and superb in taste. 
Although prices are very expensive the restaurant is worth visiting if you can afford it. 
Luckily I was invited :)
It is one of the most talked about restaurants in London but not the best in my opinion.",-1
4,"Yeah!! My first UK review :)
Thanks yelpers for pointing this place out. Great place to grab a super cheap bite (I ordered the fish ball noodle soup and sauteed choi sum) - under 10 quid!
The service is actually quite friendly and definitely efficient. Not sure why everyone thinks they're rude...probably helps that I speak some cantonese :)
I have a feeling I'll be eating here a lot when I'm out of dinner companions.",1
5,"I usually give 4 stars for good restaurants but I will start giving 5 till yelp sorts it's self out with having more detailed review options as in a rating for ambiance, food and service etc. 
Now to the review call me racist but when I go to Chinese restaurants I don't have any expectations of your European standard ""good service and hygiene"" it's just a cultural thing I guess. 
But this so far is my favorite roast duck joint and has the sweet and sour chicken the other day and was great. 
Pro tip:
Was told by my old lecturer back at Uni ( he was Chinese obviously) if you want to know how good a Chinese cooks food is ask him to prepare it with out msg. So ye give it a go taste the difference. Ofc the pre made stuff can't have the msg omitted.",1
5,"Hands down the best roast duck in London, it's a must try. However, the roast duck is a bit high in terms of fat content, may not be to everyone's liking.",1
5,"What a great experience! The service was top notch, the food was amazing, prices were decent.
In my search for places to try on my trip to London, Dishoom seemed like an obvious choice. The reviews were impeccable!
We arrived a bit later in the evening, we were greeted almost at once and told the wait was about an hour. I read that an hour wait is usually not always an hour so we agreed. While waiting in line to get to the bar area we were served a choice of mint tea, their AMAZING chai, or another drink (I stopped listening when I heard chai). All of the staff was so amazingly kindly chatty.
We got inside and were given a buzzer and were able to go over to the bar area. The cocktails were probably my favorite part. Oh, mama were they good!! I want to go back and only drink cocktails!!
We were seated in about 45 minutes, in the outside area, thank god, because I love my more quiet dinners as I get older. hah. 
The food was amazing. Standouts for me were the Naan, Chicken ruby, calamari, an",1
5,"we found this on yelp and thought give it try as its a michelin restaurant and it is indeed worth it，awesome food especially crab salad and congee, great service as well!",1
3,"So much ramen, so little time. And you need time if you want to go to Shoryu as the line is quite often 10-15 people long on any given evening. We went on the soft-opening week which meant the line was even longer although props to the staff for shoving us in as fast as possible and having no qualms about asking random people to sit together.  However, I didn't quite understand why they split the group up when the table the first pair was given was more than enough for all of us. We swapped the randoms for our friends and everyone was happy (except for the waitress who looked like she was about to punch a hole in the wall).
The Ramen itself was good (I chose the Shoryu Special) with a rich creamy white broth that was an excellent argument on its own for taking the slow boil method for making tonkotsu stock. The pork itself wasn't that flavourful and I remember being a little disappointed in the low amount of veggies. Those that were there were excellent and so was the egg. The bowl is a massive serving and I happily slurped my way into fatty pork nirvana.
It's a bit cramped inside with the planners seemingly hell bent on working out how to maximise the number of people per square meter. Be prepared to get close to some strangers and even cosier with your friends. Then again, we all survive the tube in rush hour so by comparison this is downright luxurious! 
In the London Ramen rankings, the overall food is good but not enough to dethrone Bone Daddies as the London Ramen King!",-1
4,"Not a fan of indian/spicy food, but this was good, with flavours that I never tasted. Attention was good and quick and really helped us to decide what to order. It is a bit noisy but our table was more chill.",1
3,"Interesting place. It's a great deal, particularly considering the location. The food's average-to-good, but definitely nothing to write home about - classic bistro cooking, the flaws being e.g. too tough beef bourguignon, lack of flavour in a couple of the dishes. However, a few things let it down. First, the service, while friendly, is slow and inattentive (whenever we needed one of the waiting staff, there was no-one to be seen and I spent more time than I liked trying to catch their eye). Second, the decor is basic but a few things need some touching up, and e.g. the cutlery/glassware look very much like they belong in a school canteen. Third, the wine selection is very ordinary, which is shame for a French restaurant - we had one of the more expensive bottles and, while inoffensive, it wasnt very interesting. I'll definitely bear it in mind for the future, but you won't find me going out of my way to come back, and especially not with a date or someone I'm trying to impress. There are much better restaurants in this kind of category (Comptoir Gascon instantly springs to mind, as does Le Mercury).",-1
3,"Overrated restaurant. The food is just like at your average Chinatown eatery - greasy, nothing innovative (at least as per the menu), and so is the service - kind of brusque. Go to a 'premium' dim sum place, a new, higher-quality restaurant (like Xu), or just limit yourself to something simple (like green vegs or dumplings soup).",-1
3,"Having been told that we were only allowed a 2 hour sitting my initial impression was not the great however after being ticked off the guest list by the bouncers at the door we entered the sleek bar/restaurant designed by Christian Liaigre. Trying the cocktails is a must while you wait for your table (particularly the lychee one!) and sitting at the bar in the buzzy yet chilled atmosphere is a great experience. Although the design of the restaurant is quite closely packed in the screens, darkness and low lights give the restaurant an intimate feel, perfect for any romantic dinner.
 Already knowing that the owner Alan Yau owns Wagamamas and another michelin star restaurant Yauatcha I was expecting the standard of food to be very high and I was not disappointed. The waitresses are constantly there for any need you might have but are not intrusive and at no point in the meal did we feel rushed.
 The menu contents is quite overwhelming and the dishes that have to be ordered 24 hours in advance (such as sharks fin and beluga caviar) make an interesting read. My starter and dessert (soft shell crab and chocolate and passionfruit ice-cream) was delicious, however my beef main unfortuantely tasted like standard chinese fare saying that though the rest of my party all had fantastic dishes.
 Hakkasans was a very enjoyable experience however it comes at a very steep price but it is to be recommended.",-1
5,"This is one of my favourite spots in London. Amazing food, morning or evening, with great staff and decor. Invite a bunch of friends and I guarantee you'll have an awesome night.",1
3,This restaurant was really not up to the michelin standard. The food was completely average and there wasn't anything special or memorable about it. You can get much better dim sum for a lower price. The service was sub par. Our waiter gave special treatment to the table of girls next to us and gave them plates on the house as well as being more attentive toward them whilst he didn't even bother pouring our water for us. This should not be the case at a michelin star restaurant and I can say we were highly disappointed. The only thing that was enjoyable was the ambiance and interior. But there are plenty of great places to choose from in soho and we will definitely not be back.,-1
4,Exactly what I expected based on the reviews overall. Good food but bad service. Very much enjoyed the pork belly hot pot dish.,1
4,"Dim Sum is good but it's too pricey. 
Amazing and excellent desserts: Jasmine Honey and Macarons",1
5,"I went to Yauatcha on Monday with a group of friends from Italy (they recommended the restaurant to ME and I've been living in London for 14 years!).
I read the reviews on Yelp and I ordered the venison puff, we all enjoyed its lovely crumbliness and sweet/savoury combo.
The waiter recommended the soft shell crab which was also delicious and accompanied with lots of chilly and sliced almonds.
The crispy duck rolls were also exceptional. The whole dim sum experience was fantastic.
Having Hayden Panettiere dining at the table next to us was also the highlight of the evening!",1
3,"Yes the pork broth is tasty but this place is just that bit too pretentious for me.
I asked for a side of kimchi even after being assured it would be on the side they threw it into my soup. This coupled with loud music and too cool for school waiters - there is better ramen in London.",-1
2,"The service at Four Seasons is atrocious. There is always a long queue so waiters try their best to make diners eat up, pay up, and get out to make way for other customers.
Not too long ago, I had dinner at Four Seasons with a friend. He was not very good at using chopsticks but insisted on using them. Halfway through our meal, a waiter rudely snatched the chopsticks from his hand and gave him a fork and a spoon. 
A little later, before we could finish eating, they cleared our table without asking if we were done and served our dessert of oranges. We were too shocked to say anything. We then took our time with the oranges but were interrupted by the arrival of our bill which we had not asked for.
We ignored the bill and carried on talking as we were not ready to leave. Not long after, the waiter returned and literally asked us to leave.
I did the roast duck that everyone raves about and do not intend to. If you are vegetarian like me, you might want to think twice about going to Four Seasons. Their food tasted average to me and I am sure you can find similar food in other Chinatown establishments.",-1
2,"I am doubting my fellow Yelpers after seeing this has a 4-star average rating.  
Landed in London today, am put up in a nearby hotel for work and was craving some chicken tikka masala.
The naan was inedible, the chicken was dry, and the tikka masala lacked spice/flavor.  Rarely do I leave food on my plate (I have a problem of eating everything in sight!), but I didn't finish anything I ordered.  
Will continue my quest to get good Indian in London elsewhere...if you're on the fence about coming here, I'd pass.",-1
3,"I am not sure how this establishment maintains its Michelin one star as it just fails miserably to meet the standards. The food is nothing more than any good Chinese restaurant in your local neighborhood. What really surprised me was the service. We had to request several times for our drinks. Water was not refilled and my utensils were not changed even though we asked for new plates. Our table was left uncleaned until we had to ask the manager to wipe it after 10 minutes or so. It seems they employ young untrained waiting staff. 
If you are looking for a good Chinese meal with very uncomfortable seating in a hip environment this is the place for you, however if you have visited other Michelin restaurants you will be deeply disappointed.",-1
5,"Superior service, beautiful decor, and terrific food.
Bring a wine expert (the list is extensive) and plenty of money.",1
5,"Wow. Ramen doesnt get better than this. Rich, flavorful, fresh and satisfying. Tantanmen 2 without chilli oil and the T22 are my favorite.",1
4,"I took my wife to Close Maggiore on Saturday for her birthday. The restaurant really is a gem and perfect for special occasions. Sitting in the conservatory is a must, as you will regret it if you don't.
 The staff performed very well and the food was delicious. The wine list is outstanding and runs some 85 pages. The downside of that is that many of the bottles in a more affordable price range are sold out. While they do have some fantastic bottles, they run around £200. There wasn't much selection in the mid-range so the choices jumped from £50 to around £150-200. Still, they have to be commended for a great wine selection.
 The only thing that marred our experience and prevents me from giving them a full 5 stars, is that while we had an 8pm reservation, we didn't get seated until 8.30 and had to wait in the very small lobby. While the staff was friendly and kept us informed, I still expected to have a table when I reserved.
 While the food was delicious and everything did seem reasonably priced for the experience, my starter of wild scallops was a disappointment. Three scallops for £15 is pushing things a bit in my opinion.
 I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone for a special occasion or just a romantic dinner out.",1
1,"How, HOW does Bone Daddies have such high ratings? Due to the number of great reviews this ramen joint has I decided to check it out for myself and I've only left in utter disappointment.  I tried the tonkotsu ramen during my first visit and the broth was pure NaCl.  It was so salty I couldn't finish my ramen which, trust me, has never happened before.  The soup here is honestly what I'd imagine the Dead Sea tastes like. Tonkotsu broth is often a creamy pale color but here it looks more like shoyu broth, perhaps they add a tub of soy sauce to it, rendering it completely inedible.  Besides the salt factor, it also doesn't have a nice pork flavor that is characteristic of quality tonkotsu ramen.  Lastly, I usually love nitamago which are seasoned soft boiled eggs but again here they're overly salty and not enjoyable.  They really need to tone it down a bit.
I thought my first experience was a fluke so I came back again to give Bone Daddies a chance to prove me wrong. This time I tried their tan tan men which was yet another letdown.  The broth left a powdery aftertaste and the noodles were beyond soggy.  
I hate to say this, but Bone Daddies is probably some of the worst ramen I've ever had.  Don't come here if you want anything remotely tasty or authentic.  Try Shoryu, Ippudo, or Kanada-ya instead if you're looking for something better in London.",-1
5,"The place is really nice, it is first class restaurant. We had dinner here together with my girl and had a really good time. Loved the steak and she had something with vegetables, did not remember what , but she was really happy.",1
1,The service was horrible and the food tasted awful. I had a horrible stomach ache after aswell. You should definitely avoid.,-1
5,"LOVE this place! I've not tried any of their other London venues, but highly recommend this Shoreditch branch. The service is impeccable and every dish is delicious. Can't get enough of the black daal (lunch menu) and bacon naan (breakfast menu) signature dishes. Try and sit outside if the weather permits or book a table upstairs. Downstairs is fine but slightly lacking in the same atmosphere.",1
5,Graet place. Great service. Great food. Be sure to reserves place before you arrive. The lamb dish is So yamni.,1
4,"Gerrard Street is where the real Chinatown restaurants are.  (The tourist traps are a block over on Lisle Street.)  This one is said to be renowned for its bbq duck, though I noted that a number of its neighbors also featured that prominently.
What's great about it here is that, if you're a solo diner, you can get a small quantity.  There is, for instance, a lunch rice plate that comes with 1-3 bbq meats of your choice.  I found the duck excellent, juicy and crunchy without being in the least bit gamy as duck often is.  I also had spareribs which were a little dry.",1
3,"I've tried the lazy sumdays menu and was quite full after. Unfortunately, the quality of some of the food was not that great. However, I'd recommend the rice bowls and thai soups though.
The xiao long bao and shu mai's weren't really that great compared to China Town.",-1
4,"I had the Tonkatsu ramen and was really impressed -- this is better than most of the Japanese ramen spots in the Bay Area and NYC. The broth was very flavorful without being too greasy, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the pork was so buttery and -- this really hit the spot for me! Cocktails were a little overpriced, stick to a pint of Asahi.",1
4,"We went with the hype and tried this popular dim sum restaurant on our first night in London. Make a reservation, it was full on a Wednesday night. Tons of style and ambiance. Request to be seated in the lower level if youre going for a romantic night out, the ceiling is designed to look like the night sky. Stunning. It's very Vegetarian friendly. Try the vegan ""duck"" - sweet, spicy and smoky with the most gorgeous mushrooms. What are those mushrooms called??!  My carnivorous spouse had the venison puffs, he said that they totally deserve an award.  Every other dish we tried was very good but not great. If you're looking for a traditional dim sum place, this isn't for you. But if you want good dim sum-ish goodness in an upscale environment, book a table.",1
3,"A-OK..... that sums it up.
I had the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu for 11.90gbp/18usd, 3pc gyoza for 4gbp/6usd, and a drink.
My bowl was small, so small I finished it even though my mouth was on fire because it was SPICY.  I'm not complaining about its spiciness, but its size...
gyoza. ehh.
US$33.75 for eating alone and leaving a little hungry... no thanks",-1
4,"yauatcha is a temple where i go to revere the soft shell crab, squid with chili, baby steamed vegetables and tea smoked ribs. as chinese retaurants go, this is a triumph. brilliant on all accounts. my only issue: the cruelly-enforced 2 hours maximum table time. unless i am mistaken, yauatcha is a one-star michelin restaurant come on, guys, you can't push your customers out at gun point, especially given these prices.",1
5,I thought I didn't like Indian food. And then I went to Dishoom & immediately jumped on the bandwagon. LOVE.,1
3,"After going through yelp and tripadvisor, I wanted to try a Chinese restaurant in London. This place was definitely very popular on tripadvisor and people describe this as good food but bad service. So that's what I think of authentic Chinese food - good food but lack of service is normal! 
So I decided to check out this place since we were in this area and I heard lots about it. The menu has lots of different choices and variety. We ordered the fu-king fried rice, malaysian noodles. The food came out and I wasn't amazed by it. It was your typical Chinese food. I am not really sure if I like it enough to come back though. Everyone seemed to really love this place and the food but the food doesn't live up to the hype.
So bleh. Just Chinese food.
Also, I was surprised we had shared tables. So if you have a small party, they might sit you with a shared table, I don't know how common it is in London? I see shared tables as a norm in Asia/China though but not usually that common in America.",-1
5,Just had the pleasure of trying this place out when I was visiting family in London and fell in love with the delicious food and their wonderful service! The employees were very friendly and helpful to us newcomers and the wine was fantastic as well! Can't wait to head back to London to eat here again,1
2,"Want Chinese food that's half the quality and twice the price? Well look no further because this is your joint. As an added bonus, the waitstaff will stay as far away from you as possible to ensure your privacy is maintained throughout the meal. Who wants people bothering them with food orders or cluttering your table with food and drinks? 
Seriously, if you're jonesing for Chinese food and your in Southbank then I suppose this place will do. It's good for groups because it's huge and they serve something that resembles Chinese food. But you can really do a lot better in the area.",-1
3,"It's a cool idea to only have one thing on the menu as it makes ordering pretty quick, which is more than can be said for the wait outside. I normally REALLY hate queueing for food in London, as you're never normally more than a five minute walk away from another good eaterie. A twenty minute queue on a Wednesday night in November was a bit excessive in my opinion (but in spite of looking up alternatives on my friend's iPad we stayed the course).
 It was sort of worth the wait, as after a while you just think, we've waited this long we may as well stay. Would I do it again? Probably not.
 Steak was well cooked, the sauce tasty, the mustardy dressing on the salad was very mustardy and with two helpings, I was full.
 Profiteroles were yummy (although extremely cold fillings - not sure if it was icecream) and the tarte citron very good.
 I'm glad I went but for another twenty minute queue it would have to be super special.",-1
2,"I had high expectations of this restaurant since it was highly recommended by friends who've been to the original Parisian branch (which was unfortunately under renovation when I visited one Summer).
 Alas, I was rather put off by the service (snooty, impersonal French.. it's like being in Paris all over again!) and small portions.
 If you are a steak lover, you'll find the steak decent, but nothing to rave about. My impression was more of a factory production line, where the waiter asks how you want your steak done - medium rare, medium or well done. They then serve you from a tray of pre-cooked meats, rather than prepare your food individually.
 The result can be disappointing, as the meat is at times luke warm, and the standards can vary.
 I was rather incensed that the waiter served me a very small portion of beef, and gave a much larger portion to the couple beside me. We were all paying the same price! Not only that, when we were given the choice of a 2nd (and final) helping, my portions remained small! Call it bad luck, but I was NOT impressed.
 To be fair, they made very good thin cut fries, and you could have as many servings as you desired. But I was hardly there for the fries, and had not intended to fill myself with a stomachful of oily high-caloried potatoes!
 If you're after good steak, by all means try this venue since it's received a lot of thumbs up from other patrons. But I doubt you'll leave feeling much impressed - it's one of those been there, done that experiences. I won't be going back.",-1
4,"Yauatcha is a unique place for devouring Chinese food as if there's no tomorrow :)) such a chic decor, gets you in the right state of mind from the moment you enter the restaurant, the food exceeded my expectations, and I was left feeling happy, full and delighted with the flavours and mouth watering dishes  a must for all Chinese lovers!",1
1,"No no no, how can this place be number 1? Okay so the food is pretty decent and the prices are low but IMHO the service out weighs all of that, The staff are the rudest for miles! They usually sit you with other people, plates and cutlery can be dirty, they give you your bill when you have one more bite to go, like a pre-emptive strike for you to leave. Other places like 1997 or crispy duck (on the same road) offer a similar service but at least with better standards. I would much rather pay the extra and eat there.",-1
4,"Hip dining. Tried their kimchi ramen and it was an instant hit. Place is fairly small and crowed, ambience is pretty loud. Be considerate and eat and leave since there always seem to be  a long line waiting. I hate it when people just sit there forever after they eat, if you want to catch up, go somewhere else, be considerate when there are other people waiting for tables. We waited for around 45 mins.",1
5,"best Indian food i've ever had!! I came here 3 nights in a row to try and get a table. On the first two nights, the wait was 90 minutes, so I went elsewhere. On the third night, the wait was 45 minutes. I decided to take the chance and wait, and I'm glad I did. 
I ordered the Chicken Ruby and Garlic Naan.  Prices are a little high for the portions, but I expected that since it's The chicken was so juicy and tender, and the flavors were amazing. The garlic naan was also very good and tasted fresh. I dipped the naan in my chicken ruby as well as the three sauces they put on each table. All the sauces were delicious but unique. 
I'm happy I decided to wait for Dishoom, and I would wait an hour and a half if I came back!",1
3,"Wow, I can't believe that I find myself so at odds with other Yelp!ers who have raved about the food at Punjab. I thought it was just OK, nothing special. The restaurant itself is a delight, comfortable and welcoming with loads of character and the service was impeccable. However the food, which was the main reason I was there, was good, but not great.
Best of the dishes was the Pudina Gossht, Lamb marinated in fresh mint cooked with herbs and spices and green peppers. The lamb was succulent and the spicing delicate it was good but not historic. However, the Methi Murgha, chicken with cooked fresh fenugreek, was bland, the pillau had a dirty flavor to it that matched its grayish colour and the bhindi masala was unremarkable.
Great atmosphere, whether you're dating or doing business, but there is much better Punjabi food to be had. Maybe dinner is better than lunch for some reason but I won't be going back to find out.",-1
5,"Helpful staff, friendly and on their game, quick to fix mistakes and help with anything and everything. Food is great quality and innovative. Always a good atmosphere and cool place to eat",1
5,"I am from Bombay (not Mumbai, never Mumbai). I had to try out what Dishoom claims to serve--the kind of food you'd get in Irani cafes back home. The menu definitely looked promising: kheema pav, far far, etc. Not everything's in there, but there's enough. I am not a purist anyway.
The drinks on the menu are good. Especially, the chais--regular, chocolate, Baileys, the lot. The lassis are average, I'd say. In terms of food, what stands out is the okra, koliwada prawns, britannia biryani, mattar paneer, spicy lamb chops, & the frankies. It isn't the regular London curry house fare, but it is good. What really surprised me were the desserts: memsahib's mess & malai kulfi were amazing. 
But what most people do go here for is the eclectic decor & the outdoor seating area. Both are worth the premium that you pay for. Good service and a great place to catchup with friends.",1
2,"It seems to me that the staff at Veeraswamy believe that they can rest easy on the reputation of being the ""oldest Indian restaurant"" in London, as well a star in the constellation of London's most popular (and expensive) Indian restaurants. However, our waitress was lackadaisical, slow, snobbish, and flippantly rude. And when I say ""slow"", I mean excruciatingly slow with suggestions like ""I'm sure you want to wait until the next course."" Well, actually, no. I don't want to wait 15-25 minutes between each course.  It cast a pall over the lovely dishes - which were, indeed, fine - but certainly not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination. The lamb knuckles were delicious and tender. The chicken in the chicken curry, however, was tough. Great naan. Mediocre rice. The best thing was their interpretation of ""street food"" chaat - which was fantastic. We had the tasting menu - 75 pounds with wine per person. After cocktails and the chaat (which we ordered separately) it's a pretty hefty price to pay (about 200 pounds - $320 or so) for the ""thanks"" that she tossed off with a shrug of her shoulders. She seemed offended that we didn't want coffee or tea. How barbaric of us. I don't recommend this restaurant - you're much better off at a smaller, family-run place - where the quality of food will be very similar and with a staff who is glad to serve you.",-1

1,"I was in London on holiday craving some ramen and found this spot listed on a lot of dining lists for top ramen spot in London. I decided to check it out and ordered some standard miso ramen and an order of pork buns. The pork buns came out first and it was not yummy at all! Seems like the pork belly was old and the buns were not soft at all - instead of being nicely steamed it tasted and looked like frozen microwaved pork buns. The ramen was underwhelming as well. The eggs were not cooked how I liked (yokey yellow and brown soy sauce soaked). The noodles were ok, I've had much better. The noodles tasted like they were sitting out in room temperature for too long. The broth was very watered down. I was so upset after reading good reviews about this place and left 80% of my order untouched.",-1
4,"Ambience...is modern, fun...Service is very attentive...Drinks are good but need more alcohol in it cuz it tasted more like juice than cocktail...Foods are OK not bad....Portion is too small for the price.",1
4,"Last summer, I reviewed the Hakkasan restaurant located at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami. I absolutely loved their food so it only seemed logical during my recent my week-end in London to have dinner at one of their London locations which, in my case, happened to be the Hanway Place one.
Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that the restaurant was almost identical to its sister location in Miami for the setting there is absolutely stunning. I had their Dim-Sum platter which were tender and perfect.
The Dim-Sum platter tenderness was matched by their Wagyu beef which was a delicacy that I really enjoyed.
All in all, I had a very good dinner although I hated the fact that I felt we were being rushed out after the main course as our waiter told us that our table had to be cleared for their next customers and that since we had gotten there ten minutes late, they could not allow us to have dessert. I, then, argued that hadn't they had directed us to the bar and left us there for a good 25 minutes after our arrival, we wouldn't have had to order dessert so late. Finally, the restaurant manager ""agreed"" to let us order dessert which we did.
All in all, I had a great experience food wise but the aforementioned ""dessert incident"" is the kind of things that can absolutely spoil an otherwise perfect dinner. I understand that this restaurant seems to be always full but how can anyone in their right mind tell their customers they can't order dessert?
One last detail: as this restaurant is located beneath ground level, there is no cellular signal whatsoever anywhere inside.

5,"Love love love this place, even more so that there's a new branch opening soon, just near HK in Liverpool street. Their mushroom rolls were the one, so tender and yummy. Dim sum was really good, cocktails were amazing. Need to go back and revisit. Also their jaffa Macaron is the best, like you're eating a jaffa cake straight out the box. Incredible",1
4,"This place is a fantastic  dim sum style Chinese restaurant and tea-room. It is pretty funky and trendy in here which means it is on the more expensive side but the food is certainly worth it.
I have visited a couple of times now for special occasions, and the place is perfect for cosy dates! I would request to be seated downstairs in the main room if you are looking for a bit of atmosphere as they have a beautiful sky effect with gorgeous lighting.
There is also a fabulous range of oriental inspired cocktails but they tend not to taste very alcoholic (even though they most certainly are!) so it is worth keeping an eye on how many you order! Upstairs there is also a patisserie which is lovely to visit for tea. I would definitely recommend booking in advance as the place can get very busy.",1
3,Not as good as the original. Food was fine but much more touristy. Probably partly due to the area it is in. Spend the time to search out the original or one of their other venues.,-1
3,"The surrounding and setting of the restaurant is amazing, taking you into a Midsummer's night dream and out of London for that moment. There are too many tables for my liking, as it takes away from the romantic or sentimental moment to be shared in such a beautiful setting. A much better spaced out and ambiance setting for romantic meals would be Greenhouse in Mayfair.. but completely different price point.
As for the food, I found the A La Carte a better option than the given tasting menu. The food is quite greasy and cooking skills were not put to test with the presentation similar to that of a posh school dinner..? Best way to describe it !
So 3/5 given for the overall experience. My suggestion would be to have a drink and a view of the main room. And save your appetite for a better eatery.",-1
2,"The service was terrible and the food was okay. The waitress brought our bread 10 minutes after we had finished all of our other courses. The samosas we ordered still never arrived and after telling her again she said ""okay Ill do you a favor and not bring them"". They throw out ALL food after without letting you take it home!! How is that even a valid option-- What about food waste? Overall a really frustrating experience that could have been diverted by better service and a disclaimer when ordering extra food, with intention to bring some home, that they toss it in the rubbish like their service.",-1
3,"This one was recommend by my friend as one of the best places in London for Chinese food. We visited here at approximately 7:30pm and there are already a lot of customers in here. We got 3 main dishes, 1 fried rice and 1 appetizer for 3 people, and the size of the main dishes are as little bit small. The one with eggplant was good and it also has fish in it.
Of course, they are famous for roster duck but we tried their fried pork and duck, which is also really good.
If you want some authentic Cantonese good in London, try this one. The waitresses are also from Hong Kong lol",-1
1,"The worst service one can possibly have. It's hard to fathom how such customer service can suffice in this day and age. Have it enough chances, think they don't deserve another. Essentially not only do they rush you to order, they also kick you out before you even finish your food.
Food is just a 3 star I'd say. Not bad but nothing outstanding. Price is high however and way to high for the service they provide.",-1
5,"Dishoom is without a doubt the best Indian food I've ever had! Decided to go here for lunch with a friend who had recommended it. I'd heard how good it was, but I'd never been.
The atmosphere is meant to invoke the feeling of being in a Bombay café from the 60s. And they've got it spot on. 
You have to get to Dishoom early if you want any chance of getting seated relatively soon after you arrive. We waited about 15 minutes before we got a table. We arrived around 1pm. 
The server suggested having a chai, which was the most delicious chai I've ever had. It's also bottomless, which is great. 
After my friend and I perused the menu, we decided on the lamb biryani, black dhaal, chicken tikka, some rice, and garlic naan. It was all SO delicious! The food is family-style, so it's easy to get a bunch of dishes to try with someone else!
If you're in London, Dishoom is worth a visit, even if the queue is really long!",1
5,"I went here twice when I was in London previously, this experience was again top-notch.  It has an interesting decor, great service, perfectly cooked food, and an interesting range of flavor profiles on the menu without taking on too much.  
Their cocktails and chai's are also out of this world.  A tiny bit on the pricier side but worth it for all the reasons listed above.",1
3,"I have to agree to some other Yelpers reviews here, it has a very hipster vibe. Even I am into Punk Rock / Rock N Roll and love a good Izakaya, this place is way to loud. It was hard to talk to each other and even the waitress had a hard time understanding our order. 
The menu was super hard to read, the font was micro sized printed on brown paper in a very dimmed light. The ramen was ok, the broth was very diluted with no depth or flavor. The waitress also forgot some things we ordered, but it was on the bill anyway. So we had to let them know that we wont pay for items that we didn't get, which was acknowledged, but not excused in any kind of way.
As a bar/pub hang out with a twist, its kinda ok-ish, but there are better places for that in Soho. I had the most amazing ramen in Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. This place wont be ending up on my top ramen list.",-1
4,"You know you're in good hands when a Modern Chinese restaurant is a 1 Michelin Star. Amazing cocktails, amazing food and impeccable service. When you don't know what to get, the top 5 dishes are recommended by your waiter, and they do not disappoint. I was highly impressed, and I don't mind paying a hefty bill for 5 star food. Definitely recommend to all. Modern twist on Chinese food!!",1
5,"It's expensive for dimsum, sure, but everything was so exquisitely executed that it was worth paying extra for. I know my dimsum and I can say that it was one of the best I've had. I would definitely go back.",1
5,"There are not many places in town where you can write directly on the tabletops of a restaurant.  Ping Pong does not make exception to this rule.  It does, however, defy another semi-truism about London:  It is not always easy to find a delicious meal in a good restaurant for reasonable price.  
My family and I ate lunch here.  We were sat at a tale with some other guests - a move I always find cozy and quite conducive to friendly feeling meal.  (Conducive that is unless you are sat next to the Adams Family or Stalin.)  The decor was a zen sand garden, rocks of tables place gracefully among carefully raked sand.  
My family and I ordered a variety of dishes as one often does in dim sum.  Some steamed dumplings with prawn, some veggies with spice wrapped in something quite nice made of rice), soup, steamed rice, and more.  All items (soup excluded) came in sets of three like the Triplets of Belleville.  We were more content than a hoard of otters playing in the water.  Everything made our stomachs cry out with joyous choruses of ""hallelujah!"".  
Our soprano, mezzo soprano, alto and baritone converged into a chorus golden as Orpheus strumming his lyre.  The bill came to about 7 or 8 per person.  We didn't eat heavy, but we ate enough, and walked out light on our feet.  
The only deceiving aspect was that no paddles and ping pong balls were provided as a diversion.  Guess I'll have to bring my own next time.  Think they'll mind if I run around the restaurant smacking a small white off the wall?",1
3,"I'm surprised by all the great reviews. The food is decent, but just mediocre. The menu is quite boring as well.",-1
1,"Extremely overrated Indian food that is neither here nor there ! Waste of time, money and the one star ! Stay home and look up an Indian recipe online - it'll be more fun,  satisfying and more Indian than you know.",-1
2,"For the prices I cannot believe how poor the service was and that the drinks were served warm and the food cold.
We sat in the street kitchen section and all chaats were £4+ (Which makes one wonder when this up market street food trend will just implode).
I asked what the most popular small plates were, which is how I ended up with the chicken samosas (piled with yoghurt, pomegranate, spicy sauce and crispy bits) and the chicken lollipops. The samosas were lukewarm under their cup of cold yoghurt but still crunchy (and tasty, I really liked them). The lollipops were pretty boring to me but the husband loved them.
I ordered a prosecco cocktail that came out instantly, which would explain why it was flat and warm. I sent that shit back because come on. Really? The samosas had also come out right after I ordered them, so I guess they just make a bunch of food and drinks at once and then send it out when it's ordered? Lame.
My husband ordered the railway lamb curry, which was teeny tiny for the £9 price tag. Kept having to flag down the servers, even though it wasn't too busy (we were heading off to a show so had to leave at a specific time).
Bummed out as I had been wanting to try this place out since they attended a yelp event and served a fantastic (hot) chaat.",-1
4,"Nice variety of cakes and teas. 
Just stopped in for a snack and there were a number of interesting cakes to choose from. Ended up choosing the jasmine honey cake and classical beauty blue tea. Very light flavor of jasmine, but a very rich cake. 
If you're willing to pay for an slightly expensive cake, this is a good option. The service was also very good.",1
3,"very good food but not better than the Indian food you get in Berlin. It's quite expensive for a supposedly high class Indian meal at a top location. at the end i felt like i paid way too much for a good indian meal i could also get else where. the cue can go from 30 min (when you're lucky) to 2 hours before you can get seated at a table. nice atmosphere and caring waitresses/waiters. I almost walked straight in and ignored the hostesses at the door as they were wearing jeans, chucks and leather jackets and looked like students at a part time job.",-1
3,"Like others, I went expecting the 'rudest restaurant in London', but despite the waiter not wanting to sell us any drinks (their loss, I guess), it wasn't actually too bad.
 Portions were a decent size, and the set menu meal deal for two (£12 each) was reasonable value, though a bit more expensive than I was expecting considering how cheap the place is made out to be.
 Expect to share a table with others, especially if you're not in a big group. I've had better food in Chinatown, but then again I've had far, far worse!",-1
5,"If you want fast, good quality, delicious Chinese food, Wong Kei's is the place in China Town for you!
Stick to something simple and it's delicious - I can highly recommend the half/quarter crispy aromatic duck with pancakes (delicious!), the salt and pepper (chilli) deep fried squid is delicious.
The noodle soup with beef brisket or pork is also really yummy, full of flavour and meat.
The portion sizes here are great and you certainly won't leave hungry.
You should definitely try and sit on the ground floor as it's more open and airy than the upstairs floors. I love it in here, and even though the staff aren't overly friendly, if you're polite and thankful to them, they are actually very friendly back! 
Definitely check out Wong Kei's, especially because of the delicious food and GREAT PRICES!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!",1
3,"It's interesting how a frustrating day at work often leads to us going out for dinner during the week: it's a way to let off steam and give ourselves a treat to offset the work day.  You can sit back and enjoy some good food and the beer somehow tastes nicer.
We came here for a late dinner on Tuesday night, directly from work.  It is 5-10 minute walk from Bond St station.  The restaurant has two parts: street food upstairs and a more formal restaurant downstairs. The street food option felt more like a tapas-style place to have drinks and small dishes. We chose the downstairs option because we felt like something more substantial.
We got the gilafi seekh kebab for a starter. It was juicy and had a slight sharpness of chilli which I really enjoyed.  For our mains, we shared butter chicken and malabar prawns.  We got the roti of the month to help soak up the curries.  As for drinks, I polished off two beers while my wife had a ginger beer.  While the curries were good, they were not amazing.
The total cost was a bit over £60.  I liked the meal, but it was too expensive for my liking.  It could be driven by the location of the restaurant in Marylebone and the expectation for dinner prices in the area.  I am used to spending less and feeling more satisfied (and full) after a night at an Indian restaurant.",-1
5,"One of the best Chinese meals I ever had, can't believe it does not have higher reviews online.  I came for the duck and it was better than I expected.  There are multiple duck options but ordered the half Cantonese duck, seemed to be on the page that they were highlighting.  It was fantastic.  Crispy skin, meatier than expected and in a soy based sauce they really highlighted the duck.
I also ordered the two BBQ meat combo, with char sui and pork belly.  Both were great.  Char sui was flavorful.  Pork belly was not too fatty and the crispy parts were awesome (it was all tasty).
I also ordered a vegetable by pointing to a picture as I figured I needed something other than meat.  I wish they had smaller portions (of vegetables) but even it was very good, very garlicky and tasty.  
Overall, loved it and one of my favorite Chinese meals ever.",1
3,"Had the soft shell crab and it was great! The sauce it came with was quite spicy but not unbearably so, very very good. The ramen was alright, not the best I've had, and a little steep for £11.",-1
3,"I think this place would be a great venue to enjoy apps and... well, apps. they do some of the harder to find dishes like vada pau, and pretty well, altho pricey. cocktails are nothing special, wine list not great, and entrees are OK but overpriced. 
location, however, is fabulous. and our server was a sweetheart.",-1
2,"We really didn't like Hakkasan.  It definitely has an interesting ambiance, but the food and cocktails weren't up to par. This is a see and be seen kind 
of place so don't expect great things from the food like we did based off all the glowing reviews.  We left after the starters.",-1
3,"Alright this is a tough one cause I'm not big fan of the food. Business lunch.  They should probably change their name to the House of Ramen. ( I'm not talking about your regular Jail House Ramen by the way)  oh no. This is the fancy type, made in Japan.  I'll recommend getting liquor up for this, unless you're a hippie or vegetarian, in which case you're fine. I had what I thought would it be a safe choice: the steak - it looked nice and the meat was good, just a little too spicy.. and the need to ease down on them seeds! but I guess that's some cultural thing.",-1
2,Worst service have seen in years. Abysmal. Food swimming in dressing. Major disappointment,-1
3,"Fair warning to those who go to Indian restaurants for some heat. It's not even close to packing a punch. I've heard great things but didn't seem to have ordered the right things. I had a chicken tikka wrap which served to be a reasonable lunch portion but definitely felt like I was still eating on the light side. It almost felt like eating a spring roll. I asked for extra chili pepper and mixed that in with the sweet tomato jam sauce and raised the spice level to my taste. I guess it turned out alright. 
So if you want a hip place (think Bill's brunch but for Indian food?) and don't need your food to be particularly interesting, it's great ambiance. Again, not worth the price for the food, but for the ambiance.",-1
5,"""A Taste of Yauatcha."" £28.88 for 2 people, from 2pm until 6pm, Monday to Thursday, includes 8 type of dim sum and tea. Everything is delicious and amazing value!
After dim sum, my eyes were glued on beautiful cakes. When I ate the cake, it blew me away. That was fabulous!! You must try their cakes!!!",1
5,Excellent Modern Indian food. The cocktails were good as well. It is about time they modernized Indian restaurants to accompany good drinks with good food.,1
3,"We were told the wait would be an hour. They served us hot chai and sherry while we waited in line. It was maybe 20 mins before we were allowed inside to sit and wait for another 15 minutes at the bar. I had the BollyBellini - would not recommend, extremely sweet. Once we were seated, our server came over to explain the menu to us a bit. Due to the combination of the noise level in the restaurant with the velocity and volume of our sever's voice, I couldn't decipher what he was saying. 
Our food was good. The Mahi Mahi tikka was the best. The Chicken Tikka was super spicy. The server was busy and therefore the customer service lacked. When we were finished, he cleared our plates and we advised him that we didn't want dessert. We waited 20 mins at our seats for our check. We had to track him down to ask for it. We paid cash and were waiting for our change, he took our cash and disappeared for another 10 minutes. Overall the service really killed our experience, which is why I must give this restaurant a 3/5.",-1
5,"There is no better place to go for a quality Chinese food. I am quite the regular visitor there (maybe once or twice a week) and they know me. Although I am treated very well, there is no difference with the attitude against the other customers. That's why I can honestly say that the service is the best. The food is also amazing and always hot and spicy.",1
5,"All chai is coming strictly without Opium, but you would think otherwise with how good the Indian food is here at Dishoom.  Easily my favorite Indian restaurant in the United Kingdom, Dishoom draws inspiration from Bombay and all its incredible spices and flavors.  There are multiple locations, each with its own uniqueness, but if you're looking for some of the most flavorful bites you'll ever take, Dishoom is the place to go.
I believe it is important to eat family-style, each person ordering a couple of dishes and sharing them.  Get the Lamb Raan Bun and the House Special Pau Bhaji, the former a succulent pulled lamb with spices and special slaw, and the latter a masterpiece of mashed veggies and a pau bun.
In terms of grilled meats and curry, the Dishoom Chicken Tikka is never a bad choice, but I would also consider the Mahi Tikka or the Murgh Malai, both excellently prepared dishes.  If you're into Biryani, I would say to choose between the Chicken Berry Britannia and the Awadhi Lamb, both dependant on whether the choices on mains include chicken or lamb.
Finally, the Breads.  Basmati rice is a given to get for your meal, but the right bread choice will help shape the experience of the meal.  The Roomali Roti is an unleaved stoneground wholemeal, griddled and quite thin, in comparison to the leavened and yeasty, tandoor cooked Naan breads.  Each have distinct tastes, if you're not familiar with Indian breads, but I tend to lean towards the Garlic Naan.
Final word of advice, don't leave without getting the Bombay Pimm's, it is quite possibly the best cocktail on the drink menu, and if you're not careful, you may end up ordering 4 or 5 before it's too late.
Eccentric vibes and atmosphere, and an awesome enclosed patio space makes this place a top rated restaurant.  Add the fact that each dish is appropriately priced, and the case is there for why Dishoom deserves 5 stars.",1
3,"I was really disappointed by this place but the food was really tasty so Im putting a 3. 
The service was hazy not to the standard you would expect from such a place!
However the food was really tasty and original.
We had the seared steak salad, the pancakes, the crab doughnuts (loved those), Syrian tartare (very original with the yoghurt and pistaccio), the foie gras and the smoked mackerel.
The Spritz cocktails although not appealing looking were super good!",-1
2,"Had an OK experience here. Went in a group of six on a Thursday night with a reservation; good thing, too, because the place was packed. We sat in the basement/""bottom floor"" in a kind of alcove. 
We wanted to get grilled vegetables and fried calamari as starters, but the waiter said these items (which ARE labeled as ""starters"" in the menu) come out with all the other entrees. This system didn't really bother me but I just found it odd. For my main I got the murgh malai chicken. It was alright. I tried some sauces on my chicken; this was a bad move. Some of these table sauces were damn spicy. Not a refreshing, nasal-pasage-clearing spicy, just a prickly, why-is-this-sauce-like-this? unnecessary spicy. That kind of ruined the meal for me. The grilled veggies and calamari were fine but nothing to rave about.
Everyone else seemed to like their dishes but nobody was like, ""Oh, man, this is so good, you've gotta try some!"" 
The server was fine but there were times I wished he availed himself to our table a bit more tenaciously. Prices are quite good, all main dishes under or around GBP 10. The decor and ambience were very nice, lots of Indian ephemera and dim lighting. I should note the gents' bathroom: it has huge urinals and an odd soap dispenser. 
Overall a slightly below average experience. I can see that most people really like this place so I would give it another shot, but if I'm picking out a restaurant this wouldn't be my top pick. Be your own judge, however, because sooner or later you're gonna have to stop listening to me and start making your own choices. And that soap dispenser was pretty weird, so maybe go just to check it out.",-1
5,"Delicious Indian tapas style restaurant. Food is absolutely outstanding. Interior design is very cosy and the outside terrace is stunning. Only downside is that you may have to wait over 1 hour on weekends to be seated, but luckily they have great cocktails at their bar which makes waiting time enjoyable.",1
4,"Food was super good. Always very packed unless you go during off peak hours. Was a little pricey, but very delicious. Huge win for Gluten Free foodies as much of the menu is already gluten free!",1
1,"If there were a zero rating, this place would get it. We made a bad choice going here. We saw the young waitress become impatient, and shout at 4 older Asian women who were ordering their food and asking questions. Our food was okay only. We failed to notice the great little Viet restaurant across from Wong Kei where we had Pho the next day! Give this a miss, it's not worth it to spend any money here. I wonder at how such young women waitresses could be so angry and hate their jobs, perhaps they are not paid well and with their service they likely don't get tips!",-1
2,"I hadn't been to this branch for over a year, and I'm sad to say that it's still a pretty poor example of a Ping Pong. While the food is on point (try the new pork soup steamed dumplings - I can't spell it but you'll see it on the menu), the ambience is rather lost when you have to sit outside because they still have those awful eight people tables in the main dining area.
But at least we managed to avoid those again. Instead we ended up on a rather small two person table outside - which was made better once the nearby heat lamp was turned off as suddenly it felt like we weren't being cooked.
Food was fine but the manager who took the order slip from us didn't notice we had ordered two portions of the pork buns. So once our waiter realised it was rectified but came a while after everything else.",-1
5,"Shou mai are amazing, had the pork belly stirfry which was really tasty and had the jasmine ribs which were the best ribs ive had in a long time, proper chinese sticky ribs, amaaaaaaaaaaaaazing. But its a posh place and aint cheap, but very very worth it.",1
4,"Good dim sum place. I especially liked the chasu cheong fun. 
A bit tight if one is downstairs. Upstairs is pretty awesome. 
The desserts are more pleasing to the eye than tasty. Still worth a try. 
Good service.",1
1,"The wait was long and they left us in the cold outside!
The staff gave us the wrong information about the Valentine's menu and forgot my order!
The worst was the supervisor who ignore our calls and pretended we didn't exist. Only saving grace was the ramen which was nice.
Will not recommend becoz of terrible service. The Japanese way has been totally ruined by the supervisor.",-1
3,"Not impressed. I rarely give a grim review... but when a table mate informed the server of her allergies... our waiters response was ""everything comes pre packaged or canned"" My thought was really?  
Surely they could have served steamed rice with fresh sushi... no soy. Instead they told her ""we have nothing we can serve you."" 
That was my first disappointment, but I don't think I need to explain any further. 
Michelin Star??? Not based on service or accommodations!",-1
3,"Before reviewing Nobu, I should note that I have been to Japan and eaten fresh sushi there.
That being said, Nobu is likely the best sushi you can have in London. Our party arrived on time and we were promptly seated. The staff checked our coats and took us to our table. The locale is very trendy with some great lighting centered just above the table. Great for taking photos of your food! Also people watching as you'll see all walks of life inside.
I expected the sushi to be the highlight of my dining experience here but instead it was the appetizers, notably the sushi tacos, the baby tiger shrimp tempura, and best of all--the roasted padron peppers. Each order of sushi tacos brings just one delightful little boat with some salted sushi and tasty salsa sauce to go with it. The taco was great with a nice buttery flavor. The baby tiger shrimp tempura stole the show. They were just perfectly fried with a non-excessive helping of creamy spicy sauce. And you'll think I'm crazy for saying this but the shrimp was laid out on the freshest bed of arugula (or rocket, for the Brits) that I've ever had. So fresh that my friend and I finished up all the tasty greens after we finished the shrimp.
I was surprised to see the padron peppers on the menu instead of shiso (I suspect they may be the same). These playful peppers are known for their random distribution of spicy. Most of the peppers are not, but occasionally you'll get a really hot one and you won't figure out until you take a bite. These were roasted to perfection and quickly devoured by the members of our party. If these are on the menu (I believe they were a special that night) I suggest you try them. Their taste is pepper-y but distinctly different. More savory than sweet and rarely found in restaurants.
The drinks menu is nice an extensive with some traditional offerings plus a lot of nice Japan-inspired drinks involving sake, plum wine, lychee liquor, and shiso pepper leaves. I was between a bourbon based drink and the japanese margarita and ultimately went for the latter  which contained red chili infused sake in addition to your margarita fixings. There's a great number of non-alcoholic juice-based options if that is more your style. The lychee beverage was just sweet enough and definitely a nice alternative for those nights you really don't want to spike that alcohol level.
Finally, the sushi. The sushi tacos had some of that lovely raw fish served at Nobu but were overpowered by the salsa and taco. The real show is with the sashimi. You order your individual piece and they'll bring them out in a grand serving plate. You get your choice of different tunas--all of which are fantastic and fresh. I had a lovely dining experience with the exception of a couple sashimis whose rice beds fell apart. These were dabbed on the underside with just the right amount of wasabi. Although if you like some more you'll have some of that as well at your table.
Ultimately this was a positive experience albeit over priced. This is likely a combination of Nobu being a trendy London restaurant and the steep prices for decent fresh fish in an inland city. As mentioned before, the show stealers were really the tempura shrimp and the padron peppers rather than the raw fish.  At the end of the day, the reality is that I had a more satisfying sushi experience at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Tokyo than I did at the great Nobu in London. I loved the arugula and padron peppers, but is that really what you should take away from this experience? Just not worth the price tag.",-1
4,"My friend and I dined here and ordered the tasting menu.  IIRC it was something like 119 GBP/person.  With a bottle of wine, our bill was around 300 GBP so this was definitely a splurge meal for us.
The food was great though.  There was so much food we couldn't finish all of it but I tried everything.  The duck was great.
If I can afford it, I'd like to come back again...
I had a reservation at 7 and was told that we had the table until 9.  However, we didn't end up leaving until around 10 so I guess it was all good since we spent so much money here.
The location is a little tricky to find but google maps and such can lead the way.
It looks like it used to be a trendy bar/club type place but it's not quite as trendy anymore.  It was still pretty busy though.
Our waiter was good and attentive but was a little annoying and over the top saying things like ""Oh, this is my favorite dish in the entire world!"" and ""Excellent choice, that's my favorite"", etc.",1
1,"Lousy service.  The food was ok.  There were small portions, and soup was cold!  On top of that Unfriendly waitresses.  We came all the way from Los Angeles to try the Chinese food in London Chinatown.  Kind of disappointed in this place...",-1
1,"First trip to London and on a whim me and 3 friends came to dinner here for my birthday. Everything started off amazing. Food was great, service was spot on and atmosphere was really fun. Met some cool people sitting next to us and decided to get the check and go to the bar in the hotel attached,also apart of chiltern firehouse. This is where the whole night took a wild turn. 
After we got in ,the hostess, Amy Cuff, came up and notified us we would only be allowed one drink and would need to leave immediately after because the bar was ""private"" and since the hotel was packed they ""needed the room"" for hotel guests. Which we were with. 
Just FYI. The bar was empty....
We tried to order another dink from the EMPTY bar and the bartender said very apologetically the hostess notified him we were allowed one drink and then require to leave. 
Birthday ruined. Never coming back. Ladder Shed London. You failed.",-1
4,"I've only been here for the Sumday Special where you can eat all you want for 18 quid. Not a bad deal. The selection of dim sum is quite extensive and I loved everything we ordered. I ate way too much of course, but it's too good of a deal not to. The sharing tables can be a bit awkward if you shared it with a family with young kids like we did and you're drinking bottles of wine. But it would be a good place for dinner before a big night out or for a party. I can't wait to go back and get my steamed pork bun on!!",1
5,So delicious! The menu is limited but you really can't go wrong with a ramen-only specialty restaurant. Can't wait to come back!,1
3,"Went there with two friends, for lunch they have the set menu for 26 quid. I was really courious because it's such a famous place, it has to be THE BEST.
We tried the luncheon menu with beef in wasabi sauce, a mixed sushi and sashimi lunch and their signature dish, highly recomended by the waitress: the balck cod everithing with the sake tasting.
The food is really good, fresh, amazing flavours.
The cod was surprisingly delicious, perfectly cooked and with a lovely subtle sweet flavour.
I have to say NOBU has god a way with dressing sauces, everithing was so well balanced and delicious, even the salad dressing (we've been told that's made with 10 ingredients, the main 3 are onions, black pepper and japanese mustard).
The beef was perfectly cooked and the wasabi sauce simply delicious.
And I'm still thinking about the mouthwatering of the tuna.... sooooo good.
Then we tried a bento chocolate box wich is practically a choccolate souffle', served warm with green tea ice cream on the side.
The souffle' was perfect, light and crunchy outside with a warm creamy heart. And the ice cream itself was really nice, gentle taste.
But the match of them wasn't right for me, the ice cream is just too delicate for the choccolate flavour. It's just not right, the ice cream disappear on your mouth leaving only a cold sensation when you eat the two ingredient together.
The staff is really nice, our waitress has been very helpful.
Still I didn't like that they cleaned the plates away without asking if we were done (they took away the salad I was slowly enjoying on the side of everything else).
They gave us the wrong beef at the beginning, and even if everything was really good, I definitely have to say that is overpriced. It's true you're in central London and you're overlooking hide park but this is not a good reason to let me pay 32 quid for a portion of cod!!
A special mention for the toilet which are pretty small (specially because are shared with the meetings room on the 1st floor, but I find amazing the special make up side with armchairs, white light and mirrors to retouch your make up.
Still I think whenever I want to eat great japanese food I'll go back to TOSA in chiswick, same level of quality for half the price.",-1
3,"If you are exploring Chinatown, this place is hard to miss. Husband and I decided to share a bento as we wanted a light snack (but weren't starving). We ordered their teriyaki chicken bento and paid extra for substituting the thighs with chicken tits. 
The neat thing about ordering here is you can ask for a bigger portion of rice at no extra charge. We did that and even though the portions were good, everything was so bland. From the teriyaki chicken tits to the assorted marinated veggies - ehh. Really fresh sashimi though. Good presentation but probably will venture off to try another place for Japanese bento. 
Side note - if you bring in bubble tea from another place, you cannot consume it in the restaurant. 
Side note 2 - The black shaped large ceramic spoon in the center of the bento holding three green beans is not to be used as a spoon...oops.",-1
3,"Well.. was ok, I guess. In theory Ramen are just a fast food, but nvertheless it's quite difficult to get it right. This place is a quite a gimmick: A blonde greets you at the door with a forced and awkward ""irah..shai..ma..sei?"", hits an embarrassing Japanese drum, and shows you to your table.. the broth is quite boring.. neither memorable, nor worth writing much more about.. ok overall. 
(oh, on the way out they hit the drum again.. I have probably eaten at 500 different restaurants in Japan, and never seen this before)",-1
5,"Wow! This place was so good, great service too. Excellent crowd, hip yet not obnoxious LA hip. Definitely will go back.",1
3,"The Ping Pong menu is a stylised and sterilised form of a dimsum portfolio. So much so that it loses the dimsum edge. Dimsum is a Chinatown thing and should just stay that way. 
The Southbank Ping Pong is definitely one of the better ones, not just because it looks and feels like cool dining, but also because of the efficient and friendly service level. There's a chance you order might be delayed on busy occasions, but overall, I've never had a bad experience here.",-1
5,uber cool place very dark lighting which gives it its coolness great place to impress and just forget wat time it is.,1
5,Amazing is the only word for this place! Make sure you sit downstairs as its majical with little starry lights and gorgeous decor. Upstairs is really nice for tea and cake but it's definitely a must for dinner. It's not the cheapest of places but i'd say it was worth the pennies.,1
3,"Great indian/pakistani food but slightly pricey (especially the naans). There are better, tastier, and cheaper options like Tayyabs and Lahore Kebab House.",-1
2,"I'm not certain what is the hype about. This is far from being a good indian place. The curry sauce tasted like italian tomato sauce with a touch of indian flavor, lacking the depth and richness of true indian dish. I must admit the naan bread and roti were very good otherwise I would've given them 1 star. If you want to experience indian food go where locals eat but this one is geared for tourists who unlikely to come back.",-1
3,"Quite decent food, for very basic expectations. You get a meal for £10 that would cost £3 in Tokyo, but nevertheless nothing particularly wrong with what they serve. That particular day, the waitress was unacceptably rude, especially for a Japanese restaurant, but perhaps it was simply bad luck.",-1
3,"The staff at this place were very friendly and, as you can't book a table unless there are more than 8 in your party, quite adept at telling people that they might have to wait a bit. Handily, there is a bar upstairs where you can wait (and buy expensive cocktails, obviously) and a fair ticketing system so there's little chance that you'll have enough material to write a half hour sitcom here.
 In the end we only had to wait about 15 minutes as we didn't mind sharing a table with other people. The seating in the restaurant was nice to look at but, because you're sharing a semicircular bench with someone else you do have to co-ordinate yourselves to get it in the right position. The table we sat at was for 8 and it would have been great if we'd all been together but with all that dim sum on the table it felt a little cramped trying to keep our stuff on our little quarter.
 It's a great idea to have dim sum as the entire menu as in a proper Chinese restaurant you can only get it at a certain time of day. In comparison to dim sum I've had before the menu is quite small and eclectic. But the food that we ordered was good. They asked us if we had ever been to a Harvester, I mean Ping Pong, before we ordered so it's clearly aimed at people who have never savoured the delights of dim sum before and my friend (who never has) loved it. Because the portions are smaller you feel that you can be a bit more adventurous with the menu. The waitress advised us to get 5 dishes each!! but I assured my friend that 3 each should be enough and it was.
 It was great fun in here - less brash than dim sum at a Chinese restaurant but less speedy and less menu but fun all the same. If you want authentic dim sum, though, I would recommend any Chinese restaurant instead.",-1
5,"Want clean, fresh, and unique dim sum? This is the spot! Being the less expensive sister restaurant of Hakkasan in my opinion Yauatcha is better in taste and originality. When I ate at Hakkasan I was not impressed. It just reminded me of eating at a really good normal dim sum place I'd find in Chinatown. The service, decor and ambiance is impeccable and the food is too die for! Each bite kept me guessing and pleasantly surprised. You won't be disappointed. Try it!",1
5,"When I called to make reservations, I was a bit baffled: the lady wasn't really that friendly and we could only have a table for 2 hours in total (in our case from 7 till 9 pm). What are they going to do? Tell us to spit out the last bit of food in our mouth and show us the bill? Made the reservations anyway, because one of my friends told me that the Hakkasan is a must. And he was right! To begin with the tight schedule: I don't know how, but we never had the feeling that we had to rush. It was very crowded, but we still enjoyed our privacy. The Asian food was very high-level. We were a party of 5 and the waiter recommended us to all choose something different for starters and main course and share. That worked out fine. It gives the whole evening (oh no, 2 hours) a very communicative and cosy touch. The service was very good anyway: very accurate, not at all obtrusive and very friendly. And somehow they really know how to get you out after 2 hours, without being pushed.
 Prices are fairly high, but for us tourists in London it was a one-time experience that I would not want to have missed out on. The combination of the perfect food, the one-time atmosphere with floral arrangements, without daylight (the restaurant is in a basement) and a very nice combination of hip and stylish elements without forgetting the need for cosiness, makes it to this one-time experience. Although, not that one-time I hope: I will definitely visit this restaurant again! And to be honest: you might want to leave after 2 hours anyway, because otherwise you might be broke by the end of the evening ;-).",1
2,"Not that good as I had too much good experience in HK. The food did not meet my expectation. The pork belly bun is too fatty for me and the steamed bun is not that soft, the sauce is not strong. The dumpling is nothing special. Will not go again 
But the staff is very helpful there",-1
3,"Perfectly fine, decent Chinese food. Not spectacular, but we left happy.
This is noodle oriented shop, not dumpling centered. Most Chinese in the US are Szechuan and/or dumpling--even if they have no special dumpling skill: they serve the standard steamed dumplings.  I appreciated that Wong Kei sticks with what they do best: noodles.
We shared a beef with black bean sauce and a shredded chicken with fried noodles. Both were good. they did not bring any white rice for the bean sauce dish, which is odd when coming from the US--they brought it when we asked. And even though there were three of us they did not bring plates. 
Still, the food was good and we were satisfied--paying check was a little bit difficult.",-1
3,"The place wows you the moment you walk into the door. It has a unique Indian look and feel. There are kurkure( strictly Indian commercially available to most of the parts) and Parle-G biscuits( the oldest biscuit in the Indian biscuit history for me) stacked nicely next to the entrance. That's when I fell in love with it's ambience. We sat on the street room. The truck sign on the walls are just one of a kind. We were nicely welcomed and seated quickly in about 15 mins, as promised. We sat next to the kitchen, it smelt heavenly. We ordered about 4 dishes which included 2 appetizers, but they weren't enough. So we ordered one more. We tried papri-chat, it was nice and fresh. The next we had was Parsi chicken which was nothing but ordinary. We ordered two other chicken dishes i.e chicken manchurian and andhra curry chicken, both were very bland and dull. So, I would give it no more than 3 stars",-1
1,"This is not a Japanese ramen. I ordered chicken ramen and the taste was bland and my friend ordered pork based ramen but he said it tastes so bland. The price is expensive, there is no Japanese thing in this resto and the matcha taste bitter, it is like cheapest matcha which you can find in supermarket. I used to stay in Osaka Japan, and my descendant is Japanese, I know exactly this is not made by Japanese hand. They also asked for tips which makes it worst.",-1
3,"Umm I did enjoy the food, not overly keen on sitting at a bar with other customers to eat my food but guess this is the style of the place. There are big circular tables downstairs which are available to book for groups. There are a lot of options on the menu to choose from and a good cocktail list too.
The house white wine was very nice.
I think there could be a few more options for set deals as these were limited.",-1
3,"I'd heard a lot about Dishoom, and so really wanted to try it. After not being able to get in the night before, we made a reservation and got a table to following day.
I guess the problem is that we went to India last year and so our expectations may have increased quite a bit for Indian food. We started with the samosas, and frankly they could have come from absolutely anywhere. The thing that improved them was the chutneys.
The tamarind chutney in particular took me right back to my time in India. I was also pleased to see that the naan we order arrived in the exact same manner, style and taste as we had in India. But what is with all those people ordering it without butter? Seriously people - it'll be much better with!!
We had both the paneer and the chicken tikka. I preferred the paneer but it was a little under seasoned for me - but the texture showed that it was super fresh. The chicken tikka... Well I could tell it had been made properly - no red food dye in sight. But it was a bit bland - I needed to spice all of it up with the chutneys.
I'd come back to Dishoom, as I've read enough solid reviews to make me think that we just ordered badly. I must say that the staff for the most part are excellent.",-1
5,"If you like Chinese then you will like Wonkies. Its situated on the end of China town in the height of central London. The food is great, the service is quick and the quality is fabulous.
The thing is about Wonkies and this is whether you like traditional Chinese meals or not there service of feeding people is known all around London and the rest of the world, the prices are reasonable and the restaurant itself has the all the Feng Shui you need to know where you at, what style of food your eating and more importantly you will be able to eat in the knowledge your not being over charged.
The grubs great, its always busy and the staff there have been there since day one. This business is making money, and they need to because the overheads down West End are sky rocket.
The type of people who eat in this restaurant vary, you have the traditional China town residents, regulars and people like me who venture down West regularly to eat Chinese food. Even if it was not Chinese food I would probably still eat there, because I like Chinese tea (sound familiar?). If so you will love Wonkies as am sure you already know having been there is you get free green tea, not just any old green tea but green tea that helps you clear your palette before eating and green tea that helps you wash down your food.
If I have any grumbles about Wonkies it is about the pepper, now it has not happened for a while perhaps because its the summer and the air is much drier but previously I have found the pepper shaker to be blocked. This means simply tapping the pot and sometimes means having to take of the top lid and scrape away the troublesome blocks of pepper, once years ago the pepper fell out onto my food, but anyway I still ate it because I get very hungry. I once invited my pops and brother but unfortunately they declined coming and took me to the pub instead.
Well what did they miss out on rather than just speaking about the free condiments and wonderful abundance of chopsticks. Sweet and sour is always a favourite with us English. For the health fanatics out there I recommend asking the waiter for greens with your meals, the crispy belly pork is great. The best thing about Wonkies though is the duck is does not matter whether your talking duck pancakes or Duck on rice is all very yummy. Another great meal if your ok with pork and don't mind prawns is a pasta based meal. This meal is called fried Quon Dou its yummy just try it with a huge dollop of the yummy chilli sauce, you will not regret this one the foods great.
Sea lovers ship ahoy there's a great meal that is a set meal with pasta that comes with yummy fish-balls calamari or squid and a yummy spinach based leave to soak up the gooey sauce.
If your in two minds about eating Chinese when your down the West End in London and are unsure where to turn or take your large party of hungry friends then Wonkies is where you should turn.
P.S. Another little tip there is often budget meals on the walls with special that are not necessarily on the menu, there nice but I would not get to distracted the food I spoke of here is well worth checking out for now. If your really adventurous your could try the intestines or the offal dishes but I usually go with what's your normal Chinese grub, but if its a dessert your after your stuffed there are no sweets at Wonkies. Final note yes they do sell Chang beer. Happy eating.",1
2,"Service is pretty poor.
Went with a few of my colleagues and we all ordered the Ramen and some drinks.  It actually took about 15-20 minutes for us to get any type of drinks and we had to remind the waiter about our drinks.  After we had the sake and it helped a little bit more.
Ramen:
No taste, no flavor.  BLAND.  Noodles were good.  That's it.",-1
4,"This was my first time at this restaurant. Overall, the decor was fabulous - one of the coolest spaces I've seen in a long town. 
I don't live in London - I live in San Francisco. But overall, I thought the food was very good. I had the corn and crab soup and the roasted chicken satay. Overall, I thought all of the other dishes we had (lamb salad, tofu, double cooked pork) were all very strong as well.
This place is fairly pricey, so I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Great ambiance, very good (but not outstanding) food. Great for out-of-towners like me.",1
5,"I find it hard to take the time to write about beans but the daal here begs for it. I've never had beans prepared in such a way that I wanted a second helping. Don't miss the black daal!
Beyond the unforgettable daal, the entrees and non-alcoholic drinks were outstanding - really loved the virgin bombay colada. We had the chicken ruby (like a curry) which had a wonderful sauce of which we devoured every last drop. The murgh murai and sheekh kabab (lamb) were outstanding, I'm partial to lamb but this time the chicken beat it.
We waited about 45 minutes on a Sunday night after being told the wait was over one hour. We thought that time was a godsend as the Covent Garden location had a 2.5+ wait the night before.",1
4,"Lovely place. All the dishes were on point. The Mattar paneer was especially delicious. And that epic cheese naan with its perfect chewiness. We rounded out the meal with a lamb biryani and the chicken tikka. 
Service was a bit hectic, but to be fair the place was still totally packed at 14:30.",1
5,"For 26 years I have eaten Singapore Noodles at the Wonk, and they are Heaven. Fab noodles and a pretty tasty hot and sour soup too. See if you can get a tale on the ground floor. Only once in 26 years for me. We visit the Wonk every time we go to London.",1
3,"Average and overrated! Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe it's because we had breakfast but I didn't find this place particularly exciting. I'll most likely come back just as a follow up as I clearly must have missed something. But $7.50 USD for a piece of naan with bacon inside seems ridiculous. My fiancé ended up getting the Bombay omelette which was a little more filing and interesting but I was completely underwhelmed by the bacon naan wrap. I did observe other people get the bacon with egg which seems to give you a piece of naan that's twice of big. Looking back, perhaps I got the wrong item but the bacon naan is the suggested favorite on their menu.
I will comment that their service was super on point though and that the atmosphere and decor were very nice and fitting.",-1
2,I was told this was one of the best restaurants in London. However it seems to be the most expensive but the food is mediocre at best. All dishes tastes bland and not what you would expect. The decor is now dated and paying this sort of money you would at least expect a clean table cloth. I did enjoy the beetroot dish which was very nice and the staff extremely good but the food does not live up to the hype.,-1
2,"Bah!  I don't know what to make of Dishoom.  I really don't.
You walk in, and the music and atmosphere would lead you to believe you're walking into a Cuban restaurant.  You look at the menu, and there are maybe 3 of the Indian standards you're used to seeing.  They only serve chicken thighs.  They don't serve chicken breast.  The service is... odd.  It's not that it's bad, per se, but for example, my cousin ordered a ""white americano"" and the lady helping us out was all... ""white?  You want milk?  Ooooookayyyyy..."" like ordering coffee with milk was the weirdest thing she'd ever heard of.
I ordered the Murgh Malai.  It was alright.  It was standard grilled chicken thighs with some spice thrown in.  Nothing special, but it did taste nice.  The black daal, which they say is their signature dish, is good... but I've had better.  I did really enjoy the okra fries which were deliciously crisp and not at all slimy as okra can sometimes be.  But on the other hand, the naan was way overcooked and totally burned on one side.  I have also been for the breakfast, and I will say that the bacon naan roll was pretty good, but again... it's two pieces of bacon, naan, and cream cheese.  Eh.
If you have a craving for standard curries and Indian fare, Dishoom isn't the place to visit.",-1
2,"Extremely mediocre food, poor ambiance, weird and powerful soap smell, and high prices. £27 for two with two dishes, a paratha, rice, and raita. Maybe for really good Indian food, or a nice restaurant, but this was not that. Felt like a tourist trap, worth avoiding.
Note that they have canned mango as a desert option for over £3. Hilarious.",-1
3,"I'm REALLY RUBBISH at going to those 'in places' y'know. The more I'm told to do something, the less likely I probably am to...actually do it. Like watching Breaking Bad. But, at the end of the year, I finally got around to visiting.
We managed to get a table within about ten of arriving at around 2.30 on a Sunday afternonn - a far cry from the mega-queues I'd expected. Which was a good thing. I went for the Chef's Special of the Lamb Raan Bun. Slow cooked pulled lamb with dishoom slaw and crisp-chips (basically, supersuper thin little chips which were definitely more crisps than chips - but really tasty and well seasoned). The lamb itself was an absolute joy - falling apart in my mouth, and great with one of the spicy chutneys that they brought out too.
Unfortunately, despite the food being excellent, I felt pretty disappointed with the service. We were seated in the small, covered side area and were often left waiting for long periods when we were ready to order/for the bill/needed something. Our food came out at completely seperate times, and I was given the wrong ice cream at the end.
If Dishoom's service matched up to its food quality then it's be close to a five star score from me, but unfortunately I felt slightly 'shafted' with our seating which dampened the experience slightly.",-1
3,Food was not amazing. Just ok. We were looking for true French cuisine but this was pretty plain.,-1
4,"Wong Kei's food is okay and the prices are excellent.
The waiters are famous for being rude to people but unfortunately they have never been especially rude to me.
Anyway, I like it. Recommended for a nice cheap lunch.",1
3,"I have been to Veeraswamy about 5 times. Clearly I enjoy the food. I am only giving it 3 stars because of its prices (I would like to give a 3.5 star rating if that was possible). 
The ambiance is wonderful and the food is quite good. 
But the food isn't in the creative/fusion category, and the restaurant prides itself as traditional. As a traditional fare, it just isn't that interesting or traditional. It tries to be chic and refined, but yet the food just isn't that special or exceptional to warrant the price.  You are paying for the ambiance.  The appetisers are more refined though, which I would recommend. I almost would argue having a full meal based on the appetisers as they have more subtleties and complexities that I would pay for. 
For the traditional curry and grill items, you can do better at many other places for half the prices and bigger portion. Punjab (Covent Garden) and Tiger Spices (Soho) are both cheaper and have more flavorful food with big curry kicks. 
For a glass of wine, a starter, two curries (portions are small and don't have much sauces) and a dessert, you are looking at about 45-50 quids.",-1
3,"Now I was EXCITED for this, more than normal when going to try a restaurant! Why, I hear you exclaim? Well I'll tell oh reader (channeling Miranda a little bit there). My FAVOURITE kind of food ever is Dim Sum. Little parcels of heaven, often washed down with a fragrant smelling tea. I and do LOVE tea.
So Ping Pong, known in my circle of friends as the upmarket chain dim sum restaurant of choice in London (we are working on a catchier title trust me!). This one is in prime location, South Bank. Also nice decoration and always busy, even upstairs at the bar. That tells me that Ping Pong is doing something right. So I went in with high expectations. A fragrant cocktail at a very reasonable price (hibiscus mojito, why yes I'll have more please) started the evening well. Then we attempted the dim sum. Drum roll please. Well, in my head anyway. 
The Dim Sum was nice, good selection and tasty indeed. I felt slightly overpriced for what you were getting, especially considering Chinatown isn't a million miles away and hidden in there are some SUPERB cheaper places (if you know where to look). Don't get me wrong, a wonderful evening - don't go for a cheap meal (don't get dim sum if you want a cheap meal to be honest) but I would go again. Mainly for the cocktails, but considering this is my favourite kind of cuisine EVER I was satisfied. Yes readers, that is Daniel P and his high standards... ;)",-1
4,"I had to try this place after being recommended by a bunch of ramen friends. What was that? You don't have ramen friends? How weird.
It's opposite the Supreme store, so you can watch people line up for hours to buy a shirt too, 
It was busy and loud - I don't mind that for lunch and was dining alone anyway. Seated quickly, the place gives off a slight hipster vibe. Condiments all looked to be in the standard style, the hair bands were an odd addition, but back in the rock hair phase they may have been useful!
I ordered:
Pork Bone ramen. Korean wings. Green tea and still water. 
The wings showed up quickly. They were well spiced and as sticky as you like. Not too small, just right for an appetiser I reckon. Between two as a light one maybe.
The main event arrived shortly after. 
The broth was great. Tasty and lightly spiced as expected. I added a little of the chilli and I was more than happy with its heat level. The pork was a little thicker than I would have expected, but that isn't a bad thing. Lots of top ramen content. 
My green tea never arrived but my server was more than happy to either bring it to me or remove it from the bill.
Overall I enjoyed it, I'll certainly be back. It's not Shoryu good, but it's really close.",1
5,"Best Indian food and best overall dining experience I've ever had. 5 stars across the board. Food, service, atmosphere, price. All exceptional. No wonder this place always has a line out the door. If you're in London, this place is a must.",1
5,"Not to rave or anything but this place is damn good. As in hipsters-do-to-ramen-what-they-did-to-coffee good. I don't care for the furnishings and the complete lack of sound-absorbing materials means that the place is an acoustic fustercluck, but the food and the service is good.
Thankfully offering more than three viable choices (I'm looking at you, Tonkutsu and Ittenbari) the menu is semi-traditional. Thank gods they didn't try to over-fusion anything.
A pattern I've noticed with fairly good r^2 is that food quality is inversely proportional to pages of menu used to describe the ingredients, process, ritual sacrifices and ablutions involved in making the noodles. Bonedaddies' food menu fits on one page (on a clipboard, neat-o!).
I had a T22 which I chose a) because I was ramening with someone who keeps Kosher and b) because I couldn't resist COCK SCRATCHINGS (think chicken pork scratchings), which were more than just a novelty ingredient.
Toppings are varied and interesting, ranging from just meat, nori, eggs and the raved-about pipette-o-fat to the Xzibit-pleasing £2 extra portion of noodles (Yo Dawg, I herd u liek ramen so we put some ramen in ur ramen...)
Drinks are good but not cheaper than any restaurant, sochu is decent, Japanese whiskey range is luckily wider than Suntory.
Service is chirpy and is adorably cool-because-I-joke-around-with-customers rather than cool-because-I-look-down-on-people-buying-my-food-and-paying-my-wages.
All in all, a pretty decent joint for 10-quid noodles (actually 12-quid for brosized noodles).
Protip: get the traditional pickles to share if you're having a bony stock; acidity offsets the heavy creaminess delightfully. Also, this sucker is open pretty late on a weekday.",1
1,They make you wait in line outside. It began to rain. Get a lounge or call when a table is ready!,-1

5,"One of the best Indian Restaurants in London.
Despite the daunting queues to get inside, I keep returning to this place.
Excellent Food - love the Vada Pav, Black Dal and Roomali Roti. Mango Kulfi is also recommend.
The cocktails are also nice - in non-alcholic drinks I would recommend Kala Khatta Sharbat - really refreshing.",1
2,"I found the food to be unremarkable -- it was good, but nothing special and pricier than what one could find elsewhere.  I think what makes it popular is the buzzy, bistro-like atmosphere, which is pleasant.  It has a slight tourist trap vibe (for example, the fact that servers ask if you want sparkling or still, with no explicit mention of tap water, which you can always request of course, but you have to know to do so).",-1
5,I really loved this upscale Chinese joint. Posh and classy deep underground near Tottenham Court Road. Lovely food and drinks. I had a lovely cocktail peppered around the rim and all the dishes we ordered were flavourful and spiced carefully. Ambiance is perfect and overall a very nice expreience! Must go to if you're in need of a posh fun place with good food and booze!,1
3,"We came here back in Dec 2012 after doing some yelp research. Thank goodness they have yelp in London. The service was great but it was a little loud, so it was kind of hard to hear sometimes. The hubby was going to order a dish he thought would be saucy and luckily our waitress gave us recommendation.  Good thing that happened because we would have ordered the naan for nothing.  The mango lassi was one of the best!! I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered the chicken ruby curry and got rice and an order of the roti... The husband ordered the murgh malai. Both dishes were really really good. We also ordered the cheese naan which the hubby finished all before the entree got to the table. I'm still thinking  about their mango lassi....
The only thing I didn't like was where we got seated.. it was right by the door and hostess station.  It gets pretty packed for dinner.  I took the seat because we were tired and hungry and didn't want to wait for another table.",-1
4,I don't know about their regular menus but the duck is one of the best I've tried so far. Really really good.,1
3,"Very large chinese restaurant, set over four floors and very popular with students and anyone looking for a cheap, quick meal. It is not one of the most plush restaurants I have frequented but the barbeque pork noodle soup is wonderful, at under £4 for a very large bowl, it is an excellent choice for a quick lunch.The restaurant also has an interesting seating policy, be prepared to be seated at large large round tables with other customers. This can be a positive thing, as I have had several interesting conversations over my noodle soup.",-1
3,"Ok, I randomly picked this place because it has high reviews on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. But a lot of Indian restaurants have high ratings in London - so it truly was a random pick.
This is why I was shocked that there was a line waiting out the door at 3 pm on a random Saturday!! 
It's all good though. We decided to wait and were seated within 30 minutes. Which was awesome. The staff was very friendly. I mean - VERY. I have nothing but positive things to say about the people working here.
However, service was a bit slow. We showed up during a shift change and we kinda got lost in the shuffle with our waitress. But that being said, we took a while eating (one of the people dining with us has a condition that requires her to eat slowly) during a very busy time and not once did we feel rushed.
But why 3 stars? Well - because honestly I truly don't understand the hype. Yes, the food was good - but it was nothing special beyond a regular Indian restaurant. I think there's a lot of hype about this place and I'm not really sure why. I hear they have an amazing breakfast and a few wonderful and unique dishes, so maybe that's what bumps the rating up to 4 or 5 stars?
To me, it was a bit noisy and there were a few very odd dishes on the menu that don't scream ""Indian"" to me. Fried okra? But I guess it's all about what you're into. Everything we had was ""A-OK."" Yes, I'd go back. But personally, I'd rather go someplace less touristy and less noisy.
Not good for groups. Not good for children. Not good for romantic dining (since you won't be able to hear your date over the loud 40's music). But a cool experience.
Oh, and prices are pretty reasonable - even with all the hype. Order the chai! 
Dishes we ordered:
Mahi-Mahi Tikka 
Chicken Briyani
Vegetable Curry
Black Dhaal
Naan
Vegetable Samosas",-1
3,"Roti Chai is located on Portman Mew S and near Portman St in Marylebone, London.
We found Roti Chai highly rated in Yelp and we would like to check it out.  We came here for dinner and they're not busy at all.  The hostess asked us would like to try street kitchen or dinning room.  We hesitated the different and checked the menu pretty the same dishes.  
We prefered to have Indian Tapas and we could ordered a bit more. 
Garlic Naan - it's fresh made, soft and fluffy. 
Vegetable Samosa - it's good but not great.
Macher Jhol - fish curry just ok and not flavourful. 
Railway Lamb Curry - it's medicore and curry wasn't rich.
Overall, lacking food presentation and not authentic dish but the service was excellent.",-1
4,"Had our Chinese reunion lunch there. Service was good, really love how they elevated the dim sum, a simple Cantonese cuisine into something so good. 
We ordered
- crab salad (average)
- congee (not nice)
- venison puff (excellent)
- ribs (excellent)
- fried crispy du k (excellent)
- scallop Siew mai(excellent)
- crispy duck roll (average)
- glutinous rice (average)
Stick to what they are popular with, not what you would order typically in a Chinese dim sum restaurant",1
5,"Love this place!! Fantastic ambience, delicious drinks, and the good was spot on. This place has eclectic decor and very nice vibe. Highly recommend!",1
3,"I know... I'm in London searching for japanese food... but I can't help it when I love noodles!
found this place on yelp and decided to try it out for lunch with LG.  the place was easy to find but there's a wait during lunch.  
we studied the menu when we were waiting so once we sat down, we already knew what we wanted.
to start, we got the soft shell crab. it was delicious! crunchy! tasty! great dipping sauce! meaty! this is a must order!
I got the kimchee ramen and it was not up to par... so I'll end there. 
just get the soft shell crab and beer... can't go wrong",-1
3,The service was good.  I waited 35 minutes to find out as I was seated that they needed my table in 80 mins.  Fine I am an American diner who is pretty quick anyways.  Thought long and hard about the food tasty but a bit over rated.  I expect with all of the buzz this be the best Indian I have ever had.  Not the case.,-1
3,"I don't usually eat japanese food in chinatown, for reasons quite obviously stated in the first half of this sentence. I heard this place was pretty reasonably priced so we popped into here because I couldn't touch the dim sum places until after this stupid chinese notion of not eating prawns after surgery. And in chinatown - every dumpling you eat is like a lucky dip- you don't know what meats they have. 
I would usually head for proper ramen in either bone daddies or tenten but due to not being able to walk very far 4 days after surgery, and i NEEDED to get a haircut because damn, i need to feel pampered after having such a shit time with my medical problems, I decided to treat my cousin here. (he chaperoned me so I didn't get bashed about in london, our family is close knit like that!)
It's basic- you get some set lunches, where you would get pickles, rice, what you ordered and soup and I love thats how simple it is, it's the epitome of japanese clean eating so you don't feel so msg-fied afterwards. I enjoyed my lunch!
Reasonably priced? for the simplicity- I don't really want to pay over £20 and we weren't that full, so no, I think that I can definitely find better japanese deals elsewhere.",-1
3,"If you are looking for Sushi, almost any other Sushi place will be better. Little selection.",-1
3,"After reading reviews, I was hoping that this place will be good but I was disappointed. I ordered hakka chilli paneer for starters and idli sambhar for main course, along with mohito. Hakka chilli was good which raised my expectations. But idli sambhar just fell flat. The salt was less in sambhar, idli was not at all fluffy and seemed cakey. Mohito was terrible. Decor is wanna be Indian.",-1
5,"This was absolutely delicious. 
Started off with the soft shell crab, which dare I say it, I liked better than the Ramen! But the Ramen was super yum as well. I went with the waitress's suggestion (and the plethora of Yelp and foursquare suggestions too) and got the tonkotsu- and it really did not disappoint. The dish itself was gorgeous and so full of flavour. 
The venue is pretty tinyish- and it is one of those 'no-reservation' kind of places- so its ideal if you are after a quick meal.
They have one veggie main on the menu which I have to be honest I wasn't paying too much attention too. I think it was a salad?
Service was great! And my favorite part of the whole experience was the jar of hair ties on the table for women (or men!) to pull back their long hair- nice touch!",1
3,"Ah Dishoom... Where do I begin?!
I suppose I'd better jump on the band wagon and shout about the breakfast! This really is one of my favourite places to go for breakkie in London! Served until 11am, the selection of classic breakfast favourites with a twist really hit the spot and come at a very reasonable price! My favourite is the sausage naan with a bottomless chai, coming to less than £10, but there is also the deliciously sticky porridge and a selection of eggs spiced to perfection! 
For lunch or dinner I'm less keen on Dishoom. The distinctive flavours of the breakfast are not repeated across the main meals menu, and for the price id rather save some money and sacrifice the dining 'experience' and head to my local curry house for generous portions that really hit the spot! 
At the mention of experience, that's really what you're choosing when you decide to go to Dishoom. Decked out with spine tingly accuracy like a British Raj club house, you'll be greeted by wafts of incense and carafes of water in tin cups. Where I find Dishoom disappointing, though, is that this experience is not always continues by the staff. Service is often slow (and strangely more so the quieter it is!) and mostly served by a hipster with a 'too cool for this' attitude, which somewhat dulls the excitement of going to one of London's current favourite food venues! 
My advice for those of you thinking of going to Dishoom? 
Go for breakfast, but only if you don't have to rush to be somewhere before lunch- and you'll love it!",-1
2,"I had a horrible experience at Ping Pong. I thought the food was pretty good, the spicy pork dumplings were tasty and so was the house red wine but the SERVICE was truly disgraceful.
 We were seated outside and ignored for about 15 minutes before getting a menu or any service. It was getting cold and we wanted to move inside which they said shouldn't be a problem, only a few minutes. If they couldn't move us, just tell us exactly that but they didn't and came back 20 minutes later saying it should only be a few more minutes. After getting half way through our meal, we were moved inside.
 I think it was just one person in particular that was the culprit but that put a bad taste in my mouth about the place.
 Anyways, I'll give another location a try because the food was pretty good and I had a nice rest of the evening after everything was sorted.",-1
5,"Date of our visit 5th March 2011.
Let's keep it short. 
It's been one of the best restaurants we have ever visited.
Amazing ambience including the toilets, interesting food, impressive selection of wine, attentive&discreet service.
It definitely exceeded our expectations. 
P.S.  Check your bill before you pay... in case you were charged for some unexpected items ;-)",1
5,"this place will blow your mind in two ways.
1.)  it's hands down the most amazing dim sum i've ever had in my 29 years anywhere - asia, the americas, europe... this is the best.  
2.)  the prices are RIDICULOUSLY expensive.
does #1 outweigh #2?  yes.  absolutely.  you have to go here at least once.  i don't know how they make the food so good-  superior ingredients is my guess, because if you're talking components it tastes exactly the same as other dim sum places but if you're talking quality there is no comparison - everything from the beef to the sesame oil has its own distinctive freshness and jumps out at you.  i have never had an experience where so many ingredients tasted so distinctively delicious at various times within the same bite (no i wasn't exceptionally hungry, drunk, high, or otherwise unduly influenced).  
but to temper your enthusiasm here are the prices for several of the items we ordered (keep in mind this is dim sum and thus the sizes are accordingly tiny):
*USD / GBP was about $1.62/GBP 1
:: 4 jasmine tea smoked ribs - GBP 10.80, $17.53
:: rocket (arugula) spring salad - GBP 18, $29.16
:: 3 xiao long bao - GBP 3.50, $5.67
:: 3 pork dumplings with chives and tiny dried shrimp - GBP 5.50, $8.91
:: peking duck (not the standard peking duck - it was deep fried dark meat only and it came shredded) - GBP 28, $45.36
:: beef flat noodle - GBP 11.50, $18.63
this is a must-go if you can afford it.",1
5,"Although I used to enjoy the occasional business lunch at Alan Yau's earlier Hakkasan restaurant, I never felt like lingering there, nor did I ever feel like I had gotten true value from the lunch and service. Yauatcha filled that void completely. One of my favourite Dim Sum style London Chinese of the past couple of years. Whenever I'm back in town I love to pay a visit here. Like it's many teas, the food is to be savoured and enjoyed. 
Recommend the Prawn Shui mai with chicken, Shanghai soup dumplings, Crispy Duck roll, Chilli Squid and Jasmine Tea Smoke Ribs. 
For tea I recommend the Anxi Tie Guan Yin and the Silver Needle White. Take your time and enjoy their tea selection!",1
5,Yau Nam noodle soup... Thats all that needs to be said really. Just thinking about it has made me decide on where I am going for dinner tonight.,1
3,"Their raw food's excellent, the rest is only so-so.
Came here for lunch on a Sunday and the first things that struck me was the number of children under the age of 10. They ordered the £42 miso black cod without thinking twice and knew the menu by heart. Unreal.
The decor's quite minimal with a few japanese flower arrangements on the larger tables and while not unpleasant, having heard so much about this place I thought it'd be grander. Similarly, service could've been better. Given the number of wait staff walking around, nothing much seemed to be happening. They check all the boxes in terms of refilling your glass, taking your order, but something's still lacking--personality. It all seemed quite mechanical, like you'd expect at a chain (which I guess this is).
It took quite a while for the food to arrive but the sushi was definitely worth the wait. Very fresh, great selection. The negi toro cut roll was superb and the seaweed was crispy. The scallop sushi was sweet and smooth and they were huge! The mackerel sushi was also really good--oily with some bite. You get two thin slices on the rice instead of one thick slice, which is much more enjoyable texture-wise. We also ordered the snow crab in creamy spicy sauce, which looked a lot like a cheesy pasta bake. On its own the crab was so tasty but there was too much sauce which totally masked the flavour of the crab! :(( The rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce were even more disappointing. Although the serving was huge and you could tell the prawns were fresh, you could taste and feel the oil. The ponzu sauce made them so soggy that the batter would peel off as your chopsticks touched it. And you could hardly taste the sauce! When you could, it was delicious, but that rarely happened. I feel like it's the sort of dish that you'd order to keep ravenous teenage boys full on a 'budget'.
I probably wouldn't be coming back. The quality of their sushi's top tier but at that price, you can get equally fresh sushi elsewhere in London. No reason to come to this particular restaurant other than to say you've dined at Nobu.",-1
1,Not real Indian food. I lived in New York and other states and never had Bad Indian food. This food was nasty. London you need to learn better,-1
5,"This is an excellent place for a date, yet also a place for birthdays and just merely a day to treat oneself.    The service is excellent and the menu delicious.  The Michelin star is apparent in all that they do.  Though at the same time anyone would feel welcome in here. 
We had lamb, rabbit, duck in two forms, and many other delicious items.  Even the chips were top quality and uniquely done.  
The staff was very professional and the location theater reachable as that was in our plan.
The décor especially is very top notch.
DT",1
5,"Excellent...Extraordinary food, great service..They also make great Manhattans.",1
4,"Dishoom should be a must-go list for those that like Indian.  Though expect a wait.  We discovered it at 9pm on a Friday after touring Brick Lane, and the place was packed.  Were told it would be about an hour wait.  But, they have a very efficient system to handle the masses.  We were given a beeper to alert us when our table was ready and directed to the bar.  While queuing for the beeper they offered complimentary port and lemonade.  The bar was making up wonderful concoctions and they offered us free okra fries and prawn crackers to pass the time.  (Even if they don't offer the fries to you when you go - you should order these - spicy and good!)
Atmosphere is warm with a moder asian flair divided into several different rooms to give wherever you sit a greater sense of intimacy.  There's a downstairs dining room as well, but I'd shoot for the main floor if you can get it.  
Food: Exceptionally good. Just the right amount of spice.  Shared the ""Bowl of greens"", a chicken curry, rice and samosa.  All were fabulous - and totally a great value.
Bottom Line: Great food, great service, great value and great atmosphere.  Now, if it was just a better kept secret so the wait wasn't so long to get in.",1
5,"Party of 4, w adults and 2 children.  We were told 1:15 wait, but they seated us in 40 minutes.  Excellent service throughout our meal.  The waiter was very helpful in picking dishes.
This is by far the best Indian food I have ever had in my life.  Too bad we were on vacation and can't come back.  In fact, if I had the means, I would fly over from the states once per month just to eat at dishoom.  There is a reason the place books up for weeks ahead of time and there was an hour wait on a Monday night!!  Excellent food, 5 star all the way!  Quit reading this and head there NOW!",1
5,The best Dishoom. Take the chicken ruby and order it with basmatic rice. All the lens was delicious,1
1,"I'll start off by first ditto'ing Rick G's comment on the putrid stench.
Second, wtf?? How is this place rated so highly? Saying the best dishes we tried were even mediocre would be flattery. Blegh. The chicken tikka masala was- ok. And that was the best we had. The spinach both tasted disgusting and was completely unappetizing to look at. You have to pay for rice. The tandoori was bland and boring. 
SO very disappointed to have wasted my one night out in London at Punjab.
And again, the chemical odor, ugh. Voila, my first one-star review.",-1
3,"This place is hit and miss. One of the ramen we got (chicken base with chicken) was delicious, finger licking good, slurp-out-of-your-bowl good, pour-it-all-over-your-lap good. The other (pork base with pork ) was fatty, greasy, too porky (you know that porky pork taste that;s super porky? You know what I mean) and the greasiness of it was just too much and a tad off putting. Also, they brought starters and mains all together and it was a bit of a mess. I was SO excited for this place, and yea... it was good. Good-ish.",-1
3,"An old favorite for London old timers from seventies. Not been here for 20 yrs but still here in Chinatown. No nonsense take it or leave it service without the frills. Just came from a walking tour of Downing St, Big Ben and St James Park changing of horse guard.  We had the roast meat rice £6, wanton noodles £6, mushrooms chicken rice hot pot £8 for small and fried rice noodles with egg sauce & beef £6. About £26 for 5 of us. There's a 15 mins wait for the rice hot pot. We forewarned every one on our table that service can be variable in tone. Not bad for a cold gloomy winter's day. Free hot tea but we opted for hot water.",-1
4,"I love the style of ping pong restaurants. They are really nice to look at and well staffed. It is expensive for what you get, but can be convenient for a light dinner. Dim Sum is well made and tastes good. I would prefer more choice. Offers loyalty cards which gets you some free nibbles. This place charges 12.5% service",1
3,"We were around Regent/Piccadilly Circus after watching a musical in this area so we stopped by this place to eat Ramen. Their selection of dishes on their menu is wide, so you will find something you like. If you are not familiar with Japanese food, they also have a glossary on their menu in case you have trouble with finding out what you want and need a closer explanation. 
We ordered a Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu, their signature dish with extra meat, and also some fried gyoza. We finished our ramen and also our beer, and waited long for the gyoza. So we had to ask, and it seems they had forgotten about this order. They apologized and made the food right away when we pointed that out, so it was not the end of the world. But normally the gyoza should have come before the ramen as gyoza is considered more as an appertizer. 
So in short this a good place to eat Ramen with good service, but it is not the best Ramen place around this area as they have a lot of competition here.",-1
2,"This place was hyped up and wasn't really good. The wait wasn't bad when it was busy. The staff are nice but the food wasn't that good. Its more like a ramen bar than anything else. The broth was mediocre but the noodles made up for it a bit. Overall, I wouldn't come here again as it left me wanting to eat something better. 
Pros: Fast, Service
Cons: Food
Stars: 2.5",-1
3,"Very average food if you know what indian food should taste like. Overall ambience and concept is nice, they have good indian fusion drinks. But as an Indian living in New York and visiting London, Indian food in NY is far better and authentic. To be fair, if you are in the area, this is probably your best bet",-1
5,"Really good food and great value. Steamed pork rolls were a particular highlight!
We went on a Friday night and had to wait about 40 mins - not too bad as we were able to sit in the bar upstairs. But get there early if you don't want to wait!",1
5,"Best dim sum I've ever had in my entire life, service was excellent, food came out hot and perfect!!!",1
1,"Oh my. I thought Indian food sucked in the US, but eating here made me realize that the food back home isn't that bad. Ordered a chicken curry and a daal dish. Both seem to have similar flavors. Ordered rumali roti which was basically a regular roti just a bit skinnier and bigger but should not be called rumali. Anyways, if you want flavor and spice don't come here. If you want color and the feeling that you are eating borderline Indian food, sure ...",-1
5,"So cheap for what you get! You can get a decent meal for two for less than £30. Probably not the best place to go if you're after quality, attentive customer service but the menu is diverse and you're guaranteed to get tasty dishes that are great value for money. The noodle and rice dishes portions are huge so it's easy to over order but you can always ask for a doggy bag to takeaway!",1
1,Don't even bother going here if you are allergic to anything. They do not make any effort to accommodate any allergies.  Extremely disappointing experience. Terrible service. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,-1
3,"Many publications name Clos Maggiore one of the most romantic restaurant in London, & rightfully so; however, sharing the experience of their fascinatingly beautiful conservatory with a friend or family member can be just as lovely. 
I made a reservation about 45 days in advance, & to be expected, only had my choice of time slots after 9pm. I chose 9:30pm which had the disadvantage of being too late to order the 5-course tasting menu (£65; might've been a blessing in disguise because I couldn't fathom eating another bite after just three courses), but also the benefit of getting a table in the much-coveted conservatory, which is draped in white cherry blossoms. I imagine the chances of being seated here during prime dining hours are nearly impossible, as there are only about 6-7 tables in the area. The cozy armchairs, warmth of the fireplace, & scenery that can be described as a page out of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is an experience that we'll look back on fondly. 
While the ambiance is unbeatable, the food is nice, but not phenomenal. With each course, my satisfaction with the taste of the dish dwindled. I started with Crispy Polenta & Saint Marcellin Cheese, which has an interesting mix of toppings: grilled young broccoli, pickled pears, almonds, & salsa verde. The vegetarian main I chose was heavy & became quickly tiresome: papardelle with grated fresh truffle, mushrooms, parmesan, & truffle sauce. Dessert was a Baked Natural Greek Yogurt Cheesecake with citrus accompaniments, which lacked creaminess & instead had the consistency of a panna cotta. If I could re-do the meal, I'd choose a different main & dessert. 
The reason for my middle-of-road rating has to do with service. Our waiter was not engaging & disinterested, which made us feel ill-at-ease. Though we saw him walking around, he didn't stop to check on us. We ordered our desserts with a different wait staff member & my requests of no citrus was completely lost. Another miss was interrupting us several bites into our main to add an ingredient to our respective dishes (sauce for my dining partner's pork tenderloin, shaved truffles for my pasta.) I'm perplexed as to why this wasn't done within seconds of bringing out our plates, which seems the customary practice when a dish requires finishing touches. 
No one can deny the uniqueness or exquisiteness of the room for which Clos Maggiore is known. Their attention to customers (or rather, lack thereof) & unspectacular dishes -- well, those are subjects that are wide open for debate (& hopefully, improvement.)",-1
4,"Big, loud, gorgeous, delicious. A bit pricey, but I wasn't paying.  And they let us stay late.",1
2,"the atmosphere's beautiful and it's really romantic here, but the server we had was a bit rude and kept looking at us funny, like we were going to bounce without asking for the bill or something. i've had better dim sum easily, albeit in the united states, but if you're on holiday in london and you want good chinese food, this isn't the place to go. we ordered maybe five plates, and only the spicy squid was any good. the bao was dry and flavorless, and all of the spring rolls we tried were underwhelming.
indeed, that's the word for ping pong: underwhelming.",-1
4,"The wait is long, always, even on sundays. The cocktails are fun but really small in portions. Vibe is good. 
Tried the chicken tikka, prawns and the signature kaali daal with garlic naan. Portions are small so you have to order 2-3 dishes per person. The tikka was great, but the memorable dish was the daal. I think it  was a tomato bisque with black daal. Pure awesome.",1
4,"My friend and I stopped in on a whim, and we certainly didn't regret it. We ordered à la carte, and personally that's what I'd recommend. It's dim sum after all. The quarter crispy aromatic duck was a touch dry, but definitely worth the £17 for two people. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the chili-fried squid was great. The quality of food was pretty good.
Another thing I liked was that, while this is a Michelin-starred restaurant, I didn't feel out of place wearing jeans and a fairly casual shirt. I don't like dress codes. I come from a city where frankly, restauranteurs are lucky to get people to arrive wearing trousers at all.
Service was a bit slow, and our final bill came out to just over £115 for the two of us--£100 without the beer--so you should expect your wallet to feel a bit lighter after eating, but it's definitely worth it if you want to treat yourself. I don't think I was hungry until the next morning.",1
4,"Love it. Simply, the most authentic Chinese food in Chinatown. A lot is written about the service in Wong Kei's, and its true it is amusing sometimes, but its not super rude. Its just fast and a bit brash. Have the chilli salted tofu, and some gailan (chinese brocolli). And the hot n sour soup",1
4,"Pork-bone broth is very rich, enjoyed it quite a bit.  Not perfect and I'd rank it one below Tonkatsu in terms of the overall ramen experience, but worth a go.  The croquettes were surprisingly well worth it, great flavour though a bit small.  Place gets pretty crowded so don't go expecting a nice quiet bowl of ramen.",1
5,"Oh, Dishoom in Shoreditch. I rarely give 5-stars but this deserves it.
Being a fan of Indian food and living in London has been quite the success for me food-wise. What else do you need other than the regular chicken tikka massala with pilau rice and some hot naan? 
London is crammed with Indian restaurants of all kind so when I first went to Dishoom, I didn't expect much.
First of all, this branch of the Bombay restaurant is in Shoreditch, a really cool neighborhood with markets, small cafés, boutiques and street art. The interior is inviting, it has a vintage and ethnic vibe fused with modern chic, and the verandah is to die for.
Even though they take reservations, they reserve half their tables for walk-ins, and although you might have to wait on a packed Saturday night, you are guaranteed a spot, which is rare in London have you not booked in advance.
The staff was very helpful, giving recommendations on portions and flavours, what goes with what, etc. 
We were three and ended up getting exactly as much as we could eat, which was marvelous. The potatoes were outstanding, as were the curries. The chicken tikka was not as good as expected, but was still fine.
What I liked most is that although this place serves authentic Indian food, it fuses its tastes with other Asian cuisines and creates perfection. The prices are pretty good as well. Overall, bringing each and every one of my friends to Dishoom:)",1
4,"I've never been to the restarant downstairs for dim sum (but i hear great things) but i have sat upstairs for an afternoon sipping chinese tea and eating cakes. My friend took a few of us there for her birthday one year as it was a lovely way to spend the afternoon. It was very sophisticated and a different way to enjoy your birthday. I didn't love all the cakes, but we got to have a good selection so im sure there's something for everyone.",1
5,"Thanks to Josy A.'s recommendation, I finally had a chance to have some decent Tonkotsu ramen in London!  The thin noodles were firm and chewy.  The soup was not too greasy.  The half-boiled egg was amazing with some smoky soy sauce.  I also liked the extra topping grilled corn (not from a can!).
My boyfriend tried the soy ramen with chicken broth.  The soup was much simpler and lighter taste here.  He said it got a lot better after he added some crushed fresh garlic.
Oh, the tip was already included in the bill.",1
2,"This place's high rating makes me think only tourists with terrified palates use Yelp in London. Dishoom looks trendy, but the food is flavorless. The waiter recommended the prawn Koliwada starter. It was heavy and flavorless. Lamb Awadhi biryani had literally no flavor. The kachumber was an insult to the name; instead of finely chopped cukes, tomatos, and onions with some spice and lemon, it was literally a bowl of giant pieces of unseasoned raw red onion with a few bits of tomato and cucumber thrown in. Inedible and gross. The signature prawn moilee curry was just OK, but given that it tasted a bit like something, it was the standout of the meal. All this, and the prices are quite high. Twenty pounds a head for lunch will buy you lovely Indian food at about a thousand places in London.",-1
5,"I finally got my ramen fix after craving it for a while ever since I started watching a Japanese Netflix TV show called ""Good Morning Call' (totally hooked on this show). I liked the sound of this place as it was casual dining and has received great reviews. 
At 4pm, it was not very busy so my husband and I decided to take the seats near the window gazing out on to the street. I was glad we had the room around our seats as it created a little privacy . The only downside to this was having to turn around to talk to the server, but that was no big deal. 
I liked so many things; the little jar of elastic hair bands, bibs, fresh ginger with press, the music and most of all, that there's no shame in slurping.
We had the fried chicken, which was served piping hot. It came with a lemon wedge, but we preferred a dipping sauce and found the soy sauce, which was good. I then had the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra egg, corn and chicken cock scratchings. Now I was unsure about the latter, but the waitress explained it's a nice crunchy garnish, which it certainly was. After my meal, I was nicely full and glad it wasn't raining as I totally needed to walk off the ramen.  I can't wait to go back to try the other dishes.",1
4,"Went for dinner on a Saturday around 10 and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Very cool interior.  We ordered calamari, okra fries, daal, lamb chops, and naan. Everything was delicious, but I prefer my naan a bit softer and doughy-we, whereas this naan was thinner and crispier. I also had the chai, which was the best of my life. Pricey but definitely recommend and want to go back to try the many flavored laasis!",1
5,"Hakkasan still has not been ousted as my top restaurant in London. I recently went to its sister restaurant in Miami (yes very random) and it wasn't quite as delectable as the London version.
 I'll admit to being ridiculously biased but I still have not found anything that quite compares to their peppery veggie chicken, morning glory, medley of exotic cocktails and did I mention hot (male) bartenders? Obviously that doesn't impact the taste of the cocktails..
 It better be on your list for top London restaurants to visit. Avid movie goers will remember that Hugh Grant took his 'crush' there on a first date in 'About a Boy'. So if its good enough for Hugh...",1
2,"London needs to sort it's self out. Falling arse over tit about dishoom. 
The food is pretty good, admittedly, I can't fault it, there are better Indians in London (lots) and cheaper, but you're not here for the food, you're here for the decor (be honest with yourself on this one if you're currently disagreeing) which is brilliant, really well thought out, and the place has a great ambiance, if you were to walk in, get a table and eat, it would be 4 stars straight away. Even a half hour wait at the bar would be fine. But who the fuck are you kidding when you're expected the queue outside to get in to the bar to wait 2 HOURS for a table. Are they having a fucking laugh? 
There are seemingly a lot of idiots willing to do this. 
There are far too many good restaurants in London to justify that wait ever. Let alone at 5pm on a Sunday. 
On top of this the bar is pretty poor, the cocktails are all done on theme, and most favour throwing in overpowering flavours for the sake of sounding exotic. Classics are neglected, the negroni was pretty lacklustre and pointlessly on some different teir of cocktails that you pour yourself (thanks, my own bottle!) if you're going to make people wait in your bar for 2 hours, make it a decent bar.",-1
5,"I was so harsh before it pains me to reflect on my past-self.  Bone Daddies is pretty good, it was probably my fault for ordering something that came with fried chicken skin in it.  I've been back loads and just order without the excess crap and its great.
MY 5 star rating is so balance my 2/3 stars before.  
Plus the staff are all great, though sitting on high chairs like sardines is demoralizing.",1
3,"""We do not take tips"" 
The above words are what you see first. The food is ok. I had the Mini Una Don ( Grilled Eel served with rice and sauce ) and it was tender and tastes good. 
Don't know why they said ""NO"" to Tuna but serving eel as both are getting on well are on the endangered list!!! They serve hot tea; which I liked as its aids in digestion. 
The first restaurant I visited in China town. I would recommend food lovers to try it.",-1
3,"We were extremely impressed with the Tonketsu ramen.We added some Japanese chili powder to our noodle.Wow.we thought the Ramen scene in London has come of age.
Then the MSG induced dry mouth came.OH OH.
Tonketsu with MSG!!!!!!",-1
1,"Hell's Kitchen or simply Hell?  Gordon Ramsay's head would have exploded. My friend and I decided to use our hotel $$ savings from the Hoxton's £1 Sale to splash out at London's first Michelin starred Chinese restaurant. Huge mistake and we knew it the minute we walked in to face a row of sullen Robert Palmer 'Addicted To Love' zomboids. 
The people of Hakkasan appear to be the most irritated species on the planet. Not only do they begrudgingly take coats and hold open loo doors, they also forcefully remind you (for the tenth time since making the reservation two months ago) that you absolutely must be finished with your table after 90 minutes, no exceptions. (And a hearty hello to you, too, oh irritated ones!) But it doesn't stop there. If you can open the menus without assaulting your closely situated neighbors, you are then tasked with divining the ingredients in the title sans descriptions dishes. We saw three duck dishes and made the mistake of asking our ill-humored waiter how each was prepared. Instead of waxing rhapsodic on the virtues of each, he snapped, ""They're all duck, that's all you need to know."" Hmmmph! It went further south from there, but at least it was consistent -- consistently awful to the point of hilarity. 
Spare yourself the scorn and scolding, unless of course, you're into that kind of thing.",-1
2,Really not that great. I was pretty disappointed in the overall experience. Ramen broth was ok but the meat wasn't seasoned well. Over crowded an bathroom smell was noticeable. This is tourist ramen.,-1
5,Clos Maggiore epitomises the best of French cuisine.The dishes served in the restaurant are based on the Provencal style of cooking and although the menu is pricey and probably you would not eat there every night it nice to go there for a special occassion. The bonus of eating here is that they have a multi-award winning wine list accompanying the menu.,1
3,"A contemporary take on Indian food. I felt like this place was over-hyped. The atmosphere is cool, but the food is average. You can definitely find better desi food elsewhere. 
The wait was a little long (for a Sunday evening) and they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 6. However, while you wait you can have some chai (it has more spices than usual), water, or lemon water. Which was a nice thing while you wait. 
We waited about an hour for a Sunday evening around 9:30. 
The menu had a lot of options, some traditional and some they have made their own versions of. From everything we ordered - the seekh kabobs were the best.",-1
5,"One of my favourites to visit when in London and in need of good Indian flavours. 
The menu is more street food than curries but everything has such great spices that you can't complain. 
Like others have said, I would eat there every day if I could!
To avoid the queues I suggest getting there right on 5:30 and choose a weeknight it's only slightly less busy.",1
3,"This is a very busy Indian restaurant that has efficiently streamlined their waiting-customer process. When I arrived on a weekend around 7PM (peak hour), there was a wait that they said would take 45 minutes. I decided to wait (table for 2) and they gave me one of those buzzers. I waited for 10 minutes and one of the hosts said there was room for me at the bar downstairs. I happily went down to the bar and sat down for another 10 minutes until the buzzer rang. Since I'm from the US and didn't have any cellular phone service, I was happy to use their free wifi (no password needed). If you're coming here in a group, do your best to make a reservation.
Our server was attentive and the food was good. I'd say that this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to (not just in the UK) based on food quality and atmosphere. You feel like you should be dressed up (at least business casual) at this joint.
I don't remember everything we ordered, but it included the house black daal (must-order), a chicken dish, garlic naan, roti, and mango lassi. Everything was pretty delicious and I don't think you can go wrong with whatever appeals to you on the menu. The only drawback about this place is the price. I guess they're popular enough to demand the amount they charge, but dang it costs like $6 USD for one piece of naan. If the naan wasn't so expensive I would for sure give this place 4 stars. Each person who wants naan/roti should get their own order because 1 order will not be enough for more than 1 person.
So, I'm happy I tried some Indian food in London (since there's a large population) and this would be the place I recommend for fancy, quality Bombay food.",-1
2,"This is a fancy food factory. The dining room is quite nice, but there are two main problems with this place:
1) The service: everything goes too fast. It is very clear that they have been instructed to get as many seatings in as possible. You barely get to sit down before someone is there to take your order, the main course comes directly after the first course, and they start clearing the table before you have finished. That being said, the staff are all very nice.
2) The food: I got a steak which wasn't bad, but not something very good either. The chips which came as a side was like McDonald's chips with less salt. An with that came a bernaise sauce which isn't really worth mentioning.
I have had far worse dining experiences, but it doesn't change the fact that this is tourist trap although of the better kind.",-1
3,"A beautiful large, French bistro in Covent Garden with tablecloths and waiters in uniform. Service is attentive but the waiters are particular about their respective areas so you can't call on a different waiter even if yours is busy.
We went here for lunch: grilled salmon on warm spinach, walnut and lentil salad; club sandwich with frites; basket of warm fresh bread. All delicious and fairly large portions. Very quick to bring to the table. Maybe we didn't order the right things but they weren't particularly special. The chips were very bright yellow which made me the think the oil may not have been the best. I enjoyed the club sandwich despite it falling apart in my hands because of the soft French sourdough loaf bread used. Two lunch mains for £38 is a bit steep but good if you're in the area and looking for somewhere fairly refined to eat.",-1
3,"This shop was super busy and I Waited for 1hour to get my food on table. Service was good while food has no any surprise. Among all the Indian restaurants I have ever tried, this one is just at average level.
I won't say it's worth your spending life to wait for half or one hour. 
However, to be fair, this is one of the best food I had in this London trip so far....considering London is a good food desert, this restaurant to get high score is quite reasonable.",-1
4,"This is now the second decent ish ramen place I've tried in London (after Shoryu) and I was extremely satisfied.
Food:
We ordered fried chicken and pork ribs to start (though it was called pork bones or something different). The chicken was executed well and extremely tasty. The ribs were one up though. Tender, and in an awesome sauce.
Had the Tonkotsu ramen for my main. 
Broth:
Thick and aromatic, I had high hopes. It semi delivered but just a tiny bit less flavourful than I expected. But initially at least, pretty damn good nonetheless, particularly after adding a bit of garlic.
The big caveat with the broth here is that there's quite a short optimum time to eat it in. Because of the thickness, as it cools down, it gets almost sedimentary and you can feel individual bits of it as it goes down your throat. At that point it gets notably less nice.
Noodles:
I like the texture of the noodles. Bit chewy but highly enjoyable. Their per bowl ratios are pretty off imo. Either they need more broth or less noodles in the bowl. It's really not an ideal ratio the way it's currently served.
Drinks:
I'm still pleasantly surprised when a place has mostly craft beers even though (fortunately) it is such a fast growing scene in this city. Had the kernel pale ale and really enjoyed it. Been meaning to head down to the Kernel brewpub (only open on Saturday for a few hours) and this has only increased said desire.
Overall:
When it comes to ramen chains no matter how many places I try I seem to have hardcore ippudo loyalty. This is the closest I've had to that in London, so I know I'll be back (and soon).",1
5,"Great food, drinks and atmosphere! Try the lamb bun, you won't be disappointed. All the dishes we had were delicious.",1
3,You've been to one nobu and you have been to them all. It's a bit overpriced and over rates at this point.,-1
3,Good ramen but I prefer Ippudo. The eggs were too cold for my taste and I was quite disappointed by the noodles. The soup was pretty good though.,-1
5,"My brother took me here as a birthday treat and I highly recommend this place. The ambiance is amazing. It's busy & buzzing but not loud and rushed. Everyone that paid their bills looked satisfied, including us.
The services was excellent, however one of the waitress did get our tea mixed up. We have informed the other waiter as we were leaving about the mix up and he apologised on behalf of her.
The smoked steak was out of this world. I highly recommend this main course if you ever visit this restaurant. It simply melts in your mouth and took you to a different universe and back! 
I highly recommend this place if you want to treat yourself or for a special occassion.",1
3,"We tried the chicken lollipops, bhel puri, chana, and pulusu chicken upstairs. The food was decent; nothing special. Great service.",-1
1,Horrible wait and low table turn despite the supposed fast appeal. Indecipherable menu. Slow labor all around.,-1
4,"The dim sum is good and the service is usually fine. Lazy Sumdays (all you cut eat) is great, although I very rarely actually meet the charge (they charge you separately if so).",1
3,"Hip and happening this Chinese restaurant is delicious. Sort of... People with shellfish allergies beware, as most dishes served here are with oyster sauce, even dishes that look vegetarian, and what first looks like an extensive and exciting menu limits those people with shellfish allergies down to a a measly few dishes to choose from. And when I say measly, I mean you can count the selection on one hand. This is important to note as one in our party was allergic and this meant that person had little to eat. 
Everybody else feasted. And the cuisine while distinctively Chinese had a modern approach which made for a truly tasty experience. Pork belly with truffles... foie gras, duck, and delightful pumpkin dim sum shaped into little pumpkins were divine. 
We came for desserts, however we were disappointed as by the time we were finished with our meal, the tempting dessert selections we had seen upon entering the restaurant were nearly all sold out and we were left with little to choose from. So, that was sort of the theme of the night here at Yauatcha: So much to tempt, so little actually available. 
The decor was trying too hard with its fish aquariums and Asian inspired seating. The seats themselves were very close to the ground and people were too close and on top of each other. My chair was next to one of the pillars and I had to sit a bit sideways and nearly on top of the table, so it was a bit uncomfortable. And yes, a bit noisy. Waitstaff too could have been a bit more attentive and not so rushed. 
Its a shame really as it is a fun place, great for small groups of friends. I think it definitely merits a try, as what was good, was tasty, but perhaps avoid Saturday night and the weekends.",-1
3,"I had to see it to believe it, but what a great experience
 Yes the staff are notoriously rude and you usually end up on a table with complete strangers/confused tourists. But how on earth can you argue with the 3 course set dinner for £12 a head (and I'm talking crispy duck included). You can't you just can't.
 Did I mention the house wine is £8 a bottle, and they have no problem with doggie bags..",-1
2,"For an early dinner, this place is OK in parts and terrible in others.
They're famous for their duck, so we had that with rice and crispy pork. Another of the same, plus chicken. Then 3 starters, meat spring rolls, salt and pepper ribs and dumplings.
The rice was a decent portion but the sauce that was wrongly sweet. The duck was OK, the pork was delicious and the chicken came with no skin, no bone and the spring onion came ontop of the duck! Why?? Plus the overall meat portion was small. 
The starters were appalling and clearly aimed at an unassuming audience who wouldn't know better. The ribs were bone dry and bland, the dumpling skin was thick and fried, but not in the way you'd want. The spring rolls were supposed to be 2 large pork ones but ended up being 4 small ones with non-existant chicken. 
Overall, I'd cone back for their expensive rice dishes if I had no other choice, but the starters were awful. Our waiter was ok but I heard one say ""everyone's tastes are different"" when being asked about portion sizes and what they would recommend.",-1
4,"This place had been on my radar for a while and randomly walking by the Shoreditch location on a Saturday evening around 5:30, I'm still shocked but quite happy that my husband and I decided on an early dinner. Note - we got there suuuuuper early for dinner but there was no wait and we got right in.
The food was fantastic and the service excellent. The big hits were the lamb bun, vegetable biryani, and garlic naan. Also the house chai and the Malai Kulfi are excellent. 
I really like the décor of the place, and this location is quite spacious which is nice.
We left around 6:45 and there was already a line about 20 people deep. So glad we got there early!",1
5,"Best roast duck in the world? That's what Financial Times writer Nicholas Lander reckons and it was his write up about Four Seasons that led me there. I'm not too sure it's the best in the world but it's the best I've had in London and on par with the roast duck I had at the considerably more upscale Peninsula Hotel in Beijing.
 One piece of advice based on my experience at Four Seasons: forego the rest of the menu and just order the duck. Everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good but nowhere near as good as the duck. Besides there are plenty of other decent Chinese restaurant around Chinatown.",1
3,"We were in Piccadilly Circus, and decided to swing by Chinatown for our first dinner of the night (yes... vacation means food marathon). Four Seasons was recommended to us by a friend for good crispy duck. There was also a message posted on the window that said ""best roast duck in the world"", so we came with rather high expectations. Arrived around 7pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was very busy. There was not enough space to wait inside so we had to wait outside the door.
After a 15 minute wait, we were seated downstairs, which was a bit cramped and dingy. We ordered the half Roasted Duck and Oyster Pancake. The Roast Duck was good - the meat was tender and juicy, but the oyster pancake was pretty tasteless. Prices were standard Chinatown.
Service was brisk and adrupt - normal for Chinese Restaurants so I had no complaints. However, we did ask for oyster sauce for our oyster pancake, but the waitress gave us Chili Oil. Maybe oyster sauce is more of a US thing and they don't have it in London?",-1
5,"Lots of stars because I remember the food being good. I haven't been for a loooooong time but the fact that it's still going strong says something for it.
 The main draws used to be the cheap but good Chinese food and the utter contempt that the waiters showed every single customer. The last time I was there I caught one of them basically telling a customer to piss off in Cantonese (something I picked up from martial arts movies). It was hilarious!
 Anyway, the reason I write is because my brother went in the other day and actually got service with a smile. And he said the food was still good.
 Update: I put an extra star on 'cos I notice a lot of other people besides my brother say the waiters are more friendly now. It's perfect!",1
5,"It is the first time we have eaten here and we were impressed
We booked a table for three people ( the third person was on there way) and was told it would be 45 minutes so we had a coffee at the bar. Our table was ready earlier than we had been told and the third person had still not arrived but this was not a problem , unfortunately the third person was stuck in traffic so we ordered. We had chicken berry Britannia,ruby Murray and chole bhatura it was delicious,hot ,flavourful. The staff were excellent very helpful and answered every question we asked about items on the menu. The dishes are small but it was enough for us and slightly overpriced but this is trendy Shoreditch but that said the overall experience was excellent",1
4,"Ate here last night with a colleague. We arrived 30 minutes late, mistakenly thinking we were on time for our reservation (honest mistake!) and they were very accommodating. We ordered five dishes: the char siu bao, lo bak go (or turnip cake), duck/pumpkin puff, crab salad, and prawn and beancurd cheung fun. The char siu bao were amazing, best I've ever had. The duck/pumpkin puff may have been the standout of the night, and those two along with the cheung fun rounded out the top three. The lo bak go was made a bit differently than I'm accustomed to - it had a layer of spring onion and I guess egg over the part you expect. Not bad, but I'll stick with what I'm used to on that one. The swimmer crab salad was nice with mushrooms but probably not worth £11. Desserts all looked great, my friend picked the chocolate pebble and I confess I was slightly underwhelmed. I chose a couple of macarons that were outstanding - esp the mango/passionfruit. Service was great, price was bearable but certainly a rare treat.",1
3,"Take a nice bite of the
cheese with a swig of the wine and trust me, it's divine. For the main we had
both the pear salad and the crab appetizer. Their salad was great, the blue
cheese and poached pair were the perfect combination. Overall, I like it! We
like it!",-1
4,"We ordered the chicken tikka, chole poori, roti and kachumber and chaat salad. Our favorites were the chole poori and chicken tikka. The three sauces that came with the chole poori were delicious! The chicken tikka had a nice spicy flavor. Definitely will go back to try other dishes.",1
2,"This place is the worst.  The crowd is old and wannabe.  Not contemporary or for the young, successful,  and attractive at ALL. The people there did not look good.
   This place claims to be elite but probably was 2 years ago.  We had dinner there and the food was tasteless and very average.  On top of that, they said we could get to the main bar area, and after having us spend so much money on crappy food, they did not let us in to the main bar, claiming they were at ""full capacity"".  Then when trying to leave, they tried to be ""gracious"" by hailing us a taxi out of a strange back ally.  The taxi, we realized while already on the road, was cash only, and took us on a completely round about route, which cost twice as much as any taxi we had taken for the same distance.  When we confronted the taxi driver, threatening to report him,  he gave us a discount.  
    All and all, we had a terrible and expensive experience being ripped off at the Chiltern Firehouse.  Don't believe the hype. Just don't go here.",-1
4,"Swanky spot in the heart of SoHo with attentive, friendly and accomodating staff. I was with my lovely gal pal and we ordered a ton of dim sum, some were better than others but I have to say that I think we ordered the wrong stuff. Everyone around us seemingly had wonderful smelling and looking main dishes that I will have to go back for. So i'm going to round up to 4 stars because of the potential that I think is there. 
-We tried the Wagyu beef puff which was steaming hot so be careful and super tasty. 
-Also the crispy duck roll which was nice, dipped in a brown sauce.... nothing crazy
-a Venison puff or something of the like, it wasn't my cup of tea... too bready
- Roasted duck pumpkin puff - meh
and to finish we had the Raspberry Delice totally based on looks from another table.",1
1,"There once was a place called Nobu.
It was so new it no one knew.
That one day to the next
It would change from the best
To a place filled with rules
So sad that the fun
Left forever
That is the modern Nobu. 
A shadow of its former self.
With twice the assholery.",-1
5,"Wicked Raman!! Kimchi Raman for the win! Cool location and fit out, great service. A little bit expensive at around £11 but not too bad for the quality.",1
2,I wouldn't come back.. All the Asians are on the first floor and tourist are on the second. Honestly they are racist and the food is just alright,-1
5,"Great food, great space. The wait CAN be a bit extreme around peak times, so I would avoid if possible around dinner times, especially on the weekend. Tip: If you don't mind an early-ish dinner, reserve for ""lunch"" at 5:45, and you'll be eating by 6:30 p. This is what my sister and I did, and we were able to avoid the wait time completely.",1
5,"Back to our favorite Dishoom location for an early dinner in the outside area, beautiful, quiet and peaceful. Everything was delicious and we had too much food so we carried out leftovers. It's crowded here -- you'll encounter many obstacles on your way from the garden to the downstairs bathrooms -- which is a testament to the enduring popularity of this location near so many alternatives.",1
5,"Thus place is fantastic! We came here for lunch on our last day before heading out to Heathrow...we had our luggage in tow; it was a bit of a haul and we were put on the waiting list (didn't make a reservation) about 45 minutes. My family wanted to ditch and go across the street but I held to my guns and we stuck it out. It only took about 20 minutes because I optioned to sit out in the patio. We ordered the calamari, chicken curry, lamb chops, lamb kebobs, and the grilled shrimp, rice, naan, and the dishoom sauce. We ate everything. There was nothing left. It was a great taste to end our trip in London. Oh yes. And my family thanked me for being stubborn and making them wait it out",1
3,"OK, but I really didn't understand the 5 star reviews for this place. Oddly decorated, slow service and very English French food... Meh",-1
4,"Bone Daddies is the only good place I hear about when it comes to ramen. So I finally made it on a Sunday for lunch, and I was quite happy to find there was no line. It's a casual interior with high tables and chairs. We were a group of 4 so the corner tables work best, otherwise sitting in a row would have been too difficult to chat. 
They had plastic Japanese smocks which I absolutely loved; I instantly put it on and kept it afterwards. 
For appetisers the croquettes are must-have (I liked them better than the fried chicken). Never had anything so good outside of Italy! For ramen I went for the tonkotsu ramen. I appreciated that the serving was so big but I thought the ramen noodle itself was too thin, and the soup was a bit too thick, but it did taste good especially with the egg. Each table has a container of garlic, a garlic crusher, and a sesame vial, which all I definitely took advantage of. 
Overall I really enjoyed Bone Daddies: good setting, good food and good service!",1
3,"Simple, good, satisfying ramen. The broth is amazing. There might be a small queue, but you are seated, served and provided with a big bowel of ramen quickly.",-1
5,"In love with this place - the food is delicious (even the veggie dumplings), the drinks are inventive, and the atmosphere is lovely. Would eat here all the time if I could afford it.
Wasn't the biggest fan of the desserts, although I didn't try the macaroons.",1
2,"I was pretty disappointed with this place. I rarely get back to the UK these days having moved overseas and one of the things I really miss is good Indian food. Everytime I come back I look forward to having a good tikka masala, but I was sorely let down by Punjab. It looked the real deal, cramped tables, classic menu, everything seemed ok on the surface. The food though was meh. The naan was overcooked and crispy, the chicken was likewise overdone and dry, even the masala sauce was lacking in tomatoes or spice. There is far better to be had in London.",-1
3,"Stopped by on a cold London afternoon to some comfort food. The wait staff was very welcoming, walking me through the menu and different options. I ordered their Tonkotsu ramen, gyoza and pork bun. I thought all of the food was very average, but not bad. The tonkotsu broth lacked something, but it was not flavorful enough while the noodles were a bit soft for my taste. Not a bad bowl of ramen but not one that is memorable. The gyoza was presented on a sizzling skillet, very cool. However, the flavor of the gyoza stuffing was also lacking something, perhaps sesame oil? The pork bun used a miso paste of some sort and was my least favorite thing I ordered that day. Okay for a quick bowl if you're craving one but probably not one I would recommend people to go out of their way to get. They do have free wifi.",-1
1,"We were lured into this restaurant due to the number of people queuing up but we can only advise people to queue up at other restaurants. 
Terrible service. The waiters all look like grumpy teenagers who snatch the food in front of you without asking if you are finished eating!
We were two and I had finished my dish before my girlfriend but instead of waiting for my girlfriend to finish her food, they just took the food from her without asking. 
Oh, and stay away from their char siew. Only choose barbecued duck as topping, but honestly the food looked like something you could expect from a fast food joint. 
Cannot recommend! Avoid this place!
We are never coming back!",-1
4,One of the best ramen I've ever had: get their mushroom and soy veggie one! And be prepared to queue: it's no-reservation. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.,1
5,"Expensive but definitely the real deal with great portion sizes! 
The service is spot on, continually topped up and eager to keep our table tidy and presentable.
Definitely going back for the great atmosphere and selection of food.",1
3,"Having heard of the reputation of Indian food in London I had great expectations but was a bit disappointed.  This restaurant is in the Marble Arch neighborhood.  There's two different floors and the first floor seems to be more casual while the bottom floor is more formal, for walk in the wait was only around 10 minutes. I got the lamb curry dish and the lamb was very dry and the sauce not very flavorful.  The chapati that came with it was very dry as well and I should have opted for rice instead.  I tried the chicken curry dish which was much better.",-1
1,"Overpriced. Below average food. The taste is blended.
Not very attentive service, server seemed annoyed after couple questions about the menu from us.
Seems a lot of people come here for pre show dinner only, most of them finished meal really fast.
One positive star is their interior design is quite nice.",-1
3,"Ambiance is nice, definitely a good spot for late night bite (but not too late they close at 10 p.m.). The place gives off very hipster vibes.
I actually really enjoyed their Salmon Tartar with the Lime Wasabi Ponzu and it came with Renkon Chips! The salmon was definitely fresh and the ponzu was amazing with the salmon, it's bright, citrusy, and a nice kick of wasabi! Actually one of the best things I've had! I really liked what they did with the sauce for the salmon. 
I had the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was okay. It definitely is one of the better ramen places that I've visited in London, but the ramen itself was still a little lackluster in general. The broth was fine, it's actually a little less salty than other places which I liked. The broth is also very creamy. The ramen egg was really nice, but the menma (bamboo shoots) were quite awful...lots of unchewable strands of bamboo shoots! There were hard and hay like strands in my bamboo shoots and toppings. The noodles were quite bad though, it was mushy for me. Perhaps it was just that night or my ramen had been sitting out for a while, because ramen noodles should never be mushy! Mine had no bounce whatsoever (it was also quite thin), very limp, and it was just overall unpleasant to eat in general. Not quite consistent with what I've heard about their ramen, but that was what I had. LIMP NOODLE!!!
I had the Gini Hendrix cocktail as well and I highly recommend the drink! It's like a Gin and Tonic but much more refreshing and bright! Love the addition of cucumbers and yuzu liquor instead of tonic, so refreshing and much more complex. Oolong syrup didn't really add a tea taste to it, but it was a very sweet drink. Probably my favourite cocktail ever!
It's a great place to meet up with others and have a decent meal, but it is actually quite dark inside. Prices are also pretty steep for food.",-1
3,"The food was good but the waiter had a bad attitude. We went as a group of four and when taking the order the waiter came across as quite aggressive as my friend was taking a while to choose an order from the menu (vegan). The food was good and the atmosphere here is ""cosy"", you will be more or less joined to the people on the table next to yours. We enjoyed the trip but dropped the service charge. Also notable was that I had to return a spoon as it was presented dirty.",-1
5,"Delicious food + good service = good experience 
I believe it is Chinese fusion, but the food was surprisingly good. It's very expensive, but good for some occasions.",1
5,Food was a work of art in look and taste. The conservatory was lovely. I would not have enjoyed a table in the main walkway as it would have spoiled the effect. Everything we had was exceptional! Best food I have eaten in 5 visits to London -hands down!,1
3,"Pretty good for what you can find in London. The tonkotsu broth that they're known for is way too thick and more like a gravy. I'd opt for the other broths.  The line here does get quite long, so be sure to buffer some extra time. 
Protip: add the extra egg. It's totally worth it.",-1
5,"Came here on a trip. I asked around for recommendations for a good food spots in London. Everyone mentioned Dishoom and now I see why. It was a cool spot we went at a good time and didn't have to wait in line but 30 minutes after we got there it became really crowded. We Got about eight dishes and split it amongst five people. My favorite was the non-and side dips. 
The service was excellent. Everyone is very nice and accommodating with substitutions. One of my new favorite Indian spots!",1
3,"Will this Ramen blow your mind... not quite. 
Shoryu, either this one, or the one on the other side of Picadilly Circus, is nice for a quick stop. It's always busy -  in my option this may have more to do with the lack of alternative choices in the area vs. the quality of the food.. 
I've not found better contenders in London, but compared to other cities, the ramen leaves something to be desired. 
Avoid the green tea mochi! 4.50 for one small piece that we didn't finish because it tasted bad :/",-1
5,"This was an amazing experience. From walking down the two flights of stairs to sitting down in the dimly lit but chicly decorated restaurant, it was a very complete experience. 
I ordered the vegetarian dim sum, which was probably some of the best, most flavorful dim sum I've ever had. There were 4 different types of dim sum in the bamboo container, and 2 of each type. For 11 pounds, this was a great value! It came out steaming hot, with a great texture. I think it had fake meat, vegetables and sauces, and the dim sum came with both soy sauce and spicy chile sauce. I definitely recommend this dish! If you're not too hungry, you can definitely order it as the main dish and split a side of rice.
There were 4 of us, and we shared a bowl of fried rice. This was only 5 pounds, and each person got a full bowl. I also tried my friend's vegetarian spicy black bean chicken and beans. This was delicious as well, and super flavorful. 
We finished with 1 dessert split between the 4 of us. We ordered the Javindra Dessert (or something like that), which is an ice cream chocolate mousse ball coated with a crispy layer and covered in dark chocolate, which they pour after setting it down on the table. It also has pop rocks on the side!
All in all, definitely coming back here!",1
1,"The worst restaurant I have ever been to in my life, I would give a 0 stars if I could. Service was appallingly rude and barely even acknowledged us, and the food wasn't much better. A few of the waiters even went out of their way to make our experience miserable once we complained. PLEASE DON'T BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE.",-1
2,"Came here for dim sum.  What we got was really tasty....really good flavours and were well presented. This is definitely western dim sum - but done well.  Based on the food alone, not considering the price, I'd give it 5 stars.
However, portion sizes are very small. You don't get many pieces per order.  Most traditional Chinese restaurants you'd get 4 pieces.  At Yauatcha, for the same dim sum order, you only get 3 pieces. Not cool.
They also really skimp on the tea. You order tea at a Chinese restaurant they give you a pot of tea with tea leaves in the bottom...then you ask for additional water to brew more tea.  Their tea pots don't include any tea leaves so you don't get tea leaves in your drink, however, no refills!  Lame.
We dined downstairs and I thought it was quite dark. They've got a huge selection of desserts upstairs which looked tasty but didn't indulge this time.  I probably wouldn't come here again given the price and what you get.",-1
3,"I went to Balthazar years ago in New York and really like it, and I was happy to find in in London right at the heart of Covent Garden. You get that French Bistro feel as soon as you walk into the restaurant. They have a lovely display of fresh seafood: lobsters, crabs, shrimps and, of course, oysters. 
The menu here is big and quite French, so if you are in the mood for steak tartare, escargots, duck and steak and frites, you have come to the right place. Since the restaurant is in London, you can also have some British flair, like a duck shepherd's pie. We must not forget the daily specials. The evening we went was a Sunday, so I went for the ox cheek bourguignon, because the server highly recommended it to me. It was adequate but not great. The sauce was way too heavy and instead of the flavor Burgundy wine, I just tasted salt. However, the meat was well cooked. I think next time I will not ask for the waiter's recommendation and just stick with steak and frites.",-1
3,"We came here as the reviews were good ... It did mention the wait but it fail to say it was not worth it . 
First, get ready for an unnecessary hour wait outside, the food is as good as any other Indian restaurant you will find in London, the wait do not warrant the quality of the food, we try quite a nice array 
The fried squid - it's oily no crispy 
The lamb Samoa - dry and tasteless 
The spicy lamb chops - dry, over cook
The garlic nam - was good 
The rice - basic steam rice 
The ruby Ryan - the star of the chef - ummm is ok nothing to brag about - chicken was little tough due to the long simmer 
Not against going as the staff is really friendly but not worth the wait ... The long line It's a marketing strategic to lore costumers in , by the way after waiting outside you get to wait at the bar as well before you get a table .
Happy eating !!!",-1
4,"I love this place, I really do and the only reason why I knock it is that it's a lot of money for what amounts to a bowl of ramen. I went for lunch with my mum and my sister (a quick lunch mind as it was a workday) and our total bill was over £50.
That said, it is damn good ramen, having tried Shoryu and Tonkotsu, it is, in my opinion, the winner in the area. Get there early, there aren't reservations and it's all communal seating. If you're a big party you might even lose your place in the queue as smaller groups are seated where they can fit.
My sister loved the fact that they had a) plastic bibs, and b) a little bottle of hairbands for tying back your hair so you didn't eat it while you slurped your noodles. And you want to slurp your noodles. Ramen arrived quickly along with a single order of croquettes and we went to town. If your noodles don't come with an egg, order the egg as an extra, it's worth it. 2 Tonkotsu and a Tantanmen were ordered on this day and the bowls went down a treat.
Get there early, sit and enjoy your noodles and then make way for the next customer. A long drawn out meal this isn't!
I'm going to um and ah about this one for a while but yes, for now, Bone Daddies your are a solid 4 out of 5. Who knows, I might upgrade it later.",1
4,"What can I say about this place? Every time I'm back in London, I visit here. The sweet and sour pork dish is really good and their crispy duck is pretty delicious as well. It's usually pretty crowded here and they've got about as many tables they can put in here. The service is terrible though just cause they're asian and it comes across that way. They want to give you quick service but because asian people talk in shrill voices, it sounds like they're yelling at you. Hahah. I'd say it's worth a visit though!",1
4,"Full post and photos @

 I totally adore Four Seasons. I LOVE their roast duck and really, if you can ignore the rubbish service (it's a Chinese restaurant afterall), you'll love the place.
 Things to note about Four Seasons:
 It's a dodgy little Chinese joint, not a five star hotel.
 There's one at Queensway and one at Chinatown. You'll find me at the Chinatown branch.
 They serve half duck or whole duck
 With or without bone at the same price.
 People get take out from there all the time, sometimes to take overseas (no joke the duck is that good)
 So it's rumoured (I haven't seen this) that they have a special container to pack duck for overseas travel!
 Wow that's hardcore!
 There's always a queue at Four Seasons
 And you can totally make a booking but you still have to queue (beats me).
 They work on turning the tables over so when you receive your main, expect to also receive your oranges and bill
 But with your bill they also give you kool mints, which I love.
 Customer service? There is none, but who cares.",1
4,Nice atmosphere at the bar and restaurant. Move waiters and waitresses who look like they've been kicked through topshop. Food is a expensive for what it is. Good experience overall though.,1
4,"I'm not a big fan of Japanese cuisine, but some friends took me here and I might just have to change my stance. The Tantanmen was excellent and very filling. I am also assured by my friends that it is a very good authentic version. It was perhaps a little too spicy for me, but good to get rid of the current winter chill! At £11 for the main dish it ain't that cheap, but the atmosphere and quality mean you don't begrudge the cost.",1
4,"A little torn between a 4 and a 5 for this one! The thing is, the great dishes Dishoom serves are GREAT, but as a pescetarian, my options are a bit more limited. I've particularly loved the black daal, the bowl of greens, the naan, and the matar paneer (paneer curry, basically), with the matar paneer being one of my favourite dishes in all of London. The cocktails are always interesting, and the beer selection is pretty good. The atmosphere is great, and the staff are always lovely and friendly.
It's the starters that let the restaurant down a bit. I didn't really like the calamari or the samosas, among others. I thought it was great that the desserts are more interesting, but it can veer to the too strange spectrum.
All that said, I always recommend Dishoom to visitors and residents of London alike. Worth at least a couple of visits!",1
4,"I went here with a (former) boyfriend and his co-workers for Chinese New Year celebration.  It was delicious!  It is a bit difficult to find as it is hidden in what you might think is just a back alleyway, but the interior is beautiful and sleek.
The service was great.  We kept ordering more and more to share and our waitress was patient with us but prompt with bringing our food to the table and also offered her suggestions on what we should have.
One warning.  The toilets are a bit tricky.  I wasn't able to tell which one was the ladies' and which one the mens' because of how they are marked!  Once I figured it out though, it was fine!",1
1,Service poor. Food okay. Nothing special. No takeaway boxes. Overall a bad experience.,-1
3,"BOTTOM LINE: Whilst it *definitely* ain't Kaji (Toronto) in terms of quality or creativity, the dishes are solid (but not mind-blowing) and the price factors in star-gazing opportunities.
Cost:
-£63 (~$101 CAD at time of writing) for the standard seven-course omakase (tax & mandatory 10% tip included).
Atmosphere/Decor:
-I sat at the bar where I could watch the chefs work, and whilst they were all solid (some more than others), none could compare to chef Kaji.  Whilst I realize that these guys have to prepare for more people, it just makes you appreciate how much time and care chef Kaji places into its few.  Sorry if this review is turning into an indirect one for Kaji Sushi.  :P
Ordered:
-There's your standard menu where you can order individual items and a choice of two omakase: the standard £55 one and the more ""creative"" £65 one.  I ordered the standard one:
1. Tuna tartare with special peach - The tuna was fresh, but perhaps the best part was the peach!
2. Tuna salad with shrimp - The dressing was a bit strong and hid the flavour of the tuna, and the shrimp looked and tasty somewhat bland.
3. Black cod miso - Everybody seems to rave about this as the *BEST* thing ever, and whilst it's well done, I just don't understand the hype.  Many standard Chinese restaurants can steam / grill all kinds of fishes that are just as good.  A nice touch was the tasty rod of white ginger.
4. Scottish beef tataki - As per its name, the beef was nicely seared on the outside and placed on a sizzling plate with fresh asparagus and enoki / shitake mushrooms.  The sauce was much too salty for me, but it was interesting to eat different slices of beef at various levels of 'well-doneness"".
5. Sushi platter - Standard sushi with nice rolls made from soft shell crab and asparagus.
6. Miso soup - Does this really count as a course?
7. Cappuccino icecream - You can't really go wrong with this!
-As a side note, I tried Nobu Miami a few years ago and it was good to see my favourite dish - yellowtail with jalapeno - still on the menu. I wished I had the appetite to order it again!
Service:
-Staff were friendly, if not a bit detached, and the dishes were served at a good pace.  No complaints.",-1
3,"I enjoyed eating at PingPong, I like the range of drinks and trying the out and find that the dim sum is very tasty. I took my friend for the first time and he was impressed by the food especially the mango dessert.
 Whilst the food is quite nice, the service is what lets it down as it is slow and somewhat cumbersome. You tend to see people waiting around without anyone attending to them, orders for drinks coming back after the meal is finished.
 If you are just out for a spot of lunch then I would recommend this place as the lunch time service is much better and less busy",-1
4,"Super modern setting, delicious food. The lychee martini while waiting for our table was a great start. We ordered a dozen small plates, including all three shu mai which were our favorite. Singapore noodles were very good as was the baby bok choy. Vegetable congee was a new taste for us. So glad we tried this Yelp hot spot.",1
3,"It's good but don't expect traditional dishes. Creates a big hole in the wallet, not somewhere I will think of straightaway when i want some dim sum.",-1
2,"Had the potential to be the best meal of our trip to London based on food alone, but the service was perhaps the worst I've experienced in my adult life.  
The Aubergine appetizer, pork loin and truffle pappardelle were all delicious (though salad was way over seasoned even for a salt-lover), if the service were even moderately normal, I'd probably give 4 or 5 stars (or more likely, not bother reviewing since they are already so positively reviewed)
The server who initially took our order never returned to our table and we had 4 or 5 other waitstaff cycle through the meal, never asking how things were.  The wine I ordered was poured from the very end of the bottle, there was no offer of a tasting before the ""full"" pour, which looked quite short still when the bottle was emptied, but no top-off was offered from a fresh bottle.  Once we finished our first drink, glasses were removed from our table and we were never offered a second drink.  
The food was delicious, but difficult to enjoy given how hot it was in the restaurant. Once we were done with our mains, all we wanted to do was pay our check and get out into the cool air outside.  Unfortunately, we wound up sitting with our plates in front of us for an additional 20 minutes before they were cleared and a dessert menu shoved in front of us wordlessly, with the server abruptly departing before we could say ""check please!""  Another 20 minutes before a new waiter came over to ask if we'd like dessert, to which we finally replied ""no thank you, check please"". He then awkwardly asked if we were celebrating anything, and I quietly replied that we were on our honeymoon.  That was apparently a mistake, as he disappeared again only to emerge 15 minutes later with a giant ""congratulations"" plate arranged with a few small petit fours, a sweet gesture (though worth noting every table received the same treats at the end of their meals), but it took another 20 minutes after that before we were able to successfully wave down the manager for our check.
We encountered a few other services issues (including the manager arguing with kitchen staff), but I feel like I've already ventured too far into petty-town, you get the picture. 
tl;dr :  food = very good, wait staff needs management overhaul and proper training",-1
5,"I don't go to other Chinese Restaurants anymore.
There's just no point; they're not Wong Kei.
 It's fast paced, no fuss and efficient service - this place runs on high customer turnover and plenty of customers there are.
 The menu is vast and so are the portions and the prices are extremely favourable. The food tastes great and you get plenty for your money.
 The restaurant is actually 4 storeys, all pretty different - the lower ground floor is like a canteen with a water feature, the ground floor like a diner and the upper floors like a rather nice uptown restaurant, it's a bit of a lottery where you get seated - at busy times you might share a larger table with other diners, wagamama style.
 If you want to feel spoiled when you go out for CHinese, you won't like it, but if you want good value, good food, and if you're in a hurry and want to be served quickly and get out quickly this will definitely do the trick! 
Not that you can't take your time - no one pressures you to leave or anything, but if you do want the bill they'll happily get it to you double quick. :-)",1
2,"Decent food, nothing special, bad service experience.
I show up at 6:00, which is clearly early for London, since most people are still out drinking at some pub for the past 3 hours wallowing about their painful 6 hour work day.
I show up, in casual wear, in track pants, but my friend was wearing ""sweat pants"" and we were told that he could not eat there because they have a dress code.
really?  track pants are ok, but sweat pants isn't?  it's also 6 pm there were only 3 tables of people eating, are they really going to notice?  
I bet if I was indian or the viscount of donkey kong country ther would make an exception for me",-1
5,Four Seasons call themselves 'roast duck specialists' and not for nothing! This is their new branch (the one other branch is in Queensway) and is already very popular. Their dishes can be quite pricey compared to the average in China Town (around £8 each) but there are less expensive rice dishes e.g. rice + a good helping of delicious roast duck is = £4.90. So with tea and service charge you can get a very decent meal for about £6. Expect to pay more if you want to try out the more flamboyant dishes though.,1
4,Elevated take on Dim Sim in a trendy atmosphere. Opportunity to explore dishes you know done differently and many for the first time.,1
4,"Very hip and modern restaurant that featured pan Asian and dim sum food. The restaurant seemed like it was geared towards both drinks and food so it's a good place for either or. 
Dim sum dishes were roughly £4-7 and featured 3-4 shui Mai or dumplings depending on what you order. Noodle and meat dishes can range for £12-16 so the restaurant's food is a little on the pricey side.
Overall this is a good place to take your date, get together with some friends for a drink, or to get some dinner with friends. There's something for everyone.",1
5,"Alan Yaus signature Chinese restaurant that started the whole dim-sum craze in London. The original, and still the best, dim-sum fine-dining experience in the city. Situated in the heart of Soho - the people who come here are a mix of celebrities and foodies. The décor is stunning, from the ground floor restaurant to the bustling downstairs eatery, flanked by fish tanks and cool, minimalist décor. Always busy so definitely book ahead. Only downer is they only give you 90 minutes to have your meal. Go anyway, you won't be disappointed.",1
3,"I have mixed feelings regarding Dishoom.
 On the one hand, the food is really good and I like the somewhat non-traditional approach to the Indian cuisine. In addition, I really like the decoration and the atmosphere which really remind me of a colonial comptoir. The terrace is also nice, but some of the tables are not convenient when you are trying to eat something.
However, I am really appalled by the lackadaisical service. First of all, one either has to come at an ungodly hour (i.e. 4-5 pm) or take the risk of having to wait in a queue for 1h30. Seriously, either they could raise the prices or allow people to book in advance. The personal, while polite, stand out by their lack of enthusiasm (and I have been there 3 times). 
I would still recommend the go if only once to try their Chicken Berry Britannia and the Lamb Botti Kabbab paired with a Lassi, they are all really good.",-1
4,"First of all, if you want a true dim sum experience, there are better places in Chinatown.  And that says a lot.  You lose that authentic ambiance without the rolling carts bustling about.  Not to mention that the selection is missing a lot of the more ""ethnic"" gems.  I suppose much of this is to be expected given the clientele of the establishment.  *cough*cough* NOT ASIAN *cough*cough*  Ping Pong is more of a white-washed, fusion restaurant catering mostly to bland taste buds.
With that being said, if you look hard enough, you will be able to find some tasty options on the Dim Sum menu that take a few steps away from standard Chinese dishes.  Be prepared to use a lot of sauce to capture the flavor though.
   ~ Five stars:  The Crispy Prawn Balls.  Superb, and unique.  A flaky and crispy shell with a thick, paste of a filling.  Pretty heavy.  These were the favorite of the night.
   ~ Five stars: Hoi Sin Vegetable Puff.  Also a favorite, crunchy and light.  I could have eaten five more of these.
   ~ Five stars: The Honey Glazed Spare Ribs.  So popular that night, that they ended up running out.  I was pleasantly surprised and would have ordered more if they didn't run out.
   ~ Four stars: Steamed Sichuan Rabbit Dumpling.  Mmmm, rabbit.  This is a seasonal special.  The leanness of the rabbit paired well with the hearty steamed bun shell and syrupy sauce.
   ~ Three stars: The Crispy Duck Spring Rolls.  It's actually an egg roll.  Still, I pretty much love anything with duck, so long as it's prepared right.  The Hoi Sin Sauce is obviously what made this dish delicious, but I also found the duck to be tender and flavorful.  
Note that each selection comes in a set of three.  So if you're with a party of four, order doubles of each dish?  
Total came to around £11 per person for a group of three.  We ordered no drinks, except hot tea.  There is a ""Set Menu for 1"" deal priced at £9.95 per person that includes a single serving portion from 10 different dishes, but the selection isn't that fantastic.
I'm used to putting up with bland food while I'm staying in London.  The taste buds here are atrocious.  And honestly, though most of the food selections were underwhelming, I was still pleasantly surprised with many of our selections.  Not to mention that Ping Pong is a frequented establishment for many of my friends.  
While I'm sure that at any other time, I would have awarded Ping Pong with just three stars, I found the complimentary hot tea a nice gesture, the overall price affordable and decent, the atmosphere cool and chic, the service fast, the bathrooms clean, and the location convenient.",1
5,"Okay first off, this place is awesome. You're might think that it's probably awesome because of the food. Wrong. Or that it's awesome because of the service. Nope. Or that it's nostalgia from child-hood days (You might be right). But overall no. It's pretty much the best place in Chinatown because of the no fuss (read: efficient) service, down and dirty, give the customer what they ordered and with complimentary tea. No service charge, but it does go appreciated so leave what you can.
What elevates it above most other place, is the chilli oil. Hands down the best chilli oil in all of chinatown. Nobody else does it. Nobody else has re-created it. I have literally eaten here and nearly eaten half a glassful of the stuff. I know that's probably not a badge to be proud of, but it is just that good and I probably wouldn't eat here as the food is nothing special without it. Cheap, but not special.
Recently however, they've started raising the prices a little and portions are quite variable. You used to always get a gigantic (how do I finish this) portion. But nowadays you could get that, or get something a little more manageable. This said, The price of the dish I always get, either the shredded chicken/pork fried noodles (always make sure you get crispy noodles) or the belly pork/bbq pork on hot rice have increased from £3.80 and £4.00 a decade ago to £4.80 and £5.00 today. Take into account inflation and this is probably a below inflation increase, you still get unlimited tea and the amazing chilli which haven't changed a bit.
If you're a wetherspoon snob however, and you know who you are, you absolutely won't like this place and this review won't convince you otherwise. For others that like to give new things and try and risk poor service/variable quality good, Wong Kei is great, you just have to understand how it all works. What appears rude service on your first visit is actually efficiency engineered over many decades. After all, if you're there on your own sitting at the front, why would they give you a menu?? You should already know what you want, and most people do!
PS. Like other budget chinatown places. Cash Only. They also do takeaway. I kid you not, sometimes you can get this from ordering to in your hand in less than 45 seconds. They give you a little container of chilli oil, but do it properly. Open up your chinese foil takeaway box and add more yourself.",1
4,"This review is for the sunday dim sum menu.
Started off with an excellent gin based cocktail. They sat us down and explained the menu to us. The first course was a crispy duck salad. This was amazing how the flavor of the duck and the crispness came together in your mouth. I wish they had brought more. 
Then came out 8 different dim sum dumplings in all. Generally typical (prawn Pork etc) but what stood out to me was the venison. However I wish I had used more pepper sauce on these. 
Next was our appetizer course- since we ha four people we ordered both the squid and the vegetable. Both were crispy. 
I should mentioned that during the meal we had champagne being poured for us the whole time. Not fancy bottles but still very tasty. Went well with meal. 
Finally the mains came and we were getting full. But alas we enjoyed the Seabass and the lamb. The Seabass was a bit fishy tasting (it is fish) but seared well. The lamb was tender but needed more flavor. The fried rice wasn't special but the Bol Chou was good. 
After this feast we thought we were finished. But alas after a brief period of rest came dessert. The rest of the table ordered the chocolate sphere thing which crackled in your mouth. Really good with the chocolate sauce poured over it. I however went or the macaroons. Always tasty. Did I mention we also got a dessert cocktail? I got a whiskey one which was quite a nice ending and I thought went well with the macaroons. 
All in all a great value for Michelin star food. It took all afternoon an was a great opportunity to spend time with friends. Some of the flavor a could have been stronger. Lastly wish it wasn't in the basement but I think it's part of the desired atmosphere",1
3,"I like the ambience at Ping Pongs. We went as a group of around 20 from work and had a huge number of dishes. They have round tables which is always a  good idea if you are going as a group. 
The ordering style is new as well..As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, they give you a small list of the dishes from which you tick off what you want. Surprisingly this list isn't taken by the waiter, instead they write down the order anyway... 
Unfortunately, I am a big fan of an un-dim-sum-like dish here- the honey pork ribs.",-1
2,"I visited Dishoom with colleagues from work with our lovely Indian friend leading the way as he advises and suggests stuff to help us make the best decisions mixing what we fancy and his experience and knowledge..
Now on the Dishoom diner I was rather disappointed!
The food was all right but not impressive at all, to my taste
the decoration etc. was pretty nice and I appreciated that. but what's even more important is food, and I believe it was not great and it was overpriced and expensive...
Not to mention the super packed aspect to the experience, which is sort of OK when it's a very nice place, you think it's worth the hassle; but this added on the disappointment since I would't get / couldn't justify this for the food I had at all!",-1
5,"One of my all time favorite restaurants! The service was exceptional and the food was amazing! I have several allergies and they waved a hand and said ""not a problem!"" They even made me fresh warm gluten-free bread and it was delicious! That was really special to me since its often difficult to find food I can eat at restaurants. The atmosphere was very romantic. Next time I'm in London, I will be making another reservation!",1
3,"Think we stepped on the wrong foot upon entry by asking if this place was Japanese -run. The look on the waiter's face was priceless as he said, ""Yes, I'm Japanese is there a problem with that""? Personally, I only eat sushi from Japanese places. Just like I wouldn't go to a Muslim joint to order pork, I don't eat Chinese sushi. Anyway I had the unagi set and then a salmon set after. I wasn't sure if the waiter was going to put some extra unwanted ingredients on my food from pissing him off at the giddy up, but It wouldn't be the first time. The unagi was tiny and for the price I could have gotten a whole eel in Tokyo. The salmon was decent but skint as well. I'd go back if I happened to be in the area but not going out of my way. The menu was interesting if you're into greenpeace and saving the whales and all.",-1
4,"Michelin stars aren't just handed out to those who ask for them, and while i only sampled a few dessert offerings at Yauatcha as opposed to their flagship Cantonese dishes, I certainly see why they get the attention that they do. 
Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?
From their super high end dessert bar to their very chic and contemporary formal dining area (with light that's oh so conducive to taking photos of your dishes), Yauatcha absolutely oozes class, and you can immediately spot the similarities to their mother ship Hakkasan (neon blue ring a bell?). Service is fast, friendly, and formal. Star Granted. 
Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?
Macarons are expensive these days, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my macarons at Yauatcha, where were notably large, only priced out to be $2.10 USD each once I did the conversion from pounds. That's notably cheaper than (smaller) macarons that I've had at Pierre Herme in Paris, which is certainly a win. I also ordered a signature 'Chocolate Pebble' that was a staggering six pounds, but I really can't fault the prices of flagship specialty desserts. Star Granted. 
Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?
One thing I'll point out is that the macaron flavors were just a tad bit limited at Yauatcha compared to some other shops that I've been to. Sure they had salted caramel and coconut and orange, but missing were classics like vanilla and rose or fun contemporary options like apple pie or banana. That's not really a fault (Pierre Herme has the same issue), but it was note worthy. 
The macarons themselves were excellent. Outside of the coconut all six of my macarons had excellent and more importantly consistent contrasting textures with powerful flavors on the back end, and the salted caramel in particular was divine. 
Arguably most surprising was the Chocolate Pebble, which was a symphony of truffle and liquid chocolate that had me appreciating chocolate like I'm not sure I ever have done. Dual Stars Granted. 
Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?
Yauatcha has earned all of the acclaim they've received, but their macarons fall ever so short compared to my all-time global favorites at Miann (Auckland) and Pierre Herme (Paris). I will certainly be back for the food though to give Yauatcha a proper and more thorough look. No Star Granted.",1
5,"Best meal we had in London. We went twice in our 5 day trip, that's how amazing this place is. Our favorites were lamb samosas, chicken curry dish, cheese naan and dahl. Don't forget to order a side of yogurt sauce. Just amazing!! Skip the far far appetizer, don't skip desert the chocolate pudding it's to die for.",1
3,"Part of the Nobu chain in NYC, Vegas, etc. Good food, menu pretty expansive, but $$$. Service a bit spotty during parts of our dining experience.",-1
2,"Waste of time and money to be honest. Don't believe the hype - go to Entrecôte in any other city but London puts this name to shame. 
Obviously it took long to be seated but that was expected. So was the subpar service. The food was the only thing we were really there for, and it was thoroughly disappointing. We both ordered medium steak and it came pretty much well done and at room temperature. The sauce was average and they provide a lot of fries but a really stingy portion of meat. The salad was the best part but is the equivalent of what a 5 year old can make with basic kitchen ingredients. 
Apparently the profiteroles are amazing but we were both too disappointed to devote any more time or money to this establishment. 
While it is not steak frites, burger and lobster knows how to perfect its dishes while providing outstanding service. What do you know, it seems possible after all.",-1
5,"For those impatient food review readers, I'll help you out and give you the bottom line right away: DISHOOM IS WELL WORTH A VISIT WITH EVERYTHING BEING BEYOND DELICIOUS. WAIT IN AN HOUR LINE BY ALL MEANS, IT'S A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 
Now for the normal folk. Dishoom takes the traditional indian vibe and classic entrees and takes them up to entirely different level of flavor and overall ambiance. Dishoom tries very hard to transport their customers with not only the menu design/descriptions of the items, but to the overall decor. The vibe echoed from this place is worth a good amount of pounds alone. I honestly felt that I was no longer in London when I first walked through this establishment's pristine doors. 
The food, as above stated, is simply out of this world. Everything is perfectly spiced with an array of flavors and spices present in any single dish on the menu. I have been to Dishoom three times, once for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As I am a writing this review I already know that I am going tomorrow for lunch. For the sake of clarity, I will just talk about what I had for lunch and dinner since the menus are the same. I have gotten the Murgh Malai, the Chicken Tikka, the side green side, the garlic naan, and the Bhel. The Murgh Malai and the Chicken Tikka are both chicken dishes that are beyond flavorful, aromatic,  and juicy. The chicken is just succulent; hands down the best chicken I have ever had. The garlic naan is served piping hot so you know it is fresh, and boy is it delicious. The Bhel is this puffed rice salad with spices, pomegranate, and mint, and it is a great refreshing salad as is the green salad.
Now to the drinks. The drink menu is absolutely divine, and boy is there an array of options. Both times for lunch and dinner, I ordered the Bombay Pimm's since I cannot get enough of it. It either comes in a glass or you can order a ""jug""of it. I considered ordering a jug the second time I was here, but considering I was alone, didn't want to seem like an alcoholic, and wanted to avoid any possible incident, I decided to restrain myself. I could honestly, without shame or regret, drink an entire barrel full of the Bombay Pimm's if nobody was around that I could cause harm to. How can you go wrong with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, ginger beer, and citrus?
All-in-all, and certainly needless to say, just swing by. If it could live here I would. The drinks are delicious (and certainly could be endless), the food is so delicious, that  you may honestly moan with delight in your seat considering the sensual mouth-orgy that is going on due to the knockout deliciousness of the entrees, and the ambiance just makes you take everything in leaving you sitting there well beyond the point when your check arrived. If I could be a part owner/investor I would, but im broke so...
Just come and transport yourself to a magical place. All it honestly takes to change your life and become a convert is to just walk through the door.",1
3,"I was expecting Nobu to be very fancy and full of celebrities, but it was just a dimly-lighted and not particularly wonderful looking place. I have been to prettier restaurants and there certainly weren't any celebrities there that night. 
I was hoping the food would be out of this world, but it was like other places, there were a few things that were really good and most were just okay. It didn't feel like a special dining experience or a culinary journey. 
The Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp Tempura started out tasting okay, but the serving was quite huge (it is not cheap so I suppose that's why) and the more of it you eat, the more ill you feel. It is okay only in small amounts, but 2 people trying to eat a mountain of it is just ruining the experience. It is just too creamy and too heavy.
In general, Nobu had decent food, the tataki was good, but nothing to justify the price tag and it certainly wasn't exciting in terms of atmosphere.",-1
4,"Had lunch here on Friday. Overall really good, had dim sum to start which was pretty standard. As for mains, spicy beef was great, the prawns were really good, lobster with black beans was excellent and the pork dish also good.
 We also had the crab, which looked good as it came in the shell with all the claws, but it was actually annoying and time consuming to get the crab out of the shell, and not really worth the effort, particularly as we were with clients so had to try to not make too much of a mess (although the sauce ended up all over my shirt anyway).
 Dessert was good, its nice to be able to have something other than lychees or banana fritters in a Chinese restaurant",1
1,"service charge of 12.5 automatically
service was rude
food was expensive - total bill was 107 pounds for 4 people and none of us were full
I found the service Ruder than a fast food joint. The woman just looked at me like I was a rat off the street and did not have any manners or respect",-1
3,"it's a bit like the tardis,looks tiny from the outside , but goes on forever and has a big downstairs.. the atmosphere is good, I'd only say that if you haven't been before i didn't know what to order. so probably ended up with the blandest thing on the menunext time i'll go with someone who knows what there ordering, the drinks alcoholic or not are great good.long tall refreshing  and the toliets are a talking point.",-1
4,"Food: This was our first time at Bone Daddies and therefore had to try the traditional Tonkotsu Ramen which was very good.  The broth was rich with flavour (can definitely tell the broth was watched over for 20 hours) and had a good serving of noodles.  One of the things I hate is when ramen houses are stingy with their noodles. We also ordered the kimchi side dish which wasn't real kimchi (I know kimchi, I'm Korean).  Not sure if they make it in-house, but it's not traditional and was a bit of a weird neon orange color.
 
Drinks: They have a pretty good drink menu for a ramen house which includes sake, shochu, wine, beer and cocktails. 
 
Price: Reasonable.  For two Tonkotsu Ramen and one side order of Kimchi came out to 28.12 GBP.
 
Ambiance: The restaurant was packed on a Sunday evening and very lively. All seating is communal.
 
Service: The host was friendly and we were able to get seated right away which was great since I've heard about the crazy queues.  Our server was very nice and our food came out pretty quickly.
Would I go back?  Yes;.  This is the best ramen I've tried so far in London.",1
3,Not the biggest fan of the soup that they use but the noodles are good. Their curry dishes are pretty good and for Japanese food the price is decent. However the service at this place is pretty bad. Very slow to respond so be prepared to wait 15-20min for them to even get some drinks.,-1
3,"Value to money is good; value to time is not. One hour wait really raised our expectations, but the food turns out to be not worth the time we spent in the line. If you have time and can wait, sure. Otherwise, don't waste your life",-1
3,"I was distracted from the food experience by my fellow diners on a Sunday lunch.  
Oh look, here comes a Birkin bag, with its friend, the Prada bag.  Oh wait!  here's another Birkin!  Is that ALLIGATOR?  and what about this table, 3 dudes about 20 years old, is that one wearing a $25,000 watch?  
I get the sneaking suspicion people are about 'seeing and being seen' more than culinary experience.
as for the food -- had the bento lunch.  There was a TON of food (too much, in my opinion).  and yeah, that black cod in miso is pretty good.  And actually the sushi is among the best I have had.  in fact the sushi is why I'm giving this 3 stars instead of two.  
If you want decent Japanese food I'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
If you want a Michelin starred lunch, there are better choices in London.
If you want to show off your new handbag as you leap out of your Bentley at lunchtime, book a table here.",-1
3,"Ehhhh.....
This is my first time getting Dim Sum anywhere. I live near Boston and Chinatown has its fair share of dim sum but i've never been brave enough to order. Colleagues highly recommended Ping Pong (which I kept calling Polka dot all day.. but that's neither here nor there). I went here with high expectations and left somewhat disappointed.. and 50.00 poorer.. and kind of hungry still. 
Hubby and I shared 8 plates and each got soup. My soup was the best part of the meal. I got the hot & Sour soup- flavorful and spicy and very good. For food we got the mushroom oyster (not great), the spicy pork dumplings (decent but really mushy), black bean pastry things (awful, tasted like burnt pie crust), black seafood dumplings (extremely good, but small- order a few!), prawns wrapped in shrimp (ok, but  lacking much flavor), sticky rice wrapped in some kind of tough leaves (not very good), Crunchy spring rolls (good, but standard fried food) and squid cakes (just ok, nothing to write home about). 
Each plate was somewhere between 3-4GBP. altogether we spent almost 50.00 and i left still pretty hungry but not wanting to spend anymore money on food there!
Atmosphere was nice. Probably wouldn't go back though.",-1
3,"I suppose, in a way, it's good that Ping Pong is spreading the gospel of dim sum across London. The choice of dishes extends enough to sate western palates and the ambiance is mass market chic
The 'service' is generally good but they do drop the 'ball' with the odd dish but I suppose this is because they're aiming to 'serve' a more mainstream market or for people who are new to dim sum. The best 'table' is probably at the counter where you can watch them steaming and preparing the dishes.
A safe bet but not the most 'smash'ing for dim sum.",-1
3,"Considering this was 4.5stars with over 1100 reviews, I was expecting a lot from this restaurant.  Even though this was 2 $$, it was still relatively expensive.  
Food/drinks ordered:
- Sweet & mango lassi: Dishoom did their own twist to the traditional lassi.  It's a bit more watered down and they added ice to the mixture as well.  The spices they added to the lassi are an acquired taste.  The mango lassi was actually more tangy than sweet.  
- Okra fries: This is actually pretty good.  Crispy and quite flavorful.  I liked 
- The black daal is their specialty, so I got this.  It was flavorful and tasty.  I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it was still good.
- Chicken ruby: tender and tasty.  Again, this is just average.
- The prawn mooli was really nice.  It was light and the prawns weren't overcooked. 
Overall, I didn't think there was anything special about the restaurant.  If I wanted exceptional Indian food for lunch, I'd go to Tamarind @ MayFair for lunch.",-1
2,"Before I even write anything, I am not going back there again. I have read some good reviews on Ipoudo and I'm hoping that their ramen is just as nice, because the service at kanada ya is absolutely ridiculous.
It was a Wednesday night at around 8:30pm. We queued for over 30 minutes which was fine. However, just as we thought the next table available would be ours, suddenly came two people that was at the Back of the queue and just sat down. We asked what was going on and as I was expecting the Guy to tell those two to get back in the queue, he simply said ""sorry there will be a table soon anyway."" 
fuming, I ordered my ramen just to find out that they literally have nothing left. No egg, no salmon o nigiri. could the two people that pushed in have taken my last egg?probably.",-1
1,"We booked a lunch reservation here 3 months before heading to London for our honeymoon, as there were no dinner reservations available. We were so excited about dining here. It was to be a highlight of our stay. We received a call and voicemail from the restaurant a week before our reservation and upon calling them back, I spoke with one of the rudest woman I have ever had the displeasure of speaking with. When I tried to get clarification on our reservation (I didn't realize there were two sections of the restaurant and was advised this via their voicemail) the woman on the other line was clearly annoyed that she had to explain this to me. After she explained there were two sections and we wouldn't be eating in the conservatory (the beautiful section you see in all their photos) she proceeded to tell me that in order to be seated in the conservatory, we would have needed to book our LUNCH reservation a YEAR IN ADVANCE. I have to put this is caps because it blows my mind that they wouldn't have this listed anywhere on their site. A kind ""FYI, most people who are seated in our conservatory book a year in advance"" or something of this nature would have been nice. Still, this wasn't an absolute no-go for us. What sealed the deal was the next thing she said... ""So, are you going to confirm your reservation or not?"" We were given no time to process what she had just said before that! Needless to say, we prefer not to have our food with a side of nasty attitude. Not only did she phrase everything as if to make it clear she thought the conversation wasn't worth her words, as soon as I said we wouldn't be confirming, she immediately hung up the phone. No ""Goodbye"", no ""Sorry to hear"", etc. We wouldn't have gone after that conversation had they paid for the meal and put us in the conservatory.  I can't believe people are still patronizing this place with a woman like her being the first impression everyone gets of their restaurant.",-1
2,"I've always wanted to visit this restaurant since it is supposed to be the oldest North Indian restaurant in London. 
We ordered the vegetable pakora for an appetizer, but found some hair in it. Not good. The mango lassis were good but not great. 
We ordered the malai kofta with vegetable biriyani and Naan (bullet and garlic). The naans came way after the kofta was almost gone - not good again. 
With some many other Indian options like Dishoom and Gymkhana around, I will not be back.",-1
5,"Zomg amazing breakfasts. Expensive but on expense account so, fine :) we ended up coming here for breakfast 3 times even though there are a ton other interesting places nearby. Tried to even go for dinner too but the wait was 1h45 (wtf?!). Will absolutely go back next time in London. Yummmmmm",1
5,"Dim sum is one thing that can be done very well for reasonably cheap, so I entered Hakkasan's luxurious space afraid we would be shelling out for the chic flower arrangements, the lush seating, and the seductive ambience.  My fears found themselves unfounded - yes, Hakkasan presented its food with impressive, elegant trappings, but these were just a gorgeous frame worthy of presenting the attractive and phenomenally delicious dim sum.
I'm going to get two brief complaints out of the way first.  1.  No pictures allowed, and that's company policy.  2.  Our waitress seemed a bit impatient at first, as we were first-timers who didn't necessarily know how much to order or how this new-fangled cartless dim sum worked.  She answered our questions, but seemed a little surly about it.  She did warm up to us quickly, though, and service was generally unproblematic and even friendly at times.
Now, the food.  We were presented with a la carte and dim sum menus, and went all dim sum, with one order of vegetarian dim sum from the a la carte menu.  We started with this vegetarian dim sum platter, which came with two pieces each of crystal dumpling, vegetable shumai, yam bean and shiitake dumpling, and vegetable beancurd roll.  We proceeded with the steamed king crab noodle wrap, the chinese chive dumpling with prawn and crabmeat, the seafood dumpling consomme, the scallop shumai with tobiko caviar, the char sui bun, and an order of the Singapore vermicelli with prawn and squid.
Each dim sum order came in its own little bamboo container or ceramic bowl, and everything looked beautiful - dumpling skins in deep honeydew green, glistening scallop topped with jewel-like tobiko, burgundy pork peeking out of white clouds bursting quietly at the seams...the presentation was a cut above any dim sum I'd ever seen before.
Incredibly, it tasted even better.  Every last bit of dim sum was cooked gently to unveil bold flavors and toothsome textures.  The dumpling skins were impossibly good, the consomme soothing and deeply aromatic, the Singapore noodles fluffy and wonderful laced with firm bits of seafood.  Not one bite fell short of eye-opening, and Hakkasan unlocked a new level of dim sum in my culinary universe.
 
We should have stopped there, but curiosity got the better of us and we tried the tapioca pearl pudding, which came with little snatches of vanilla panna cotta, poached banana, passion fruit sorbet, and caramel popcorn.  I prefer the humbler version of this dessert offered at lower-end dim sum places.  This one tried too hard and the result was a messy hodge-podge of clashing and cluttering flavors.  The rest of the meal was so delightful that I'm going to forget this final bit ever happened.
Hakkasan was a revelation.  In one meal - and a lunch, at that - I obtained a new lens by which to judge dim sum.  My experience wasn't perfect, but the core of it was, and it is upsetting that I can't go back and repeat it any time soon.
Also, the bathrooms are REALLY COOL.",1
1,"I have been twice and will not go back.
 The first time the food was excellent but the service was shocking.
 Unfortunately, the service problems were not an anomaly and the second time was just as bad in terms of service.
 There are too many fabulous places in London to eat that also give you a wonderful experience. Don't waste your time or money here.",-1
4,"The service was ok, the food presentation looks good. I also enjoy the dinner. It really hit my taste bud, recommend to try.",1
3,"Not what I expected. Didn't like the decor or the food. I am very generous and always give the benefit of the doubt but felt like they wanted us out if there as it was nearing closing time but then they should adjust their timings not rush paying customers.
To top that our order was wrong and told them mild coz of my young child and the food cane our spicy.
Not going there again.",-1
5,Venue of choice for roast duck and roast meat in Chinatown. Takeaway and enjoy a delicious meal in Central London!,1
3,"Good service, long lines but moved quite fast thanks to staff efficiency. They gave us complimentary warm sake shots while waiting in line. Ordered yuzu tonkotsu. Quite tasty; the broth is a bit too thick for my taste but some people may prefer it. Noodles were ok, a bit skimpy on the meat but satisfying overall. Chili sauce was more Chinese style than Japanese. It was fine but a bit of an ecclectic mix if you're expecting a Japanese ramen shop. Soft shell crab apps was very tasty & fresh; though the accompanying dipping sauce was quite odd & not a really good pairing. Agedashi tofu was quite disappointing. 
May return but probably will try the chicken broth ramen instead and the chicken wings app (they look quite appetizing).",-1
3,"The pork belly buns were flavourfull and yummy; the gyoza had a fresh pork filling that reminded me of homemade (although the skins were not).  I had the original ramen which was a big bowl of miso pork broth with two fatty slices of pork, some seaweed and scallions.  This was good although I did have food envy for my friend's signature ramen (there was half an egg!)  One drawback on the broth was that it was quite greasy.  Defat the broth!  It's not hard to do and really makes for a better, non-greasy experience.  It's not fun having to wipe your lips because it feels like you've put on too much lip balm.
While I liked Shoryu and would go back, the main drawback is the seating.  I think they are trying to provide an authentic, Tokyo experience by making the tables as crowded together as possible.  It is not a place to have any sort of intimate conversation with anyone because you are literally right up against the person sitting next to you.  I get turning tables but Shoryu borders on the ridiculous.  No wonder there were so many solo diners.  You wouldn't want to go here for a friendly chat or first date!",-1
5,"Don't come here expecting an intimate ambience, fine dining or good service. This is simply good Chinese food cooked for those in need of a Chinese fix, which is greatly appreciated if you've lived in Europe too long. The roast duck is absolutely divine; the skin is crispy and the fat melts in your mouth. The hot plate beef - I suggest the black pepper sauce - is also recommended. Finally, you can't go wrong with some Yangzhou fried rice.",1
4,"A wide variety of delicious food, creative drink menu in a cool, well decorated interior.",1
2,"I don't understand what the whole fuss is about: we waited in the queue outside (or in American term: we waited in the line!) Then we were served two small portions of steak with a special sauce but frankly speaking I had much better steaks but the fries was great. The waitress was super serious and when we asked to have our photo taken, she commented that if it is quick! I know it is hectic but a photo at most takes 10 seconds! Anyway, I don't think I will go back here.",-1
4,"Loved loved dining here in London. But I must say that I preferred the appetizers than the main course. We had prawn and beancurd cheung fun which was incredible, I could have had like 50 of them. Also the beef wrapped with pastry was also delicious. But the main course was not wow enough for me with the thai style chicken and I forgot what the other main dish I ordered. Overall it was a great experience with good service and atmosphere.",1
3,"A Indian New Yorker has Indian food in London. 
The YELP community very rarely leads me astray, and although they were a little bit below the mark, Roti Chai was still a decent food option. To note, I am sure there are plenty other fantastic Indian spots in this city, that this wouldn't be my first pick going forward. But if you are in the neighborhood and want quick food and service this would probably be your best bet. Let's break it down shall we?
3 friends go to Roti Chai and share some Indian dishes Tapas style, and here's what we thought!
STREET SECTION:
1. Aloo Papri Chaat (4.8GBP) - The papri (circular fried bread base was crispy, but not fresh), the aloo (potato) was well made, and the toppings were tasty, but not fresh again. It was decent, and edible, but not exciting or by any means the best papri chaat I've had. Decently priced for the portion. Rating = 3/5
2. Chicken Lollipops (5.5GBP) - Good texture, taste, although could have used more flavor, spice, and seasoning. But still delicious, and one of the better dishes we had, good price for the portion. Rating = 4/5
3. Agni 'Fire' Wings (5.9GBP) - Well made, although I thought the chicken could have been cook a tad more. The accompanying sauces were good, and the wings were indeed spicy. I will have to say, they were not ""Indian spicy"" but still created some heat and were well ""sauced."" Again, good portion for the price. Rating = 4/5
4. Hakka Chilli Paneer (5.5GBP) - My favorite dish, as the quality of each paneer was perfection. Perfectly seasoned and flavored. The paneer was also cooked to perfection and tasted more fresh than 1, 2 and 3 (above). My one qualm with this dish was there was very little paneer, and vegetables took up most of the dish which isn't what you are paying for. Quality = 4/5, Quantity = 3/5, Rating = 3.5/5.
ROAD & RAIL:
1. Gobi Manchurian (7.2GBP) - This dish was all that was wrong. The gobi Manchurian was slightly stale, the sauce ruined the gobi, and gobi itself tasted like it was undercooked, the cauliflower (gobi) was still a bit hard and the dish just 100% made me wish I could have my 7GBP back, this dish really ruined the meal for me. Rating = 0/5. Sorry for the awful rating, but do not order this dish. 
2. Railway Lamb Curry (8.5GBP) - The Lamb was decently cooked, but could have been softer. Whenever I've had lamb curry, it has melted in my mouth, so this was a bit of a disappointment. It was not really spicy, but there was a bit of flavor, could have been cooked longer, and with more flavor. Overall probably would not order it again, but it was decent. Rating = 3/5.
SWEET:
1. Pistachio Kulfi (2.9GBP) - Although I love Kulfi, and it was good, it tasted like it was a ""packaged kulfi"" and they just unwrapped it an put it in a glass for me to eat. Still delicious, but still not the kind of fresh made Kulfi I was expecting. Rating 4/5. 
WiFi was good at the restaurant, and the service was solid (sometimes a bit spotty as no one really checked up on our table). Rating 4/5.
Final thoughts: 
Don't go out of your way to eat here. 
Decent Indian food for a cheap meal.",-1
3,"We decided to try something less formal today so we went to Bone Daddies for some Ramen.  Lining up seems to be the new trend in London.  
Tomato salad with their Japanese sour vinegar dressing was delicious. We had Tonkatsu ramen and Kimchi ramen.  The  soup base was made with pork broth that has been cooked for 20 hours, so imagine the flavour and thickness of the soup.  
However, there is one thing interesting, I tasted ginger in the soup which is not the normal ingredients of Tonkatsu ramen.  I prefer the regular ones though.  
The seating is not amongst the most comfortable ones, and I preferred to just stand there eating than sit on those wooden stools.",-1
3,"They have very good food and excellent service. Very tasty dishes with excellent curries. 
They need to update their restaurant, it's rather poor shape but it shouldn't stop you from going if you want good Indian food",-1
4,"Came here for dinner with the family. The food was generally excellent though the service, surprisingly bad. They clearly are trying to cater to a hip crowd -- and trying too hard. 
The service was thoroughly inauthentic. Our waitress was pushy, trying to upsell nearly every item. My 9 year old daughter just wanted water. Waitress insisted on lassi. My daughter insisted on Neebu Pani. My daughter finally relented after multiple times saying she just wanted water. The Neebu Pani was way too bitter for her -- and the waitress did not inquire, let alone apologize for being so pushy. This was the entire meal -- we were a family of 4. We ordered 3 appetizers and 4 main dishes and 2 side dishes...and the waitress battered us to order more. It was all too much. 
The food was superb but the service, crappy. If you can tolerate bad service, worth going to this place.",1
5,Don't expect service at all. If one come for the boneless duck - one will be in heaven! Who knew duck could be so tasty and tender! Shut up and take my money even though your service sucks big time and you even charge for service.,1
4,"Everything was almost perfect. Would give this a 4.5 if I could. 
Tried the prefixe menu. I had the ""tartare"" starter which was kind of weird and not really a tartare. My husband had the asparagus soup which was quite good. But our main courses made up for it. Had the scallop and pollack over linguine. Probably too many calories but worth every single bite. Ryan had the beef which was so tender.
Service was great except when I asked for tap water and they gave us bottled. lol smh.
Definitely very pricey so definitely save for a special occasion! I was dressed relatively casual (just came the London eye) and was a little embarrassed. However they still welcomed us!",1
3,"recommended by my indian friend as the ""BEST indian food outside of india"" that she's had, Punjab was one of the first restaurants i tried after landing in London
we were pretty underwhelmed by the food 2.5 stars.. but maybe because I didn't order the famed chicken tikka masala
--grandad's daal: BLAND
--lamb korma: this dish was ok
--acharri chicken: too tomatoe-y for my taste
--Garlic naan: pungent but pretty good
--we got one order of Flavored and another order of unflavored rice for the 3 of us
a reasonably priced meal for london
Bill includes a suggested 10% tip
NOTE: the 15 pound minimum order per person is flexible & they only print that on the menu so people don't order solely appetizers",-1
2,"Dry curry and rice. Thought it was only the dish I ordered (paneer) so didn't want to judge too soon. I was wrong, it was the same for the other meat dishes my two friends ordered. The non-authentic vibe and location is what attracted me to this restaurant. It's a shame that the food didn't match up to the high standards of decoration and furnishing. Good atmosphere and place looks good but food is very average.",-1
3,"Quick glance:
+ delicious food
+ good selection of wine, including English
- pricey
- small portion (on set menu)
Full review:
I had a team dinner with work here one evening and from the hustle and bustle it would have been hard to guess it was a weeknight. The place was swimming with people, as well as fishies in an enormous tank that stretches across the bar downstairs, stylishly decorated for a nice ambiance. 
As a group, we had the Yauatcha Signature set menu. As a Cantonese person judging an upmarket Cantonese restaurant, I found the food was tasty and delicately prepared, but the portion size was not particularly generous at £60 a head for 8 people. At that price I had expected perfection but was disappointed by the two plates of desserts (one per group of four) dishing up slightly different sweets. (It looked like an error that one plate had duplicated chocolate pudding while the other plate had four distinct offerings - small things, but alas I have high expectations!). 
The restaurant offers a good selection of wine, including Camel Valley from Cornwall, and the a la carte menu looks alluring and attractively priced. If I come back again I would definitely stay away from the set menu, but then again I would probably feel more at home in a less grandiose venue...",-1
3,"I heard of this place through the 2010 Not For Tourists Guide for London and a bunch of London guidebooks, saying that it is one of their recommendations for inexpensive eating in London. I decided to walk inside to grab a lunch and see how they do. 
When I got inside, they quickly gave me some tea. The tea was fairly bitter and tasted kind of bland. I don't think the people who work here speak English very well, and I ended up speaking Cantonese Chinese to them. The t-shirts they wore were pretty cool as well. 
I ordered the Fish with tofu over rice. The fish was pretty bony, but there was a decent crisp in the fish, and I thought it was decent at the best. It is not high on my recommendations to order at this place unless you do not mind eating fish meat from the bone. The tofu was pretty good though as well as the rice. The dish also had some Chinese mushrooms and ginger as well. The ginger put some flair into the flavour of the dish, while the mushrooms were pretty tasty. Portions were pretty good and I got my stomach full. As for the prices, most of the dishes were under £9, so it's fairly inexpensive for a city like London. I paid £5.70 for my dish, which is probably the least amount of money I spent for a meal in London so far. 
Overall, this is not a bad place to grab something inexpensive to eat in London and I would not mind coming back here again. However, I would not recommend getting the Fish with tofu over rice.",-1
2,"This particular Nobu restaurant seems to have lost quite a bit of its exclusivity and high standards in terms of service. Been to the NY location a few years ago and me and my family were extremely impressed!
Therefore, went today and was really looking forward to it. We were welcomed and everything was good, bathroom didn't look like the NY location at all, just very simple and generic.
We were seated on wooden chairs and I asked whether we could sit on a soft couch twice, on which the reply was; sorry that is not possible while there were plenty of benches available...
Their salmon & tuna sashimi tasted just like the one u can get at YoSushi; like plastic. Maybe this is more of an environmental issue but still then don't dare to charge a Nobu price.
After I refused to pay the optional service charge due to dissapointing fish quality and just rude seating arrangements, I was treated like a criminal - never again at this Nobu location that's for sure!",-1
3,"The decor is tacky. Food is good, but I doubt it's worth the price tag. A bit of a disappointment. But it's ok, it was a business lunch and I didn't pay for it personally.",-1
3,"I'd like to start by saying that this place is gorgeous. It's a sexy dinner house located in London's first public library. Which is just cool! They pride themselves on a vast and very interesting gin menu. They also advertise a awesome gin and tonic service by a professional gin and tonic bartender... but the delivery is abut of a letdown... the lovely stuttering young man that was manning the gin cart, stuttered through the gin presentation that he was reading off a card... and he wasn't stuttering because he had a stutter, he had very obviously never served a gin and tonic before.
Then there was the food. We ordered butter chicken, The tasting of mushroom which featured a large and dry portobello, a mushroom briyani with wayyyy to much star anice, a butter chicken that was just ...meh, lamb with saffron which was underwhelming.  We also ordered a  bread basket that was very good and chutney tray that came with a mind blowing gooseberry chutney. All together a 3 star experience... I think we just expected more.",-1
3,"My friend took me to Dishoom in London calling it a restaurant which would hit very close to India. The reviews amongst Londoners I met prior to the meal were something along the lines of ""Best Indian restaurant"", ""Daal is to kill for"", etc., So with absurdly high expectations, we hit the restaurant at around 9:30 PM. Waited for 10 minutes and managed to get a spot at the bar with a further estimated wait time of 15 minutes for the actual table. At the bar, we ordered Okra fries and Samosa. 
Samosa - Tasted pretty much like Trader Joes frozen samosas heated up. 
Okra fries - Underwhelmed. No crispness to it. Favors didn't stand out either. 
After around 10 minutes of wait time, we got our table. I was willing to let go of the samosa and okra fries and give Dishoom a second chance. We ordered Vada Pav, Bhel Puri, Daal, Bread and Biryani.
Vada Pav - Good. Not a home run, but good. 
Bhel Puri - Disaster. Where are my chutneys?! Why am I eating this bland puffed rice? I mixed in the chutneys from the Samosa to save the day. 
Daal - Really really good. They got their signature dish right.
Biryani - I guess it was Kachi Biryani. Please don't tell me this is Dum. If I am trying to guess the biryani types, you know the biryani is in trouble. All I can say was it was some sort of curry rice. 
Outside of India, the restaurants worthy of mention are Himalaya in Houston, Texas, Vij in Vancouver, Canada, Rasika/Bombay Club in Washington DC, Indian Accent in New York. Dishoom is nowhere close. If I was in London, I would be visiting it yea, but not recommending it as the next best thing outside India.",-1
2,Moyasi Ramen with very rich broth (very fatty) was disappointing in this new restaurant.  There was very little meat -  three pieces of cold pork with lots of fat - and the stock was nothing special and bland. The Chashu Men's meat was better with soft hot pork.  This is a new restaurant so they have plenty of time to adjust the menu and flavour.  It is way too overpriced and not a good value for money.  I definitely had far better one in Japan.,-1
1,"The worst food experience while I was traveling in London. I would skip and look elsewhere if possible. 
Here are a few things to expect while you eat here:
1. The staff do not care about you. 
2. Everybody is expected to order one item even though you're not hungry or they just charge you at a random amount to make it up. 
3. Food is just alright.
4. I saw the staff legit yelled at customers for asking questions about the menu. 
5. The staff also swore at some nice elderly people. Wtf? What is wrong with them?
However if you're into a bowl of lukewarm wonton soup for roughly £6, this is your place. 
I made a bad decision for coming here. The staff should be fired.",-1
5,"the environment is nice, it needs a long time to enjoy the meal. Every plate is delicate and delicious, the dessert is so great, and the cocktail has a lot of flavors in it, it's beautiful.",1
2,"On a recent trip, went to Balthazar with a friend who had great food at Balthazar in the past. Possibly this was the one-off day but the food was very average. We both essentially got a steak and it wasn't great. The wine though was brilliant - we got recommendation from the sommelier and it was a great suggestion. Will visit again though since it possibly was just a busy Friday eve.",-1
3,"Indian Street food with lovely decor throughout. 
Food was good, wish I knew what to order. I had a rice dish that was a bit unexpected,  Felt a bit like a fish out of water with the cuisine but we did the best we could. 
I would definitely try this again for a better pov. 
Service could use some work. I sat around for a total of about 40 min waiting for service to bring menus, to order drinks, to order and a long time for the check.",-1
3,"Mmm...  pretty yum.  There were lots of us at the restaurant and I felt like they were quite accommodating and patient with our table.
On Lizzie's recommendation I went for the fall off the bone butter chicken which was yummy- tangy and spicy and extremely dippable- in fact we ended up using uneaten bits of naan off other people's plate to mop our sauce.  The perswari naan was sweet but not too sweet, though I like mine with fruit in it, so slightly disappointed it was only sweeterned nuts.
The only thing is they gave us bottled water instead of tap (as we requested) and that the poor server's arm was too short to reach over the other side of the table.  
I think Tayyabs is still much better, despite the lack of service and infinitely cheaper too.  So there you go.  Punjab, I will probably be back if looking for curry in town, but I'd rather make the trip and go east.",-1
4,"Very cool setting & amazing interior - submerged lounge with dark woods and charcoal greys everywhere. The food is fantastic, and the cocktails are lovely (I recommend the bisongrass vodka with cucumber).
 The dim sum starter is amazing, as is the venison main meal, and any of the sea bass dishes.
 The menu has not changed in 5+ years, so it gets a bit tired if you have been many times, but still the vibe for dinner or even a drink is worth the price.",1
4,"I haven't yet had a meal here, but went to their bar on a weekend. Great drink menu with exciting selection. Had a few nibbles which were good. Costly all around but can be worth it for the atmosphere.
I'd love to go back for dinner and the place smelled amazing!",1
3,"My husband and I had lunch at this location the other day.  We arrived just before noon.  We did not have a reservation, but the hostess said that was no problem.  She would seat us at the end of a long table for 10 people, but said she would need it back by 1:30.  This was not an issue for us, but it did seem a bit odd.  I've only been to a few places that have told me I can have a table for a limited amount of time, but most of the time it is because the restaurant is so amazing that they are overbooked, so although in one sense it bothered me, in another sense I was now even more excited to eat here because, dang this place must be good.  
For drinks my husband ordered a watermelon cooler which he described as a watermelon mojito, no alcohol.  I was debating between a chai and a lassi.  I love both, but I have a tendency to fill up on lassis before my food arrives.  However, there was a guy at another table with this gorgeous pink drink.  When I asked the server what it was and he said the rose and cardamom lassi, I knew I had to have it.  To be honest, it was my favorite thing I consumed at this meal.  It was heavenly.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and the a gorgeous flavor of roses, but it did sort of fill me up.  
For entree my husband ordered the lamb chops.  He saw a thousand things he wanted to order on the menu and was having a terrible time deciding, but once I started showing him pictures on Yelp he knew that is what he wanted and he said they were incredible.  I'm not super into red meat right now.  My pregnancy has largely turned me off to most red meat,  but they did look gorgeous.
  I ordered the chicken ruby.  Here's my issue, it was one of only 2 curries on the menu.  I mean it is kind of cool to go to an Indian restaurant that has different stuff and when we were in India most restaurants had curries, and tandoori, and biriyani, but I really felt like 2 curries was a super limited selection.  There was no korma, xacuti, vindaloo, madras, etc.  For my personal taste this lack of selection of sauces was a bummer.  
The chicken ruby was very good, but far from the best I've ever had.  It tasted like butter chicken to me.  The spicy flavor didn't kick in until the very last minute.  I ordered it with basmati rice which was fine, but in no way special, and roti, which again was fine, but not special.  
With his lamb my husband ordered the black daal which everyone raved about and we found to be lackluster.  These were far from the best lentils we've ever had.  
The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit odd too.  We sat upstairs and I am glad we did.  When I went downstairs it was like a whole different restaurant.  It was loud, crowded and cramped.  The upstairs was a bit like that, but not to that extent.  
Finally, the prices were a bit steep as well.  After, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, this was the second most expensive meal we ate in London, so it is pretty pricey.  We definitely enjoyed it, but I don't think we enjoyed it that much and for all those who say this place is worth the wait, I am going to have to politely disagree.  Again, it is good, but it is not outstanding.  Perhaps I am spoiled by my vast selection of Indian at home or by the fact that I have traveled and spent time in India.  I had really high expectations for Indian food in London and this didn't really meet them.",-1
3,"Whilst lovely, Ping Pong is starting to get a tad formulaic. It still hits the spot, with a fine selection of Dim Sum . . . . but, well . . . . it fails to light fires in the way that I would want or in the way that say, Yautcha can. Granted, Yautcha is in a different league price wise and dim-sum there are freshly made to order. But Ping Pong's cut-price ready-meal formula is starting to wear thin.",-1
3,"So we walked around trying to compare prices in the close area and we thought this was the best price one for us college kids. (And the 'FREE TEA' got to us, haha)
Decor: Nice & cozy; they have a downstairs seating area too
Service: Hah, they expect you to know what you want within minutes, and we took FOREVER to decide. But they were nice about it! And some of us spoke canto, so the guy chatted with us for a little bit and that was nice.
Food: 
- Ma Po Tofu: really good! I was surprised, considering it isn't really a canto dish. If you order this, remember to get a rice dish or just a (pretty large) bowl of rice (for about 1.50?)
- Roast Duck (cold): I didn't particularly like it because it was really fatty (Though I know some people like it) and I found it a bit salty (yet again, some people like that).
- Yang Zhou Fried Rice: DELICIOUS. haha, get it!
- Choi Sum w/garlic: pretty good, not what I would say best I've ever had. It wasn't the freshest, but the garlic was good (it was his recc).
Price: We had 4 people and it came up to 10 pounds a person, which isn't too bad since I was pretty stuffed.
Overall: I'm pretty happy about this place! I'll still be searching for other Chinese restaurants before I say this is my top place.",-1
1,I came to this restaurant with my father and brother. We ordered the starters and main course together at 9:20pm and we received our starters with 20 mins. It took an hour for our main course to come. This is not right. I don't recommend this at all.,-1
4,"I was intending to visit this place for the umpteenth time again the other week for tea and cakes possibly followed by a cocktail when I realised the amazing cake counter had disappeared.
Anyone know where it's gone? Will it be returning?
I don't think I'll visit again if they don't have the macaroon platter still :(",1
4,"Excellent Chinese food! Highly recommend making a reservation otherwise you do wait a long time to get seated. In our case, we were seated at the bar. 
Service was excellent- especially for such a busy restaurant. 
Food was fantastic- loved everything! Thai chicken dish, pork buns, chicken corn soup and the mushroom truffle egg rolls were stand outs!
Will definitely go back. One star penalty for not allowing take away service for our leftovers :(",1
3,"OK yet forgettable Indian. Had a couple of similar fried chicken dishes, a tiny pani puri, a fine lamb curry, and a nicely presented patri chaat. The best part of the meal was my Beaverton Neck Oil IPA from a local London brewery. I can't see myself going back here, so three stars feels about right.",-1
3,"The broth is kinda light, and mixed with noodle's smell. Go there 5 minutes before they open and avoid lining up.
Unfortunately, I can't finish their ramen because the strange taste of the broth.",-1
3,"I think this is overrated. Stood in line for almost an hour and got in. Ordered Wada Pav, Kali Dal and Paneer Roll. Kali Dal was okay not over the top as other reviews are saying. Same for Wada Pav and Paneer roll. Definitely overpriced IMHO",-1
4,"Great dim sum - really enjoyed Yauatcha's interpretation of Cantonese dim sum. I had the sticky rice in lotus leaf, rice noodle rolls with bean curd and prawn, the xiaolongbao, and chocolate blood orange cake. A lot for one person - wish I could have taken advantage of their £28 dim sum set lunch for 2. Cake and dim sum were all excellent, especially the Cale - good balance of sweet, rich, and tart. 
Service is the only detriment at this otherwise very good dining establishment.",1
3,"I was looking forward to this meal due to the strong reviews...However I was disappointed. To start, I ordered the grilled figs with blue cheese and mint. The figs were neither grilled nor was there mint. In fact the figs were raw and cold. For my main entree, I ordered their honey glazed duck with red wine jus. While the flavors were good, the duck was way over cooked by French standards. If you order the duck you must you must clarify that you want it medium rare.",-1
1,"Came here after recently seeing Jay Rayner live, where he recommended Four Seasons in London, in particular because it apparently has the best roast duck in the entire UK.
Arrived here with no booking, but the place wasn't too busy, so they directed us to go and take a seat upstairs.
So off we popped, upstairs, into what can only be described as a storage area of the restaurant that just so happened to have some tables and chairs sitting about in it. 
Not a great impression, but we were there for the food, willing to sit in any condition to taste this supposedly incredible duck.
It arrived luke warm, there was a LOT of fat (I know duck is very fatty, but this was a bit much), the skin was just soft and limp, the duck itself was moist and very tasty but unfortunately this didn't make up for the rest of the failings.
Not cheap either! 
Wouldn't recommend. Terrible service, terrible atmosphere if you're sitting upstairs, not great food, go elsewhere.",-1
3,"Looking for a rough and ready Chinese served at lightning speed at rock bottom prices? Hit up Wong Kei. 
Having gained a (somewhat deserved) reputation for its scornful staff slamming down your dishes, disappointingly, it wasn't the case this time. They were fine - not friendly exactly but civil. 
Although, we were smelling distance from the toilets. Oh, and one of our tea cups had a faint lipstick stain smeared on it. 
But, hang on a sec because there're some good points too. The food is tasty. And it's dead cheap. Like £5.50 for a huge plate of heartwarming crispy noodles, tender beef and crunchy pak choi.
For that price, I'd almost expect a bit of old lippy on the crockery. 
Give it a go, if you dare - an essential London experience.",-1
1,"I ate at this restaurant and it was not good, the butter chicken was not creamy. I have eaten at many different Indian restaurants and trust me this one is not good",-1
3,"Wong Kei was ... eh ... OK to me.  The food indeed was authentic Chinese food, but for a restaurant in Chinatown, I was expecting more.  On our recent short trip to the UK, our first day in London, we walked all over the place.  by 4 PM in the afternoon, we were starving, having only had small snacks up until that point.  We rushed to Chinatown and decided to give Wong Kei a try.
We ordered half a crispy duck, wonton soup, pork and preserved egg congee, and a beef hue fen (stir fried thick noodle with beef).  The duck was a bit over cooked, but still got good flavors.  It came with pancakes, shredded cucumber and scallion to make your own duck wrap.
The congee was a very big size.  I was thinking it would be just a small bowl.  It was decent.  The beef hue fen was my favorite out of everything we ordered.  It has that 'big wok' smokey taste and the beef was very tender.  Our least favorite was the wonton soup.  The soup and the wonton filling were both bland.  
The price was decent, the food was decent... so it was A-OK for me.",-1
4,"One day as I got back from visiting my family in France, I realized right off the Eurostar that I had no food at home and had forgotten to place a tesco delivery. I was starving and decided I wanted dumplings and nothing else so I embarked on a Yelp journey to find good dumplings in my neighborhood. Alex's review of Ping Pong was a good enough insurance for me so I ordered various dumplings from Ping Pong on Deliveroo. Literally just dumplings. 
The delivery came fast and the dumplings were really good. I had a nice assortment of which i can't remember the composition exactly (that review has been waiting for me for a long time now oops). The dumplings came with nice sauces to accompany it. 
I'm sorry I can't write more as I didn't get the full restaurant experience, but I'd definitely try one oof their restaurant if I get the chance.",1
3,"To commemorate my last night in town, I wanted to find an especially wonderful restaurant. We've had quite a bit of scrumptious food, so there was a lot to live up to. After taking into account all the advice from Yelp and various other sites, I selected this Covent Garden French eatery. Supposedly the BEST French restaurant in all of London, I was told. Perhaps even the best restaurant of any cuisine in London.
Puh-lease. This place isn't even the best restaurant on this STREET. 
I had booked weeks in advance and we got put in the cave of the upstairs private room. Those wanting to dine in the lovely conservatory be warned - specify on your reservation.
To their credit, my tomato salad was delicate and ripe. My dining companion's scallops were perfectly cooked. Our entrees, on the other hand, were mediocre at best. Nearly ""inedible"" tagiatelle and beef that was anything but gourmet. 
The service was slow but our waitress was good natured, if not taken aback by the fact that we didn't come close to finishing our dishes.
We booked it out of there and luckily caught a window at our favorite restaurant for dessert. (see Scott's Restaurant)",-1
1,"My experience here wasn't great. Very bad service, noisy. The food good but very expensive according the general value of the rest. Not really worth the high prices I don't think. Would have been better off going to another restaurant I think!",-1
4,"One of my favourite places in Soho. The ambience is average and it is usually quite crowded. However, the food is delish and never disappoints. There is nothing I wouldn't recommend from the menu. Definitely worth a visit.",1
4,"I only went for treats and cocktails. Both of which where awesome, relaxed atmosphere and yummy teas. Worth a visit on the treat trail!",1
2,"Why did they bring us all the dishes at the same time :-@ !!!!!!!!
I could never ever understand!!!!! I've never experienced such a restaurant in Japan.
Something like Dim Sum which is considered that that served warm are the best way of eating should be always served one by one. Never ever all at once.
Is this just the difference of our custom?! If so...  I should've told that when I ordered. OK I will from now on then. 
Anyway.... when it comes to the taste, (I ordered SHARING SELECTION FOR 2)
Only 'crab and prawn dumplings' and 'honeyed chili chicken&mushroom rice' were tasty. The others were ...... I wouldn't want to eat them. But I really liked this chicken rice. It was flavorful. full of Chinese soup taste.So I rated 2 stars.
Sorry again but I was sooooooo shocked that they brought them at the same time........  :-()",-1
5,"I should get two points for this place, because i went to both locations on consecutive nights.  Yes it is that good.  Yes i am that addicted, committed to the dumpling.  This place is chic, modern and dark and swanky.  It is crowded at night on a weekend.  The cocktail menu is extensive and after having quite a few all were amazing.  I tried to compare the lichee martini to nobus and it may have won.  It is such a weird dichotomy...ancient london street, quintessentially narrow and cobble-stoned...then you walk into this modern chinese food mecca and are accosted, though pleasantly by the smell of incense.   The dumplings, short ribs and crispy duck rolls are all amazing.  The shrimp dumplings a favorite.  And at the end when you go to leave...there are three people holding an umbrella over your head while they hail you a cab...please...its midnight, my curls came out ages ago but I'm flattered...and i will be back...",1
5,"Great place for a romantic dinner. We arrived a little underdressed as we had been out for a day of sightseeing and didn't have time to get back to our hotel and change. No one balked at our attire. Instead, the politely took our coats and seated us in a cozy room with a fireplace that was much welcomed by us after a day in the rain.
We both ordered the tasting menu and I had the paired wines. Before each course was presented, the wine steward presented the bottle at the table and explained a bit about the wine as well as their reasons for choosing it to compliment the dish.
The scallops were perfectly cooked-- deliciously seared on the outside. Foie gras with pear and this crispy little semi sweet cookie was out of this world and paired with a Gewurtztraminer from Washington. Lamb chops were succulent and they brought an amazing cheese course with four fabulous cheeses, crackers and quince jam. Dessert was a molten chocolate cake... so gooey and delicious, served with a Sauterne!? It was heavenly!
Service was a little stiff but wonderfully efficient and informative.
The tasting menu was great value, I won't confess to know what the bill was since my boyfriend paid-- I know it wasn't cheap-- but the quality and presentation were outstanding. Coupled with the fabulously cozy and romantic decor, it made for a wonderful evening.
I would recommend this restaurant to couples--possibly small family gatherings. It's definitely an intimate environment. I think a large group would be better off to book a private room here.
We would happily return to Clos Maggiore the next time we are in London.",1
3,"Dimsum offers taste so great but are very expensive. Rating it 3star just because of the price but if you don't mind the money, i recommend this restaurant.",-1
3,"A gorgeous backdrop and ambience as you enter for sure, however overall we were a bit disappointed that the service didn't live up to the expectations set.
Had a nice table in what used to be the ""reading room"", which offered a nice intimate setting.  We split the butter chicken for two and the dish was fantastic.  All the right blends of spices and creaminess you'd hope for.  The black daal was great, as other reviews have called out, and the naan was slightly above average as far as naan goes.  
The letdown was the service.  It was very disjointed (asking us as we sat down what we wanted to drink, then waiting about half an hour to cme back to take or food order) and on multiple occasions different waitstaff asked us the same question someone had just asked a couple minutes ago.  The price seemed justified for the location and the food, but factoring in the service it seemed a bit overpriced.
Improve the service and this turns into a 4-4.5 star experience, but as-is, an overall average experience",-1
5,"Bussssssssssssiiiiii ! 
This place was packed! Not just packed it is packed paxked ! The queue is extended to outside of the door.
Credit to the ramen really!!!! Springy and hearty! And the broth was soooupppper nice and dense and the ingredients, the braided slice pork and the slightly runny eggs were perfect match with the broth and ramen ! 
They also have this bib thing where you can wear to prevent the juiciness of the ramen spread on your coat. Gimmick ! 
Overall nice food and hipster-y environment",1
3,"Not my favorite ramen spot. Was pretty over priced for ramen. I had the to tonkatsu ramen and the broth was pretty good, chashu and noodles were just ok. It's the most expensive ramen I've ever had- I expected more from an £11 ramen. The venue is ok - quite small - not many tables and a lot of bar seating facing a wall. The service wasn't great either, took about 10 mins to get water. It seems like a popular place to hang out later in the evening as it got really crowded.",-1
4,"This is a very trendy restaurant to go and be seen. I didn't see any celebrities (though my British celebrity knowledge isn't that great) but this is definitely somewhere you can expect to see a sighting. A guest list lady is at the door, don't even think of walking up without a reservation (unless by chance you are a celebrity reading this awesome Yelp review) and I hear that tables often need to be booked quite well in advance. The ambiance and decor is trendy and reminds me of the upmarket restaurants that are adjoined to Las Vegas nightclubs. The food was good but tbh not as spectacular as you'd think given the high price - I think you are very much paying for the wealthy and fashionable vibe rather than the quality of the food. If you want to impress your significant other with a trendy night on the town this is a good place to start or if you're a tourist consider this as a good example of a fashionable London restaurant.",1
3,"My hubby really wanted Indian food in London, and our first choice was Dishoom, but when we got there we saw it was closed for renovations (we probably should've checked the website in advance...), so we quickly scrambled and found Punjab. There was a 20 minute wait, and the little wait area is so tiny and crowded. We moved around as people came and went (it was raining outside, duh, so couldn't wait there), after the time passed we were seated at a table upstairs. The restaurant is huge and it was packed. 
My hubby really wanted to try some stuff he doesn't see on menus in the US, and he did, I can't remember what it was that he ordered though (something very spicy), but he really liked it! We also ordered samosas, naan, chicken tikka masala, some veggies, and rice since it did not come with the meat dishes, weird. The food was good! The flavors were very authentic and tasty, the naan was delicious! The service was ok, I kept having to ask for water, which seems to be on par for London (I had to basically beg for refills everywhere!) but overall this place was pretty good! We definitely left quite full!",-1
5,"Great atmosphere  interesting set up inside  if you're in a small group don't be surprised if you are sat on a bigger table with strangers. There was 4 of us, sat on a table with 2 ladies and a couple. The tables are so big though that you don't feel like you're imposing on anyone or vice versa.
The food is great  a good range, soups, noddles, dim sum and very helpful staff to explain the process of ordering etc.
Each dim sum dish is usually a portion of 3 dumplings. There are set menus for those who are new to the idea of dim sum and have no clue what to order. The set menu for one comes in at just under £10 and you have a good variety of dumplings and tasty morsels provided within that!
I have been twice to this particular Ping Pong, I haven't tried any others in the chain. I am very impressed and it is great if you are on a budget as all items are priced fairly cheaply.",1
5,"I used to frequent Wong Kei Restaurant while living in London.  The restaurant serves good size authentic food.  The waiters tend to be borderline obnoxious at times.  The place is normally overflowing with patrons.  When I visit for lunch on my own, I normally will be seated next to someone else due to lack of space.
The prices are affordable, not a tourist in sight and the rudeness of the staff is, for the most part, simply hysterical.",1
2,"I love dim sum. Love it. Tasty pockets of deliciousness (think I just ripped off Ping Pong's slogan there) what's not to like? Well, Ping Pong's baked 'Pork Puff' that's what's not to like. This was the first dish to arrive to our table and it was essentially a mini sausage roll that someone had poured honey onto. Sickly sweet and unpleasant, it did not fill me with high hopes about the rest of the meal.
Fortunately, this was as bad as it got and although the Soft Shell Crab was greasy, all three of the steamed dim sum we chose were delicious. The service was very quick and efficient but I resented the waitress encouraging us to over order. Three to four dim sum each seemed a bit over the top and these dishes weren't cheap. In fact, being a big fan of dim sum I noticed that these prices were at least a pound more than anything you would pay in China town. Ok, you get to sit in sleek surroundings and sip cocktails but frankly I prefer my dim sum with a little more character and would rather sit in some weird Chinese back room restaurant than have another watery 'Lychee and roses' cocktail for £6!",-1
4,"High end beautiful dim sum restaurant. Very fancy and pricy for dim sum in London but quite delicious and surprisingly the few dishes I had tasted authentic. I was expecting it to be westernized since it's not like your typical dim sum restaurant. 
I went solo so couldn't order too many things thus just got a few classics.
- steamed pork buns : pork was good mix of sweet and savory and the buns are nicely filled with the pork, they didn't skimp on the filling. It was slightly oversteamed but the taste was still really yummy.
- scallop and pork siu Mai : unlike traditional siu Mai, the scallop wasn't dried it was a fresh one! Probably why it was so expensive for just 3 pieces. I prefer the cheaper version with dried scallop but this was also quite tasty. 
- Xiao long bao(pork soup buns) : the wrapper is thicker than I usually prefer it but the taste of the soup and pork were on point! 
Overall really good experience, great service and ambiance. Heard their cocktails are worth trying as well. Will have to come back with a bunch of people to try more dishes!",1
5,"By a happy accident, I ended up here on my last night in London. After trying a place close by with an insane wait, my group was fortunate to stumble upon a free table at exactly the right time. 
Usually when I think of dim sim, I think of carts coming by or offering delicious, but often unsophisticated looking dumplings and buns. Yauatcha is a dim sum restaurant that made me feel like a grownup (and that is not something that I say lightly). 
The dishes here were excellent. My group and I ate about 8-10 plates between us, and each item was fantastic. The char siu buns were steamed to perfection. The shrimp and bean curd cheng du...I could have eaten like three plates of that. The dumplings (considering I had about 3 different kinds) were all inhaled. And the turnip cake was the best turnip cake in the history of turnip cakes. 
The plates are small, but shareable with about 3-4 pieces per dumpling and buns. Topping off our meal with some delicious sake made the entire experience complete.
I felt a little out of place with my jeans here, and had I known this is where we were going to end up, I would have opted for something dressier. 
The wait staff and FOH managers were very accommodating, and would check up on us often. Or suggest another delicious dish for our meal.
So many stars. I'm sad I had to stop at five. This place was one of the best meals that I have ever had.",1
4,"We went on Sunday... After me not being there for 2 years. Much different vibe on a Sunday afternoon versus a Friday night during much better times! I was pleasantly surprised with the families there. Sure its not authentic dining but I am one for a beautifully designed restaurant, excellent service and yummy food which this one does. I think our waitress persuaded us to order a little too much, which we were happy to eat but still a little too much. Duck salad and prawn toast very recommended. What I have been doing there for the last year is buying their sweet macaroons as hostess gifts, they look great and the packaging is original.",1
3,Learned of Bone Daddies on IG and figured I would give it a shot while I was in London. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which is typically what I order when first trying a ramen shop. The ramen noodles where good but nothing amazing the broth was thick but I didn't find the flavor I know and love. When I go back to London I would stop by again and try something else on the menu as well as grab a couple bottle of Asahi Super Dry Black so good!,-1
5,"Clos Maggiore is one of my favourite restaurants in London. I've been back several times, each time.. bringing a different group of friends - service and food has not disappointed me once.
 In terms of French cuisine, Clos Maggiore consistently whips out exquisite concoctions that whet one's appetite
 I've always gone for the pre-theatre menu (best value on Sundays where it's 3 courses at £19.50 with no limit on early time slots), but even then, each course served on this reduced price menu is impressive and unforgettable.
 The forcacia bread is one of my favourites try it!
 The restaurant is always full, so booking is essential. In fact, do not be surprised if you're told that they are full and you have to make a pre-booking for another date.",1
5,"My favorite restaurant in London!! Yauatcha tends to draw mixed reactions from people, but the great majority agree: Yauatcha rocks!!
My absolute favorite dishes are the Shark's fin Hot & Sour Soup (just the thought of it makes my glands flow), the Shitake & Duck Roll, the Spinach Cube (stunning. stunning.), and the hand pulled noodles with shimeji mushrooms. Give me three of each of these and I'm happy and stuffed.
Bear in mind, this is not a traditional dim sum or high street chinese restaurant. The dishes are, for the most part, variations of the oldies. A lot of the dim-sum dishes would be familiar to you, but this is a menu worth taking time over and trying as many of those that appeal to you. Chances are you won't be disappointed with the flavors of the dishes. The ingredients are obviously of the highest quality and kitchen consistently produces the same high standard every time we've been there. 
Added to which the restaurant (downstairs) has a very smooth decor; subtle, warm and inviting. The bathrooms are pretty slick too...
Be sure to try the delicious teas (white tea... mmm-MMM!).",1
3,"Hmm, maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The chicken, Pimms, and the staff were fine, maybe I was a little too American or something. The upstairs was very pleasant, and the downstairs looked like a cool place to hang out if you had a large group. Had some Pernod because it felt like the right thing to do. Will def go back but not really in a hurry. Booking via the OpenTable widget above was lovely.",-1
2,"I was not impressed with the broth. I don't see the big fuss with this ramen joint. Perhaps I've been spoilt with excellent ramen places in California and have eaten legit ramen in Tokyo, I just do not see this place deserving a 4 to 5 stars. The broth was just too fatty, I think they just add a chunk of butter to compensate real fat flavor from pork bones. I almost puked after eating from here. I don't see the big hype about this place to be honest, I definitely would not line up and pay for an overpriced bowl of ramen. No thanks.",-1
3,"Extremely overrated and I am shocked at all the glowing reviews. This Indian food was fine. In a city with a lot of good Indian food I didn't think it stood out at all. The restaurant is enormous. The service was very good, can't fault em for that. In fact overall Dishoom was totally decent, but I would never tell someone this is a must-go spot. If you're gonna wait for something special in London, I'd go to Hoppers.",-1
2,"There's a reason why it's so hard to get a booking at Zuma and yet it's so easy at nobu...
It didn't start well. We were a group of 3, there were a fair few tables empty and yet we were given a tight tiny table for 2. I refused such a bad table and was given a proper sized table.
Service was terrible, slow and quite frankly useless from start to end. 
At an early evening booking, how do you run out of the rib eye steak? Or that there was no Sauvignon blanc by the glass? That's pretty poor.
Anyway, had the tacos, nothing particularly special. A selection of sushi and sashimi, decent taste with the fish as expected, the rice in the sushi was not the best made, fell off too,easily.
The shrimp tempura was fine, but Zuma is another level, much nicer, they serve the whole shrimp in a much better batter. The asparagus tempura was fine, bit greasy, slightly too thick hence they were still a bit hard to break on the end pieces.
I had ordered rice to come with the miso cod which was next. That rice never came so fish by itself, as tasty as the fish is, you need something else with it. Very disappointing.
Finally the last course of tenderloin steak with rice finally. That was cooked rare perfectly and hat a spicy kick to it that worked. 
Dessert was just green tea ice cream and petite fours. Was ok.
At the end they apologized for the slow/lacking service and gave the dessert free of charge but quite frankly 
, it shouldn't have been that bad.
The service needs to improve. Zuma will stay number 1 by miles in my book.",-1
1,"Service is horrible!!! 
Yelp said they close at midnight but when we walked in at 10:45 they said they close in 15 minutes and we can only order off the ramen menu but no sides... they seated 4 other parties besides us and gave everyone else a menu but my boyfriend and I literally had to wave down a server to get a menu. 
The ramen came out fast which is good and it was delicious.
However when the check came they had the audacity to add service charge to the check without my consent. Coming from America I know to tip!! The service charge was a huge turn off not to forget to mention illegal!!!!",-1
3,"I sit down and am promptly ignored until Meg comes in. The vibe is very French bistro and a bit like Lucien in NYC which used to be our favourite place for a mildly celebratory dinner so that's good. The restaurant is crowded but unlike a crowded NYC restaurant you aren't putting your elbows in your neighbour's soup.
 Tiny paper napkins and diner-standard flatware/glasses are all that's on the table. Meg arrives, we get the menus, and order drinks. We get glasses of tap water, which are never refilled, and a bottle of chenin blanc which turns out to be a 2008 from Long Beach winery in South Africa. This is a little sweet, but very nice - I like it a lot. The bread is pretty plain-jane white bread, but it has poppy seeds on the outside which make it better than expected.
 Meg has Tian au Crabe which is described on the menu as Tian of crab and avocado emulsion. What is a tian? We don't know which seems as good a reason as any to order it. It turns out to be something like crab salad. Meg seems to enjoy it.
 I have Chevre Chaud, grilled goat's cheese with fresh leaf salad and basil pesto. This is quite good although I think rather too heavy on the goat cheese and not heavy enough on the pesto as it's a little dry. The salad is nothing special and in fact I was hoping for more leaves. Weirdly, I guess, I'm asking for them to have more of the cheap ingredients in this dish.
 For mains, Meg gets Supreme de Poulet Roti - roast breast of chicken, garlic mash, green peppercorn. She seems to like it. I have Filet de Loup de Mer - sea bass with cauliflower puree, raisins, and chili lemon zest. Everything individually is good but they don't seem to go together that well.
 And that's it. We're tired, Meg seems to be coming down with something, so we skip out after just over an hour for under 40GBP. A great deal, convenient, decent food. We'll definitely be back.",-1
2,"I did a bit of research and many claim that this is one of the best ramen places in London. I don't understand the hype for this place. Did I order the wrong thing? Come at the wrong time? Maybe it's because I came here half an hour before it closed... Anyways, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. Pretty standard. The broth was good and that's to be expected because it's advertised as a 20 hour pork bone broth. The egg was pretty good too. The noodles were too firm for my taste and was kind of cold... The bamboo shoots and wood ear fungus were also kind of cold. The lukewarm broth didn't really help either. Service was okay. Overall a pretty mediocre place.",-1
3,"this was really disappointing for a Michelin star restaurant. 
venison puffs were good at first, but then too rich towards the end. 
pan-fried turnip cake were THE BEST of the evening. i really liked them alot. 
duck rolls were okay, not too much flavors in there. the sauce would've greatly improved it, but it was way too sweet. 
duck pumpkin puffs were aesthetically really cool, but wasn't a ""wow-er""
lobster dim sum- eh... not seasoned enough. 
crystal dumplings with pine nuts- okay, nothign amazing. but this could've been my fault b/c i thought it would have shrimp in it and it didnt. 
service also wasn't really great, not very attentive and ALL the dessert that i wanted to try was out. it was really disappointing.",-1
1,"Although greeted and served by very friendly staff, we found the food ever so disappointing, despite hearing great things about Balthazar London. 
Crammed in between very noisy small, darkly lit tables, our food came out suspiciously fast - within two minutes of ordering. 
The spinach in my eggs florentine was wet, bland and a rather small portion, definitely not worth £13.50, for a bit of bread, veg and hardly any sauce. Sadly nothing special, overpriced and overrated. I could definitely think of better places for brunch in London.",-1
4,"Ping Pong has always looked so stylish from the outside so I was excited to go in and try the food.
Ordering can be a bit tricky, as you are called to fill out a form with all the items on the menu. We were four people and 3 of us went for the set menu so when the items started arriving it took a while for us to figure out which one belonged to what menu and explain to the waitress she would have to tell us what was what.
The food itself was very satisfying, I particularly enjoyed the fried selection  but the dumplings and vegetables were quite nice too. The black tea was a bit bitter but full of flavour so I enjoyed that without needing to add any sugar.
I felt quite full after that meal but the guys in the group (the other two set menus) did mention they could still eat more so you may want to keep that in mind and order a couple more dishes. I'd say ordering lots of things and sharing would be the best option.
In general it was a lovely place for a midweek lunch with my team and I hope we go back again.",1
5,"Ding Dong, it's time for Ping Pong.
 Being a very simple lad i've always tended to end up in some greasy curry house whenever anyone has suggested Dim Sum to me before. But hey i was on the south bank and thought lets be cultural
 Really enjoyed it, it was stupidly busy but a bit of chat with the waitress and we managed to get sat in the upstairs bit almost straight away, i think it is better up there if you get the choice as it's a bit more private and you feel like you are somewhere slightly more exclusive (you aren't, you're on the Thames in a chain Dim Sum)
 Food was delicious, the cocktails looked great and the service was with a smile, in fact I seemed to be being served by about 20 different people, all with a smile.
 Ding Dong",1
3,"I'm a big fan of Balthazar in New York, so was over to the moon to hear one had opened in Covent Garden. While the look and feel of the restaurant is similar to the original in NYC, it's lacking a little something that I can't quite put my finger on.   While the food is nice, it can be a little bland - the burger for example, at £17 you'd hope for something with a little more pizzazz. But it's a cute little stop off if you fancy grabbing a coffee and one of their lovely pastries. You can sit in a little area by the bar, do some people watching, not break the bank.   The real winner here is the bread & desserts (not at the same time) - which I know may sound odd, but it's certainly one to try. The Pavlova is lovely.",-1
4,"First of all, if you're coming to Dishoom for dinner (particularly on the weekend), be prepared to wait! Saturdays and Sundays after 7pm, expect an 1hr - 1hr 1/2 wait at a minimum. Luckily, while you wait outside, the wait staff offers complimentary refreshments such as sherry or lemonade, which definitely makes the wait more bearable! Inside, you wait at the bar for additional time during which you can order drinks or starters. 
I started with Pau Bhaji - a mashed veggie mix served with two buttered buns. It was tasty but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture, which was a bit thin for my taste. 
Not long after I finished I was seated at my table, which happened to be downstairs. Unsurprisingly, with a place this busy they try to fit in as many tables as possible, but it certainly didn't feel crammed. I ordered the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and some garlic naan. Despite how busy the place was, the food came rather quickly. 
Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed at first glance! The portion size was small, and was served with a pittance of vegetables. That said, it was absolutely delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The naan wasn't quite as fluffy as I'd have liked, it was a tad over-grilled.
For dessert I had Memsahib's Mess, which includes fresh cream, strawberries, and crushed meringues.  I found the cream to be really heavy in the dessert and would have liked it to have been more whipped as to provide a little more contrast with the crunch of the meringue. 
I'm sure I'll return, but probably with a bigger group. Dishoom is definitely a better place for a group with whom to share and be loud than for an intimate dining experience.",1
2,"Its more flash than bang, as trendy Indian places go. The lines are too long and the food does not merit the wait. However the ambience is great and the cocktails are great. The interior decor evokes the Irani/Parsi restaurants one used to find in Bombay.",-1
3,"UPSTAIRS! Yells the wait staff for a bunch of tourists who are apparently here for the insults and terrible service. Wong Kei reminds me of a place back in San Francisco where a very famous waiter (Edsel Ford Fung of Sam Wo Restaurant) would insult unsuspecting patrons for not tipping, spit in people's food, and slamming food on the table.
I figured with the curt treatment the place is a cheap, no frills, get in and GTFO kind of place the moment I stepped in. I didn't even need to read the Yelp reviews to know that I'm going here just for the food and not fancy table service. As soon as I enter, the waiter acknowledges me and tells me to share a table downstairs. Not even seconds later I'm asked if I know what I want. I politely asked for a menu and was given one instantly. That probably my first mistake. You should already know what you want. They run a very tight ship here and I was put on the spot like on the episode of Seinfeld where the Soup Nazi was scolding patrons for taking too long in the soup line and sent to the back for not following his rules. I settled on the roast duck noodle soup and it came faster than you can say, ""Long live the queen"". The food was delicious, the service was meh. The locals seem to come here a lot and don't mind. I really didn't mind since I've experience much worst service in the past. 
The prices here are so ridiculously cheap that you're getting a great deal. There is no service charge and VAT is already included. Cash only!",-1
4,"Clos Maggiore in Covent Garden had excellent service and good food, apart from slightly tough lamb. Waiting staff remembered mention of birthday celebrations without having to be reminded on the day - candle in dessert and happy birthday was a nice touch. Also, conservatory is lovely (and romantic), but if you sit near the fire place you get a cold blast of air. Overall, enjoyed another great meal at Clos Maggiore and we will be visiting again soon.",1
2,"They used to have more vegetarian/vegan dumpling options on the a la carte menu. While they offer more on the vegetarian combination meal, they do not offer most of them on the regular menu).",-1
3,"Having been in London for a few months now upon writing this review, I must start off by saying that I've really fallen in love with the Indian cuisine offered in the city, however, as a result, I'm beginning to grow a bit more critical when reviewing Indian as I learn to understand it better.
To start off, Punjab provides customers with a great atmosphere for dining.  Located right at the end of Neal Street in Covent Garden, Punjab is a great place to go after a bit of shopping or after work.  Additionally, the service is absolutely fantastic, with quick and funny waiters who are more then willing to help should you find yourself in a bind as to what dish to have (and you will!)
As for the food, however, Punjab falls just a tad bit short when taking into consideration that you'll likely pay around 12 pounds if you get a dish with rice and naan.  The serving sizes are a tad bit small (certainly too small to split) for what you pay, and having sampled a bit from the dishes of those around me, I found that the seasoning was pretty much the same even with dishes that were drastically different from one another.  
If you're in it for the atmosphere, Punjab is a great choice, but if you're really trying to get the best bang for your buck I might consider looking elsewhere.",-1
4,"Had a very good martini at the bar to start. Four stars for the food leaning towards five. Really really good pau bhaji, awesome masala prawns, lamb biryani, and garlic naan. Our server was ok, but definitely distracted at times. I can see how a busier time could cause problems as the servers seemed to lose interest in existing tables. The little spiel at the beginning about these are tapas and you should order 4 or 5 dishes for two people is a joke as three and naan is a pretty good amount of food.
Liked the atmosphere and music, very chill and inviting. Will definitely return.",1
4,"We live almost literally across the street, so excited to have this in the neighborhood.  They're having a soft opening this week, so any bumps were easily excused (not that there were many).  I've also been to the one in Soho.  
It's good.  Everything is very tasty.  But almost every dish seems to go for the REALLY REALLY BIG FLAVOUR so dinner is a bit of an exercise in endurance.  The whole lamb shank is expensive (and was too salty) but there's a good concept in there.  The lamb chops were good (but not as good as Tayabs).  Daal was delish.  Paneer was fine.  The three or four other dishes were worthy.  Very impressed with some of the more unusual desserts.
But there's also something that bothers me about how high concept it is.  I'm convinced it was started by two Goldman bankers from India here in the UK who came up with a concept they could replicate in Qatar, NY and Rio.  
But tasty nonetheless.  And half off during this week's soft launch!
UPDATE:  I WAS WRONG ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS.  FOUNDER IS EX-BAIN.",1
5,"I have been a big fan of ramen soup since my trip to Japan a few years back. Since then I tried many of the shops and restaurants in London and there are some decent eateries out there, but this one is my new favorite. The menu is simple with a good range of ramen plus some rather nice side dishes. We had a spicy version and a normal meat version and both very delicious. I have to say that the broth was amazing. So full of flavour with a near silky texture ... it was pure pleasure. The ingredients of the soup were also very nice, with eggs, which were still a bit gooey in the middle and meat which was very tender and nicely seasoned. I haven't eaten such nice ramen in absolutely ages. 
I will definitely go again ... and bring all my friends with me.",1
3,"Edamame was tasty as it normally is, and the broccoli was really good - cooked in a dashi broth with small pieces of fried tofu - it was served cold, which was surprisingly nice. The sushi was all fresh and the nigiri were a good size. They give you free green tea with your meal as well, and in Japanese fashion, they don't accept tips (anything extra you leave behind goes to a homeless charity). There's also no tuna on the sushi menu as they refuse to serve any unsustainable fish. This part of town is full of little Japanese restaurants but this is one of the best I've been to - it's not fancy inside but the service is friendly, fish is fresh and it's pretty moderately priced for sushi.",-1
1,"Stood next to hotel concierge while he talked with Cinnamon Club and obtained confirmed reservations.  Later that evening, the restaurant called the concierge to state that they had no availability.  How can you confirm a reservation and then unconfirm it?  The restaurant manager had no explanation when asked.",-1
3,"I was there several times with friends of mine.We enjoy our meals every time.They are very good at cooking one of the tastiest dishes ever.You should try the duck meat,for sure:)
If you are going there for the first time-be prepared that the atmosphere is kind of unusual.For me,personally,the atmosphere when I step inside was like I am entering a night club.May be this was an effect of the dramatic dark wooden decor. But when you get used to it..you will enjoy it :)",-1
5,"DIM SUM fans your temple awaits, on wandering Londons soho we came across this gem after making good our escape from a cutpurse loitering in the quieter parts of Soho, which was lucky for him as we were not the lost tourist fodder he took us for. On entering the ground floor we were shown downstairs to our table. The decor is an ultra modern take on Buddist calm, hundreds of pin point lights in the ceiling and candles in recesses in walls. The food? simply the best I have tasted, prepared by artisan chefs, and as fresh as you'll find anywhere, particular favorites are the venison dumplings, although the whole menu is mouth watering and making your choice is not easy, so allow time to enjoy and savor the experience. Being in Soho, as one would expect, the waiters are groomed and runway thin, and the service is attentive and informed. Love it. Bill: £150 inc drinks, two covers.",1
4,"A Michelin starred dim sum joint is worth a visit for no other fact than it is what it is.
The food is incredible - better than any dim sum I've had in the US...disclaimer, though, that I live in East TN and most of our asian food options are ""fast"".  Between my time in Houston, DC, and San Fran, though, the dim sum here best all in the places I've lived.
Their signature is the shrimp and bean curd cheun fun - and worth every bite.  Every other dumpling we had was awesome...the edamame truffle stands out, as well.  Least favorite on the list for both of us was the wagyu beef dumpling - skip it.
The vibe is totally cool and the architecture/design is modern and slick.
The only negative was the seating - I felt like I was sitting at desk chairs at my daughter's elementary school.  Both my wife and I ended up curling our feet underneath the chairs/booth, which was both awkward and uncomfortable.  Fortunately, though, the quality of the food combined with a Suntory whisky or two and some sake we had eased the discomfort.",1
4,"We had a delightful lunch here in November. The bread basket full of home-made rolls was generously offered and the lobster and crab soup was a triumph with accompanying mozzarella bites. The main course of red mullet was professionally executed and the service was attentive. 
We sat near the door as we forgot to ask to sit in the conservatory on booking, but the ambience was still good.",1
4,"Lovely ambience! Delicious! Price is right. Chai is spicy and yummy. Lamb raan too-- so flavorful! I have zero complaints, but I highly recommend coming for lunch so you can make a reservation. It can get packed at night with long waits. Request an outdoor table, if possible. Such a cute little patio area",1
4,"When I visited London, I obviously wanted to try cuisines that the city was known for. In other words, what kind of food do I eat when in London? You know...ones I can't find in the US? So I made a basic list: English breakfast, Indian food, Fish and Chips.
For Indian food, I decided to try Dishoom. I was informed by my friend that anyone who visits London to check out Dishoom. So...I did. I yelped it and was supremely excited to see lots of positive reviews. As such, we headed out to Dishoom in Shoreditch for dinner that night. 
Reservations are recommended to guarantee a table, otherwise I highly suggest you arrive early. Remember, Shoreditch is where the techies work so there's lots of people in the area. We went at 6pm and we were lucky to snag a table. But around 7-8pm, there was a long queue to get in. Dishoom's reputation definitely lived up to the hype for being a well known establishment.
Ambience is quite lovely. The place had a very tavern feel to it; clean and professional. The employees were very nice and friendly. They greeted us formally as we walked in. It was, however, a bit dark but the lighting made it very exciting and appealing. We were seated downstairs which looked like a basement where you house and age wine. It was dope.
Our waitress was very kind, attentive and responsive. Most importantly, she was well informed about the menu. She fielded all our questions and made key recommendations. 
For my drink, I ordered their very own Dishoom IPA. It wasn't too bitter, and actually surprisingly smooth. Lighter than the usual IPA but I liked it.
For appetizers were ordered Pau Bhaji, Lamb Samosas, and Dishoom Calamari.
OK THE PAU BHAJI was the BEST dish from my entire experience. The waitress recommended this and I was extremely pleased by it. It's a bowl of mashed vegetables with hella butter and they give you homemade buns to eat with. Absolutely tasty and delicious. This is a must order here. Also, it's a Bombay thing, so try it to fully immerse yourself in the Dishoom experience. 
Lamb Samosas - I'm not a big fan of lamb, but it was very well spiced and delicious. Point is, I enjoyed it despite disliking the taste of lamb.
Dishoom Calamari - it was ok. Tasted like any other calamari dish I've had. A tiny bit disappointed here but not big deal.
For our main courses, we ordered Murgh Malai, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Masala Prawns, House Black Daal, and Chicken Berry Britannia. 
Murgh Malai - It was cooked very properly, but wasn't flavorful. It was ok, not bad.
Dishoom Chicken Tikka - A bit disappointed because I had better Chicken Tikka, but still good. Not amazingly good.
Masala Prawns - Grilled well, tasted good, needs a bit more seasoning. 
House Black Daal - Dishooms signature dish. Very well made and unique consistency in terms of texture. I liked it very much. My 2nd favorite dish next to the Pau Bhaji. Must order.
Chicken Berry Britannia - Had well chosen mix of spices but I was disappointed because it was drier than what I was used to. Spices were well played though. 
Would I come back? Absolutely! I would also recommend this place to anyone visiting London. They have to stop by and check it out.",1
4,"The food is not bad, but their focus is more ambiance and atmosphere which is nothing wrong.  :)
If I want to get good/authentic dim sum/yum cha, then I would rather go to Royal China.  But if I want to enjoy some cocktails with friends and maybe some dim sum munches, then I would come here.",1
3,"Classic Indian fare using fresh tasty ingredients for a premium. Perhaps the cost is to cover the rose petal covered tables and brightly coloured hats on the walls. The vibrant decor and friendly service make for a delightful dining experience.  That said, nothing about our meal really stood out and I most likely won't be returning here.",-1
3,"I went with one of my friends when visiting the South Bank Christmas market and was pleasantly surprised by Ping Pong. This is certainly a chain that I'd visit again - the food is fine and I especially love that you can mix and match - and share - different dishes. 
We went for steamed buns with vegetables, dumplings with shrimps and chive, dumplings with shrimps and coriander, dumplings with vegetables, spring rolls with vegetables, sticky rice with vegetables, and shrimp crackers.
The concept is that you fill out on the order card with all your favourites, hand it to the waiter so he can pass your order to the kitchen. Then the waiter returns with your order form, and as the food is prepared and arrives steaming hot to your table, he crosses the dishes out one by one from the list. 
It's a great flexible system that can accommodate both snacky and havn't-eaten-in-days customers with the same ease as you basically tailormake your own menu. I love it so of course I'll come back!",-1
3,"Not bad! I wasn't sure what to expect, but dishes were authentic and good. It's not fair to compare it to Japan, where the ingredients are better quality, but I am glad that a place like this exists, if only because I abhor Wagamama. This is where you can get things like hiya yakko (cold tofu), katsu curry, tsukemono, and una don. Very good value, great hours, and central location.",-1
5,"Absolutely superb restaurant - very romantic setting and a perfect combination of Italian and French food. Great attention to detail from staff as you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre.
 I recommend asking for a table in the glass-roofed garden area (gazebo?) - in winter there's a wonderful fireplace.
 The quality of the food really shines through - Expensive but very nice restaurant.",1
2,"Manager is up front rushing everyone in and tells you quite bluntly that he has a table but you must be out by a certain time. 
The idea behind it is that he must rotate the tables 2-3 times for dinner, and it shows. Wether the food is good or bad is irrelevant, you can't enjoy it when waiters are staring you down for you to leave! As soon as you put your fork down, they are at your table to clean up. We refused to tell them that we were done, 5 times in less than 7 minutes, just to let our food go down to your stomach,
We were seated in the back room, which has 4 long tables, canteen style. There is a thick carpet in the room and dust accumulates on the black side boards on the walls .. disgusting. 
This place has a lot of potential, but when managed as it is, is just plain sad.
Save your money and go eat somewhere else, there are better places in London.",-1
4,"For good and well-priced Cantonese cuisine, this is the place to go. I have been here many times and have even brought my Cantonese parents when they were crazing home-cooking. 
If you're a meat fan, order the sample plate where you get the BBQ pork, soy sauce chicken, duck, and fatty pork. It's incredible... my favorite is the first three because the fatty pork can be dry sometimes. The noodle dishes (stir-fried rice noodles with beef) are a must, and their seafood (pineapple shrimp) is not bad either. 
Be wary of the waiters though because if they think you're tourists, they will try and get more tip by falsely claiming their added service charge is for the government, not for the restaurant... completely absurd. I was a bit insulted but it hasn't happened again and the food is so good, so I will definitely go back here.",1
3,"This place was recommended by some locals so we wanted to try this while in London.  We went to the Covent Garden location in a cold November evening, and had to stand outside to wait for a table.  While standing out in the cold, the staff brought out hot chai teas for all of us, which was already a wonderful touch.  The queue moved rather quickly, so we were seated in about 30 minutes.  The decor inside was quite cool, with Aalto pendant lamps and all.
The food was good.  Definitely no complaints, but there was nothing I could remember that was amazing.  Yeah.",-1
3,"Good food all around. Authentic indian ambience and food was very good. 
Some small niggles, the water glasses were smelly and the chopped onion we asked for were stale.",-1
4,"Not much more can be said that hasn't been already about the ramen kings, bone daddies! 
Arrived just after 6 on a Thursday, and pretty soon there was a queue out the door, as expected! 
My friend and I nabbed seats by the front window (excellent people watching while dining) and stared with an order of the Korean chicken wings; they had a sweet and spicy sauce and were crispy and delicious!! But messy, soooo messy! 
We both had the tonkatsu ramen with the now famous pork bone broth. Rich, creamy and flavoursome, loaded with noodles, spring onion and a perfectly soft poached egg- ramen perfection! I did add a load of chilli to mine, so think next time I'll order the spicy version and see how I get on!
We ended our meal with a selection of moochi ice creams. The green tea was good but slightly bitter, the raspberry fresh and fruity and the chocolate has a rich, mousse like quality to it. 
Staff were friendly and the atmosphere was buzzing - yet another great spot in soho!",1
4,"Met a friend on Shoreditch High Street for a lunch catch up and we spotted the windows of Dishoom. Intrigued we followed the signs to the entrance. We found a beautiful little oasis for an alfresco lunch. With help from the waitress, we selected various bits and pieces to share. I can't remember what the dishes were called, but I do remember the lentil dish and roti, they were divine. Will definitely be coming back for more.",1
5,"Holy moly. This place is fantastic!
This restaurant is the epitome of cool, located right in the heart of Soho. Rock-n-roll Asian paraphernalia is plastered all over the walls as the most awesome music sets you in the mood to devour a huge bowl of ramen. I've been here at least 4 times, with varying sizes of groups, and every time we've been accommodated in the nicest of ways. There are more than a few delicious choices to make. If you're having trouble deciding, the staff know the menu backwards and forwards. They'll help you out.
My usual here is the Tamtamen 2. Nutty broth, cashews, chicken, veggies, GET IN MY BELLY. While it's on the spicier side, it's not too bad. Just the right amount of punch. I can never finish a whole bowl there's so much to eat! I stuff myself until I can't anymore and then mourn over the loss of uneaten ramen. I wish they had places like this in the States because it's just fantastic! It does tend to get a bit crowded during the lunch and dinner rush, but turnover is quick. Also keep in mind that they close in between lunch and dinner!
This is a must-eat if you're in the Soho area!",1
5,"Oh if only I had a man to dine here with! Clos Maggiore is without a doubt the most romantic restaurant in London - make sure you're seated in the beautiful rear conservatory. Made up to look like a French courtyard it has twinkling fairy lights and faux apple blossom. So pretty - somehow they managed to avoid tackiness. Summer is the best when the skylight is open.
Anyway, the food. It is really good - I'll admit not the best French/Mediterranean in London but let's face it, you're mainly here for the ambience. I highly recommend the pasta - I rarely eat pasta out but Clos Maggiore's really is superb. As is the confit duck. 
Service is fantastic. Friendly and attentive but not intrusive.
Oh and if you're a wine lover - they have a ONE HUNDRED PAGE wine list with over 2,500 wines!",1
4,"--- American tourist ----
Wong Kei is A very  typical old fashion Chinatown restaurant. Very old furniture, very working class, not trendy, not cool, ""you get the best value here"" attitude of service. BUT I highly recommend it!
1. Price is damn good for most chow fun, fried noodles and soup noodles. Cheaper than the United States Chinatown in NY and SF. For other dishes, prices are average NOT cheap.
2. Roast duck is very good but NOT as good as Four Seasons around the corner which still has the BEST duck in London!  Half duck with NO bone is 11.5 pounds at Wong compared to 14.5 pounds with NO bone at Four (number may be off slightly but conclusion is the same). If you want the best duck, go to FOUR.
3. The wonton soup at Wong is average. Soup is meaty, little salty and not clear, not very tasty. Good wonton soup should be clear and strong with seafood (shrimp) taste. Wonton itself is average average although each one has a big piece of shrimp! It could have some MSG in it and it will taste a lot better!
4. Beef stew flat noodle soup is not bad and it is very vinegary. This type of strew is not common in Cantonese style. 
5. Tea is FREE.
Bathroom is acceptable marginally. Service is ok, not great.
Bottom line, good authentic Cantonese noodles restaurant BUT with very affordable prices earns Wong Kei  ****.
CASH ONLY, BUDDY!",1
4,"Besides the weird anomaly of having a great Mojito in a Chinese restaurant, there is nothing out of place at Ping Pong. Its stylishly designed over too floors, and upstairs is a cocktail lounge bar where you can meet friends before your meal. 
The service is very fast, and the dim sum is deliscious. This is a great place to meet a large group of friends - the circular tables allow you to see everyone at the same time. And you can share a large variety of food, and get pleasingly sloshed on the excellent cocktails before taking a short walk along the river to watch a movie. Low lighting and candles make it a good romantic spot in the evening too.",1
5,"Amazing place
Amazing atmosphere
Amazing service
I'm a huge Hakkazan fan in every country they have their restaurant. but the Hanway Place give love to their concept for the Cantonese cuisine.
The Michelin star it's really deserved!
Th dim sum is the best I ever had. Be sure to order for the supreme platter. It worth.
Then we had the chili prawn. A bit too spicy but the prawns were outstanding
And for the grand finale duck with tartufo sauce!
It's our last night in London but can't wait to be back.",1
2,"The ambience here is casual, and the location is perfect--right in the heart of one of the busiest night life and food neighborhoods in London.
So why two stars only? 
Because their ramen is subpar and not real ramen!
Maybe it is the ramen snob in me, or maybe London just has different standards for ramen. So take this review with a grain of salt.
My girlfriend and I came visiting London to try out some of the tastiest food stops we could find on Yelp and through other review sites. We are both huge ramen fanatics, so we had to give London's highest reviewed ramen shops a stop. Unfortunately we were left disappointed. 
We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the tantanmen ramen. The portions were decent. The price was decent for London standards as well. But the ramen....was just not ramen noodles. In fact, the ramen noodles reminded me more of pasta noodles than anything else. (Completely different type of noodles.) 
The broth itself had a strong peanut taste to it, and didn't taste like pork broth at all. Bear in mind that authentic tonkotsu broth is supposed to be created by slow cooking the fattiest pork belly for over six hours to create rich and intense flavors.
If this was named something other than ramen, then I would probably say it's a decent eat. But to take the name of ramen and to create something completely different....
Well. I definitely can't be recommending the ramen here to anyone. If you're ever in Japan, Los Angeles, or San Francisco---definitely stop by some of the highly reviewed ramen shops there so you can taste what real ramen tastes like.",-1
5,"Still the best restaurant in London, for my money. Yes, not just the best Chinese but the best restaurant of any cuisine. Truly stands up to the best in New York.
The team have really thought about every ingredient and they have created a nouvelle Chinoise cuisine that is not pretentious or the ramshackle fusion you find in some modern Chinese restaurants.
I would recommend all their duck dishes, the lobster in garlic and black bean and the surprising turnip cake which is a creamy maked purée topped with shredded bacon. Tremendous.",1
3,"Not bad for a casual and quick dinner.  We had oyakodon bowls I think.  Pretty good.  They confused our orders at first and I had to wait a while for my order.  It's small in there, but warm and cozy to get out of the cold in Leicester Square.",-1
5,"Perfect dinner for a perfect night. 
Outstanding food and great selection of wines.
We'll come back for sure",1
3,"Underwhelming meal. Four of us ordered both versions of the Omikase dinner. When a sizable piece of plastic wrap was found in one of the sushi rolls, the staff didn't really seem to think much of it. The roll was replaced with a fresh one but the manager never made an appearance to apologize. Presentation nice, service slightly above average but not special. We were hoping for a memorable dinner in London, but left with a pricey souvenir.",-1
5,"Amazing. Did not do a thing wrong! Duck rolls were a special treat. We almost did not get them but staff said to. Fantastic. Sauces were perfect, hot spicy items never lost their subtle taste. New London favorite, possibly best dim sum ever. If you find the door the first time you should feel good! I spent too much time looking at the food in the window and walked by it twice! Definitely make reservations.",1
4,"My sister, cousin, and I had came here for dim sum while we were in town. The dishes were prepared extremely well and tastes great! We had the fresh apple juice and jasmine tea to pair with our food. 
We had reservations so we had a nice lovely seat on the ground floor. The restaurant definitely has a good ambience but I would say the prices were pretty high for Chinese dim sum. Also because the portions were quite small. 
I would still recommend the place. It's something different as to your typical Chinese dim sum restaurant.",1
5,"Dishoom was our first stop in London. Went there for dinner around 9pm with out reservations. We waited in a line outside for about 30 minutes, the entire time the staff would bring out cider and cups of chai while we waited. Once we put our name down we went to the bar area and ordered drinks. The Bombay Gimlet is great. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful. For appetizers while waiting for our table we had the Okra Fries and Samosas.. very tasty! The chatni's are phenomenal. For dinner we had the ruby chicken.. absolutely a must to order! The daal was amazing as well as the raitah* yogurt. The cauliflower had so much flavor. Dishoom is one of the best places I've had Indian food at. Definitely one of my favorites. Too bad it's only in London as I'm from California!",1
3,"The best noddles I've ever had so far. The sevice was awful though, the starters arrived after the main course, the waitress didn't stop asking if we were finished, as if they wanted as to eat quickly to vacate the table. The place is extremely loud, and the loud music doesn't help. If you want a quick bite to eat this is the place, but if you want a nice relaxing dinner I don't recommend.",-1
5,"This is a decently trendy place, a while back at another branch a waiter told me that the owner hired the same interior designer who did mega trendy and expensive Nobu's interior  and Ping Pong's is almost copy.  However here they seem to have refreshed from then and the concept and the design has moved on since then to keep it current.
The main waiter was great, making sure we had everything we needed and really  attentive. Although the other staff were nice, they did have that disturbance of feeling a bit rushed.
The dim sum is superb, this is a chain though so the food does feel a bit like it is made to a formula, but is good.
It is starts at about £26-£30 because will need to order a lot as it is a few dim sum with each order.
A good dim sum place that will not dissapoint.",1
3,"The dim sum is pretty good, but would not compare with the best you will find in Hong Kong, Singapore or Shanghai. The skin on the xiao long Bão is almost as thick as gyoza. Chichi décor, attracting lots of young Chinese princelings staying in London.",-1
3,Tried the tonkotsu ramen and the broth tastes really thick. But it may tastes a little bland for some people. Personally didn't think the noodles tasted as good either. The restaurant itself may be ano good place to come with friends and hangouts.,-1
4,"Be ready for this hipster ramen experience. Bone Daddies has arranged the perfect union between an hipster atmosphere and quite authentic ramens. 
I hate the food fusion but mixing atmosphere with (good) food is fine. To the ramen, Bone daddies has added this typical low-light, hipster-waiters with beard. The only Japanese elements I spotted in the interior was a photo of the Yoyogi park where Japanese dance disguised as Elvis - indicating which bathrooms were for women or for men (which did not seem obvious to everybody though).
And as the food was indeed very good, let me add a few word on what matters the most in the end. For appetizers we had CHASHU PORK & CORN CROQUETTE which was a rather random choice but it was a very good pick and I highly recommend you to taste that: we were really surprised. For ramens, i had the ""T22"" (they were really inspired on this one or maybe I miss the reference) and the broth was really really tasty. Hipsters do know how to make ramens, they are evolving.",1
4,"Bone Daddies. Well the name alone should have perked your interest. In cool spot within Soho this Ramen spot is uber trendy. Certainly judging by the queues and type of people you see in it.
The Tonkotsu Ramen is my personal fav, with its 20 hour pork bone broth. Corr blimey it's good. Seems to be a trend to outdo each other with how many hours you can make that broth within Ramen places but let me tell you it makes a difference.
I also really like their fried chicken. And you can't go to a Japanese without getting the chicken. Though I prefer the proper term Karaage Chicken.
Next time I will come purposely a little drunk and for their late night menu. 10.30pm-11.30pm they have a great deal for 2 courses and a whiskey cocktail for £15. Banging!",1
4,"My birthday fell on the Chinese New Year this year (well, at least on London's celebration of the fact) and we decided to embrace the theme. Accordingly, we booked Hakkasan for lunch and its sibling, Yauatcha, for dinner.
I didn't know much about Hakkasan, but man, were we pleasantly surprised.
Ok, first things first, this is definitely toned-down Chinese. But it's classy toned-down Chinese, and if you just embrace the fact that you're eating upscale fusion food, you'll be fine.
The décor is really pleasant: it's sort of a cheeky take on a traditional tea house, with cut wood dividers and little dabs of tat. It's dimly lit and just modern enough, without being so chic that you feel alienated. There's a DJ spinning pleasant background mood music right in the centre of the central wing (there are three, and I believe a few private rooms), and a full bar.
Drinks: really good, balanced, and as described in the menu.
Food: solid, and set at an appropriate price point for quality/quantity. But don't get the pumpkin tofu; it was a massive disappointment.
Service: spotty, but not for wont of trying. The place was packed, there were lion dancers weaving in and out, and you got the distinct impression that it wasn't normally this chaotic. There were two slips in the service (the wrong drink, and the aforementioned tofu arrived around the time we were ordering dessert) but the staff were trained to the calibre you'd expect for this level of establishment, polite, unobtrusive, smiley. Great overall.
As a bonus, the dessert here wasn't an afterthought, and the tea menu was delightful. I have a soft spot for places which actually brew my tea well and yes, Hakkasan, you did just that.
I do wish that the flavour profiles stuck a bit closer to their roots, and that's the only reason Hakkasan misses out on its 5th star. Aside from one fried nibble with dried scallop inside, and some very very mild preserved duck egg in another, I found things just a bit lacking in the flavour department overall.",1
3,"Really cool spot on Upper St. Loved the food but our waitress seemed a bit out of it at times. We also found a blond hair in our calamari but it was quickly replaced.
I want to give this place 4 stars but based on the two items above, I can't justify it. We  will have to dine here again and try some of their other dishes so I can update this review. Overall though the food was solid!",-1
3,A bit overrated thought it was decent Indian food.  Dishoom is way better go there instead.  Chicken Tikka Masala was kind of bland.,-1
4,"Very sexy restaurant. Service was great - told the server to pick about 6 dishes on the menu for me and my date to share. His choices were great: crispy duck salad was my favorite, along with a spicy prawn dish. The lychee martinis were fantastic so I had a bunch of those.  Main downfall for me was our seat. We had to both sit on the same side of the table and there was a couple right next to us doing the same thing. It was a little close for comfort.
A lot of business dinners but also a lot of dates and party groups. Versatile restaurant with good food and service.",1
5,"Delicious, beautiful, trendy, and reasonably-priced. No wonder this chain is so popular and opening everywhere! 
Walked in by myself around 6pm and was told there is a 30-minute wait. No problem, went to the bar and got their namesake IPA. Pretty good beer, as expected. The bartenders are friendly and cute, gave me some good recommendation for drinks and where to go. Before I knew it, my table was ready. 
I got fried okra, chicken ruby, basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was fantastic. Everything. I had too much food so I shared my okra with my neighbors and made friends :) 
Dishoom is awesome, now go line up!",1
5,"This restaurant served the best Indian food I have ever had in my life! The lamb raan, raita, black daal, paneer roti, and everything else we ordered was so unbelievable!! I am really going to miss this place. I wish they had it in Los Angeles!",1
2,"We traveled from the United States to London in one week ago, and we had a dinner at Four Seasons.  We only tried one Chinese restaurant in London during this trip, so I am not sure the quality of Chinese food in other restaurants in London.  This restaurant is definitely not recommended because the food and the service were really bad. 
1.  This restaurant has minimum cost for every person ($8), and the waiter will force you to order more if you didn't order enough food.
2.  This restaurant will charge you tip automatically.
3.  The service was really bad, the attitude of the waiters were the worse that I have ever seen in my life.
4.  The flavors of the food were bad, the portions were small for that price.",-1
1,Totally overhyped. It was not worth the hour wait outside the restaurant. It was not very flavorful and was not traditional. You would think for a country that once claimed India as a colony they would at least be able to represent the food better. The place I go to in the states in much cheaper and much more flavorful than this place. Don't waste your time in line.,-1
5,The bacon naan's here are amazing - the perfect hungover brunch,1
4,"Needless to say, there's a lot of ""fuss"" going around about Hakkasan, mostly being all positive. I think it's really important to undertsand that this is not your regular Michelin star restaurant. No silver service, pretentious service....far from it. You're even seated on time limit which for me personally means no Michelin star but I don't make the rules. The decor and interior is fantastic, nice traditional asian touch with modern brasserie style buzz. However, the food is a slight let-down. Let's remind ourselves again that this is supposed to be Michelin star class. Salt and pepper squid was the highlight but the rest was above average, but ceratinly below what you would expect at such an establishment. Hakkasan is absolutely an overall good experience for all the senses but the tastebuds are left the least entertained.",1
4,"Just got back from lunch at Yauatcha. Delicious!
Liked the decor, too, although maybe a bit dark in the basement for lunchtime, would love to come back one evening.
We ordered lots of different dishes and shared them, but they all tasted amazing. Particularly the duck roll!
I got taken here on a business lunch so didn't have to pay, otherwise the visit might have left a bigger dent in my purse than I would have preferred. But as I said, it was delicious, so maybe worth it!",1
4,"I had dinner at Ping Pong with some friends while visiting from America. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was friendly. The food was delicious - I chose from the preset menu, and everything on it was great. I didn't like that we couldn't make a reservation unless there was at least 6 of us, and they didn't bring us the checklists back, so we were unsure as to who ordered what some of the time. Overall, a great experience, and I would return when I'm back in the UK!",1
3,"For the longest time, I was very anti-Ping Pong.  I've been here a couple of times before and never felt very keen to come back but have to say my view (or taste buds) have changed for this place.  I came here for lunch recently and ordered the Super 8 lunch special which I thought was pretty good.  For the group, we had the pork puff pastries and spare ribs.  
Everything was actually quite good and would consider coming back.  I think it's a good alternative - also they have a lot of good veggie options.  I do like the modern look and feel of the place and such a good location.",-1
5,"If you're in search of something different for brunch, you've found it. And if you're not in search of something different for brunch, you've still found it. I was curious to try Indian-style brunch after a friend recommended it, and I was far from disappointed. The Chai tea made me realise that in fact, anything else I have previously thought was Chai was nothing more than a poor imitation --it was sweet, spicy and delicious. I had the Egg Naan Roll as my meal, and it was also divine.",1
5,"One of my favourite restaurants in London for sure! Everything I've had so far is great quality and amazing taste! They got absolutely everything
The rude staff is kind of their thing and you kind of just make it into a game to make the waiter smile ;)
Cheap, fun and Noodles need I say more?",1
4,"If you are looking for a dim sum experience beyond the usual Chinatown stuff, then Yauatcha is one place to go (Royal China Club is another good one). Like other Alan Yau creations, you'll find chic decor, plus well-dressed waitresses.
 For around 3 to 5 pounds, you'll get a serving of dim sum. My favourites include the pork and prawn shui mai and the simple chive dumplings. There's also a number of different types of teas on offer, unlike other places.
 One problem we had was the 2 hour time limit, though it was partly our fault as some of us reached late. But otherwise, we had a good dim sum experience here.",1
2,"It feels like there's an extensive menu. We tried a little bit of everything, and yet 90% of it was rather unappetizing. What we ordered: 
- Baby spinach salad with shrimp: 5/5 actually one of the only good things that we ordered that night
- Chicken with teriyaki: 3/5 chewy and overly sweet (even for teriyaki!)
- Miso cod: 0/5 Oh. My. God. This was inedible. This was supposed to be the star of the show and it was a huge let down. It felt like it was doused in maple syrup. Couldn't taste the fish. Much too sweet and hard to stomach
- Toro sashimi: 3/5 the tuna didn't taste like very fresh/high quality fish
- Tuna avocado roll: 4/5 eh, very plain but that's just your run of the mill tuna avo roll
- Edamame: 5/5 hard to mess up
- Sea urchin crispy nori sushi cup: 2/5 I'm usually a big fan of sea urchin but the crispy nori sushi cup felt like burnt/tasteless/cardboard seaweed and it didn't complement the flavour of the sea urchin at all!
- Chocolate bento box: 4/5 pretty standard chocolate fondant and the green tea ice cream was also ok
The service was really good, our waitress was very attentive, but I would personally never come back here again, especially considering the price for what you get.",-1
4,"Wow! What a restaurant! I had the seasonal tasting menu with suggested wine pairings. It has been an amazing experience, all plates really delicious, well presented and well portioned. 
The sommelier paired excellent wines, none of them was disappointing and all of them a perfect match with the food. 
The atmosphere is lovely, waiters all nice and good. 
Absolutely a must go!!",1
2,"SERVICE:
The customer service here has some serious room for improvement. Between the moments I stepped in the restaurant to the moment I stepped out, each interaction with the staff felt very impersonal and unfriendly. If I say ""Thank you"" to a waiter, he would just stare at me and walk away. When it was time for me to pay, the person who inserted my credit card didn't even say a word. He just took the card, printed out a receipt, let me sign it, and walked away. Not a single eye contact. Wow. On top of all that, I'm required to give a ""10 percent optional service"" fee.
PRICE:
My total amounted to 14.25 GBP for Butter Chicken with rice. That's about $23.63 USD for those living in the states. People say that this place is cheap but I think it's expensive. I have been to other Indian restaurants where my total is about 11 GBP for the same or more portion of food. 
FOOD:
I ordered the Butter Chicken and rice. The Butter Chicken included two pieces of chicken still on the bone. The gravy was good and had a slight spiciness to it. It goes well with rice or naan (not included in the price). 
If the customer service was better, I would have given this place a 3 out of 5 stars.",-1
4,"Having spent some time in China and Hong Kong, I can honestly say this place meets the standards pretty well. It also meets the service standards, but this is the kind of place you simply go to only for the food, not necessarily for the ""restaurant-experience"" (this is not a place to dress up for a Saturday night).
Their roast duck, pork belly, soya chicken (in that order) are all fantastic, you can have a meat selection but make sure you order enough duck. We ordered the beef noodles and Singapore fried vermicelli with it and these are equally great. 
Whether you're new to the Cantonese kitchen or have high expectations, this is the place to go to!",1
5,"I think I love the interior design of the restaurant more than anything else haha. It's super modern and pretty but the Asian culture still remains. 
The dim sums are amazing!! I've been to Hong Kong and had delicious dim sum and this place is up there. Every item is small/delicate. At the same time, it is innovate and has lots of flavors. Honestly, everything I had was really good so just be open minded and order something you've never had before and surprise yourself :). 
Each person would need to order about 3 items. It's not the cheapest dim sum but it is well worth the money.",1
3,"I'd been dying to try out Yauatcha many years ago when they first opened their doors. Back then though, I was a student without the money to try out fancy restaurants. So fast forward some years and I'm finally seated inside. 
If I want dim sum, I don't need to pay such an extortionate price. I could just opt for an authentic place down the road in Chinatown. So I opted to try a few plates, unique to Yauatcha instead. 
Was I impressed? Sadly not that much. Maybe it was because I'd paid double (or even triple) the price for a few dumplings. Or maybe it's because I'd had so much expectation for it for so long. 
So I guess, if you're looking for decent authentic dimsum, don't go to Yauatcha. If you're looking for a fancy venue, then Yauatcha is for you!",-1
5,"Amazing restaurant, the athmosphere is great and the food phenomenal. It does not just taste great but it looks amazing.",1
5,"I loved the ramen here! Fantastic, To be honest, one of my favorite even though people swear by Kanada-Ya or Shoryu, in my opinion this place trumps them of all. Great creamy tonkotsu and best of all Asahi on tap which tasted that much better with a creamy lip on the pint glass. All in all my favorite ramen place in London, worth a try! Their sides are also good, but for us 2 big bowls of ramen were enough! be warned, it gets very busy and its not uncommon to wait 30-40 mins for a table!
The service is great, even when it is very busy service is attentive and helpful. But most important is the food.",1
5,"Wonderful service! Our waiter was extremely helpful and kind. We had vegetable samosas, ruby chicken, garlic naan and white rice and everything was delicious!",1
5,"If you like upmarket Dim Sum, Yauatcha will be right up your street. It's not Chinatown as we know it but rather some kind of newly minted sparkling 21st century version of an old Chinese favorite.
We called in at 7.00 on a Sunday and we were given a table for 2. The tables are close together and as it was quietish, I requested a four-top for us as they were all empty. 
The hostess kindly seated us on a larger table after checking her table plan. 
Our waitress was excellent. I had an idea of what we wanted as I have had Dim sum before but she was great at giving us suggestions. We ended up ordering six dishes all recommended by her and I was very happy with all of them. 
The cocktail I had, called Lalu, was gorgeous and full of lime and zesty flavours. 
My favorite dim sum was the Szechaun Beef parcel and the prawn Cheung Fun. 
Our bill was a £70 for 6 dim sum, a cocktail and a beer, 2 espressos and dessert. It was all amazing and I will be back.",1
5,"Some of the most amazing dim sum I have every had.  Great service, amazing ambiance.  Order the dim sum for sure!  Can't go wrong with anything.",1
3,"The food is good, but not that perfect.
The place a little bit small there is no personal space you can share the conversation with the next table.
Try the chicken masala and chicken butter. And the vegetable and lamb biryani.
And at last don't forget to try the cheese naan.",-1
5,"The food was delicious. We're from Markham, Ontario, Canada where we have excellent and authentic Chinese restaurants. The food at this restaurant is very comparable. The beef in black bean sauce on ho fun noodles was really good. The vegetables with garlic were excellent too.",1
5,"Absolutely wonderful food, good prices, warm & friendly staff! Highly recommended!",1
5,"Second time there. 
Venison Puffs & Taro Corquettes are my staples and they do them the best. 
It wasn't the ninja style waiting service like the first time (seriously, never saw the waiter take our empty dishes or change napkins). They gave us the Steamed Char Sui buns by mistake, but mistakes are all good when they are FREE ^___^",1
1,"Ping Pong South Bank, I have fallen out of love with you.
 I used to really love this place. The food, the drinks, the decor and ambience. All top-notch.
 I went here on Saturday night - I've been there when it's been busy before, and it was fine, but this time around we should have seen the warning signs when we were handed one of those stupid pager things that Student Unions hand out if you're waiting for a burger and chips. After waiting for a table in the bar, we then had to literally wave at the waiters to get somebody to take our drinks order.
 When we eventually got a table to eat at, we discovered that a lot of food on the menu was 'not available' - much to our disappointment. The food, when it arrived, was delicious as ever, but then when the mains were finished, a bill was whacked down on our table, without even asking if we wanted dessert or tea, seemingly in an attempt to turn the table around quicker. We were given a dessert menu after a request... but then had a bizarrely epic wait to get the bill at the end.
 What used to be a great restaurant is now swamped and understaffed on busy nights - leaving yourself up against a bizarre conflict of staff who one minute seem desparate to get you out of the table, and the next are impossibly hard to get ahold of in order to take orders / provide service. Dining is supposed to be relaxing, not leaving you stressed at constant efforts to get the attention of staff, as you squeeze around a communal table that is simply not big enough for the food of all of the dining groups.
 At £75 for 2 including service, it ends up leaving me with a horribly nasty taste in the mouth. The food was great, but did I have a pleasurable dining experience? Not in the slightest. The staff tried their best, but there just wasn't enough of them.
 I would not go to the South Bank Ping Pong again, at least not on the weekend. I think I'll be returning to a quieter branch in future...",-1
4,"Only came here for dessert but they were really incredible. On the expensive side but definitely worth it for something special.
The only downside in my opinion was that the whole place felt very pretentious and the waiting staff were all very well presented but not overly friendly.",1
5,Trendy Chinese restaurant. Situated in the basement-level but in a setting worthy of a Jet Li film. The food is great here despite the large size and number of tables in the venue. Especially after matches this is better than pasta!,1
2,"This was really disappointing considering the good ratings. I'm from Toronto and this didn't compare at all to the ramen back home. I had the tonkotsu ramen and for a broth that was supposed to have been stewed for 20 hours, it really didn't taste like pork bone. Or anything for that matter. It was really thick and fragrant but it didn't actually taste like anything. Their chili oil also lacked any spice. The service was good though, the presentation of the food was nice and the place itself seems pretty hip (hence the two stars). But when it came down to the actual food itself, I am really disappointed and you shouldn't come here if you're looking for authentic ramen. If anyone knows of authentic asian restaurants in London please let me know!",-1
4,"So, I'm eating my first ""real"" ramen, as in, it's not $.10 Maruchan ramen from a package, while listening to blaring Van Halen and Guns N' Roses and being served by a slew of Australians... And it was glorious.
Along with several of the others, I ventured for the tonkotsu ramen and there isn't anything more I can say than what the others have already said, but I'll go ahead and repeat!  Oh, that broth.  That broth was so tasty.  And Yee Gan graciously shared his pipette of fat with me, which made the broth even tastier!  How often do you get to share a pipette of fat with someone?  Not often.  It cracks me up just typing it out.  There were some sprouts, but nothing overpowering, and they softened up nicely in the bowl.  I think it may have been marginally better if the noodles had been slightly harder in the beginning as they were quite soft by the end.  I couldn't finish my bowl due to the almost overly generous portion of noodles.  But they were very, very tasty!
That egg is the stuff of my dreams.  I was looking over at Katie and Rob's bowls with a bit of jealousy as they had the foresight to order a spare egg.  The yolk is so buttery!  Om nom nom.  All the extras on the table really added to the dish.  I know I probably should have tried my first ramen without any additives, but when you're given a garlic press to play with, how can one resist?!  The pork slices in the ramen were so tender and were falling apart upon contact.  And with just a bit of fattiness, they added to the rich broth and my half-fat pipette delightfully.
I ordered the yellowtail starter which was really nice, but nothing outstanding.  Just good, fresh sashimi with a bit of chili, cilantro (because I'm a Texan and can't get behind ""coriander"") and some soy.  I tried a bit of Rob's fried chicken and agree that it just wasn't quite crispy enough.  Think chick-fil-a nuggets without the pickle juice marinade, if you've ever had them.  Also had a bit of Yee Gan's soft shell crab, which was tasty and came with a lovely, spicy sauce, but also could have used a bit more crunch.
My first Bone Daddies ramen will most certainly not be my last!",1
4,"About a year ago I was at Yauatcha with some friends, and someone got to wondering whether Yauatcha had ever had a Michelin star.  There was some disagreement (some thought it still had a star), so we eventually asked a waiter who, after leaving to consult colleagues, eventually returned with the news that at that moment, Yauatcha was still the holder of one star, but that it was uncertain whether this situation would continue for much longer!  Evidently the fate of the restaurant did not rest with that curiously pessimistic member of staff, for the 2010 list is now out, and Yauatcha still has its star.
I revisited a few days ago, and whilst Yauatcha is perhaps not the restaurant is once was, it's still got some pretty good moves.  The dim sum is some of the best in London, and whilst not cheap, it can be surprisingly good value: it's very much possible to drink tea and eat well for £25, which is perhaps £10 more than an acceptable dim sum you might get somewhere else.  (I've only ever eaten dim sum at Yauatcha; other dishes will be more expensive.)
The food is recognisably traditional, though with a few twists--venison might replace beef, for example.  The presentation is pretty good, even for menu items that sound uninspiring.  Dim sum is not for the truly timid, but although chicken feet are on the menu, there's plenty of safe dumplings and ribs and buns, etc. to be had.  The mushroom cheung fun (mushroom wrapped in a loose noodle sheath) is close to twice the price of the meat and seafood variations, but well worth it.  The deep fried squid was also excellent.
The decor is nice and staff are pleasant.  Neither is intimidating.  It can be noisy, and isn't suited for long, lingering meals.  As other reviews have mentioned, the dramatic cake display upstairs has disappeared--a loss.
Four stars--I'm a fan, and I'll be back.",1
5,"I have been frequenting this institution for years. Its brilliant whether dining with friends or alone. The food is tasty, with huge portions at great value. I recommend the Char Siu (BBQ Pork). The service is famously abrupt but has improved and still retains a certain charm. The food is often delivered very quick - a plate of rice can be quicker, tastier and cheaper than McDonald's!
If you're happy with no frills tasty food, you found the right place.",1
5,"This place is fantastic. I'm not a foodie, but even I could tell it was something special. I went with 2 others, and we had a 3 course meal and wine. The dishes are plated beautifully, the service is exemplary, and the food is absolutely to die for.
As an appetizer, I had the ""Fresh Maine Lobster, Scallop & King PrawnTortellini"". The scallop is sweet and tender, the lobster is succulent. For the main course, I had the chicken leg stuffed with sausage. Again, the perfect seasonings and tastes. I wasn't overly impressed with the mashed potatoes and carrots that we ordered as sides. Finally, I had pralines and toasted hazelnuts, which was a perfect end to an incredible feast. The setting is incredible with the indoor garden theme as well. Well recommended, even if you're not going as a couple - the food alone is worth it!",1
1,"I recently spent several days in London and wanted to eat some great Indian Food.  Looking at Yelp, Punjab seemed to be among the best so we decided to give it a try.  I won't say it's the worst Indian food I've ever eaten.  No, it's truly mediocre.  Dry, flavorless naan, poor quality rice, bland dal... everything you'd expect from a mediocre Indian restaurant.  I hope those who thought this was the ""Best freaking Indian food"" get a chance to eat at better places.  They can start a few blocks away, at Dishoon (it's not the best Indian food I've had, but definitely better).
What makes Punjab one star, though, is the painfully strong odor of industrial strength soap that permeated ever nook and cranny of the place.  And after sitting in that horrid stench for an hour, it also permeated every nook and cranny of my skin and clothes.  The crazy thing is that this soapy smell seems to be the result of some towels that they give you at the end of the dinner, so you can clean your hands.  Or maybe, so you can get a chemical peel.  Either way, it was ridiculous and it totally ruined any chance we might have had to enjoy our meal.
There are many more Indian restaurants in London.  Give some of them a try instead of this place.",-1
4,"After eating at the wonder ground, we wanted something sweet, I jumped to search yelp for desserts, and of course, this place popped up. 
We headed in, they took our coats and luggage, and we were sat in the blue lit bar area since we were just having pud. 
We giggled struggling to read the menu in the low light and candles (who knew blue light made it so difficult?) Picking cocktails and elaborate puds. 
The seats were tall and oddly comfy, and the atmosphere in both the bar and the restaurant were lovely, and the view into the kitchen gave us a peek at what we were waiting for. (also, people watching through the one way wall kept us entertained too!) Things didn't take long to arrive, and they were presented beautifully, and tasted even better. We plumped for things with ingredients that weren't every day, and there was a nice range to choose from, but ours were just lovely, tart, and well balanced, with a really nice mix of textures too. 
I'd like to come back and eat more than just puddings, because it all smelt great!",1
2,It's okay to say the least not fantastic. The broth is too salty. Definitely had better.,-1
3,"ok so this is tough.Im from NY where theres no shortage of good indian food. Now orginally my wife and i were going to head to DUM biryani house but saw the greaaat reviews and number of reviews for DISHOOM. So i ll go thru pros and cons
PROS- ambience is amazing. The lighting the old indians photos were superb touch
The cocktails honestly were the best part of the entire experience.  I had an excellent manhattan and my wife a colada. So no issues there. Service was great. All employees were friendly.  
To the food. Best dish we had was the chicken tikka off the grill. Tender and flavorful and with the chutney selection you could make as spicey or mild as needed
Mattar paneer was good with excellent flavors and one of there signature dishes the black dhal was on point i must say.
Cons- spicy lamb chops, first werent spicy and second they were overcooked. Cmon man there should be some red. 
We also got the signature prawn moilee in a yellow curry and it was just OK man.  I mean the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I wouldnt even say they were prawns. It wasnt bland but i did have high expectations. My wife ordered some coleslaw and felt the yogurt in their mightve been old. 
To summarize id say its a good place overall but if your expecting curries like some tikka masala vindaloo or saag .. yea not here. I mean im torn, i think people will enjoy the overall experience in general but really if youve been to other indian restuarants around the world this isnt even top 5 food wise. 
Go enjoy and have drinks and other small plates and judge for urself",-1
3,"The restaurant was recommended by a friend and when we arrived it was packed. Fortunately, we were able to find a table for 2. I looked for recommended items on the menu and ended up ordering the butter chicken-a Punjabi speciality. Well, when it arrived I took my first bite and  it was insanely spicy. To the managers credit he saw the face I made after that first bit and asked me if anything was wrong. I told him it was very very spicy. He then had the waiter bring me some yogurt to calm the spices down. if you love spice this is your dish. If not, stay away from it.",-1
4,"Good food and great service. Well worth a visit. 
The staff go above and beyond. 
There were a couple of issues when we went but I e-mailed after our visit and all problems were resolved straight away.
Reasonably priced too. 
The interior has an industrial theme and I fell in love with the toilets.
Recommend!",1
5,"Amazing dim sum - really enjoyed Yauatcha's.
All we ate was the Dim Sum, we tried many different types.
The Scallops ones were our favourite.  Would definetely go again",1
1,"Was excited to check this place out. After a 45min wait for a single serving of ramen, I was served a horrible, lukewarm soup as I was getting ready to leave. I though I'd waited that long, I might as well try the ramen. Lukewarm tonkotsu is not nice. Neither is the tough-as-old-boots chashu pork on top. I have a strong feeling they made my serving and forgot about it for 20min, despite me asking the waiter a few times why it was taking so long.
Then they had the nerve to add a service charge.",-1
4,"So after a night of dancing in London till dawn, I rose from bed around lunch time and, stomach roaring, went on the hunt for some food. Luckily for me I stumbled on Dishoom which was hidden away down a side street that happened to catch me eye! Curry for breakfast, hell yeah!
Service was polite and prompt, I didn't get the brush off treatment I have received elsewhere on asking for a table for one. So top marks there. I sat outside on their beautiful plant draped terrace, it felt a world away from London. I ordered steamed rice with Mattar Paneer and some house chai. The chai is absolutely delicious, aromatic, spicy but not too sweet. However it comes in a tiny portion, I could have easily enjoyed more.
The food arrived quickly and was beautifully spiced and fresh tasting, the rice was delicate and light. I only wish I had had time to make a return visit, as there was so much on the menu I would have loved to try. I'd say it'd be a great spot to have  lunch with a group to get a few dishes to share.
It was pretty pricy to my eye - but I'd say it's competitive for London prices, and there was a lovely atmosphere to the place so i was happy to spend.",1
2,"Coming from Southern California, I would have to say the Dim Sum here is barely okay. Given the fact that you are paying significantly more for the food, they shuffle you out the door after your meal as soon as they can (I asked for a round of drinks toward the end of the meal which was immediately followed by a conversation with the manager), I don't think it's worth it at all. Don't order the Halibut - too fishy. 
Granted, I am in a unique position to eat dim sum at great places which are a small fraction of the price but when in London, I would say find another place to eat.
I know London is different from many cities but I was not impressed by the service either. I usually don't ding places for their service because there are a ton of factors involved and many times, there are reasons happening behind the scenes so I only offer that up for information. Drinks were slow or forgotten.",-1
3,Ordered two ramen n a black sesame tofu. I'm in love with the tofu but not a ramen fan sorry. The dining place is a bit small. We feel lucky to have a friendly n fast service thank you,-1
1,"While the roast duck was flavorful, the skin was soggy (major no-no in any Chinese kitchen) and the dish of 3 BBQ meats was altogether cold. Our aubergine vermicelli was cold as well and over cooked. 
Originally I thought to myself, do not judge them too harshly, after all I just came back from a year living in China. But the last straw was when they grossly overcharged us. The meal should have been 21 GBP, but I later discovered my date was charged 40 GBP! I am going back with the receipt.
Utterly unprofessional and disappointing. I could have bought 4 whole Peking roast ducks of the best quality elsewhere.",-1
3,"Oh, gosh. Three stars at best. Two stars at worst. Let's settle with three because the service was really something special.
I think part of the problem I am going to have with all ramen shops in London is that none of them are going to match the ramen I ate in Tokyo a handful of months ago. It's just not going to happen. Plus, diners are waaaaaaayyyyyyy too politically correct with how they eat a bowl of Ramen in England. Please, people, just shove your head into the bowl and slurp those noodles up into your mouth. 
My husband and I started off on a good foot. We popped in at prime dinner time and were seated straightaway at the bar in front of the windows. I liked the curtains hung on the entance, very Japanese. I ordered a Berry Berry Somethingorother which was made of gin and had a fresh raspberry in it but I wasn't wowed by it. I mean, it was OK but nothing special. I was more wowed by the fact that such a fancy cocktail was served to me in what is considered a fast food shop in Japan.
On the table was:
-a bottle of fresh garlic cloves and a garlic press
-chopsticks, napkins and bibs (happy I brought my own fork, BYOF)
-a bottle of hair ties (yes, like to tie your hair back into a ponytail)
-various sauces like soy and some chili-based looking sauce
We ordered the fried chicken, the T22 and a second kind of ramen which fails to come to memory at present. The fried chicken came in a little stainless steel bucket and looked a bit like popcorn chicken but larger pieces. Some of the pieces had been sitting underneath the heating lap for an extended period of time because they were cold and chewy. Other pieces were hot as though they just came out of the fryer. I remember commenting, ""I'd rather have wasted these calories at KFC)."" So, there's that.
My ramen, the T22, was not super great or even great. Now that I think about it, it wasn't even that good. I highly disliked the crackling. The noodles looked like they came out of a packet. The chicken was sparse. And, in general, it just was not my cuppa ramen. Also, as an added bonus, I started burping up the broth about 30 minutes after eating.
Perhaps it my ramen selection that literally left a bitter taste in my mouth or perhaps Bone Daddies just doesn't have as great of ramen as claimed. Either way, there are too many other ramen shops in London to try before returning to Bone Daddies.",-1
3,"The place is always on high demand... food is ok, nothing spectacular. The duck which looks huge ends up been served in tiny portions and you are left wondering wheres the rest of the meat??? Anyways, fun to go with friends, more like a bar.",-1
2,"Food is okay. The hostess needs to be a lot more organized... She kept us waiting for almost 30 minutes, and when I saw that a table had been kept open I finally inquired about it (thinking there's no way she would keep us waiting when that table is ours). As a matter of fact, she HAD forgotten about us! Space is chill and cool though.",-1
4,"We waited for two hours. Literally. The staff at the reception had an attitude. I have every right to ask how many more minutes left, but they were just annoyed with that. Food was amazing. Loved the spices and the menu. I have to admit, the price was unbelievably good for what we ate. I pay four times what i payed there than in luxurious Indian restaurants like Amaya. Honestly, Dishoom was more authentic.",1
4,"Didn't have the ramen but really enjoyed the starters. firstly, its totally not baby friendly as far as tables and stuff but the staff really handled a fussy baby well. Thanks ladies and gents!
When one has a fussy baby only a cocktail can curb the angst. Too bad they were out of the watermelon juice.  That sounded amazing. Instead I had what tasted like a 'porn star' minus the champs. The passion fruit drink was still yummy. The dza had the 'mule' and liked it very much. 
We tried and loved the fried chicken which so happened to be baby's first taste of chicken and she loved it too. 
The yellowtail sashimi reminded us of our favorite dish back home so we were more than pleased to see some jalapano on the plate. 
The soft shell crab was pretty bland and i'm actually n ot sure if it was cooked all the way through, but we still ate it. was ok, batter was like, and the dipping sauce was ok. Just an overall meh dish. 
But I really really enjoyed the food that we did try and will most def go back for more.",1
4,"I went here with some people for work, and was really looking forward to it because of all the hypeand it certainly lived up to it! The food is so delicious and there i such a varied choice on offer. The interior is a bit strange, and slightly claustrophic, but all in all it was a great experience.",1
5,"I always make a reservation at Hakkasan when in London. The food is excellent, the wine list is phenomenal, and the crowd is sexy. It's a Michelin-star winner and deserves all the hype it gets.  My favorites include the sesame prawn toast, salt and pepper squid, and stir-fry black pepper rib-eye. Remember your veggies! You won't go wrong with the pak choi and gai lan.",1
5,"The entrance of the restaurant (in a basement) said it all and much about what you are about to find. Down there, is like you are no longer in London, the waiters have a strong unknown funny accent, the food is not just pretty and no flavour but rather strangely mixed on the plate and scrumptiously flavoured. 
This restaurant is a lovely way of meeting with asian country, without wasting as much money on travel.......
The whole experience was lovely",1
5,acceptable for any special occasion. able to enjoy your dining past kitchen hours too.,1
3,Not worth the hour and a half wait. The curries and naan are delicious but having to wait that long for food makes me not enjoy it as much. The day we waited was also pretty chilly. We got there quite early 6pm and still had to wait an hour and a half. Def come at an odd time like 4pm if you can go beat the crowd.,-1
5,"This review is for the dim sum.
Best kept Dim Sum secret.  Cost?  Pretty much the same range as any other dim sum place in London...a small premium.  Quality?  10x better than any other dim sum place in London.  What's that you say?  You thought Hakkasan was for the filthy rich?  Not authentic enough?  Wrong 
I admit that I had my doubts.  A look at their dinner menu posted outside made me scream a little in my head.... tricked into another overpriced Chinese restaurant in London.  Puh.  Well, that may be the case for the dinner menu, but the dim sum menu is very reasonably priced.  For two people, the cost came out to be the same as Royal China except everything about the Hakkasan dim sum experience outshone any other dim sum place I've been to in London (and we were stuffed for the rest of the day).  So let's talk about the food.
The menu is a combination of traditional dim sum plates and a few plates with a unique spin.  We had a go with both types, and were pleasantly surprised with all.  Generally speaking, every dish was good and very well executed both in taste and texture.  However, four things really stood out to me:
1.  Chang Fen with Beef Flank - I can't recommend this dish enough.  My boyfriend nearly devoured the whole thing, and I was trying to fight him for it.  Hakkasan have taken a little spin on the original Chang Fen idea, and topped off the Chang Fen with...well, basically a version of Cantonese Beef Stew.  Who would have thought to put the two together?  The Chang Fen itself is phenomenal.  PERFECT texture----slippery and soft, but firm enough to not break apart when you pick it up with chopsticks (No other dim sum place around London has seemed to master the texture of Chang Fen.... most of the time, it's overly soft).
2.  Shanghai dumplings - do not get this.  It is basically just pot stickers.  I thought it would be real Shanghai dumplings, which is one of my favourite dim sum plates.  Remember that Shanghai dumplings should always be steamed, filled only with meat (NO VEGGIES), and so juicy that when you first bite into it, you get burnt by the hot juice splattering across your chin.  If a Shanghai dumpling does meet these requirements, then it is not a true Shanghai dumpling.
3.  The dessert menu had White fungus & pear soup.  Surprise!!  Don't be put off by the white fungus description!  This soup brings back home for me as my mother used to make it in the summer time.  You can drink it cold (the way I like it) or hot, and it's just a really smooth, not overly sweet, dessert to have at the end of a meal.
4.  Tea.  I probably drink more than a litre of tea a day if I'm at home.  And all Chinese teas I stock up on from trips to China.  Hakkasan actually have a fairly good tea menu with some pretty traditional teas that you don't normally find in other Chinese restaurants.  Pu-er cha for instance and Tie Guan Yin (which we had, and was very good!!!).  
I am definitely coming back here.  I am not even sure I would give any other dim sum place in London a chance again.  It's worth the tiny 5 pound premium.  The quality of the food is just amazing, and really under-priced in London terms.",1
5,"This review is strictly for their gorgeous cakes! They cost 6 pounds each which is pretty decent compared to many of the other dessert shops here. 
FOOD:
Glancing at the case of cakes, I literally wanted to try everything! They all looked so beautiful. After much deliberation, I decided on the Honey Jasmine Milk Chocolate cake. I didn't try it that night, but the next day and it was soooo delicious! 
The decor is designed to perfect. There were 3 layer compacted into the tiny cake: milk chocolate ganche, jasmine buttercream and honey buttercream and chocolate pop rocks! 
SERVICE: 
If you want to come here just for the cakes, let the hostess know and they will call someone over to help you out at the cake station. The lady that helped us was really friendly! I asked if I could take a picture of the cake before she boxed it and she actually gave me the best looking one and asked if I wanted to take picture of any other cake. They box your cake in one of those boxes that you don't want to throw out.
If I'm ever back in London, I would come back just for the cakes!",1
2,"I have to say that some of these reviews seem to be going very OTT. The food is OK - hardly 'transcendent' or 'sensational'. The space seems a little odd and not the kind of room i'd associate with India street food.
The thing I would associate Indian street food with is a very very low cost. Not the £10 that a small bowl of rice and 2 rotis cost here. I have no problem with paying a lot for good food, but those prices were getting dangerously close to extortion.
Then again, the place was packed so maybe i'm just too much of a Tayyabbs fanboy to appreciate food from  the sub-continent anywhere else!",-1
5,Great atmosphere and ramen w pork was incredible.,1
5,"The husband and I love this place very much. And this last time we went, we noticed that the service had improved, as well. Not that we care, because the food is so good it's enough to keep us coming back. 
The okra fingers are finger licking good. You have to try them. Also, the pau bun thing was super yummy - it's a veggie potato mash served with the softest brioche type bun. The shrimp starter was perfectly spiced and we were popping them like popcorn. The raita was fine, not the best.  The naan and roti were warm, soft and fresh. 
We love to try the drinks. So good. I cannot remember the names, but my favorite is a spicy, sour & sweet cocktail. 
Try the pineapple desert - and order it with a scoop of ice cream. So good.  
Finally, we love the space. There's a cute covered outdoor area that's lovely on sunny days. Highly recommend!
So good!",1
1,Punjab what can I say. Good quality food but Shitty service. We were forgotten(4 tables who arrived after us received their food before us wtf). They also charged our table for an additional naan.....that we never ate)... I never ever write bad reviews but after tonight's dinner I have to. I was so hungry and sad that the staff forgot about our table that I started to tear. Bye punjAb. I'll go to dishoom,-1
3,"Wong Kei is one of the many options you'll find in the heart of London's Chinatown. There are several floors, and someone will direct you to a table. 
Food: It's simple and straightforward. The roasts hanging in their window are done well - duck, BBQ pork, roast pork. I had the pork and century egg congee, with a side of roast park. Congee was full of meat and egg, and had the right amount of ginger. The roast pork was fresh, with a crispy skin, and the meat was tender and not dry. 
Service: Food comes out quickly, and you'll be left alone to enjoy it. Reasonably attentive if you need something. 
Cost: The two items with tea cost me £17.50. 
Overall: It isn't fancy, but it does offer some decent food at decent prices.",-1
5,Food was really good and prices were reasonable. They have a gluten free menu that includes choices of deserts. I went with kids and they all loved the food. Portions are a bit small but then we got to order several different dishes and liked all of them. Service was quick and staff was polite. It is pretty casual and loud so kids were just fine being themselves. They add 12.5% tip to the bill. It seems like a popular place ... we made reservations and on our way out there was a long line of people outside.,1
1,Inaccurate advertising. No gluten free options whatsoever. Not sure why that's posted or why this keeps coming up as the number one spot for gluten free Noodles. Will keep on looking....,-1
4,"The dim sums were good, but the main course was just average. The ambiance and drinks were good. Have been at Hakkasen at other locations, but the food is always a hit or miss.",1
2,"All that glitters is not gold. The disparity between the hype and the reality of the Chiltern firehouse was so extreme it needed calling out.
This is a beautiful location and it's buzzing, but once inside it felt like you were part of a machine designed to get you in and out, and onto the next guest.
Above all, it was the lack of consistency in terms of food and service that was astounding.
Too fast to take orders & way too slow to deliver them. Food was brought to the table out of sequence. Insipid cocktails, staff with a lack of basic knowledge on the drinks / food offering. The signature dish, 'Pork Iberico', was tough & dry and, worst of all, the 'maple sweet potato' side dish was so sweet it was inedible.
The whole operation appeared almost random, apparently lacking an authoritative maitre d' to ensure it flowed professionally.
There were several highlights, including some of the food dishes (Carrot blunts, Short rib, Octopus), but way too few to warrant the price and the reputation, especially when London has so many other great restaurants.
The one saving grace was our main server, who was excellent -  she was the only redemption for a venue that has built a reputation for being coolest eatery in town, yet completely lacked the attention to detail to deserve that accolade.",-1
5,"Delicious Dim Sum. Would heartily recommend the set menus, as they do provide enough food for oen hungry person. But if you're really hungry, add a few items from the main menu. The Honey Chicken rice pot (can't remember the precise name) is absolutely delicious!
Oh, and if you're thirsty, consider ordering a tea. They are served in lovely insulated glasses, and you can get one of the blossoming one, making for a beautiful slow motion show while you eat.",1
4,"The ramen was awesome. Had the kimchi and traditional. Would give it 5 stars but it is a little too pricy for ramen. Also they have some questionable things on the bars (E.g. hair ties- gross what if they are reused? Also nothing covering the chopsticks.)
For two pints and two frames it was about 62$ USA. In Los Angeles this would have cost us 25$ USA. So not sure why the price was so high.",1
5,"Delicious food!!! The dim sum quality is amazing. My favourite was definitely the cheung fun with bean curd. They added an extra tea to our bill, so they offered us a refund or a choice of dessert to go. We got 6 super tasty macaroons and I was just amazed by this service, since the tea had only cost around 3 pounds. The food isn't cheap but the whole experience for me was outstanding.",1
1,Very disappointing ordinary food. There are so many great Indians in london this doesn't hold a candle to most .,-1
4,"AH the restaurant was just so pretty with all the flower towers. I had the truffle pasta. It was very simple taste and I loved it. My friend had the lunch special two course meal with foie gras and lamb chop. They were really good too! 
Their coffee was super good too. When we ordered the coffee it came with a set of three desserts! They were very nice.",1
4,"When I think of upmarket restaurants that fail to disappoint in London, this is (so far) pretty much the top of my list!

The decor and lighting was perfect, the food was even better than I'd imagined, and being able to share the signature menu meant we both got a taster of varied Hakkasan specialities without spending £££s.",1
5,"I have eaten at better restaurants, I have eaten better dim sum, I have had better service. But somehow this restaurant still gets 5 stars because I always come out feeling like I've had the loveliest treat ever. The quality of the teas (and tea cocktails), the beauty of the dim sum, the ritual of it all, and the fish and flowers.
 Yauatcha is a hybrid of a swanky dim sum restaurant and a very posh tea house. Although it's possible to eat dim sum upstairs, the restaurant is technically downstairs, and tea and cake upstairs. The two are very different in character; upstairs is light and airy and downstairs is dark and sexy.
 When you book to eat, you can choose upstairs or downstairs. Evening meals go downstairs, light snacks, afternoon tea, upstairs. You cannot choose the exact spot when you book, however I recommend once you get there that you specify you would like to sit in the main section downstairs, not around the side. In fact you should insist upon this, and prepare to wait a bit longer. Although this may be a hassle, you will enjoy it far more, I promise.
 As a reasonably critical person who has visited Yauatcha countless times over the last six years, which is akin to giving the place spot checks throughout its history, I can say one thing: Yauatcha is consistent. As such it's a great place to entertain friends, treat clients, or take one's partner.
 The style of decor, food, and service treads that fine line between being suitable for business and for romance. One can equally bring one's glamorous Persian girlfriend here late on a Friday night, and one's aging mother for a Sunday afternoon tea. (Currently one has the latter, not the former...)
 You may find the front of house snooty. Personally I love it. I don't want to be greeted and subsequently ignored by anyone other than the impossibly (I'm not allowed to say ""pathologically"" am I? No) slim, beautiful girls who do it so brilliantly. I like my FOH efficient, with that edge of slight disdain that says ""you do realise where you are, don't you?""
 The dim sum is inventive and seasonal, the ingredients are fresh. The menu has naturally changed over the last few years but the favourites still exist to this day; the Baked Venison Puff is a must, although the venison is a little more stodgy than it used to be but the pastry has got even better. Sadly the shark fin soup appears to be off the menu - it's probably best though, isn't it? Oh and I love the latest (Autumn 2010?) addition of the Crystal Dumplings - lovely little translucent steamed things stuffed with pumpkin and pine nut. The Lotus Leaf Rice is another simple, well-executed crowd-pleaser. Mooli puffs are fun little creatures to behold, they are vegetable dumplings with a pastry exterior rolled into the exact shape (and presumably dyed to the same colour) as a little carrot, with some spinach coming out the top. This is high-end-pastry-chef-meets-Roger-Rabbit and I heartily approve.
 It's a terrible shame their cake counter has been replaced. Yauatcha staff say this is because the cake chef left in Autumn 2009. Oh, the gold-flecked chocolate ganaches - I mourn their passing. (I'm not serious. Actually no yes I am.) Nevertheless the macaroons are still great.
 The downstairs decor is stunning. You know how some people, when they walk out of the house, they put on a suit and look smart, at all times? Even if they put on a bit of a shabby jacket, they still look ridiculously hot? The interior decor of Yauatcha is that person. It could never become a bit tatty, because it's so hot in the first place. The tropical fish and the flower displays are very special indeed. Music is ambient and always at the perfect level for conversation, and the restaurant's acoustic allows it to become quite lively when busy, but never too loud. It has a lovely bustly feel, but I never get offended by loud groups here. (I usually hate loud groups.)
 I personally love to enjoy food at Yauatcha on a Sunday afternoon, post-lunch, when the service is relaxed and the downstairs restaurant is quiet.
 I'm sure it's possible to bring children, but really it's not that kind of place - in case you hadn't guessed. Personally I find it nice to get away from restaurants (especially Sunday afternoons!) that are brimming with prams and cots and toys and screams.
 Oh, and the bill? It's not pricey especially compared to a number of notably inferior chain dim sum restaurants I could name (some are very nearby...)
 It caters for all appetites and tastes in food. You simply can't go wrong. Go!",1
3,"Not that I'm an Indian food know-it-all, let me start off by saying that eating here was like eating at any Indian restaurant worth its curry in Jersey City, Iselin or Edison, NJ - those in the know will know what I mean, but at least there you get more food for your money - I'm not looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet, far from it, but the butter chicken had two pieces of chicken in it - c'mon! The sauce was delicious, though. 
Don't get me wrong, the food here is good - Punjab is touted as the oldest Indian restaurant in London in continuance operation, and for good reason. 
The pumpkin curry was probably the best thing on the menu - spectacular.  All the food was fresh and tasty.  We ordered a variety of dishes, rice dishes, nan, chicken tikka masala, etc.  The wait staff was very attentive and there when you needed them.  The Sikh patrolling the rooms, making sure everything was done just right, transported you back to the time of the British Raj - the good times, not the bad.
Anyway, that said, food was good, prices a bit high, and typical of London you gotta eat ethnic foods or die trying.",-1
3,"I suppose I should start this by saying that I'm not a fan of curry or indian food.
.............................
With that, I hear immigration calling...they want their visa back.
But seriously, I went with a group of friends hoping that the light would shine down and I would fall magically in love with all things Indian, and live a happy life satisfying late night cravings with poppadoms and tikka masala to my heart's content.
Well, that didn't happen. Punjab put up a good try though. There was nothing to complain about, the service was excellent, the food was good. i had chicken korma and the portion was large for the price, and tasted good. My friends all enjoyed their courses and alcohol was reasonable for being in downtown London.
The inside had some interesting colour schemes going on, and really wasn't a fan of the mustard yellow. I'd say give it a try, but don't expect his holiness, the Lord of Naan to shine down on you after your done.",-1
3,Dishoom is mentioned in the Time Out tour guide. I was quite disappointed to try the Bomba[y] Omelette. What is special about it? It tasted like a simple omelette to me. It was cool to learn about the tradition of Bombay Cafes in London from the history lesson on the menu.,-1
3,yesterday i  visited this popular restaurant and try many dishes. as a traditional cantonese，i think the food here is good and fresh. however， i donot think the food is match with its price.the service here is not very good. the staff always push their customer to eat quickly .the table is extremely small. i do not recommend it.,-1
3,"Food was tasty, but service was lacking.
I got the butter chicken and the saag paneer.  The butter chicken was as advertised, two pieces of bone-in chicken smothered in a creamy butter sauce.  The saag paneer had a decent kick to it.  I saw someone get the chicken tikka special, I think I will get that next time with a side of masala as one of the other reviewers recommended.
Worth a stop if your unsure which quick Indian place you want to jump into.",-1
5,"Bone Daddies is surely my favourite restaurant in London to eat ramen. I love them all, but I have a little favourite : the Tonkotsu ramen. All the broths are delicious and very tasty. 
I go to Bone Daddies at least once a month if not more.
My friends and I shared tenderstem broccoli and fried chicken while we were waiting for our ramen to be cooked. The broccoli were nicely cooked but none of us liked the sauce served with it. We didn't think it's taste went well with broccoli. Instead we ate them with soy sauce. The Fried chicken were good and tasty. I liked the fact the batter was not too greasy and slightly spiced.",1
5,"Summary: 5 stars even against my list of 40+ noodle soup places globally.  Quality ingredients are why you pay the price of 11£.  Appetizers are nice.  Great service. Don't be such a snob, wear the bib.
Atmosphere:  It's a little noisy, but the decor is so cute.  Would absolutely recommend going with friends.  Went for lunch.  Very few people at that time, though I'm told lines are quite long.  To get the full experience, you should wear the bib and tie hair. Not too many people were doing this. I think that's a mistake.  
Service:  Excellent.  Nice happy greeting when I walked in.  Very quick service.  Ideal for the short span I had for lunch.  
Food: Full Stars!!
Soft shell crab - 4 stars!  well tempura'd and cleaned.  As an appetizer, it's not bad. I wouldn't rave like the others on the list, but I can't rate it low either.  The mayonese mustard was ok.  Solid execution, but just not quite my thing.  This was not the basis of my rating.
The ramen - 5 stars!  On the suggestion of Yee Gan, I had the tonkutsu.  The broth is a delicious thick meaty hearty yum.  The noodles were reasonable, though I have had slightly better quality noodle.  This was not bad though.  The egg was wonderfully marinated in soy teriyaki, the pork retained it's own sweet flavor.  I really appreciated the toasted garlic.  Have not seen that one, or at least not so well executed. If you're a huge garlic fan, they also have a garlic press that allows you to add to your heart's content. Other condiments include hot chili, which I like versus the typical Japanese hot powder.
Soft serve green tea ice cream -  5 stars! I find myself surprised that I have such high marks for ice cream.  This was particularly good.  Aside from having just the right green tea and sweetness (not too overpoweringly sweet), the soft serve texture was something special on an unseasonably warm sunny day.  Amazing and worth trying!",1
1,"Michelin Guide ""recommended"" my ass. Six hours after eating I woke up all nauseous in the middle of the night. Proceeded to rush into the bathroom with mud butt diarrhea and then vomit. 
Aside from the bout of foodborne illness I'm currently experiencing, the food was less than mediocre at best. This was my first time here and I ordered the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. The tonkotsu broth is nothing to write home about (incredibly bland for boasting that it takes 12 hours to cook), the chashu was flavorless, and the noodles were... well, comparatively similar to everything else that's supposedly good about their ramen. When the ramen was brought out, the broth and egg were cold but the noodles were hot. At the end, I couldn't bring myself to finish the bowl and that's rare as I normally devour ramen instantly.
Overall, 10/10 would AVOID this place like the bubonic plague.",-1
3,Booked a few weeks in advance to secure a table for weekend brunch. The decor inside is lovely but finding the actual restaurant once you've entered the premise is a bit of a maze. It could do with some signposting or a person guiding patrons through. Though we had a reservation at 2:00- we were told to wait for 25 mins.  When we were sat I promptly ordered the peach mint champagne spritzer. It didn't end up arriving until after the food which was crazy- also served in a highball glass which I felt the presentation could have been better. The food was flavoursome but portions are small for the price. I ordered the eggs florentine and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict. The eggs florentine was flavoursome but I can't attest to saying it was anything out of the ordinary. My friend and I shared a stack of the pancakes which we both enjoyed and we were glad we ordered as did not feel full from our egg dishes. Service was consistent and decor inside is lovely however I wouldn't rush to come back here- expensive and nothing out of the ordinary.,-1
4,"If nothing else, go here for the Wagyu Beef Puffs. They were unlike anything I have ever had and definitely worth the stop, I wanted to order about 3 more orders after finishing them.
Not to mention the drink menu is so unique in that they have a tea menu, and alcohol menu and one that encompasses the two. The ambiance also makes it a great spot for a date or even for a party of one. Enjoy!",1
3,"3 Stars = ""A-OK"" and that's how I felt about this place. The food was good (4 stars), the atmosphere and decor makes it more of a homey places. Basically, the two didn't match well together. It almost seems like a great top chef lost his job at a Michelin Star restaurant and went to work at a ""normal"" restaurant.
Whether or not this is a good or bad thing is up to you and your personality. I usually expect the two to match because of the company I'm with, but if you are just a casual dinner looking for great food, this is your place. The food and it's presentation is far beyond the way the restaurant looked and operated.",-1
4,"Wong Kei used to be infamous for cheap, filling Chinese food and rude waiters who would scold you and it was all part of the fun. I used to go as a student a long time ago and so it's officially a London eating 'institution' in my book. For me, the brusqueness of the staff translates to efficiency which I would take any day over ineptitude and slowness which drives me mad.
It was the first time I've been back since the re-opening or new management or whatever happened. On this occasion I was dining solo (always a good spot for solo dining) and was immediately directed to one of the solo dining tables right in the entrance area. The waiter came straight over and asked me what I wanted. I kind of like that, taking me for a regular because if I did know, I would just say right away. I asked for a menu instead since it had been a while...
I ordered a wonton soup and singapore noodles. Pretty straightforward.
My order came quickly and I was surprised to see that the wonton soup was a large bowlful with plenty of wontons which were really good. Prawn and pork, freshly made with big chunks of prawn with a good ginger note. It made me think how good this was especially for the price around £3.50 vs the £11 bowls of ramen noodles that have sprung up everywhere (was never comfortable with paying £11 for a bowl of soup noodles).
Singapore noodles also didn't scrimp on the meat and shrimp and a good sized portion. A bit overly salty not helped by the salty soup but overall solid.
Complimentary tea.
So. If in the mood for a quick spot of Chinese in the centre of town and want to get served quickly with no hype and no queues then come here.
Great value and good food. Still love Wong Kei and the quality seemed better than before.",1
4,"Ramen was pretty good.  
Would have liked the broth and roast pork to be warmer/hot.    Service a little lacking and unorganized.",1
4,"Bone Daddies was always going to be a hit with me. It has two things I absolutely love, ramen and rock. This Peter street outlet is where it all started...as a simple ramen bar. The interior has Japanese inspired graphics, and pictures of Japanese rockers plastered all over the walls. Diners are seated on stools at high tables. The rest of the Bone Daddies experience comes courtesy of an all-out onslaught on the senses, the noise, the smells, the tastes - fantastic.
To start, we ordered the Salmon Tartar, Wild Soft Shell Crab, and Edamame. I regret not ordering the Korean Fried Chicken Wings which, the couple sharing our high-table so thoroughly seemed to have enjoyed. Our salmon, which is served with a lime wasabi ponzu, was really good; the salmon so fresh I could swear it had a pulse. The soft-shelled crabs come with an out-of-this-world Thai green curry, chilli and ginger sauce - OMG!
For our mains, we ordered the oddly named T22, which is a soy ramen, a Kimchee Ramen and my favourite, Spicy Miso Ramen - all amazing; my spicy miso ramen as good as any I have had in Tokyo (and believe me I have had a lot). The noodles are not just genuine ramen noodles but they were cooked perfectly.
Service is good for London, and it's fast; they're just too busy to be friendly. Expect to stand in a queue, either in-doors or out, for up to 15-minutes. I'm not sure if they accept reservations. I think not. Irrespective, if you're looking for an authentic ramen in London, this is the place to come.
Waste NOT. Want NOT.",1
5,"This is the real deal for Indian cuisine. Cafe style restaurant, a small menu, really tasty food, good service, buzzy atmosphere and best of all reasonably priced. 
£25 pp including a bottle of wine, VAT and service. 
My best tip is to get here at geriatric eating time around 5pm to avoid queuing outside for ages.",1
5,"This is my favourite ramen joint in London. It is simply divine, and the portion sizes are guaranteed to leave you satisfied. 
I've tried a few of the ramen bowls they have here and love most of them. The T22 is probably my die hard favourite. As other people have said, you could probably get slightly more authentic ramen elsewhere; this is somewhat westernized ramen. That being said, it's still very delicious. Ingredients like the egg and cock scratchings are always done perfectly. Bone Daddies is also very allergen friendly. They're always happy to customize a dish for you.
Besides for the ramen...
The fried chicken is one of my favourite starters. I couldn't possibly recommend it more. However, I don't love the pork/corn croquettes, and I think most of their sashimi is somewhat overpriced. 
I've had some sort of green tea sesame alcoholic smoothie there once that was on their specials board. It was divine and I keep hoping they'll bring it back sometime. Their other milkshakes, when they have them, are often equally good. 
As a last tip, make sure you have a fair bit of time on your hands. I've always been served quickly, but have also always had to queue for at least 30 minutes (as they don't take reservations).",1
4,I love yuatcha and always go here to satisfy a dim sum craving and then treat myself with the absolutely amazing macarons afterwards. Highly recommended.,1
4,"i've never really understood the ramen craze, but then I came here!
Whenever I have to queue for my dinner I am skeptical, but the queue goes quite quickly. The restaurant is pretty cramped and getting from one corner to the toilet is a bit of an obstacle course!
The food itself though is great. The stock is so rich and so delicious. Will definitely be going again!",1
4,"Great service. Order the lamb salad. Truly memorable, although I'm not sure why they call it a salad. The Pipa Duck is also marvelous.",1
5,"This place is a london classic. I remember going here once a few years back and enjoying an evening's free entertainment as a bunch of drunk so-and-so's started a massive fight with the waiters good times. The resteraunt isn't really like that anymore though and the staff are a lot more friendly nowadays. The food is cheap; dirt cheap by London standards. Expect to pay about 3 quid for most mains (noodles/rice dishes etc) and up to ten quid for some of the pricier dishes. The menu is variable in quality but most dishes are ok and some are true gems. The singapore noodles, for example, are some of the best in London and the Hong Kong style pork chops are another highlight. Service is a little curt but, as I said, not so unfriendly anymore and very quick.",1
4,"Lovely romantic anniversary dinner paired with delicious wine by a fantastic sommelier, let down by the fact we weren't placed in the conservatory as promised.
Myself and partner ate here for our anniversary dinner in October, after I made reservations months in advance. We were welcomed into a beautiful restaurant with impeccably dressed staff, and seated just outside the conservatory; a beautiful intimate light studded garden scene. This is my only negative, and I'd asked and been promised to be seated in this area- so I seated faced away so she could look at it in bliss and I could stare at the well stocked bar.
Food was great- we ate the Pumpkin & Pine nut soup and the Braised Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit, Sweet & Sour Black Radish & Wholegrain Mustard Mousseline for starters. Delicious, really truly delicious. Even the bread basket was utterly morish, especially the rosemary focaccia. We asked for more, happily given.
Mains were the Oven Roasted Venison Fillet, season autumnal vegetables, truffle & potato mash, with a slow cooked beef & potato gratin side; and Slow Cooked Fillet of Scottish Cod 'Rougaille' Roasted Vermicelli, Mussel & Iberico Chorizo Fideuà. Venison was perfectly cooked, as was the cod. Felt the cod dish didn't hugely work together, but might be my personal feeling- didn't leave me with a 'wow' feeling unlike the rest of the food. 
Wine- The sommelier was extremely helpful and paired us two different wine wines for starters, and another white (for her) and deep red for my venison. I've completely lost my notes on what they were, but will update when I read their extensive wine list.
We were so full we skipped on dessert barring a decent but not special coffee. Which was fine as they brought out a plate with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate and some cake. Nice touch and I had forgotten I'd told them!
Leaving I had a great talk with the front of house about their wine cellar whom nearly brought me down for a look but construction was going on. Next time!
Overall- 100% recommended. Expensive yes, coming in around £120, but once utterly worth it. Get into the conservatory however! It's magical.",1
5,"Simply the benchmark: perfect service, superb, nuanced food, the perfect  place for a leisurely dinner with good friends.  I have had the pleasure twice, and cannot wait to repeat it.",1
4,"I was taken here recently, specifically to be ""impressed,"" and Hakkasan is very much a place to see and be seen. It's tucked away in a subterranean space on a small side street, but once you get inside, it's overwhelming for the senses, with ultramodern décor and a loud, lively lounge atmosphere. 
I tried a number of plates, including the dim sum platter, the stir-fry black pepper beef, and the sweet and sour pork. All were of reasonably high quality and presented gorgeously, if a bit small in size. The drinks were exceptionally strong. Even though I spread out 2 cocktails over 6 shared plates, I still stumbled dizzily up the steps and onto the street as we left later that evening. 
I hate being a party pooper, but it wasn't necessarily the best Chinese I've had - and I'm of Chinese descent to begin with. It was simply very good. I guess stylish décor, attention to detail, and reasonable food quality is all it takes to dress up otherwise conventional Chinese food into a Michelin star and command a truly spectacular price premium.
In the end, I enjoyed the overall experience, although I must stress that I'm by no means a high-maintenance person when it comes to being ""impressed."" ;) All in all, if you're ready to pay a pretty penny, then it's not a bad choice for a special night out or to celebrate with friends.",1
3,"The hosts are very rude, it made me leave before even thinking about asking for a table, but we decided to give it another try later on. Hosts are still rude, so we just decided to grab drinks and a dessert rather than spending money here on dinner if it was going to be just as disappointing as the staff. Luckily, the bar staff is a little nicer. We ordered a carafe of red wine and dessert, which was not worth remembering the name. It was like a panda cotta with a creme brûlée top (torched sugar) which was unevenly torched, the middle too burnt and the sides left with raw sugar. I did feel like the flavors were wonderful, but the presentation was unimpressive. Overall, my experience here was not worth coming back. If you're looking for nicely done french food, keep searching. I will say the ambiance is aimed for a more romantic feel, but the decor is very similar to that of the Cheesecake Factory (an American chain restaurant.) 
I apologize for the not so great photos, the lighting inside at night is not ideal for photos and I didn't care enough to waste my time editing them.",-1
3,"I really, really, really wanted to like the Cinnamon Club.
It's a great locale, set in the old Westminster Library, very art-deco-ish (if you like that kind of stuff), has an exclusive feel to it as you enter, but then things kind of progressively deflated as the evening wore on.
Let's start with the bar, where we had to wait 15-20m despite having reservations at 830pm and having arrived on time. People have gushed about the bar, but seriously, the room is a bit incongruous, the furniture mismatched, and the overall seating arrangement a bit weird. We ordered 2 martinez's (sp??)... however, which were truly excellently mixed. Chapeau to the bar tender.
We got seated, and I must say, the service for the most part was excellent. They moved us to a quiet corner, which, if you've been there, you know is difficult to achieve; the high ceilings reverberate, and the atmosphere gets pretty loud... which is great if you want to keep your conversations private.
Now on with the food:
For appetisers, we shared the:
Grilled Scottish king scallops with hot lentil chutney, smoked Devon crab puree (17£)
Hot yoghurt and chickpea soup with crisp pink aubergine steaks (£8)
Char-grilled Welsh lamb fillet with nutmeg, sweetbread bhaji and caper kachumber (£10)
Everything tasted delicious... except for the amount of money we were dishing out, I was expecting more bang for the buck, if you know what I mean. The scallops tasted amazing, but they were tiny! So great on the taste front, but really poor on the value for taste front. I know, I know, it's all about quality, not quantity... but I don't buy that BS. It's possible to have amazing quality with non military ration inspired amounts of food. This is just pure customer margin extraction.
I had ordered a bottle of NZ Syrah... which was great... except 5 different waiters kept trying to pour my partner for the evening a glass of wine, despite numerous requests not to do so. I don't particularly like 'servititis', and the overzealous servers at the Club do have a little bit of that going on....
The mains were even better (and the portions reasonably more adequate):
Chargrilled Halibut with Kashmiri fennel and ginger sauce (£25)
Tandoor wild Spencer Gulf king prawns with Goan curry sauce, pandan, and coconut rice (£27.50)
The halibut tasted amazing, and the 4, let's say 'princely' rather than 'king' prawns were out of this world. But, I kept thinking back to my time living in Mumbai, where we would go to the ITC Hotel near the International Airport, and gorge ourselves on fat, juicy, tandoori tiger prawns for less than 10$. It made the 7£ per prawn slightly more expensive that I was happy with. Again, call me a miser... but I can't escape my internal benchmarks.
For dessert, we had the 'Lime Cheesecake' and the 'Pudding, Pecan Nuts with Garam Masala ice cream'.
Forget the cheesecake, it's a lump of 'crème fraiche' mixed through with some lime rind or something. Boring and uneventful.... the pudding however is to die for. The combination with the garam masala ice cream is out of this world, with the slight hint of heat from the masala accentuating the depth of the chocolate (kind of making it like an Indian version of mole sauce)... and the ice cream cooling stuff off. Nice combo. Worth coming back just for dessert next time (will help not to break the bank ;).
All in all, 200£ for 2 people. 
Was it worth it ? No.
Would I do it again ? Only for dessert ;)
Was the food good ? Yes
Could I get as good quality somewhere else, minus some originality? Yes
Now, don't let that detract you from seeing for yourself what the fuss is about.",-1
5,Try the pecking duck. The cocktails are delicious. Service is impecable and ambience is very cool. A bit pricey but worth the trip.,1
4,"I echo other's reviews regarding the duck! It was definitely fantastic, in particularly how crispy it was cooked (I mean obviously crispy on the outside whilst very tender on the inside!).
Overall a really lovely environment and I also liked staff and their professionalism.",1
5,"Went here a few years ago with family while we were in town.  Amazing food, and even made a dish without soy sauce for someone in our group who was allergic.  I think I had the mango duck and it was great.",1
1,"I can't believe this place is getting such excellent reviews! No, I'm really shocked! The food is so commercial but then again I saw a lot of tourists in line. Yes, there is a line to get into this place, and yes, I waited on it! So annoyed that I did. There were empty tables for way too long as people waited out in the cold. They are not seating people intentionally to cast an impression that people are dying to get in! Back to food: salty, commercial Indian. My Ruby chicken was cold. My okra fries were way too salty. This is basically the TJ Friday's of Indian! Man, what a hoax.",-1
3,"Main reason for the mediocre review is I felt really rushed though my meal. I can appreciate wanting to ensure I made my show time (reservation at 6pm, show at 7:30), but still I had an appetizer and my main in front of me by 6:20pm... and that was after leisurely looking through the menu! Also, the restaurant itself gave a very cramped feeling. So much so the couple next to me and I commented on it.
The appetizer (octopus, tomato, basil) wasn't exactly flavorful. The main (stone bass) was more up to par with a delicious artichoke purée. 
 
The bottle wine list was very extensive with plenty of French wine to choose from. The wines by the glass had reasonable selection.
All-in-all, I'd say a touch above average for this caliber of a restaurant. If someone brought me back here it'd be ok, but I would seek out another place for myself.",-1
1,"Worst experience - no one to greet you as entered into the restaurant. Then when someone finally arrived they told us to go to table 43 without someone actually showing us to the table so we were left to wander the restaurant looking for our table. Then after trying to call numerous waiters to get our order, no one bothered to attend to us after 30min - didn't bother to wait around to give our orders in.",-1
4,"The atmosphere was a bit pretentious, and I was not a fan of the whole ""designer-y"" look. The drinks and food were delicious though, and the seafood clay pot is one of the best dishes I have ever had.",1
4,"First time I've been here, there were 10 of us, which was frankly too many for the circular tables. Best to go with two or three people. Unused to picking the food as well, which basically involves ticking a paper list after studying the menu, and then handing your choices to the waiter, who was very attentive, constantly filling our glasses with water. I had the duck spring rolls, which were delicious, the pork bun, likewise delicious, and a hot and sour soup, which was a tiny portion that quite disappointed me. 23, 26 and 138. The toilets here are very strange and deserve a mention. Basically you wash your hands by putting them underneath a counter, at which point you may encounter female hands, as teh water is shared with the girls toilets. This is just odd, as naughty pervert girls can look straight at the urinals. Splitting the bill caused a few problems as we had all decided to split evenly before the meal, then some people only wanted to pay for two courses, but it was still good value, I ended up paying £11.20 for three servings which would have cost me about £9.60 had I been on my own, which is a pretty good ratio when I remember some of the shared bills I experienced at places such as Pizza Express, where the wine drinkers and bread eaters benefited tremendously.",1
4,"Great Asian restaurant in Soho!
Ambiance is gorgeous--a salt water aquarium, beautiful blue hued decor, very modern. The chairs and tables were lower to the ground than usual, which was interesting.
The service was top notch, very solicitous....until the last few minutes when we had to ask for our bill instead of it being brought to us, but that was minor.
The food was really delicious! The sweet and sour soup with mushroom was very flavorful and thick....and served piping hot in a bowl with a lid. The Thai chicken was crispy yet moist and tasty, not spicy.
The Kung pao chicken was quite good but had way too many peppers in it--they were a quarter of the dish! 
The vegetable fried rice was so good-- lots of flavor.
And we had one of their slices of mocha cake for dessert; so much flavor packed into a few delicious bites!
Pricey but worth it!",1
4,it offers very authentic chinese dim sum and beautifully decorated desserts. the environment is very elegent and suitable for dates. the service is great. highly recommended.,1
3,"I heard about Bone Daddies through a tantalizing photograph I found on reddit. When I first saw the pic I thought - ugh another delicious ramen picture from a traveller in Japan and was delighted that it was actually a spot in London. 
I got in around 6:30 and waited 5 minutes before we were seated. The service is quick and the food came out very quickly. My choice to order was easy as there is 1 vegetarian ramen on the menu. 
The ramen noodles were chewy but the thin kind that tend to get soggy quickly so slurp quickly! The vegetarian mushroom broth was pretty average. The flavour was one-dimensional and it was just a strong umami taste. No spice or creaminess that I've had in other vegetarian ramens. The toppings are perfectly cooked and the eggs yolks were golden and runny which was perfect. 
The overall experience was great and I understand why there was a long line-up of people waiting in the rain on a Monday night to get in. Didn't hit the spot on my ramen craving but I would recommend to non-vegetarians!",-1
1,"Don't bother with this place. They take reservations and never once say you cannot bring kids (mine are close to 6 and 10). We had this reservation to do dinner coming from Boston. I have taken my most well behaved kids to Mori Motto's, Michelin star restaurants and never once have been turned down. Basically have the curtsy to say that on you website. Manager had the gall to tell me he will recommend some other place. Thanks but no thanks we are foodies, we don't take recommendations from you. Very rude staff.",-1
3,"I went to the one in St.Katherines Docks just before Christmas, and considering I'm not a massive fan of Dim Sum I was pretty impressed.
 The food was full of flavour, which I was pretty surprised to discover because I normally find Dim Sum not up to much in the tantalising the tastebud department.
 Oh and I must also mention the pretty Jasmine tea, where the flower opens up as it soaks up the hot water.
 Very nice.",-1
2,"I ate here on a Thursday night,fairly late, and the street level kitchen was quite busy.  The chicken leg appetizer was pretty good.  The samosa was fairly standard (a little too much of something in it, though).  The chicken curry was very good, whereas the lamb curry was marginal.  The banana chips were very good. 
The biggest problem was that the server brought the entire meal all at once (from the guava juice down to the curry), and by the time we finished appetizers the main was cold.  I asked why they did it, and the server said she did it because we didn't tell her not to.   Unusual, to say the least.",-1
5,"If you like rich fatty unctuous (yes, I said that overused food critic descriptor) ramen then you can't get much better than Bone Daddies unless you go to Japan of course. This place is all hyped rock n' roll non-traditional but really does that matter as long as the ramen is good? Like I said the broth is silky smooth and super creamy - my favorite way to have ramen. The noodles are springy and the chase pork was tender. Everything was super tasty. I wish they would put out the free pickles like they do in Japan but that's a small quibble. The home made pickles are worth ordering as an appetizer and an antidote to the richness of the ramen broth. The ramen bowl was enough for me without any other snacks. I wasn't even able to finish the bowl but I've grown accustomed to ramen coming in man-sized portions.
They don't take reservations and they don't have a waitlist where you can leave and wander about, you'll have to wait in line and people don't rush in/out like they do in Japan so be prepared.",1
5,"WOW!!!!! A friend recommended this restaurant and I have to say, one of my faves in London!! Its like Dim Sum fine dining!! The menu is unstoppable, so, we need to go back and try everything else!! hahaha!!   Everything to share , order at least 7 per 2 if hungry!! Try thier citrus martini!! mmmmmmm! Perfect dinner after the Michael Jackson Thriller Live show!!!  Service was FAST and GREAT!!!",1
1,"OK food, expensive, absolutely terrible service.  There are so many good Indian restaurants within walking distance of this standby.  Choose the others.",-1
2,"My friends and I decided to continue our girls dinners with an early dinner at Hakkasan mid week. We found a £35 Taste of Hakkasan menu, which includes 3 courses and a cocktail - not a bad offer! 
When arriving at the 'original' London Hakkasan off of Tottenham Court Road you go down a dark stairway, past the blue lit reception area, into a dark and moodily lit space with the bar at the back.
After a first cocktail at the bar we were shown to our table, they kinda squashed us in, but it was a nice round table.
We had Dim Sum and Crispy Duck Rolls for starters, then a choice of either Roasted Silver Cod, Pipa Duck (more crispy duck - I can't get enough of it!) or Stir Fry Black Pepper Rib Eye.
Desserts were selected from the full main menu - I can recommend the chocolate one!
So what's the verdict? 
The food looked & tasted amazing too, I was only uncertain about the sauce with the Roast Silver Cod, but that wasn't my dish!. Unfortunately the dinner was let down by the service. With a Michellin starred restaurant I expect a certain level, certainly not what we received.
Not only did we get told that the Taste menu wasn't for those that were hungry - a suggestion that we literally were not going to get enough food, but also the impression that we were being looked down on for choosing this option - staff repeatedly walked into me when serving or clearing the table (it's not that dark in there surely?!) and food didn't arrive at the table at the same time.
I can't excuse any of these issues when I've been to similar caliber restaurants (Roux at the Landau and Maze) on similar deals and been treated superbly, so this is something that Hakkasan should work on for all levels of client - not just those dropping £700 for dinner for two (true story, but it wasn't me!).
And the staff member was wrong - we had plenty of food and left feeling stuffed, especially after a pot of tea, post dessert.",-1
3,"Duck, soy chicken, crispy pork--- those are all you need to know. On my trip to London, I came back here twice because my boyfriend and I wanted more! We opted for the three meat plate each time and it was plenty of food to share. Their duck was juicy and not too fatty. I don't think it was a life changing dish but it was solid. What we really enjoyed, surprisingly, was their soy chicken. It was moist and had just a hint of flavor from the soy sauce. Their crispy pork was also solid and a nice textural difference to have. 
As for their other options, we were not impressed. We also tried their Peking style duck which was too dry and was definitely not worth the price. It honestly tasted like it was sitting out for too long. Their calamari wasn't special and was overcooked. I don't even really remember the other dishes we tried because they weren't that good.",-1
3,"Need to keep it short and sweet for this place ! The food here is very interesting and delicious. We ate in the dining room and ordered a couple of dishes such as palak paneer, naan, tarka dal, chilli paneer and an eggplant main whose name I cannot remember. The food was quite good ...not your typical Indian fare with layers of oil. Now the bad part - The service was shoddy ...we waited and waited for our starters and mains. The server was polite but seems like it is not managed very well. A big '0' for the value for money part :( :( The portions were shockingly small ! Now I am not a big eater ...but if I don't feel at least half full ..it is a sign that the quantity sucked. Not sure if the portions are this tiny because they are bending over backwards to remain on Oxford St ! Please avoid this place if you want a bang for your buck. An average meal for two will burn a hole in your pocket and leave you hungry for more (literally!). Such a disappointing meal :( and such a high cost 50 GBP for it !",-1
3,"Came here late around 9pm on a Sunday to celebrate Chinese New Year and feast on some food after a few beers locally. As with most Chinese restaurants don't expect great customer service. It's not their forte. Though you will get service charge added, so expect that.
We got the roasted duck, which it is famed for. I had many recommendations that this was THE place to get duck from in Chinatown. A whole one of course. They had unfortunately run out of crispy pork belly (another rec), so we settled from BBQ pork which was really good.
The duck was good. Fatty, juicy, though we kept it on the bone for flavour and this meant it was awkward to eat into. Duck is hard to cut like this, so the pieces er eaten eaten whole or bitten using hands.
Very nice overall.",-1
4,"This is a great little place, part of the ever-expanding Ping Pong dim-sum chain. The food is divine, and it's a handy place to grab something whilst soaking in some culture around the South Bank. Service can vary wildly, however, they are usually quick but it can be a bit impersonal. It's always REALLY busy too so be prepared to wait.
 Overall a top tip to grab some food before a concert or gallery.",1
3,"Nice Indian restaurant with a not quite matching relation between price and service. Where the service itself is ok, but the food quality, that is got, does not really match the price given. I don't understand why you order Indian food and have to order the rise or nan bread in addition. At least a portion of rise should come with the food.
So after all you feel a little cheated, though the quality is ok.
The overall feeling in the restaurant is very good.",-1
5,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality and authenticity of food here. 
I ordered a tonkotsu ramen, a yellowtail sashimi, a side of kimchi, and a glass of junmai.
I wasn't really expecting any authenticity, but they caught me off guard when they started pouring the sake into a shot glass placed inside a masu. Okay, the owner knows something, I thought. 
Then I started to pay more attention. Yellowtail sashimi was prepped with coriander and ponzu, and they made no mistake there. The combination of junmai and yellowtail went very well. I then ordered a salmon sashimi. The salmon was prepped with puffed rice and herb and the dish was impeccable.
Ramen didn't disappoint me either. The noodle was chewy, the egg was just right, and the soup was rich but not too oily. 
I would come back when I come to London. Good job guys.",1
3,"After having to walk across half the city due to student riots (go Tories - radicalize! radicalize!) I decided to stop in here for a quick bite before the long bus ride home. I have been wanting to go here for a while since I saw their vegetarian bento box, advertised as absolutely vegan, and partly intrigued by their marketing strategy of ""no tips - it's just not japanese"" which is prominently displayed on signs throughout the restaurant. Because I was on my own I was shown downstairs, into a somewhat depressing cellar space. Before ordering you can specify that you are extra hungry, and get a larger helping of rice for free (apparently if you do this too late you are out of luck for some reason - why you can't  get this if you ask later is beyond me. Another nice addition is the free Japanese tea; though I did have to go out of my way to get them to refill (service was only OK and it was one of those places where you can't seem to make eye contact with the wait-staff). The cost of the bento box is not cheap - 10.50 Pounds - but that's probably about standard for this area. The food itself was so-so. The four tiny sushi were just ok, and definitely not fresh. There was very little in the way of wasabi. The rice was OK, and the cooked vegetables tasty, if not stellar. The sesame seaweed salad was excessively oily. The best thing about this place was that it was reasonably filling, and there were no hidden costs; the downside is that the food just wasn't that nice. If you can get a table upstairs the ambiance would certainly be better.",-1
4,"First impression, an Asian food restaurant with almost no Asians inside - food must be so-so. But NOT at all! I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen (pork bone soup ramen) - the taste of the soup was very dense, complete with eggs, pork slices and bean sprout. Atmosphere inside the restaurant is very London casual design, with the wood furnitures and cool lighting. Waiters and waitresses are also very friendly to talk to.
Recommended.
Interesting fact - the main chef is from Australia!",1
4,"Great food, loved the fried rice. Kinda reminds me of Ping Pong Dim Sum. Overall, ggood experience and nice decor.",1
4,"Gluttons* of England, Gluttons of Ireland,
Gluttons of every land and clime,
Hearken to my joyful tidings
Of the scrumptious breakfast time!
Dishoom is continuing to expand across the city of London! This Bombay-style café, which started in Covent Garden more than half a decade ago, opened locations in Shoreditch, King's Cross, and Carnaby over the past few years, for a total of 4 restaurants in London! 
Dishoom is modeled after iconic cafés that were established and operated in Bombay (now Mumbai, India) in the mid-to-late 1900s by Zoroastrian merchants from Iran (known throughout the Indian subcontinent as Parsis - literally meaning Persians). It is quite a unique blend of bustling energy and a relaxed, laid back vibe. 
The food at Dishoom would be described as ""non-traditional"" in relation to the food offerings at the multitude of Indian restaurants that operate all over the UK. Breakfast is the best meal with the most typical of Parsi dishes. My personal favorite is the Keema Per Eedu, spiced minced chicken, interspersed with diced chicken liver, and topped with two fried eggs. This protein-rich deliciousness is served with two buttered pau buns. Another favorite of mine is the Akuri, a heap of spiced scrambled eggs also served with pau buns. 
The Kejriwal (fried eggs with chilli cheese toast) and the Bombay omelette are mad tasty, and the fire toast comes with a pineapple-pink-peppercorn jam, which is some of the most delightful combinations of sweet and spicy flavors I have ever experienced. ""Oh man"", declared my taste-buds, ""that pink peppercorn and pineapple is my jam!"" 
The only slight disappointment was the Dishoom slaw. It is supposed to be a creamy coleslaw with pomegranate seeds in it, and there were literally 3 pomegranate seeds in the bowl full of slaw; not even joking! 
In a city like London, where an abundance of exceptional restaurants makes it impossible to pick a favorite, I find myself drawn to one of the Dishoom locations when I have time (and stomach capacity) for only one meal.
 
*Note: I'd much rather call myself a ""glutton"" than a ""foodie""; it just is a more apt description of what people like myself are.",1
3,"I'd have to go back and try the menu a la carte, but the tasting menu was decent if uninspiring. 
The salmon tandoori, beetroot and plantain thingy, stir fry of shrimp, and breast of squab (the first 4 of 8 dishes) were very tasty, but the remaining dishes were fairy non-descript. I was particularly looking forward to the venison but the flavor of the meat was completely disguised by the strength of the accompanying curry (which was delicious by itself but I wanna taste deer!).
The service gets a star, they waiters were superlative, but the food gets an unenthusiastic thumbs up, at least until I can go back and try the rabbit tikka and some of the other a la carte dishes.",-1
5,Please get the Duck Salad when if you get a chance to come here.  I still dream about it....,1
4,"I know some people are ehh about chains, but i really really like Ping Pong. I miss good dim sum, and honestly this is a good place to take a bunch of people with a decent atmosphere with good food.  Its not super greasy like the hole in the wall places in San Francisco but not as pricey as the fancy ones I have been to in SF either.  
For three of us with plenty of dim sum, wine and tea, it came out to £55 in total, which I actualy think is great.  I am going to come back for sure and especially this one because its in the southbank area (one of the best areas in London in my opinion).",1
3,"Very efficient on arrival, they seat you almost immediately in the bar upstairs and give you a numbered tag. This way you can relax in the bar for as long aas it takes to get a table, which can be a while in the evening as it gets very very busy.
 Once seated the novelty of ticking boxes to order different dim sum is fun although try not to get too carried away as it just seems to keep on coming and is more filling than you realise.
 Perhaps a victim of its own success it struggles to keep up with demand once you are seated. Dishes arrive sporadically at your table, we were given one of our dishes twice plus something we didn't order and then had to argue over what we had and hadn't received as we were still waiting for one of our dishes long after everything else was finished.
 If they can work on the service element it would be a lot better but the food is fun and the location is convenient. If I was craving dim sum I would travel to somewhere more authentic but this place is great for a drop in dinner if you are on the Southbank.",-1
2,"I took my family on the recommendation of a colleague while we were in London.  My wife and I dearly love Indian cuisine, and he stated this was the best the old city could offer.  We made reservations and went with great expectations.
When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and asked to wait in the library bar as we were a bit early for our (admittedly) early American dining hour.  We enjoyed a pricey, but quality, cocktail before being shown to the dining room.
We were pleasantly surprised they offered a tasting menu with wine pairings.  It was VERY pricey, but as we had never experienced this approach in Indian dining we decided to splurge.  
I won't get into the specifics of each dish, but let me just say we were pretty disappointed.  For the price, there was nothing special.  The food was good, but merely good doesn't cut it at that price point.  The wines, on the other hand, were excellent, and the wine steward was charming and knowledgeable.
When we returned home, our memories of great meals in the UK were from a local pub followed by a hole-in-the-wall curry shop where a ten quid plate of curry was recalled fondly.  This outrageously pricey meal didn't even register on the memorable experience meter.",-1
5,Loved this place. We went on a groupon deal and even that was great. Need to go back without the restrictions of the set menu from the deal so we can really let loose. Well worth the money.,1
3,"Good Tonkotsu, thats all I know, good amount of pork, tender noodles, array of condiments including a garlic press and bulbs! Negatives: served slightly cold, service slightly inattentive. Not sure if its good value for money. However it really is tasty and there is a lovely fresh ginger taste that cuts through what is sometimes a rather rich and cloying dish.",-1
5,"DELICIOUS and worth the wait! Came here on a Sunday night around 7PM and waited about 1.5 hrs for a 2 person table inside. The wait isn't so bad - they bring out tasty cups of hot chai and sherry wine to everyone standing in line, then once you reach the front of the restaurant they give you a buzzer and let you order drinks and snacks at the bar until your table is ready. There is a very cute patio with seating, but it seemed like you needed to specify if you wanted to sit out there and/or wait even longer for those tables.
For 2 people we ordered 4 dishes with garlic naan and everything was better than any Indian food I've eaten before, although they are not the dishes you'd expect to see at a more casual Indian food place (they're better). 4 dishes with naan (and no rice) was more than enough food for 2 people. 
The Keema Pau was really tasty - spicy minced lamb with peas and onions that you eat with soft buttery dinner rolls. Then we had the Chicken Ruby Curry - I liked this better than my old standby favorite, Butter Chicken. The curry had a lot of spices in it and they all worked great together. The House Black Daal was my favorite thing that we ordered. It came in a delicious creamy tomato-y sauce. We also had the bowl of greens to get some vegetables in, which was good and interestingly flavored. We had a Bhang Lassi (non-alcoholic) for dessert. This was amazing! The yogurt drink was thinner than I've had at other places, which I preferred, and it came with candied fennel - the whole thing tasted like a candy milkshake (but not too sweet) and was delicious.
The service was great and fast, and I especially loved the decor and the way that the menu explained what the restaurant is all about and how they're trying to recreate the feeling of an old Bombay Cafe in London. It's great to eat at a place that not only serves amazing food but also puts a lot of effort into giving the place a great overall aura and awareness of the culture and history of the place you're eating in. Highly recommend, don't let the wait discourage you!",1
4,"Enjoyed this hip Indian restaurant in Shoreditch!
This was the first restaurant that we went to once we landed in London. We missed our original lunch time reservation, but they were able to accommodate us at 2 
pm on a Friday. They kindly introduced us to the bar and let us know we could order some drinks while we wait. Soon after we ordered, they had a table available for 2!
The service was great. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive. The food was good! 
There were some sauces that came with our apps, was a fan of the green sauce.
What we ordered:
Lamb samosas - soo good, prob my fave thing honestly. Crispy and flavorful.
Okra fries: delish but gotta be a fan of okra's gooey texture
Spicy lamb chops: yummy! Flavorful and tender.
Chicken ruby curry: tasty curry!
Garlic naan: good because it's naan, but lacking in the garlic flavor department
To sum it up, everything was yummy, but not like out of this world delicious. Also, I was so glad we did not smell like food after we left especially since we had to be out and about. Def make a stop if you can. Get the lamb samosas!",1
5,Best food I've ever tasted. Hands down. No more needs to be said. Cocktails were incredible.,1
4,Everything we order was really good. We had to make a reservation but the place wasn't even busy. Not sure why dim sum starts so late in London. The only draw back here is the price.,1
2,"Extremely long wait for average Indian food, and that's if they get your order right. Service is very slow. If you don't have to wait then it may be worth it.",-1
5,"THE BEST Indian/Bombay café in LONDON! We found this place walking in Shoreditch and saw the line wrapped around the build. Well when you see that, you know it's gotta be good! And it was... THE BEST Indian dishes ever. 
YES I'll repeat, If the line is wrapped around the building it is completely worth the Wait! 
If the hosts tell you 1hr+ waiting list... YOU WAIT. Everything about this place is wonderful!
Be sure to try the Black House Daal & Lamb Raan.",1
2,"This place did do great Cantonese food and it's reputation in Soho and even London proceeds it,  I found this place from a top off from a chef many moon ago.... but..... 
Recently I took my girlfriend for the first time and it was a pretty good experience,  endulging in the world famous Peking duck,  crispy pork belly,  soft shell crab and yummy noodles and rice. We were seated quickly and the experience was noisy but enjoyable. But somehow the noise adds the feeling of a bustling busy restaurant which is fine... So we went back a week later. 
And.... 
I don't think a restaurant could drop the ball any further... And they weren't even as busy as usual.... Maybe that's a sign of the times. 
After 40 minutes we received our duck pancakes,  the duck was nice but seemed to be dry from sitting out too long,  then..... Nothing.... 20 mins later we received cold soft shell crab.... Ten minutes later Kung Po... Very tasty.... But cold.... No rice.... 10 mins later... Rice.... What's the point 
No apology just an interest to take money and run. Also the pricing is higher than most Chinese restaurants so we left feeling like we paid for their reputation not there service and sadly not their food. 
We won't be going back. There's plenty more tables in London serving exotic Cantonese wonderment.",-1
5,"Outstanding! drinks are awesome, try the black forest martini or the white buffalo for something sweet like dessert. for vegetarians, this place rocks! bok choi with garlic, vegetarian dim sum, veggie lettuce wraps are to die for, veggie black pepper chicken will scare you it looks so real. chilean sea bass was yumalicious as were the red pepper chili prawns. music via live DJ and ambience was awesome, dress nice for fun, don't expect much of a convo, quite loud. great service....reservations a must way ahead of time, hot spot. don't go late for dinner (10 or later) if you need to cab or subway back, you will get stranded.",1
1,"We came at 9:56pm, the restaurant is serving the guests inside but they refused to serve more even they open until 11:30pm, just say no and without telling me why.",-1
5,"Best ramen I've tried in London.  As good as any in new york, apart from undefeated champion ramen gods ippudo. And the egg in bone daddies' tonkotsu ramen is phemonemal - there is some unholy unami in that yolk.",1
3,"We went here for breakfast and it was not a pleasant experience.
Some food was good; the naan rolls were delicious. The restaurant has quality food suppliers.
Some were disastrous. The mushrooms were way overcooked. It became completely inedible and tasted like charcoal.
Mostly, the waiter completely forgot to bring my main dish. I waited for more than half an hour and cannot even find my waiter. I was starving to begin with and I was feeling a bit pissed after a sustained duration of starvation and the inedible mushroom.
After I explained the situation to the head of the wait staff, they brought my egg and bacon roll out finally. And the management apologized and offered this meal free on the house. So I appreciated that.",-1
4,"One of the best ramen you can find in town, good menu with many items you can choose from.
Affordable prices for the quality you get
Definitely gonna go back",1
4,"Phew!  After reading the reviews, was a bit wary of the experience I was going to have at Yauatcha, but ended up having a great meal.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the food and really helpful in sorting through the maze that was the dim sum menu.  We had a friend that was running late and didn't get any of the typical attitude about a member of your table not being there, and happily grazed away on dim sum and good cocktails.  We did get reminded of the 2hr turnaround time on the table (which I absolutely loath) but fair enough on a busy night.  Nice setting, great service and good food--would definitely go back.",1
2,"When we searched ""Best Indian food in London"" on Yelp, Dishoom seemed like a no-brainer since it boasted over 1000 five star reviews. After learning the wait time for a table was over an hour and a half, we thought ""If people are willing to wait over an hour and a half for a meal, this food must be outta this world! No one would be stupid enough to waste almost 2 hours of their life standing in line for mediocre food!""
We debated whether we should stay or go, but the curiosity of why anyone would wait so long for a meal got the better of us and we decided to wait it out. There were several hostesses who put your name on the waitlist and bring you hot chai while you stand in the cold London streets. Exactly 1h30m later we were ushered inside. The restaurant was simply decorated, elegant, classy, but simple. I was surprised at what a well oiled machine it all seemed. I must have counted at least 5 hosts/hostesses (at least)! Over 20 servers, and hundreds of guests. We were guided downstairs where the ambiance wasn't as pretty, and after 1h30m of waiting we were seated by the staircase (where guests came in and out of), not the best start. My expectations are now really high given that I agreed to wait so long. We ordered a spicy shrimp dish with tamarind sauce, the paneer tika masala, naan, and the jackfruit biryani. The spicy shrimp dish, though a tad bit over salted, tasted delicious, and the sweet tangyness of the tamarind chutney made it a really flavorful dish. Unfortunately all the other dishes we ordered were underwhelming. The paneer tika lacked spices, it was flavorless, and other than the fact that we were eating cheese --- cause who doesn't love cheese, it wasn't very special at all, and it was even a little dry. The naan was neither bad nor good. It was just your every day naan that you can get anywhere (without having to wait over 2hrs for it). But worst of all was the Biryani. It was overpriced dry and flavorless rice, with very scarce pieces of equally flavorless jackfruit. The service was also all over the place. Although the host staff was friendly, our waitress was flustered and barely came to our table, we had to ask for water several times before it was brought to us. Lastly they boast to offer ""unlimited chai"" but when you're paying almost $5 per chai, it BETTER be unlimited refills. 
Under normal circumstances (meaning, if I hadn't had to wait in line for 1h30m, and then another 30m to get our food), I would given Dishoom 3 stars. Had the food been exceptional, I would have had NO hesitation rating it 5 stars, however, due to the mediocrity of it all, add the extensive waiting period, i would argue that 2 stars is a fair rating. As we were seated at our table, we heard many Americans chatting at several tables nearby and we realized Dishoom is more of a hyped up tourist trap than a legit establishment for fine Indian fare. I encourage folks to read The Guardian review of Dishoom (by Jay Rayner) before waiting 2hrs for an overpriced Indian meal. If you want to stand in line, then go ahead! But we'll be opting for a place in Southall with better food and no wait!",-1
4,"I can't believe people are marking this place down because of the service. Surely that's all part of what makes this restaurant such as institution?
 On my first trip down to London, the amount of people back here in Sheffield who said you must go to Wong Kei's to be abused was phenomenal. Their reputation has spread far and wide!
 Plus, where else can you go for food and exercise at the same time as you traipse up and downstairs? It's cheaper than gym membership!
 The waterfall downstairs looks like something a person with no discernible taste might have in their garden and the plates look like the indestructible ones they used to give us at primary school.
 The main reason to go though is the food. My partner is a notoriously fussy eater and I've never seen him clear a plate so fast. We had pork noodles and they were amazing and the jasmine tea was also nice. I think the meal we had added up to about a tenner and we were stuffed.
 A great place to go if you're not bothered about dressing up and going somewhere fancy.",1
2,"Location= Yes = 1*
Chinese tea = Yes please 1*
Me and my (previous partner at the time) decided to celebrate our 2 years together (shivers) at Wong Kei's. 
Soon as we arrived at the door, the waiter came up to us and took us downstairs to our seats. It felt like we was in the middle of rush hour (no not the film!). 
I ordered Singapore noodles and he ordered special fried rice. I'm telling you the noodles was so dry that I had trouble finishing it! And you know when you can tell that the waiters are waiting for you to finish your meal and leave..I swear I could read their mind...'HURRY UP AND BYE' (accent)! Not a pleasant experience and the sight of my previous partner did not make a difference.
So all in all, would I go there again? No comment",-1
4,"It is a strange day when I find myself reviewing a bit of cake, but needs must.
 If looks dictated the flavour then this cake could well be the best in all the kingdom, but they don't, so it's not.
 It's deceptively heavy looking from the outside, however, once inside it has a surprisingly good mixture of light textures and flavours which left me wanting another fork full. A sophisticated fusion of tastes and textures. Very good indeed, but still not the best in the kingdom.
 The shop itself is a delight. A huge array of incredibly good looking cakes. It's a photographers dream (as well as a foodies).",1
2,"It's ok. Not ""blown away"" by anything going on here. It's indian food in a hip environment. Bartenders seem good. Food is ok. Stay away from the weird desserts.",-1
2,"I went to Ping Pong last Sunday with an open mind and bear in mind I've had Dim Sum only once in Chinatown as a reference.
 Ping Pong from the outside looks nice and impressive. Equally the décor seemed okay inside.
 Being two of us they did ask if we wanted to sit immediately if we didn't mind being in the sun. It was absolutely fine I add.
 We considered the Unlimited menu but wondered whether we'd really eat that much bearing in mind the price of £18.79(?) does not cover drinks and some items of the menu.
 Ping Pong do Dim Sum and they do it well. The two most memorable ones were the Black Prawn steamed dumplings and the one with Turmeric. I notice they sell them as three's so one each and then you have to split the third?
 It's not all perfect: I found a piece of clear plastic in my mouthful from one of the Claypot selections.
I knew I had to highlight this and the waitress quickly said she would get the Manager who apologised and offered us a couple of glasses of wine on the house.
 Prior to this episode, the first steamed Broccoli that was delivered to the table was like mush and was sent back. The second one that came was exactly the same. More about this later.
 We hadn't had breakfast and ate quite a lot, more than we needed to. If we had gone for the Unlimited, we'd have made a small saving each - say the equivalent of one dish so be certain you are going to eat a lot.
 I thought the set menus looked good and took a lot of hassle out of what to order. Any feedback from others on their value?
 Back to Broccoli: When it came to paying I pointed out to the Waitress that the Broccoli had been mush. She just said sorry.
Then whilst waiting for the other half near the exit the Manager came over to say goodbye and we had a little cordial chat. He asked me if everything else was okay and I asked how the broccoli should have been served. Apparently crispy (with a bite).
I told him about mine and in reply he told me how hard it was to monitor so much being steamed especially on a Sunday.
 Is that a reasonable excuse? I don't think so. I rarely have fault to complain so never too sure what to expect when I do - not that I was on the Broccoli - I was giving feedback though I should have mentioned that £3.79 for a tiny portion of steamed Broccoli is a rip-off.
 Will I go again? I think I'll give it a miss and find that place in Chinatown.",-1
3,"We lucked out and got a table immediately, had prompt service and were all wowed by the quality of the food. Coming from eating Spanish food for four months, my friends and I were in need of some spices. I had the mutter paneer which was fantastic. The food had the perfect amount of spice. The portions looked small at first glance, but the four of us left satisfied!",-1
5,"Dishoom is a magical place. 
Walking into Dishoom is like walking into a different world. You're not in London anymore. My senses were filled with slow, jazzy, and romantic music combined and the smell of burning incense. 
Pros:
- Each table feels intimate and private. For the smaller tables, there are high panels that separate them. 
- free and fast wifi 
- bottomless chai for 2.5 pounds 
What I got and what I thought:
I ordered the garlic naan, mattar paneer, and chai. Everything was delicious. The chai reminded me of my trip to India. However, the mattar paneer was more lukewarm than piping hot. 
*Tip: DO NOT COME HERE FOR DINNER. Wait time is usually 1-3 hours. Come BEFORE 5pm.*
Dishoom is a wonderful dining experience, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants good Indian food.",1
3,solid ramen place. Not the best ramen i have had but not the worst. the service is pretty good. solid place if you are in central and want ramen.,-1
4,"Stand out indian food with a constantly evolving menu.
The cooking standards are excellent and the dishes well priced
Always recommend the 24 hour black daal as its creamy gorgeous unctuous vege pleasure
Love the decor and hipster staff
A joy",1
1,"Cinnamon Club is a beautiful restaurant with sketchy service and zero to no accommodation for anyone with a food allergy. Our server told me that I could have okra. That's it. So I ordered okra (for my dinner main course). I had hoped to have something. Anything. Although I have food allergies, I can always find something to eat just about anywhere. I hate being the person who's difficult to serve, so I'm extremely flexible. But that did not matter at Cinnamon Club. When my okra arrived, it was clearly an appetizer portion--even though they knew it was all I could have. No effort to bulk up my plate or anything. No one made me feel welcome or as if the chef or staff hoped to do something...anything at all...to make my experience nice. What I had was okay. Sadly, my cocktail wasn't impressive either. We noticed sluggish service all around our table as well. Others had to ask for a waiter to be sent over so they could order. They were seated before we were. I was really looking forward to this meal, but I am leaving hungry and unimpressed.",-1
3,"Done the NY one. Enjoyed the buzz. So when it opened here in London we thought we should give it a try.
But getting in at a reasonable time is a different matter. All booked up.
Just so happens we had tickets for Charlie and the chocolate factory at Drury Lane on Thursday. 7.30 kick off. Balthazar right outside. Why not try a pre-theatre raid.
A 6pm table of 3 was duly booked. We got there on time and the place was already busy. The bar was full and three quarters of the tales were taken. Bags were swiftly taken and we were at our table.
Balthazar London feels exactly the same as New York. Loud. Thronging. hot. Nicely decked out in authentic French brasserie tiling and furniture. Serving staff whizz round all over the gaff and there is a big seafood bar at the back to whet the appetite. This is proper tourist London stuff, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Slap bang in the middle of covent garden and full of hip things out for a good time. It feels great.
The menu is what you'd expect from a good French brasserie. Nice bread arrived to munch on, plenty of it. Followed by a good moules et frites which was lifted by the inclusion of caramelised fennel. The boy had macaroni cheese sans the bacon and the missus had a skirt steak that was full of taste. 
My chip were a little soggy was my only complaint on the food. But it was pretty expensive for what we got I thought.
However, you're paying for the great atmosphere, not the food. And for a bit of a treat if you're painting good old London Town red, it's definitely got it. Go there and show out. It's fun. Not perfect food and a bit pricey but great fun nonetheless. Not quite a 4 but a high 3 stars well earned.
Nb If I did theatre reviews I Would give Charlie and the chocolate factory 6 stars. It was truly brilliant. And I hate the theatre.  Book it. And try Balthazar before for a proper night out!
The place was heaving by the time we left at 7. So do book.",-1
3,"Pricey, food is good but not sure it's worth the tag. Anyway, great for people watching. Ambience is loud too but drinks list is long to make up for it.",-1
3,"Great place for a variety of tea's and cake in an upmarket surrounding.
 They used to do three scones in a cream tea style that was really good value for money, but alas I believe that's no more.
 Downstairs hosts dim-sum and is good, well portioned, good flavours although you are paying for it.
 Really good surroundings and decor though!",-1
4,Nice place to go for something different outside of your traditional/mass-market indian restaurant. Tasty food and good selection. Personally I wasn't as keen on the desserts! I have heard greatest things about their breakfast but am yet to try!,1
3,"Known as the oldest Indian restaurant in London, I knew I had to check it out during my latest visit. And while it was surely delectable and the setting was gorgeous (on the second floor of one of London's oldest shopping districts), the food was good--but not great. The portions were certainly generous, but the flavors themselves I found a little lacking. Granted, I visited for lunch so perhaps it was not their best work, but I would have to say I've found better in the US (such as Rasika in DC).",-1
3,"This was probably the most disappointing (and expensive) meal of our trip. While service and the atmosphere were great, the food was just so-so. They were out of the burrata appetizer, which was a bummer. The grilled octopus was just ok as was the mushroom/egg appetizer. My chicken was weird tasting and my husbands lamb was Ok. Everything was super small. I did enjoy the tarte tatin for dessert. I wouldn't come back.",-1
2,"I always say...when going to an asian resturant..look around you and see if its either full of asians or non-asians as it is a good indication of how authentic it is... 
me and my friend were the only 2 asians there lol.
Honestly the food was not that great...it wasnt bad though~~ but I love my dimsum and was expecting to eat turnip paste cakes (aka carrot cake) which was not on the menu. Its definately a westernized concept. Which is fine for those looking for that. 
The duck spring rolls were nice, the beef & spinach dumplings too, but disappointed in the pork bun... disappointed in the fried asparagus little dinky dried up strings came out. Disappointed in the bak choy (the cut off the leafy portion for presentation im assuming? Didnt appreciate just the white part of the vegetable... 
The cocktails looked amazing though~~ didnt have one but presentation was nice~ sat by the bar~ 
What I liked: 
1. Staff was really friendly 
2. Ambiance was great, nice place, lots of people
3. Good location right next to waterloo station by the weekend market stalls",-1
1,This restaurant is not good for families . When we went we had a long line . But this restaurant does not even have basics of taking people's names in a list . They prioritize two people . We had to wait more than an hour even though they said the wait would be 45 minutes because they send people who came even 30 minutes later than us they were just two people . The restaurant is full of two sets that can be combined but they don't do it . So if you are more than two people especially 3 or 5 don't waste your time waiting here .,-1
4,"Nice food in a unique space, especially pleasant when you're sitting in the ""garden"" area (glass house of tables at the front of the space with plenty of light streaming through a retractable roof, which they close when the chill of night settles in, or if it begins to rain). 
The food is a different from what you'd find at a curry house (and curries are only a very small part of the menu - think more grilled sauteed or tandoori type of dishes). It's ordered like small plates - choose 2-3 per person and go to town on the array. The meats can be hit or miss, some were super tender and falling off the bone, others were dry and chewy. However, every dish was extremely flavorful, lots of kick with the heat and heavy on the spices than most. They go similarly extreme on the cream and butter factor, but in the end with small plates this is a good thing... At such concentrations of flavor, a little goes a long way!",1
3,"The Nobu restaurants are one of my favorites because of their usual amazing food and service.  However, I was disappointed when I recently visited Nobu Berkeley Street. Though the food tasted wonderful as usual, I was very agitated with the table service. I was sitting at a small table and servers continued to attempt to crowd the table with dishes, which made me feel rushed like they were trying to turn our table quickly. At other Nobu restaurants, dishes are served one by one so the guests can enjoy their dishes. The atmosphere of Nobu Berkeley street is loud: playing club lounge type music making conversation between those at your table difficult. If you are looking for Asian fusion, I would recommend you going across the street to Novikov's Asian restaurant where the food is delicious and service on point.",-1
5,"This is my favourite place to go for Dim Sum and they serve it all day long!  The tab comes out to be bit on the pricier side, but the selection, quantity, quality and overall attentiveness of the staff makes Yautcha number one on my list!",1
3,"i been to many Donkotsu ramen place in japan, paris and london.
I wantied to find the most nearest donkotsu ramen with original japanese one.
Obviously here is one of the best in london.  Very tender and well made cha-shu makes customer happy. And the quality and taste of Donkostu soup is good. Deep and long time boiled. However, when i was served, noddle and soup was nt hot . it was served with warm-cold. I was disappointed. Evenmore, the combination of topping and soup anf noodle is not good. Separately its good taste though, Too lack of ginger, not hot soup, and lack of bean sprouts. all together its disapointing for me. Because it served as warm-cold, the taste of soup is more greasy. 
 As a big fan of Donkostu ramen, im disappointed, but Still one of the best ramen spot in london. I tried Ittenbari, Nagomi,, ect, Bone daddie is one of best. I want to try Chiken Gara-age. For donkotsu gourmet, its bit disapointed but still one of the place for reducing thirsty for japanese dish.",-1
2,"Had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. However, the experience was a let down. I ordered spicy miso ramen. The broth was so VERY salty that I could not taste other flavour in it. The ramen was just so so. I also ordered fried chicken and pork ribs as snacks,both of them are tasty(that's what those 2 stars for). I would not recommend the ramen to anyone and I probably will not visit them again.",-1
4,"Very good quality ramen. Buzzy, loud atmosphere - good for a group as it's not really a date place. Friendly service though a little slow when it's so busy. Excellent cocktails.",1
4,"Quality dim sum, affordable prices, good service.
The dishes are creative and they have either set menus or a la carte.  Really nice concept for a restaurant which we'd eat at often if it were close to home.
Definitely would stop back again and again!
Delicious food and a decent atmosphere.  I'd recommend.",1
1,"Um, no again.
This place was just as bad as Kanada-Ya but for different reasons. The tonkotsu ramen was so bad we couldn't finish it. The pork buns were smothered in sauce we couldn't finish those either.",-1
5,"Best lunch spot in Soho! There is always a small que, but dont let it deter you! The que goes quick and the service is great!
The softshell crab is amazing... and my favorite main is the T12 Ramen! 
Must try it out!",1
3,"I have to say this restaurant is overrated. Their food is good, but it's not that good.
They do not take reservations. We waited for about 35 minutes or so outside and then 15 minutes or so at the bar downstairs. Once again, their food is good but I don't think it's worth waiting for close to an hour. We ordered the lamb chops (my favorite), murgh malai, and chicken ruby. I would give 4 stars for the food, but with the long wait, I cannot give more than 3 stars.
Pro-Tip:
Even if the queue looks relatively short outside, it's likely to be a long wait as there are people waiting for their tables at the bar downstairs.
I would not return to Dishoom nor do I recommend this to anyone. There are many other good restaurants in London and there's also better way to spend time than waiting in line.

2,"With high prices come high expectations; unfortunately, Veeraswamy did not live up to them.
The hostess initially refused to seat us by the windows (even though the place was half empty) but that was quickly remedied by someone who overruled her.  And the restaurant is beautiful and well-ventilated so we didn't come out smelling like curry.  
After some hemming and hawing on our part, I decided on the pear and cinnamon martini and my friend got the guava and passion fruit martini.  Neither of us particularly enjoyed our drinks.
I started with the raj kochuri, which V describes as a ""large wheat puri filled with goodies, splashed with chutneys.""  I had never had anything quite like it before and thought it was pretty good.  I had a taste of the sholay chicken and it was very flavorful.
My entree was the lamb shank and it came out looking delicious and smelling wonderful.  But I took my first bite and realized that it lacked seasoning -- such a shame.  My friend actually asked the server to bring salt, and that is a first at an Indian restaurant.
I had the caramelized banana kulfir dessert and it was pretty good.  But I'm not spending 40+ pounds on lunch for ""pretty good.""",-1
4,"After walking up and down London's sad excuse for a Chinatown section unable to really find anything too interesting (and Yelp wasn't much help),  Yelp pointed me to this great ramen place.  It seems to be fairly new to the area.  I hate to use the word ""unctuous"" but I think it's the perfect description for this ramen.  Definitely a must try in Soho.",1
4,"I've never had a proper meal here but come for the tea and desserts.  Teas are magnificent and made properly, and the desserts are awe-inspiring, works of art that taste delicious.  A go-to place to finish off a dinner date and woo with sweets.",1
5,"Went on a Monday night about 8:30. There was a 90 minute wait for a table but we had nothing else to do so decided to wait. The line outside to just get in took about 30 minutes where we could wait in the crowded bar area to get drinks and starters. We did have really tasty starters - lamb samosas and calamari. Before long we were called for our table and dive into some delicious food. The menu is based on the concept of Iranian cafes in Bombay. The waiter will give you the full story, which is cool, but we were hungry. We had the garlic naan, cheese naan, some amazing Gunpowder potatoes, a lamb kabob that was supposed to be really spicy but wasn't, and a chicken dish I don't remember. The food was excellent and the service was good. My wife isn't a fan of curries and there was plenty here for her. Excellent choice.",1
2,"How bad can you go... Purely relying on cheap prices to fill seats in your restaurant?
With this as their business model, I will always have a soft spot for Wong Kei!
The first time that I ever came here, I was introduced to the place by a friend of my dad's when I was still in my teens. I really did not know what to expect. Upon returning with my best friend, he and I spent the evening completely perplexed as to what was going on around us, even though we were the customers and we were the ones who were placing the orders. We most definitely were not in control or command of what was happening to us! 
I seem to remember almost random dishes appearing with no explanation as to what they were. I also remember very well ordering portions of egg fried rice and the waiting staff slamming the bowl down and me repeatedly asking where the other portion of rice was. Each time I asked, the waiter immediately started walking away and shouted at me ""You got it!"" 
After grabbing a more senior member of staff, he finally explained that two portions is one bowl. Thanks for that!
So when I returned here very recently, I was wondering if they still had ""the same magic"" that they used to.
Well, to be brief. Prices have most definitely escalated compared to what they used to be here. However, you most definitely get great value for your money. I can most definitely eat & eat & eat. And.... The relatively few dishes that I did order really challenged my eating prowess. 
Service here is still fairly crazy. But I suppose, it is all about perspective. I personally feel that over the last few years service in London has gotten worse and worse. Get me started on this topic I will tell you that it is the fault of including service in the bills, but I'll back off that for now. So, comparatively Wong Kei is no longer the worst place in London to be served food!
And you know what, that sort of disappoints me.",-1
2,Service is not equivalent to this level of restaurant. The food was reasonable but not terrific. Service was below this level of restaurant in London.  Go to a good curry house instead.,-1
4,"When I think of ramen in London, I think of Bone Daddies. Yes, more than likely you will need to queue but that's only a sign for what's inside is worth it. 
The food is tasty with quite a variety of ramen bowls, leaving you with a very satisfying fullness. Particular shout out to the soft shell crab! 
The place itself, as others have mentioned, is hipster, with a casual feel. It can get pretty loud in there due to the size and music but you can have a conversation fine. What I like are the cute touches. On the table there are bibs for obvious reason, but also little jars of hair bands. As a female with long hair, this certainly helped me out.
A frequent diner and would urge anyone else to try it out. Yes, a bit on the pricy side but we are in London after all. Definitely go and see for yourself.",1
5,Deservedly famous Chinatown restaurant. Food is basic and cheap and you sit at communal tables. Service is brusque but it's all part of the experience. The barbecued pork noodle soup is fantastic and great value for £3.50. You get free tea with your food which is lovely.,1
5,Amazing place and must visit restaurant to satisfy taste buds for Indian food . Very different and refreshing ambience . Cocktails are too good and they serve some of the best Indian appetizers. Vadapav was a surprise . The main course delicacies taste even better than restaurants in India. This place is a perfect combo of a End of the day bar hang out and a dining restaurant,1
4,"Following the reviews from Mssrs A and A Hunter in particular, I went on a date to this place. Chinese generally isn't my favourite cuisine but I will certainly come back here. It's as efficient in service and atmosphere as the other reviews suggest, but I really didn't feel rushed at all, and we stayed to finish our wine with no indication that they wanted us to leave!
 A pot of chinese tea was put immediately on our table, and we went for the house wine - a risk a) in a cheap chinese and b) at £7 a bottle - but it was dry and perfectly drinkable! We started with the finest crispy duck pancakes I've probably ever eaten, then we both had won ton soup. Delicious broth with noodles (which were slightly undercooked), with 5 or 6 giant pork and prawn dumplings. Delicious. We had chinese greens on the side - a giant pile of steaming hot stems with oyster sauce. It was all extremely tasty and we couldn't even finish it all. And the bill? £22 inc the wine. Have already told everyone I know about this place!",1
4,"The main reason i like this place is for their amazing desserts.  Just one peek through their window and you'll see some beautiful creations staring back at you.  The blue-cubed blueberry one is divine though i only chose it for the colour so can't be more specific in what was in it.
Second best thing is that you can get the cakes to go, which is preferable to having to actually dine in.  Not that the food or the dim sum is bad but as pointed out below the service is slow slow slow!
Recently went with a friend.  We said we just wanted cakes and were told we had 40 minutes, which would have been fine if we hadn't been ignored by all the staff having an impromptu staff meeting for 20 minutes.  We sauntered over to the dessert area and ordered our cakes and the lady placed them on a nice dish each and said someone would bring them over.  We should have taken them ourselves as we waited over 5 minutes and we severely pushed for time.
For quality of food this places rates highly but it has a long way to go to even be close to an enjoyable experience.",1
3,Expensive but food it great. However i like to see the food i buy as presentation is really important so gear up the lights a little or we could end up eating something not so pleasant.,-1
4,"Yauatcha has become a must everytime I visit London. The menu is very diverse but I end up ordering the soup dumplings, sticky rice and pork and shrimp dumplings every time I come.",1
4,"First went there with several friends and I have been going back a few times since whenever I want India food. It is not very traditional, which is probably why I like it, and the food tastes simply delicious. They offer a huge variety of grilled and curry dishes and Biryani. I especially like the lamb kabab, paneer Tikka and the house specialty of spicy daal. I crave the mango Lassis here and can just have a whole meal of it. They also have a very nice outdoor area for you to enjoy delicious food and soak up the sun.",1
3,"A visit to Le Mercury was inevitable as I watch this little gem fill up every night without fail. The blue and yellow interior might lead you astray however with a simple menu and excellent prices, Le Mercury is everything French and nothing less. The crayfish and lobster ravioli was minutely salty for my liking but was succulent enough to still enjoy. At £2.95 a plate, it's alright to order the entire dessert menu.. if only I could stomach everything, I would. Mascapone cheese Cake - a lighter alternative but still as rich and as enjoyable as a normal cheesecake. Love, love, LOVE!",-1
5,The Roast Duck. That is all.,1
5,"In my younger days when lunch choices consisted of Soho's wide range of eateries as opposed to today's regimented packed lunches, there was one spot that was a consistent favourite. Wong Kei. This evening after a long day at work followed by a lengthy meeting and beer, I decided to revisit my favourite old haunt. It's as good as ever. I ordered my standard:
- Ho fun with beef and scrambled egg
It is a dish that sums up my love for the restaurant; hearty, authentic, homestyle cooking that will fill you up on a budget with the finest of ingredients - simplicity. There is nothing fancy about a plate of wet noodles with a generous helping of tender beef and eggs. Its taste is mildly salty with a slight spring onion sweetness and there isn't much else to it. What you get however is a sense of warmth and comfort with every bite that few other places can offer at its price point. Wong Kei has long been infamous for its abrasive staff and unassuming environment (both things I have no problems with personally) but in dishes such as this, it provides care in the way it feeds you. It in some ways encapsulates the very Chinese way of expressing love without words and not many people appreciate that, or open themselves up to notice such things at places like this.
I will forever love this place and hope it stays forever. As a little pro tip, this has to be consumed eating in to make use of the plentiful chilli oil crucial to this dish and for that rarest of perks by today's standards: free tea.
Wong Kei, please don't change.",1
5,"The best Indian food I've ever had. Perfect execution, best menu selections, and dangerously delicious cocktails - watch out. 
Decor, atmosphere, food, service all A+!
Beware of the long lines though. Get here early! They only take reservations of parties of 6 or more after 6p",1
4,"My first Alan Yau's restaurant in London was the famous Hakkasan which won first Michelin star for its Chinese cuisine. It's a wonderful place. Once again I wanted to have some Dim Sum for brunch. But I wanted to change and that's why Piotr and I have been to Yauatcha. This restaurant has a tea-room on the ground floor and a Dim Sum restaurant in the basement. As we had drunk a lot of beer these last two days, we decided to be reasonable and ordered rest silver needle tea... light and delicious. Then we had a Beancurd Cheung Fun (Pan-fried bean curd with prawns and yellow chives), Har Gau (Scallops and prawns with fish eggs), Szechuan wonton (another kind of dumplings), Prawn Ho Fun (stir-fried noodles with prawns) and Malaysian Kweito. Everything was absolutely delicious. Only the Kweito was not my cup of tea. Really, it's a nice place to visit while in London. Don't pay attention to the waiters who can be from indifferent to obsequious.",1
3,"We came here based on the reviews and proximity to our hotel.
I enjoyed the food here but not sure if it's the best Indian curry I've ever had. I know there's many types of curries from different regions but I guess Punjab is not my favorite. It's a little too tomatoe-y for my taste.
I've never been to an Indian restaurant where I had to pay extra for white rice. The rice usually comes with the curry. And not only that but when we got the bill, the rice was 3 pounds so that's about $5 USD for just white rice. We ordered two. If we had known, I would have gotten more naan instead. Some of the naan were cheaper than white rice.
The service was ok. Nothing great.
The place seemed pretty touristy. No one at the nearby tables were English. They were either Japanese, American or Swedish (?).",-1
4,"Save yourself your embarrassing web searches and make sure when you google Bone Daddies, you include ""London"" as a keyword too.  Besides, all you really need to know is that Bone Daddies belongs right in Soho, with its trendy wall decor, trendy menu on a clipboard, trendy good looking people (hello good looking people).
I walked here on 9 pm Tuesday, and was surprised how busy it still was even an hour before closing, but was relieved to be seated promptly at a communal table.  I have no shame eating alone when it comes to the ramen call of duty.
Ordered the £8.8 Unnamed cocktail (Nikka All Malt, Pink Peppercorn Vanilla, Ume Shu) which was served quite bitter in a martini glass and very strong, but I'm all for pre appetizer inebriation.
Also ordered the £5 fried chicken, a little bucket containing 8 morsels of Asian style fried chicken with a slice of lemon, and finished it all myself... to the obvious amazement by my wide-eyed waiter. It was a bit salty and lacked seasoning but the lemon helped dispense some flavor.
20 minutes post chicken inhalation, my £11 Tonkotsu ramen finally came.  It was decent, with two soft boiled egg yolks shining like a beacon amidst waves of noodle and a sea of creamy broth.  I compare all ramen places to Ippudo in NYC, and I'm sure my standards will reset yet again when I go to Japan.  I liked the place, but wasn't slurping out of my bowl like a human vacuum the way I do when I'm at Ippudo.   Something was missing- maybe it was that the broth wasn't as flavorful (although putting in the chilli oil did wonders) and maybe the noodles weren't as starchy.
In any case, I liked Bone Daddies and would come back to try the other ramen offerings.",1
3,"I took my sister and her Indian in-laws there and they loved it. What I think makes this Mumbai-inspired chain successful is that it's a subtle cross between East and West. The menu has all the classics you'd expect at your local deli; biryani, curries, kofta, naans etc. but the menu is designed to suit Western palates.
I think it's a tad too pricey given the quantities but the  flavour and refinement make it worth the money. However, if you're looking for homely, comforting food, it's probably not the right place. The restaurant has a sophisticated and cosmopolitan vibe to it. 
If you go there in 5+ groups you'll get better value if you order different dishes everyone can eat from, tapas-style.",-1
4,"I was both excited and apprehensive to experience high-end dim sum as the cheaper stuff is already so good. But Yauatcha offers a whole other level of gourmet ingredients and flavour combinations.
The restaurant is stunning and each dim sum is lovingly made, beautifully presented and above all, absolutely delicious!
Only let down is the service, which isn't polished enough for a Michelin star joint.",1
2,"MAYBE its because we got this delivered?! Everyone is entitled a bad day right?
After hearing so much about this place, I was more than excited to experience London's little dumplings, was super ecstatic, but.....boy was I let down.
Their menu was impressive, so many selections and options for vegetarians - so I went crazy and ordered just about one of everything. 
When the food arrived, it arrived in cute little packaging, so ""yay"" for packaging...but once the food arrived in my mouth, it was not a party.
Okay, they weren't absolutely terrible, but a couple of the dumplings I had didn't belong in my mouth. 
I ordered: 
green chive dumplings
coriander dumplings
seafood dumpling
crunchy golden vegetable dumpling
fluffy white vegetable buns
fresh veges in the sticky rice lotus leaf
and a couple other things that I can't remember....
I remember spitting out some of the dumplings and the foods wrapped in leaves. The buns weren't nice, kinda dry and tasteless. 
I don't know about this though, its hard not to get dumplings right, next time I'm in town, I'm definitely going back - they must've just had a bad day of cooking, because it wasn't only me who didn't have a pleasant experience. 
Ping Pong, you're just so cool, I hope my next experience here is a better one. I promise not to get it delivered! 
My first experience here was....DIM.",-1
2,I did not see what the hype was all about. The noodles tasted like it was simmered in the broth until it melted. I definitely do not recommend the ramen. They get 2 stars because the staff was great.,-1
5,"Yes it takes reservations and Yes it's very good. I went here with 3 coworkers for good dim sum and Chinese and it was AMAZING! Place has a really cool ambiance/vibe and it was packed on a Monday night. We got the dim sum meal which comes with multiple pre-chosen courses (minimum of 2 people) and also ordered some egg fried rice to go with it. At first they come out with some really good dim sum but I was wondering if we were still gonna be hungry after...then the duck confit and fried calimari / chicken comes out and you realize that there's soooooo much food. We were all stuffed when we left. I would definitely go back here. Very very good. Also, a lot of other tables ordered the ribs which I don't know how they cooked them but they looked soooo good too.",1
3,"The food was good, but the service was really slow. 
There were two reasons for this, it was only the second day of one of the servers, and we were one of the two couples that were downstairs, and I think it was a little of out of site, out of mind.",-1
5,"A favourite. Posh dim sum sums it up. The food is fresh - you can see it being made and then cooked. The decor is superb - sleek and sophisticated. The service is really efficient and pleasant - never pushy, always attentive and precise.
 A huge range of green, blue, and smoked teas are available and the staff are always happy to recommend something that goes well with the food you've ordered. The food is classic Chinese fusion but steers clear of the outlandish or merely sensational. Quality and flavour is the keynote.
 To finish, select gold leaf topped violet and rose flavoured cakes or light chocoloate mousses topped with lime flower and candied cinammon. Just looking at the cakes makes you think you've gone to some kind of food heaven.
 Innovative cocktails and soft drinks complete the 'event' that each meal here inevitably becomes. It's a treat.",1
5,"The best meal we had was the first evening in London. The service was attentive, accommodating, and friendly. The ambiance was intimate with dark woods with an accent mirror, and a fake hedge that added a bit of romance to the dining experience. The menu is contemporary English cuisine with European and Asian influences. Each course was beautifully plated and tasted even better!
I started with braised shoulder of Loire Valley rabbit - so good! The main course was fabulous; treacle caramelised Gressingham duck breast with roasted red plums, sautéed bok choy, and ruby port sauce. The excellent meal ended with an amazing desert; Amalfi lemon & olive oil tiramisu (fresh Amalfi lemon & thyme sorbet). The sorbet was the best I've ever had and I've had some really fabulous artisan sorbet from Capogiro in Philadelphia and a pink peppercorn sorbet at Chikalicious in NYC but the thyme sorbet tops it all!",1
3,"I was told rare is bleeding but what I really got was medium rare, no blood, and the famous sauce that was really just supplementary rather then complimentary to the very mediocrely cooked meat...",-1
1,"Awful! Dined here twice (second time unavoidable as bday party) and just terrible. The food is second rate P F Chang quality at best, and Panda Express at worst. Not what I was expecting considering its trendy rep and classy ambiance. Very expensive and while the host was charming both times the waiting staff acted like they couldn't care less.",-1
3,"This ramen is clearly geared towards the western palate.  If you're looking for authentic Japanese ramen, this isn't really it.  It is still good though.  
We did have an unfortunate thing happen when we went; my friend's phone was stolen while we were eating there.  Keep an eye on your things while you're there!",-1
5,"Okay, whether you are a local or just visiting this place is an absolute MUST if you like Indian food. There are places that have great food but so-so ambiance. Or the service is outstanding but location isn't that great. This place has it all. Including collapsible high chairs (the type that just hook onto the table - why don't more places have these?) and, get this, etch-a-sketch boards for the kiddos! How fricken cool is that?
The restaurant is enormous. Two stories and a beautiful, peaceful looking patio out front. Dark wood and décor give a warm vibe to the place. And located in Shortditch, it's set in a cool neighborhood with lots of cool, funky shops. Plus, it's reasonable prices for excellent fare with wonderful service. Doesn't get much better than that.
Now for the food and drink. The Chai tea drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic options) were so tasty and perfect for a cold day. We enjoyed the most amazing Okra Fries, Mahi Tikka, Sheekh Kabab Lamb, and House Black Daal with naan. If you don't order anything else, the fries and the daal are a must. My husband usually doesn't care for daal and he was scooping every last morsel up in this dish!
So Mahi in Bombay can be any kind of fish. This one happens to be a basa fillet and it is cooked to buttery perfection. The lamb, with the lime and spices was straight up delicious.
The bonus to the menu is that it's all tapas style. I'm all about small dishes so you can try a number of things. So for our party of 6 adults, it worked out well to just have each couple order dishes to share rather than trying to find a few things for the whole table. I'm a little sad that I live across the pond from this incredible place but I will definitely be back the next time we visit!",1
3,Wonky's,-1
1,"I have been on a Ping Pong hiatus for about two years, but was recently in need of a quick bite before a show at the Southbank in December 2014 and decided to revisit. I was craving steamed buns, so we were determined to get in despite the queue that was trailing outside of the restaurant. We barely managed to get food, however, and our experience was utterly tainted by overburdened staff and misinformation- I can confidently say we will continue to avoid Ping Pong for future as a potential dining venue.
In particular, we were told that the waiting time for a two person table would be 20 minutes, but it was at least a 40 minute wait before anyone made any effort to seat us. Only after we complained were we directed to a communal table, so we put our foot down and demanded a two person arrangement as we had originally requested. To our astonishment, we were then swiftly seated. 
We nearly had to physically grab a server because we were having difficulties getting anyone's attention and were forced to order all of our food in a frenzy while stressing that we only had 20 minutes to dine. The server attempted to be congenial and arrange for our bill to be presented immediately to help speed things up, but was still very slow in manifesting this and to take payment. We had no sauces on our table and asked another passing server for these, but they never arrived and we ended up sharing with our neighbours. Our table was literally so close to both adjacent tables that we were pinned to the wall as well- it was the most stressful and uncomfortable meal I have experienced in recent memory.
It must be acknowledged that they did honour an NUS discount and that I have previously eaten at other, smaller and speedier branches of Ping Pong in the past, but the Southbank branch is best avoided if you wish to enjoy a relaxing meal. I can barely recall the quality of the food because we were so dissatisfied with the visit and were forced to voraciously stuff everything in our faces, but I recall that the steamed buns that I did order would have otherwise proved satisfactory as they are a specialty of the chain.",-1
1,Small portions over rated Indian. Much better Indian food available in London. We left hungry,-1
5,"I'm highly critical of Indian food given that I grew up with an amazing mama who cooks it the best. Came to Dishoom in Shoreditch while visiting my sister and everything we had was incredible. 
I highly recommend the following:
- rose, cardamom lassi (light and subtle flavors...not heavy at all)
- limbu pani (soda water with lemon and spices) 
- lamb samoosas
- lamb raan (the bun or as is)
- pav bhaji (great on a rainy day) 
- paneer and mango salad 
- falooda for dessert 
If you can find a table in the patio, I would recommend requesting a table there. The atmosphere itself is old school Bombay and you can tell they have put a lot of attention to detail!",1
2,"Maybe it was an off night, but I did not have a very good experience here. It's too bad, I had really heard nice things!
 I went for a chicken and egg stirfry-type dish. The panko was soggy and the egg cold. It just seemed like it had been sitting out for ages.
 My friend had the salmon sashimi which looked a bit better, but he wasn't raving by any means. couple those with one beer and one tea and the bill was nearly £30!
 I would have been ok with half that.
 I'll go back just on the off chance that this was an anomoly, but I was not impressed with Tokyo Diner.",-1
3,"Dishoom is handily located in the heart of Covent Garden and as a result it was packed out at 10 pm on a Sunday evening when I paid it a visit.
The place smells amazing but the food didn't quite live up to the aromatic promise. I ordered the chicken ruby (extra kudos for them using cockney rhyming slang) along with rice but it doesn't really compete with some of the curries I have had in London for a cheaper price. Solid but not spectacular.",-1
4,"After many years of remembering a great comfort food meal at the Bayswater restaurant, finally had a chance to return.  Very good roast meats but recalled a better roast duck than I had.  Slightly disappointed in the end to expectations but still a good quality Cantonese Chinese restaurant.  Had a perception it was better than the best equivalent in NY, but in the end, it was an equal.",1
4,"Tasty ramen in central London.  Inside Bone Daddies it isn't very big and they've mostly gone for the large communal style tables with stools.  I've been told by my friend that lived in Japan for 4 years this is quite normal as in Japan you would normally just eat at the counter after a heavy night out on the drink. There comment was it was a shame that they also didn't serve gyoza to go alongside the ramen.
When we arrived on a Saturday evening we didn't have to wait long for a table and while we were waiting they served us drinks from the bar.  The beer wasn't too badly priced and the ramen was around £10, which is the same at a lot of other ramen places I've been too in London.  We found out that the chef is Australian but of Japanese descent and that you can request your noodles hard or soft, which is authentic to the cuisine.
I ordered the dipping ramen, this is a cold ramen dish perfect for a hot summers day.  The dip that it comes with is hot though.  I do like this dish but I find it a bit trickier to eat using the dipping sauce and always feel there isn't enough.  I'm sure that it's much healthy than the traditional ramen and it's still pretty tasty.",1
5,"Definitely a 5-star experience.  My friends had been raving about the roast duck from the moment we started our Channel crossing on the Eurostar train, and I was thinking: how good can duck be?  Turns out it was so good that I dragged them back for a second round of duck in our 4 days in London.
The duck (GBP22) was suitably tender and well flavoured, and the gravy complemented the taste well.  Other dishes were typical Chinese fare that was above average.  We ordered 2 types of Chinese soups that were typical standard for Europe: barely passable but that's so not the point of being here.  
The staff were somewhat curt but very efficient.  They managed to quickly get us a seat on the ground floor (important as a friend was hobbling with a walking stick) when we walked in on a Sunday afternoon.  The queue on Wednesday dinner was long but we solved the problem by ordering out - the main thing we were interested in was the duck anyway.  
Stood eating on the streets before our theatre show (restaurant is walking distance to many musical/ theatre venues), and decided there and then that ""duck followed by theatre"" shall be part of my next London routine.",1
3,"I would have given it 4 stars. The service was very polite and nice but inattentive. I waited forever to place an order, and waited forever to get attention to get the dessert menu, and almost knocked the waitress serving the next table over, actually she almost knocked me over, as I was trying to leave.  Food was pretty good. Ramen soup (tonkutso) was excellent, and yummily garnished. I had the matcha ramen and was good. succulent texture. Hirata bun was oversized, fluffy and pillowy, and chewy, but there was something indecently inelegant about it. Pork belly was ok - doesn't quite melt in your mouth and of course you couldnt go wrong with the mayo. Mmmm. I also tried the gluten free hirata bun and they microwaved it!! So the ends ended up being very hard. But where I could chew it was actually tasty and the texture quite good - not as soft and pillowy but decent and tasty! If you are going for the gf hirata buns (which only comes in chicken), ask them not to microwave but to steam it.  The matcha tea was absolutely disappointing. It said stoneground in restaurant but it was hardly tasty - i felt like i was drinking plain water.",-1
4,"Think sexiness, think pleasure, think a dining experience that makes you ooooooooooze sex ... think Hakkasan! 
I have wanted to go here to eat for a long time .. only ever managed to make it for cocktails before. 
Last we went for some food to celebrate life. It was delicious. The ambiance and attnetion to detail of this place is wonderful. 
I had Duck rolls for starters and Roast Duck for main ... just devine. The side veggies were cooked to perfection. 
We had a beautiful seasoned Rjoca to top it off ..perfect.
It is pricey but I think totally worth it! 
Would recomend for romance , would recommend for cheering up, would recommend for drinks ! 
Loved it !",1
3,"Our first day in London was a cold and rainy one.  I was looking forward to having a hot bowl of ramen to counter the dreadful weather.  I got the tonkotsu and the husband got the tantanmen.  The Clarence Court egg was impressive.  The yolk was barely set and was a stunningly rich orange color.  The pork was tender and flavorful, although sliced too thin.  I wasn't a fan of the menma.  It was too sour, almost like eating bamboo shoots from a can, where they acquired this unique sour note that is absent in fresh or vacuum packed bamboo shoots.  
My main complaint was the broth.  There can be too much of a good thing and in this case the broth was too rich and too thick.  I love a rich broth like the one from Santouka, but here, it was hard to appreciate the complexity and the umami taste of the broth because it was too oily and viscous.  Husband liked the tantanmen, but I find the peanutty broth too sweet.",-1
5,Literally the best meal I had in London! So good I had a layover for 4 hours at heathrow and we left just to go to dishoom ( another location) anyway I wish we had one in New York because omg this place is amazing.,1
5,"Having now had the opportunity for multiple visits, I've eaten my way through all the ramens and most of the starters. My visits have produced a consistent level of food and service, which is nice
What I love about the ramens is that they all taste different. Though I thought that my favourite would continue to be tonkotsu ramen, in fact my current favourite is tantanmen ramen which has the same depth of flavour in the soup but it comes with a great chilli kick - I love it but if you don't like heat, then I would recommend that you ask them to dial it down a bit
I echo Tim L's advice to ask for cock scratchings (crispy chicken skin) which add a wonderful crunch and umami kick to the dish
As for starters, I prefer the salmon sahimi over the yellowtail. Crispy soft shell crab is great, especially with the spicy mayonnaise though the portion isn't the biggest. A great sharing dish with friends is the artichoke, where you can all dive in and pluck the leaves to dip them
The drink variety is big from no-quibble tapwater to sake (served in a traditional wooden box) all the way to cocktails
The only warning is that the most recent addition to the bottles of condiments on the table that you can add to the ramen is actually a bottle containing hairbands! Definitely inedible but as my dining companion today, Minnie M said, it was the perfect thing she needed to stop her hair getting into her bowl of soup. They really have thought of everything!
Perhaps the greatest accolade for this place is that it's the sort of  place I'd be proud to bring friends. Still the best ramen in town",1
3,"Dim was okay.  Could get the same quality Dim Sum in Chinatown for way cheaper!  
Service was poor.  Waitress wasn't really friendly.  When asked about the menu and where certain things were on the menu she would just give you this blank stare like you should know.  What a dumb ass! and she wonders why she didn't get a tip.  Maybe if your service was better and you smiled a little more you would get better tip. -_-
Macaroons were pretty good.  I only recommend macaroons they were decent and not overpriced.  
Come here if you don't mind paying for overpriced Dim Sum.",-1
3,I don't get the raves.  Mediocre Indian food at best.  Pretentious and definitely not worth the wait in the evenings.,-1
3,"A run of the mill 3* from me for Ping Pong Southbank. Last night was my second visit to this particular dim sum establishment. We had to wait 30 minutes but we cracked open a bottle of wine upstairs in the cocktail bar so that was fine. 
Our waiter was really lovely and friendly, but a bit useless (ie lots of running around and flapping but not much actual doing). That said, I don't really mind crap service when someone is as nice a fella as this dude was, he made us laugh a few times and that's worth its weight in gold (we're cold as ice Kent girls). 
The food was good, no complaints, nothing super special I'll warrant though. They forgot a few dishes which we had to nudge them about.  
I know it's a really lame thing to say but I'm not really into the sharing tables The tables and benches are rounded, and ideal for a group of 8 or so. But for the 3 musketeers alone, nay so good.  With 3 or 4 groups ordering food and wine, there was no space for anything. The chairs don't have backs, which means if you chilling out for the long haul (we were there like 3 hours gossiping away) you're potentially going to be doing a lot of hunching over your table and my back was creaking by the end (I need posture lessons, must Yelp that next).
In short, I would go back if someone else really wanted to go. Else, I probably wouldn't.",-1
5,"We came on a Monday night around 7-8 pm and the line was already out the door. From what I've heard it's like this every night so be prepared to wait. The queue for the bar was about 20 minutes and then the queue for a table was about an hour. It was our last night in London and I realllllly wanted some Indian food so we waited. The staff at the front and inside were very friendly. While we were waiting in the bar queue outside a hostess came around w complimentary drinks of sweet sherry wine, chia tea, and lemon water.. she came around every few minutes which was a really nice touch cus you had something to sip on while you waited. Once we were at a table we started ordering to our hearts delight. We got the veggie and lamb samosas, the ruby chicken, some rice, naan, and a few other things that slip my mind. Everything was well worth the wait. The place does not disappoint. Definitely plan on making a trip back here for their brunch.",1
4,"A real dining experience with a subtle and contemporary take on Chinese food. The interior paves way for a relaxed atmosphere with clever use of lighting and partitioning to give you that private and exclusive dining experience.
We ordered a selection of dishes from throughout the menu, sharing and discussing amongst us in the traditional Chinese way of eating. The vegetarian and meat dim sum platters were generous enough with the prawn dim sum offering an amazing mix of texture and a fresh prawn flavour. In addition the stick tea ribs were amazing and again came in an ample portion. 
For mains, we ploughed through a variety of dishes including vegetarian (of which there is a great selection) and unanimously came to a decision that the sea bream with champagne and honey sauce was utterly memorable. 
For desert I would most definitely recommend the chocolate bomb and a nice selection of macaroons. 
Overall, I would highly recommend this place as an dining experience that can see you lost from the outside world for a number of hours whilst you enjoy the many wonderful flavours of Asian cuisine.",1
3,"No reservations and only one menu. It seems like a lot of people really like this place so maybe for me it is just a personal preference issue. I would say the food was okay but I would rather pay 21 and eat elsewhere.
They start with a green salad with mustard vinaigrette topped with walnuts, followed by steak frites, £21
Your meal is servedl in two portions. There is only an option for rare or well-done.
I thought the sauce was pretty good but the meat was slightly tough. Fries were thin cut, crispy, and not too salty.
I really liked their profiteroles but they could have used a bit less chocolate sauce. It was drowning in it.",-1
2,"Overpriced items my lamb chop was way overdone, look nice but taste shit. 2 stars for the nice staffs.",-1
1,"The most pretentious place I have ever eaten at. You can read all the other reviews about the decor and the setting which is quite spectacular. The place is a scene to be seen and for those to see you. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by the outside bellman/bouncers? and looked up and down before you are delivered off to another chap who walks you thorough the maze to the hostess. 
Picture this, we went for breakfast on a Monday morning with four people and there was only a handful of tables occupied with about 25 staff people milling around trying to look busy. It was amazing the number of staff present for Monday morning breakfast.
We place our order for breakfast, with only one request, that one of the egg dishes be cooked well done. (no running yokes) Simple enough for any breakfast cook.
When the dish arrived, the yoke was still runny and we asked if we could get the order done as requested. The look and attitude that we received from the waitress was "" I told them to cook it the way you wanted"". It went back to the kitchen and was recooked.
Then I took a bite of my french toast, it was totally raw inside, with the milk and egg oozing out. I asked another waitress if the chef could finish cooking the french toast and she brought the dish back to the kitchen.
About 5 minutes later our waitress delivered us the following message from the Chef. "" I will be happy to cook you another french toast, but it will come out the same way as before"" OMG Any five year old can cook french toast!  I was ready to get up and go in the kitchen and show the chef how to make the simplest of breakfast foods.
It just wasn't worth the effort. 
I guess the celebs like their food un cooked. This place is not worth the time nor the effort, especially when there is such a big disconnect between the kitchen, staff and guest.
They obviously did not recognize who we were......
but I hope for all you reading this, you don't support such an unwelcoming place that can't train its staff and kitchen about basic customer service, considering they have so many people on duty.",-1
3,"The street kitchen upstairs was, Meh! Average food, average choice, nothing really stands out. Good for a bite if you are in the area not worth making a trek half-way across the town.",-1
