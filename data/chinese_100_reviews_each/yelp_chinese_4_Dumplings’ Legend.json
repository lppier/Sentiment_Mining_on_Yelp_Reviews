                "description": "Gave this place a go after reading numerous articles about how Dumplings Legend's dumplings are some of the best in town. We came on Tuesday afternoon and were seated immediately. We ordered xiao long bao, prawn dumplings and half an aromatic duck.\nThe xiao long bao was mildly disappointing. The soup was thick and slightly bland. The pork was as expected. One order came with 8 dumplings for £8.\nThe prawn dumplings were mediocre, nothing exceptional yet still very satisfying. One order also came with 8 dumplings for £8.\nSurprisingly, the duck was the best part of the meal. It was crunchy and extremely flavorful. I'd compare it to carnitas in texture. Accompanied with thin pancakes, cucumbers, green onions and brown sauce, it was just an amazing amalgamation of flavors.\nThe service was great, very quick and friendly. Price point was also great, I can't complain about 8 dumplings for £8. But considering we went here to try some of the best dumplings in London, I can't say my expectations were met. For better and cheaper dumplings, I'd recommend going to one of the smaller dim sum shops right down the street.",

We saw that this place was full of people so we decided to give it a try.\nFood: We ordered the Spicy Pork Siu Loung Bao, steamed prawn dumplings and Shanghai-Style Fried Noodles. The spicy pork Siu Loung Bao was nothing more than chili sauce and it was way too watery. The steamed prawn was the best of the three but the skin was thicker than I would have liked. The shanghai-style fried noodles was over sauced.\nService: Outside the door said \"10% off the bill of you pay with cash Monday-Thursday.\" We asked the waitress about it and got an eye roll. We paid for meal in cash and got multiple one pound change. We then went to get dessert at a near by place and tried to use to the change we received. We found out that the change was older currency and they would not accept it. So, we did get the 10% only to be SCAMMED a few pounds. Terrible service is one thing, but you can tell they aren't very trustworthy people by the way they acted. \nPrice: Overpriced subpar chinese food that you pay for sitting in a nicer restaurant. \nThis place didn't impress us and we don't appreciate them giving us old currency. I don't recommend this place at all. Don't be fooled that this place always looks full. There are plenty of other food options nearby.",

I should have just gone without. \nI ordered the shrimp toast, the crispy duck and one order each of their 4 varieties of XLB. The shrimp toast was ok. The duck was so over cooked and dry that I sent it back. But the real sin was the XLB - about 1/3 we're broken when they brought them. The rest were literally touching each other so you couldn't remove one without breaking the one next to it. Out of 32 Bao I found 6 with soup in them. If you don't know XLB the whole stinking point is that there is soup in them!\nIn a neighborhood with close to 100 Chinese restaurants, you can safely skip this one.",

                "description": "Let me preface this review by saying that Xiao Long Bao is my LIFE so I have extremely high standards for it. I'm not entirely sure about the standards of XLB in London so I'm definitely surprised to hear that Dumplings' Legend offers some of the best in London after my meal.\nI haven't tried other XLB to compare but I'm sure this city must have more amazing XLB to show! Overall - 4 stars because the XLB were great, don't get me wrong, but they weren't out of this world and this city definitely deserves better!\n~ Atmosphere:\nIncredibly hectic. The place was packed FULL, overall not too pleasant of an atmosphere to eat in.\n~ Customer Service:\nI've had a different experience to other reviewers - the customer service here is great. Very attentive and quick with their service. The food came out at the speed of light.\n~ Food:\nWe ordered both pork and pork and crab XLB - both of them were really great and juicy, but the broth inside was just OK. I much preferred the pork and crab to the pork-only because the crab added an extra dimension of flavour that took their XLB to the next level. Overall, I liked their Xiao Long Bao but if you're a self-proclaimed XLB connoisseur like me you should keep searching.\nDownsides: Ordered their custard buns, it wasn't custard but salted duck yolk (which I like, but definitely not custard so I don't know why they advertised it as such). Also, they don't offer Chinese hot oil at all unfortunately, only soy sauce and vinegar. Not too great if you're into hot oil like I am.\n---\nI like Dumplings Legend. I would say that they're more of a 3.5 stars, but I'm happy to bump it up to a 4 because I don't think it's quite there to justify a 3. The food was great and I'd definitely come back here again, but the search for the best XLB in London continues on.",

The bottom would rip, the soup would come out, and we'd be left with just some filling and ripped dumpling dough.\nOn the flipside, the staff was friendly.\nThe hot and sour soup was okay, a bit too sweet.\nIf you're in a pinch, don't feel like waiting, and want some Chinese food, this place will do the trick, but I can't really recommend it beyond that.",

They were American (I am American). A French mother and daughter two tables away from us as well as this table of American men repeatedly flagged down the waiters for waiting a long time for food.  I thought they was just unfamiliar in the ways of Chinese service, nope!\nOur food began arriving because I ordered all over the menu. However, it became apparent that the complaints of my fellow patrons were true. First off, the runners couldn't even tell us what they were dropping off and argued that a dish on the table was tripe. Tripe is my religion. My boyfriend knows tripe--he's basically a butcher. That wasn't even the same color or texture as tripe. I returned from the bathroom and my boyfriend tells me the two guys next to us left and it was a huge drama because they refused to pay for any of their food or drinks because they waiting over an hour and their dim sum never came. Around this point, the mother and daughter received theirs, they waited more than an hour and unfortunately only ordered one type of dim sum.\n2 hours into our experience, 4 dishes hadn't arrived. But! This new server came out of nowhere. He was so lively and friendly compared to the woman who took our drink order and actively avoided everyone in the dining room despite being the only server on our floor. I asked him if the plate in front of me (we tried to eat it but it was so dry and cold), was tripe. He laughed and said no! And very quickly and efficiently took that and our missing food items off the bill. THEY STILL HADN'T EVEN MADE THEM--otherwise we would've boxed them. He saved our entire experience. He even said not to worry about the service charge. No man, you deserve all the service charges. That second star is just for him. And we will probably give this place another shot because he was so great.",

The waitresses were rude and ignored us, seemed very unhappy when we tried to order some water. When we asked about the service fee since it is not necessarily required in the UK, they were mad and told us that everyone has to pay the tips in restaurants, it is same in the United States. And did not even listen to us, they were like: pay the service fee otherwise you could not leave. Really disgusting experience in this restaurant. 服务员没素质又冷漠，从进门到最后买单不会说一个你好和谢谢，一脸不高兴嫌麻烦，最后还无理强加小费，说英国美国都一样都要给小费，一副高高在上无所谓的样子",

While waiting you can already check out the small dumpling-kitchen where thousands of dumplings must be made daily.\nThe menu is a bit confusing and not completely consistent with the DIY order list but if you don't know what or how to order just ask the staff. If you want something special and you know the name but you cannot find it on the menu just ask and probable they will just bring it. It would actually help if you know a bit  what you want or otherwise just try to be seated next to some (Chinese) locals and copy ;-)\nI was graving for dumplings so only had a nice variety of the fresh dumplings but I will definitely come back soon to try the dumpling soups and the steamed filled buns which looked amazing at our neighbours tables.",

We were three people and they sat us in a table for five, which was fine for us. A little after we ordered the food and received our drinks they asked us to move tables, but to a table that could barely fit two people. \nIn our previous table they sat a group of six kids, and from their look I can assure they were not happy, it was obviously too small. \nThe dumplings were OK, I have had better dumplings there in the past so I was not very impressed. \nLocation wise, the place is great, right in the middle of Chinatown and only a few blocks from Leicester Square station.",

I recommend scooping them out with a spoon then attacking them with chopsticks, unless you are really good with chopsticks - which I am not.  We also ordered one of the specials prawn toast, this has to be the best prawn toast I've ever had! It had full prawns with tails layerd on top of toast with sesame seeds.

The crayfish ones are really good, but you can't go wrong with their classic pork. Just remember, all in one bite! Don't try and do it in halves because then you'll get precious bao juice all over yourself you messy pup! \nService is fast, efficient though not particularly happy or friendly.

I have been here several times and have always been super impressed with the food. \nThe food is beyond excellent. This place is famous for their dim sum and dumplings, which are very good. I usually get the crystal prawn, and their broth infused dumplings in the spicy pork. Beware though! When eating the broth infused ones you have to gobble it down in one bite otherwise you will get it all over yourself! I also like to get the crispy duck and pancakes, and I'll admit that this dish isn't the best you'll find in Chinatown but its still lovely. The chinese broccoli is also a top dish for me, as well as the pumpkin and prawn dish which is totally different from anything you would find at other places.\nThe venue is so clean its virtually spotless. Everything is white and clean and the glass partition where the dim sum makers work is wiped down several times a day and is always looking great. This is such a nice change from the other places in Chinatown, which seem a bit moldy with old sticky carpet floors. This place is also huge and I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to be seated.\nThe service could be better, but its not any worse than the other places in Chinatown which aren't exactly known for their exceptional service. You do have to hail down your waitor, and be very clear when you order otherwise you will get the wrong thing. But all in all this is totally worth it as the dim sum, dumplings, and everything else there is incredible.\nTip: Order the fresh squeezed apple juice, they literally squash an entire apple into the cup and it comes out all foamy and fresh.",

One of the less externally scary looking places in London's small Chinatown for those of you that may not appreciate hole-in-the-wall ethnic foodie dining experiences. Inside it is clean, modern, bright and even a little hip with some artsy images on the wall and music playing with a vibrant beat. The staff speak passable English (and while this is really not a great sign for an authentic Chinese dining experience, it is, after all, located in the heart of London so it is necessary), the menu has a fair amount of interesting dishes including a list of about 120 dim sum items and noodle soups. I had prawn and chive dumplings and a clay pot rice with minced pork and salted fish. The food is tasty but a bit more expensive than some of the other dim sum places in the area and the real reason I am not as enthusiastic about this place as I should be is that they did not have steamed tripe on their dim sum list. I love that dish and use it as a baseline to measure dim sum joints around the world. It is a very basic, readily available \"famine food\" (offal made delicious so poor people would eat it during tough times) dim sum dish and this is he only dim sum spot I have ever been to where it is not available. If they start offering tripe, this place goes to 4 stars.",

                "description": "We spent three weeks in London last year and ate here with pleasant results three times. So when we arrived in London again, this was our first choice for dim sum. \nUnhappily the results were not good. To begin, the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. Staff helpful. Waited 15 minutes for a table. Each group is seated individually. Not family style. We ordered only dim sum. Started with wanton soup. Broth tasted like dishwater, no flavor. Colored water. Wantons large but not cooked enough.  All the other dishes were under cooked. The barbecue pork buns were over flavored with hoisin sauce and undercooked. The Chang-fen with prawn , again undercooked. The Cantonese shrimp dumplings. Same issue. Fell apart trying to serve. Minced pork and crab soup-Mai tasted like shrimp instead and pork undercooked and grizzly. Perhaps in their haste to get food to many customers, did not bother to finish cooking\nOther customers who did not order dim sum looked like they were having a better experience. Would not return for dim sum.",

After handing over our order the server said we had to order more food if we wanted to eat there, so we checked off a few more items. Then the mgr came over and said that we didn't order enough. So again I explained to her we just wanted dim sum, hence the sign outside said they served dim sum. Yet there was no sign that said we had to order a certain \"amount\" to dine there. Mgr was very rude about the situation and said we had to order food from the main menu on top of the dim sum menu.. so instead of causing a scene I told her to her face out loud that this was unexceptionable and I've never been anywhere in the world where I was treated this way. Yes I get that she wanted to make more money from us dining there. Shame on you I said as we walked out.",

                "description": "Totally fine.  \nBy London standards; this is my fave dim sum to date.  \nBy dim sum Alex S has consumed over her lifetime standards; this is just fine.\nDumplings' Legend is best known for its soup dumplings, of which they have several varieties.  Go for the standard pork which - despite a too-thick skin - is still delicious and, well, \"porky\".  It bugs that we don't get our own containers of vinegar to douse each dumpling ourselves (just a tiny little ginger-and-vinegar dish given to each diner ordering dumplings) but, well...they bore through my requests for more with a smile, so points there.\nI know it's unfair to compare and yet, well...I do.  Compared to San Francisco, New York, Toronto: all far superior dumpling cultures, and Dumplings' Legend falls flat in that ranking.  And for the price, these are not cheap dumplings.  And they're not stellar.  So...womp.  Craving for soup dumplings fulfilled, yes, but with a little side of \"ugh\".  \nI mean, sure, I'll likely be back, but I'm totally on board with Leighton S who summarized so well: (paraphrasing) dumplings tasty, service friendly, not a bad option, no rush to return.  \nYelp note: really lovely clean and multi-stall bathrooms which, well, deserve a special call-out.

                "description": "My co-worker mentioned this place and I was craving for some good northern dumplings at the moment, so I made a trip down there almost immediately.\nHowever this is not a place for northern dumplings (jiao zi), but a little heaven for soup dumplings (xiao long bao). \nTheir xlb is consistently good. Went there alone once,  took a friend who's very picky about xlb there twice, and everyone was happy with it. They have many options for xlb, including a very special one -- spicy xiao long bao. This is the first time I tried something like this and I am a fan!  The stuffing is soupy and flavorful, I could eat 2 orders (16 xlbs that is) all by myself.\n5 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus tube station, and not too far away from Covent Garden. They also open till late almost everyday, great for late night cravings after musical/opera/shopping. \nAs for other dishes, I didn't even bother to try. I know they have a big menu, but when a place is named \"Dumplings' Legend\" and has a window that shows live dumpling making, you simply stick with the dumplings.",

Xiao long bao (steamed dumplings with soup and meat inside), assorted meat with vegetables, spicy salted prawns, and beef with rice noodles with sauce. Dumpling Legend had an advertisement where if you ordered more than 25£, you can select a small dish for an additional few pounds. Our selected dish was the spicy salted prawns. \nThe XLB is no where near what you can get at Joe's Shanghai in New York, but we were not expecting that. They were about average. Not the best nor the worst.  The assorted meat and vegetables had a good variety of chicken, prawns, and scallops. The beef and rice noodles were comparable to the US and the table next to us ordered the same dish based on staring at ours! The spicy salted prawns wee nicely salted and a great deal(about 8-10 prawns) for only 2£ more! \nThe price here was a bit high at 35£, but after being exhausted from a long day of sightseeing, it was ok.",

Perhaps to call their dumplings legendary is stretching it a bit but they were definitely the best part of our meal. The xiao loong bao had thin skin encasing the soup, which was flavoursome\nSadly, this was the highlight of our meal. The Peking duck promised much as it was carved tableside in the traditional way. The skin was served with pancakes, cucumber, spring onion and hoisin sauce. The meat was fried up but there was only a tiny amount to share between us\nThe main dishes were forgettable but the real kick came when the bill arrived. £45 for Peking duck and the extortionate amount we were charged for rice means this tourist trap only scores 2 stars",

In fact, they're actually quite soupy and the flavour is also very good. As for the rest of the dishes...let's put it this way: they should stick with making dumplings!\nWhat is really off-putting as well is the amount of tourists that come into this place...it just feels like a factory more than a true local place. The whiteness of the clientele is then only exasperated by the awful white interior. In fact, I was here with two Asian architects, who simply could not help but complain about the awful design!\nSo, let me recap: do go here for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao)...and maybe also have a couple of appetizers, but I cannot really recommend any main dishes...",

Having already been to Shanghai for the real soup dumpling, I was excited to try this location even if it was thousands of mile away. The place was busy and I was traveling alone but was seated immediately. I enjoyed the traditional pork soup dumplings, 1/4 Peking duck and some shrimp dumplings and probably a few others since my bill was $50 British Pounds! The service was prompt and helpful. I did not feel rushed especially dining alone. I also enjoyed the \"dumpling room\" where the chefs tirelessly cranked out dumpling after dumpling. A neat little place in London's Chinatown.",

No doubt they are not bad by London standards.\nOther than that there are a variety of dishes on the menu. The fried rice is nice and fried hot enough so that the rice is dry. The pigs ear in chilli oil looked devilishly red and scary, but turned out quite yummy.\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the drunken chicken. What is meant to be a cold, smooth and slippery dish instead was hard and tough.",

But you know me, let's talk about the food.\nDumplings - The Xiao Long Bao is good, definitely better than most places.  The steamed pork and veg ones - a little disappointing.  I was actually really surprised on the small selection of dumplings on the menu.  I thought naming a restaurant \"Dumplings Legends\" you'd have more variety.\nOther stuff - Spicy pork belly and spicy chicken something.  Both were good but forgettable dishes. Beef tenderloin - I've never had anything like this but I wasn't thrilled at all.  Seafood ho fun - probably one of the better dishes.  Singapore fried noodles - definitely had better elsewhere.  \nService - they were very eager to take out order but didn't care about us afterwards.  Place does get quite busy but a good place to go with larger groups.",

It's mostly bland and uninteresting. Crispy noodles and seafood tasted like it was a frozen meal from the market. The roasted meats were ok not great. Dumplings are better from my local shops on Clement Street in San Francisco.\nIn short, go across the street to Golden Dragon. This place isn't worth the trip unless the food is free.",

                "description": "Just no. (That's a short review in itself but read on if you are curious.)\nPRO - I really don't know. I think we came in this establishment because we were starving and saw a lot of people sitting by the windows (READ: they purposely seat as much people as possible by the windows to make it seem like they are busy, smart and cunning!). \nCONS - RUDE service! I asked a waitress what the other table was having and she pointed to an item on the menu and I ordered it (it was an entirely different item by the way). When it came, I told another waitress that was not what we ordered, she kinda just shrugged it off and walked away (we were later charged for the wrongful recommendation). We asked another waitress (third different waitress now if you are keeping track) for extra sauce and she gave us attitude (come on woman, it is just sauce!). Prices were average (as compared to the other dim sum joints around Chinatown that we should have went to instead). The Xiao Long Bao (what they were apparently were known for) was also average. They had a spicy Xiao Long Bao version -- BAD. They basically shoved a spoonful of hot Szechuan peppers (including the numbing spice) with their usual filling and it tasted just spicy with no depth of flavor! \nCONCLUSION - The scallop rice rolls and quail egg shu mai were decent (but I'm sure I will find better ones in the other dim sum restaurants) but the snotty service will keep me from coming back. Oh, the bathrooms don't have soap so think of all the employees handling your food - RED FLAG!",

                "description": "I'm a bit torn on my review for this place.  The soup dumplings (xiao long bao, or XLB) were decent.  Just remember that you have to have light fingers and a spoon in hand when handling the XLB without breaking it! And break the dumpling skin just a bit, so you can slurp out the soup - otherwise you will probably sear the skin off the roof of your mouth.  No, I'm serious. \nAnyway, their XLB - sure, decent, delicious, soupy and not dry.  But anything else on the menu?  Just don't bother.  Its way overpriced for what you get, and I don't think there were any dinner dishes that were decent.  The service was quite shoddy as well.  I don't know how many times we had to flag someone down, only to be ignored.. but when we were able to get our orders in, we had to repeatedly remind them that we were still waiting on something.  \nThis is my first time having Peking Duck in London, and it was £45.  I nearly had a heart attack.  I'm not sure if this is the standard, but seriously... ?????  I couldn't.. i just couldn't wrap my head around that.  It better have been some fantastic duck, but it wasn't. \nThere should have been some fresh hand made roti-style pancake to wrap the duck.  Instead, we were given WON TON wrappers.  Again. WTF?????  They are trying to pull one over you if they are giving you wonton wrappers.  I know others didn't see it as being a big deal.  Its like ordering an expensive burger, to be given some meat sandwiched in between 2 slices of white bread.  Or given cheese whiz instead of real cheese.  Yes, its a big deal.\nI get that essentially its supposed to be 2 dishes - the second is a lettuce duck wrap.  Which was so small, that there were only enough for 5-6 people.  Complete rip off. \nWe also ordered a bucket of rice, should have been the equivelent of around 6'ish packed bowls of rice.  We had to ask 3 times, then it finally came at the END of dinner, in a large sized soup bowl.  We ended up being charged £26 for that. 26 !!!!!!!!  around 2.50 per person, and we had 11 people.  But I know for a fact, there's no way there were 11 bowls of rice in that bowl.  \nTotal kick in the face.  I'd rather go elsewhere for food, and for XLB for that matter.",

The turnip dumplings were definitely the best I ever had, and the beef hofun really hit the spot. Two friends had the set menu, which looked ok but with rather small portions. However, we weren't given the time of day for at least 20 minutes after we were seated. I tried to catch the eyes of various waiters - smiling, glancing, waving - on a number of occasions; what finally did it was all of us standing up and preparing to leave (which brought over the manager right quick but unapologetic). As delicious as the dumplings were, the whole place put a bad taste in my mouth.",

Apparently my husband has been eating them for years when he goes to San Francisco on business, so he was all smooth and suavé about it, all Mr. Professional XLB Eater Man. Dude has been holding out on me. \nI'm not gonna say these are the most authentic and delicious soup dumplings in London, because I have nothing to compare them to. But I can tell you that I wrestled down 11 of them on my own, no problem. I can tell you that they are full of a fresh ginger/lemongrass/pork flavor that makes them an absolute delight to eat.

My chinese dish of chicken stir-fry with chili and lemongrass was just ok. Price are reasonable most dumplings (they seem to come 3 to a plate) cost between 2 and 3 pounds, and mains are between 7 and 10 pounds. Not bad for lunch!\nService is friendly but a bit slow, however, the overall place was spotless---very clean and bright.

Their weekly special creations can a bit baffling. Christmas lobster dumplings? No thanks.\nDining experience was fine - seated quickly on one busy Saturday noon. Service was slightly disorganized even for a Chinese establishment.\nThe soup noodle gave me somewhat of a gag reflex. Tasted fine at first but ended up losing it all over the kitchen sink an hour later.\nWould I come back? Not too sure.",

See, being my flatmate, she knows how much I love Xiao Long Bao, and wanted to give me another experience. So, all I had was Xiao Long Bao! Others had various dishes from dumplings, noodles, and full entrees, but me, all I needed was my dumplings.\nFirst, Dumplings' Legend is BYOB, so BYO-what you want and you won't have to dash out mid-meal like we did.\nNext, the pork and crab XLB was fantastic! The spicy pork, not so much. It was actually too spicy, but not in a fiery kind of way, but more in a \"there's too much black pepper happening here\" kind of way. I'd definitely go back for the non-spicy ones though.\nOther than that, it's a standard dim sum restaurant, much like the ones I love in the States. That being said, it's obviously a bit farther from authentic, despite being in the heart of Chinatown. But, it is right in the heart of everything, which is a bonus.",

The place was definitely authentic and i saw them making the dumplings in the restaurant so I thought they would be great, but sadly it was disappointing. I ordered the xiaolongbao, soup dumplings, and they were just so tiny in comparison to what I've usually had. They tasted great, the flavor was there, but it was so small. I also ended up ordering the roast duck and roast pork with some rice. The roast pork was decent, but it wasn't the real roast pork, if you know what I mean, the texture was off and it it just wasn't the same as what I've had. The  duck I had was pretty fatty, but the taste was good, albeit a bit greasy. I had high hopes for this place but they fall flat. I've eaten at so msny great Chinese places that this place just didn't compare. The food itself was decent, but it wasnt spectacular or anything to write home about. There are plenty of other places to visit in China Town and I recommend that you do.",

We were seated near the kitchen and could see packets and packets of pre-fab, identically packaged frozen dumplings being brought out from a freezer. The dumpling chefs were not making dumplings as usual but were sitting behind the glass, reheating the frozen dumplings. The dumplings that are usually heavenly were tasteless and were leaking goopy fatty liquid. \nNot happy!",

                "description": "ok,i really really really wanted to love this place, but honestly, it was just ok. For London where Chinese food is lacking, it was great. But honestly, the xiao long bao is just as good (if not better) in Los Angeles, where the cost is 1/2 of that. We ordered 6 orders of XLB, 1 eggplant dish, 1 rice dish, and our total came out to $104!!!! In LA, the same order would cost less than $60.  Each order of XLB averaged 6.60 - 8.5 eur. CRAZY. This place is posh and modern, and you can watch a billion chinese dumpling chefs wrap dumplings while you're eagerly waiting, but it's hard for me to give them a superb review bc LA is so much cheaper. It is what it is.\nOne thing I didn't like was the staff. We told them that we had a party of 4, thinking that a baby doesn't count. When we finally got called to our table, we asked them for a high chair. \n\"Oh, 3 adults and 1 baby?\" \n\"No, 4 adults and 1 baby.\" \nThe skinny bartender got involved (don't ask me why....) and yelled angrily, \"is it 4 or 5? 4 is different from 5 and 5 is different from 4! Which one is it?!\"\nARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! He wanted to pick a fight over numbers?! This is a common mistake. So what if we said 4 and now we have 5? That's just more business for them! If the 5th was a real addition, I'd tell them to go eat at a competitor's.  \nThe hostess (NOT THE BARTENDER) should have just asked for clarification, not yell at the customer and [figuratively] spit in our faces. People like that bartender give Chinese people a bad name. They should fire him, not only for charging an arm and a leg for cheap alcohol, but for his rudeness and lack of bedside manners. Something tells me he's one of the owners though. Bah.",

                "description": "I can't believe I'm \"celebrating\" my 200th Qype review with one of my worst dining experiences in London in my 6 years here.\n Dumpling's Legend is a new restaurant just opened in Chinatown, specialising in a type of Shanghainese dumpling called Xiao Long Bao. The interior is sleek and modern, very neutrally white but feeling a bit soulless.\n We of course ordered a basket of 8 xiao long baos, and were not disappointed - they were good, although nothing extremely special. Having dined at Leong's Legends round the corner, I think the xiao long bao there are better - with a richer filling and thinner dumpling skin.\n We also ordered beef noodles and pork chop noodles to go with the dumplings, and were really disappointed with them. When the noodles came they looked pathetic - a big bowl of tasteless broth, with some noodles and limp stalks of vegetables swimming inside. The pork chops were average (again, Leong's Legend was better). The beef soup came in a separate bowl to be poured over the noodles - the bowl was way too hot to lift to pour, so we had to resort to using the spoon to slowly transfer the soup and beef over.\n Overall, a very disappointing experience, and we shall definitely not be going back again. The noodles gets a 1 star from us - the xiao long bao a 3 star rating - averaging out to two stars.\n Reviewed by The London Insider\nlondon-insider.co.uk",

Not Ding Tai Fun quality but decent for London.\nWent there few nights ago on a rainy, cold London night trying to decide a new place or going back to this place. It's safe to say that my decision turned out to be the wrong one.\nOrdered the crab soup dumping. I can tell the dumpling is not freshly made. Given this is 9 pm, I gave they a pass since it still tasted OK. Then the horror begins. Hot and sour soup looked like a bowl of thickened dark vinegar. The string bean with minced pork was way too oily and salty. The only decent dish is the tofu with minced pork.\nIn addition to the bad food, the service was just horrible. I know what to expect from an Asian restaurant, but this is even below par. Don't let the picture of HRH at the entrance fool you. What does a white person know about good Chinese food??",

But, I'm not sure I would say that they were good though...  The first one I picked up stayed intact and tasted...ok.  The rest of them thereafter burst and the lovely soup leaked out on to the bamboo steamer....what a disappointment.  This did not happen to the Ding Tai Fung dumplings...\nSalted Egg Prawns:  Ok, I admit that I do not remember the exact name of this dish but it is basically prawns tossed in salted egg yolk and deep fried with the shell and head of the prawns on.  This was mighty yummy.  The fried this so nice and crispy, you could eat the shell and all.  The salted egg yolk gave it a nice taste.  I just loved it!\nEgg fried rice:  Well, it is as it sounds.  Nothing special.  Actually, quite mundane.  I was disappointed in the portion size.  For 4 pounds, I expect more than a small chinese bowl size.  But I'm jaded with my large American portions.
