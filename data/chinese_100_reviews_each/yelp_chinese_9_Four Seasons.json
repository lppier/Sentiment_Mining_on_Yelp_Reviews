This one is said to be renowned for its bbq duck, though I noted that a number of its neighbors also featured that prominently.\nWhat's great about it here is that, if you're a solo diner, you can get a small quantity.  There is, for instance, a lunch rice plate that comes with 1-3 bbq meats of your choice.  I found the duck excellent, juicy and crunchy without being in the least bit gamy as duck often is.  I also had spareribs which were a little dry.",

Have it enough chances, think they don't deserve another. Essentially not only do they rush you to order, they also kick you out before you even finish your food.\nFood is just a 3 star I'd say. Not bad but nothing outstanding. Price is high however and way to high for the service they provide.",

                "description": "Hubby and I were hungry and happen to be by Chinatown around dinner time one night in London so we stopped in here after seeing a long line here the night before . We wanted to see what the hype was. We noticed they have multiple locations with the first being open since 1990, so we knew the food had to be good. I also double checked on Yelp and noticed most of the bad reviews were non-Asian or complaints about the restaurant, service, or tip. Aka, good food? Im down! \nThe entrance and ground floor is tight but we managed to be lead upstairs to our table. I am glad they gave us a bigger table for our winter jackets, shopping bags, and room for the food we ordered. \nWe asked what were some of the best sellers and ordered two dishes to share. Plus an appetizer of xiao long bao. \nThe xiao long bao was meh, skip it. \nWe also ordered the crispy aromatic duck and lobster. The duck was extremely good. The lobster as quite good as well, but not a good as impressive as the duck. The duck I highly recommend getting when visiting here. Next time I will get the traditional roast duck as it has been deemed by the Financial Times as \"the best roast duck in the world\" lol. That probably means at least in the UK it is the best. \nThe waiter does speak Chinese and English so no worries if you cant speak Chinese. \nThis place is pretty traditional from the food to experience. Dirty, small, dingy restaurant. Waiter is pushy and cranky (what Chinese adult/parent isnt lol). Plating is traditional (plopped on a plate lol). Table side service for the duck. The only thing I didnt do is get a hot bowl of water to clean my utensils lol. \nYou do have to pay for rice and water. Oh, and I think I spotted 20% automatic tip. \n*For my fellow Chinese : Every Chinese person is showing face so wear nice clothes- service is better then - hint hint. \nThis place offers great authentic Chinese food. Get off the high horse and get passed the ambiance/cleanliness, plating, service, cost, etc. and enjoy the good food they have to offer. Its good. It why you go to a restaurant at the end of the day....to eat. Visit and enjoy the Duck!",

                "description": "This is a small shop located across Bubblewrap and every time we walked by, their were little to no customers around. I personally feel like this place is more authentic than the other places on Chinatown which may account for why it lacks popularity.\nThe person who served us was relatively polite and nice but one of the ladies working was pretty rude to us. \nWe ordered beef noodle soup, fried rice, Chinese spinach, and seafood soup. The fried rice was good as was the spinach. The noodle soups were just ok and were not anything special.\nOverall, this was a subpar place and I probably wouldn't go to it again. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great.",

Our dishes were extremely greasy and salty. I understand that a little use of oil prevents stickiness in the pan but when the vegetable dish is greasier than the meat dish then there's a problem. The couple things that were passable was the steam rice and BBQ pork. The chow fun was drenched with a very salty gravy. I think my doctor would recommend me to stop dining here. \nAlso the men's toilet is the smallest one I've been to. How small is it? Imagine sharing an airplane bathroom with another person. I swear while I was peeing I was rubbing shoulders with the man in the next stall and rubbing cheeks with another man washing his hands. Intimacy is good sometimes but not in the toilet. \nAfter the meal there is complimentary orange slices and mint for your stinky breath. They also add a 12% service charge to your bill.",

                "description": "When I arrived, I hear people speaking Cantonese so as a Cantonese speaker I speak to the guy up front in Chinese only to be met with gruff, broken English. We are sat and given water but had to ask for tea at $1.50/pp. When it came time to place our order I asked again in Chinese for 1/4 duck, chicken satay appetizer and the braised beef wonton noodles.\nThe chicken came out first and then the noodles without the beef. I looked confused and said I ordered the beef one. One of the waitresses offered to switch it but I said it was fine. What bothered me was that waiter was adamant that I was wrong. He protested in Chinese \"I'm not wrong! She didn't order that!!!\" Soooooo when I speak in Chinese you pretend you don't know any but when something is wrong you complain in Chinese?? What great customer service...\nThe wonton noodles were soggy and an off putting grey color. It's as if the noodles were pre cooked and just left out - the noodles were still sticking together in clumps in the hot broth. \nThe duck was extremely dry and I was insulted that they would serve it. We were basically given shredded scraps (see pic). Had I not slathered the pancake with hoisin sauce, it would've been inedible. \nThe chicken satay was decent from the one bite I tried but still fairly dry.\nThis establishment provides better service to non-Chinese clientele from what I saw when I was there. \nAlso, I think they sensed I was annoyed and they automatically charged  20% tip to our check under \"Discretionary\" even though we were just a party of 2. What crappy business practices!!!!!",

We opted for the three meat plate each time and it was plenty of food to share. Their duck was juicy and not too fatty. I don't think it was a life changing dish but it was solid. What we really enjoyed, surprisingly, was their soy chicken. It was moist and had just a hint of flavor from the soy sauce. Their crispy pork was also solid and a nice textural difference to have. \nAs for their other options, we were not impressed. We also tried their Peking style duck which was too dry and was definitely not worth the price. It honestly tasted like it was sitting out for too long. Their calamari wasn't special and was overcooked. I don't even really remember the other dishes we tried because they weren't that good.",

Another of the same, plus chicken. Then 3 starters, meat spring rolls, salt and pepper ribs and dumplings.\nThe rice was a decent portion but the sauce that was wrongly sweet. The duck was OK, the pork was delicious and the chicken came with no skin, no bone and the spring onion came ontop of the duck! Why?? Plus the overall meat portion was small. \nThe starters were appalling and clearly aimed at an unassuming audience who wouldn't know better. The ribs were bone dry and bland, the dumpling skin was thick and fried, but not in the way you'd want. The spring rolls were supposed to be 2 large pork ones but ended up being 4 small ones with non-existant chicken. \nOverall, I'd cone back for their expensive rice dishes if I had no other choice, but the starters were awful. Our waiter was ok but I heard one say \"everyone's tastes are different\" when being asked about portion sizes and what they would recommend.",

What a great start. Among a couple other dishes we ordered the whole duck. We should have only gotten the half duck. There was a LOT of it. It was very good.\nIt's unfortunate Chinese is going through a down period in so many markets because it's not all the generic meat and veg in a brown sauce when done right. They did it right tonight.",

There are multiple duck options but ordered the half Cantonese duck, seemed to be on the page that they were highlighting.  It was fantastic.  Crispy skin, meatier than expected and in a soy based sauce they really highlighted the duck.\nI also ordered the two BBQ meat combo, with char sui and pork belly.  Both were great.  Char sui was flavorful.  Pork belly was not too fatty and the crispy parts were awesome (it was all tasty).\nI also ordered a vegetable by pointing to a picture as I figured I needed something other than meat.  I wish they had smaller portions (of vegetables) but even it was very good, very garlicky and tasty.  \nOverall, loved it and one of my favorite Chinese meals ever.",

Four Seasons was recommended to us by a friend for good crispy duck. There was also a message posted on the window that said \"best roast duck in the world\", so we came with rather high expectations. Arrived around 7pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was very busy. There was not enough space to wait inside so we had to wait outside the door.\nAfter a 15 minute wait, we were seated downstairs, which was a bit cramped and dingy. We ordered the half Roasted Duck and Oyster Pancake. The Roast Duck was good - the meat was tender and juicy, but the oyster pancake was pretty tasteless. Prices were standard Chinatown.\nService was brisk and adrupt - normal for Chinese Restaurants so I had no complaints. However, we did ask for oyster sauce for our oyster pancake, but the waitress gave us Chili Oil. Maybe oyster sauce is more of a US thing and they don't have it in London?",

As with most Chinese restaurants don't expect great customer service. It's not their forte. Though you will get service charge added, so expect that.\nWe got the roasted duck, which it is famed for. I had many recommendations that this was THE place to get duck from in Chinatown. A whole one of course. They had unfortunately run out of crispy pork belly (another rec), so we settled from BBQ pork which was really good.\nThe duck was good. Fatty, juicy, though we kept it on the bone for flavour and this meant it was awkward to eat into. Duck is hard to cut like this, so the pieces er eaten eaten whole or bitten using hands.\nVery nice overall.",

Thank goodness I'm no longer allergic but even if I was, the crispy roast duck pancakes served here would encourage me to keep eating regardless. The three of us ordered the duck pancakes with a half duck and salt&pepper tofu (beancurd). The duck pancakes were delectable! The half duck was served in shreds to make it easier on us to make our own pancakes with cucumber strips and onion strips. We were given the duck sauce (looks like BBQ sauce) along with a trio of spices to fully customize our heavenly duck experience. \nThe salt&pepper tofu was alright, but it was nothing special so I wouldn't order it again. \nCONS - It's a bit spendy for the amount of duck you get but Four Seasons know they are hot shit compared to other roast duck places around Chinatown so they are \"entitled\" to price their duck that way ;) So the problem lies solely with me and that I should get a higher paying job to eat more duck pancakes, dammit!",

We ordered a whole roast duck (Â£24), sliced beef (which was savory and slightly sweet, but so juicy and delicious), choi sum vegetables stir fried with garlic, tofu with prawn stuffing, and a herbal pork soup with black and white pepper which was a milky white color because of the carnation milk they added (we took a chance with the soup because it was so cold and we were so glad we did, it was so yummy and helped clear out my sinuses).  The total bill was around Â£100 but the food was amazing,  definitely one of the best I've ever had from both the U.K., and the USA.  The restaurant was fairly old and small even though it has two floors. We sat in the first floor and there were 6 tables. The staff was incredibly attentive. When we arrived, they took a few minutes to set up a table for us (3 adults and a toddler) and the toddler seat was set up before we even asked for one.  Once, we had dropped a chopstick, and the owner (manager?) immediately  grabbed us a new pair of chopsticks. When all our dishes arrived, our table was quite crowded and they quickly lifted up the extension of the table and gave us more space.  The staff spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin and I felt completely at ease conversing with them in Cantonese as they were extremely friendly and customer oriented. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for amazing Cantonese food. They also own \"Little Four Seasons\" which was more on the main side of Gerard Street but I have not yet tried it.",

                "description": "Definitely a 5-star experience.  My friends had been raving about the roast duck from the moment we started our Channel crossing on the Eurostar train, and I was thinking: how good can duck be?  Turns out it was so good that I dragged them back for a second round of duck in our 4 days in London.\nThe duck (GBP22) was suitably tender and well flavoured, and the gravy complemented the taste well.  Other dishes were typical Chinese fare that was above average.  We ordered 2 types of Chinese soups that were typical standard for Europe: barely passable but that's so not the point of being here.  \nThe staff were somewhat curt but very efficient.  They managed to quickly get us a seat on the ground floor (important as a friend was hobbling with a walking stick) when we walked in on a Sunday afternoon.  The queue on Wednesday dinner was long but we solved the problem by ordering out - the main thing we were interested in was the duck anyway.  \nStood eating on the streets before our theatre show (restaurant is walking distance to many musical/ theatre venues), and decided there and then that \"duck followed by theatre\" shall be part of my next London routine.",

The food was ok, the service was what you learn to expect in many \"Chinese restaurants in China town\" - sit, eat, leave.... The latter at their insistence. \nIt's supposed to be well known for their duck, it's not my dish of choice but I tried it and it was good (very fatty, but I hear that's the best part). \nThe restaurant is of a  reasonable size and they maximize the number of seats which means your pretty close to the next table. \nMy personal opinion is the best Chinese restaurants aren't in China town, but for quick eats this place meets the requirements.",

It's a good bowl of noodles when it's cold outside and you had enough of \"ghost people\" food and want some \"people eat gei food.\" The soup is a bit heavy with star anise so be prepared. \nWe also ordered the \"pig stomach chicken pot.\" This hotpot was very heavy with white pepper so be prepared your throat will burn. It's a good dish for the cold winter though. \nAlso, this place was crowded with tourists so we went to the modern looking one next door which bears the same name and serves the same duck. Much more quiet and better service there.",

Unfortunately, it felt like another restaurant at any Chinatown where the food was bland and just average.\nOur main dishes were the Roast Pork/Pork Belly, BBQ Pork, Roast duck. All the food was served at room temperature. We had some greens but nothing spectacular or memorable.\nMaybe it is a London Chinatown practice, we were shocked to be charged GBP 2.5 for a bowl of rice. Given we ordered 5 entrees, we assumed that we would get a bowl per entree and were disappointed when our bill arrived.",

I was well aware the place was run down, however didn't mind if the duck was as good as was said.\nWe purchased a whole peking duck (Â£38) and several other side dishes (Fried rice, Sweet & Sour chicken etcetera). The waitress was very rude from the off, asking us what we wanted after literally only just sitting down. When she did take our order she was very blunt which set the precedent for the rest of the night.\nOn arrival we all remarked how little meat there was on the duck and even double checked it was in fact a whole duck, to which she replied it was. The duck ended up being about 2 legs worth of (lukewarm) meat, the rest was just skin and a base of prawn crackers which were used to pad the dish out.\nWaitress collected plates as people were still eating, poured most of the wine down the side of the glass/on the table, and didn't say thank you to any member of the party after paying our Â£170 bill.\nTL;DR - Rude servers, expensive food, small portions. Would have rather paid Â£12 for all you can eat at any of the other generic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.",

Firstly, I know a lot of Chinatown restaurants aren't pretty at the best of times, but the basement here really is pretty basic. \nFood wise, the actual food wasn't bad, although I realise now that we stupidly ordered crispy duck when we should have gone for their famous roast duck...oh well. The real problem was that should have come first but instead they brought out our brisket stew, with no rice, so it went cold while we waited. Then the pork we ordered actually arrived cold, and had to be sent back. Duck arrives at this point. We ordered more rice but that never turned up (nor on the bill, which was something). Overall, very poor service and I think that's the first time I've ever had to send something back to the kitchen to be heated. I would hesitate to come again, even though I'd like to try the proper duck!",

My friend and I were looking to grab a simple dinner in Chinatown, and when I looked up restaurant reviews, they were all around 3.5 stars out of 5 and I wondered how they could have all been so poor. There is nothing that is 4 stars or above. I've been here a few times to get barbecued meat or roast duck for takeaway, which somehow always managed to set me back Â£10-15, but it's well regarded for having the best roast duck in London and the char siu and crispy pork belly was always solid too. It's expensive, but on the bright side it's the same price to eat in, so that is probably the best option at this restaurant. The other items on the menu were outrageously expensive - the highlight was that plates of seasonal vegetables will send you back Â£9, when clearly the cost at the supermarket next door would be something like Â£2. We got stir fried prawns with seasonal vegetables (which turned out to be broccoli, not even anything special) for Â£10, but at least there were prawns. We also got the crispy duck with pancakes, which was nice because we could order Â¼ duck, which you can't with the Peking duck, but the crispy duck was a dry, shredded, indistinguishable version of the normal glazed and juicy roast duck glory. I wouldn't recommend it. The table next to us got the Peking duck and I had serious food envy. Our last dish was the young chow fried rice. The disappointing part about this was that it was served lukewarm. The whole meal costs us nearly Â£40 in total, which is terrible value and you should definitely be able to do much better in Chinatown. I might come here for the barbecued meat or roast duck takeaway, but it's not worth your while to eat in.",

Also notable was that I had to return a spoon as it was presented dirty.",

We were seated quickly and the experience was noisy but enjoyable. But somehow the noise adds the feeling of a bustling busy restaurant which is fine... So we went back a week later. \nAnd.... \nI don't think a restaurant could drop the ball any further... And they weren't even as busy as usual.... Maybe that's a sign of the times. \nAfter 40 minutes we received our duck pancakes,  the duck was nice but seemed to be dry from sitting out too long,  then..... Nothing.... 20 mins later we received cold soft shell crab.... Ten minutes later Kung Po... Very tasty.... But cold.... No rice.... 10 mins later... Rice.... What's the point \nNo apology just an interest to take money and run. Also the pricing is higher than most Chinese restaurants so we left feeling like we paid for their reputation not there service and sadly not their food. \nWe won't be going back. There's plenty more tables in London serving exotic Cantonese wonderment.",

Now we know to never go!) So she looked up Yelp and she decided to give this place a shot. \nWe arrived before dinner rush and there were already people waiting. Since we were a small group, we were promptly seated in the basement section. My wife ordered her noodles, a tofu with veggies, the mixed plate of duck and pork. \nIts decent Chinese food. We did order the famous duck that everyone is raving about and its good - I have to give it to them, but its not \"the best I had\" kinda good. Think HK, NY, or SF! Maybe its consider the best in UK (maybe Europe)?\nThe pork was not as good because it got soggy from soaking in the soy sauce mixed in with the duck. The surprise was the tofu veggie that I really liked. Sorry - I don't know the official English name because the server recommended it in Cantonese. \nAnyways, I think this restaurant is decent. Wouldn't mind going back again if I was craving Chinese food in London.",

Not much to say about the interior or staff, so we promptly ordered our food.\nStarters were brought out after the Mains. Our Roast Duck was tepid, and judging by the sauce that had dried on the plate it had clearly been sitting out far before we had arrived.

Because without a doubt the food here is good, tasty and worth the asking price.\nThe main detraction however is ambience. My partner and I were sat downstairs in a small white box of a room, packed with tables and customers. This I can deal with, but when the number of patrons impacts the service I start to become wary.\nMy meal was excellent, tasty and felt authentic. However the venue for the meal lacked any ambiance or class.\nI came here because of the good reviews, and my food lived up to them. The over-all experience though was tainted by the lack of ambience and friendly service. Don't get me wrong - the service was good. I just wasn't classy enough to make me smile.\nIn a nutshell, if you want tasty Chinese food in Chinatown you can get it here. If you want a more pleasing environment in which to experience it go elsewhere!",

                "description": "This is my other half's favourite haunt for roast duck. It's not hard to see why as their Bayswater branch is famous for it, they have won countless awards (and glued these to their window and walls, including newspaper clippings for you to read while you wait!)\nA quick summary before we begin:- If you want tasty roast duck, come here. If you want excellent service to go with it, please look elsewhere because you will not find it here.\nTo elaborate, the roast duck is the juiciest duck you will ever taste. Sometimes it may be overly fatty but the fat is what makes it taste so good. The soya sauce that comes with it is really sweet and I can only imagine the amount of sugar that has gone into it. However, I cannot complain as I have a sweet tooth and generous helpings of this sauce with the roast duck makes me a happy bunny.\nI usually get the roast duck for takeaway to eat at home, unfortunately the price has gone up recently, it's around Â£18.50 for a whole roast duck. If you are ordering takeaway please ignore the queue outside and just go straight to the till to order. \nSometimes if you come really late in the night (I actually mean 9pm) they would have sold out of roast ducks. Have no fear, they opened another branch about 3 min walk away down the end of Gerrard Street, at Wardour Street. They usually have a few roast duck hanging up even though this branch has run out.\nOnto the issue of service. Inevitably you will see a queue start forming here as early as 6pm. The restaurant is tiny and there are just too many people trying to eat here all the time that you end up freezing outside while you wait. If you do manage to get a table, you will get one of these two:- get ignored by the waiter for refills of drinks, or get hurried by the waiter to pay up and leave so they can sit someone else down. If you are lucky you will get both treatments!\nTip: maybe stick with takeaways and cook your own rice at home!",

It's incredible... my favorite is the first three because the fatty pork can be dry sometimes. The noodle dishes (stir-fried rice noodles with beef) are a must, and their seafood (pineapple shrimp) is not bad either. \nBe wary of the waiters though because if they think you're tourists, they will try and get more tip by falsely claiming their added service charge is for the government, not for the restaurant... completely absurd.

Many of us tried the same things, but there are some things that I have had at this restaurant that stand out as being the best Chinese I've ever had in my life. We all split the duck with the pancakes. I was quite hesitant to try duck, as I never have been fortunate enough to see this variety in my daily diet. It was amazing! The pancakes (of course, I had not known what this was since Americans have a different cultural knowledge of pancakes) complemented the appetizer so well, that I wanted more! But I'm really glad we didn't. Our main course came, and we all sampled the variety of duck and chicken in many different sauces: sweet and sour, orange, and kong-po. I know there were some other dishes that were ordered, but I do not recall at the current moment. We had visited here on our first day in London, and decided we loved it so much that we made reservations for the last day. What a great decision! When I come back to you one day, London, I will enjoy this wonderful restaurant again!",

When I finally exhausted the recommendations of friends, I went in search of something undeniably delicious that I knew wouldn't disappoint me and I wound up in Chinatown, in a well reviewed restaurant, where they waste very little time on decor and atmosphere and they spend all their time on what's important. Roasted Duck.\nSimply food. Walk in, sit down, order half a duck with white rice, sit, and feast. The skin was crispy and fatty, the meat was tender and plentiful.

Can't complain I suppose, although I have to admit this was the rudest asian restaurant I've ever been to. The food however makes up for most of the crappy service. I recommend the boneless ROAST DUCK. The sweet soy sauce just PERFECTION drizzled on. Every time I'm in town I stop by Four Seasons. Though, if you do takeaway they don't give you the veggies that comes with the order when you eat in :( I'm a bit sad when i found that out. If you're bringing buggies you might be yelled at since the restaurant is small, which is really RUDE. I still have to give a 4 for that duck, coz even LA's chinatown got this beat from the get go. :)",

                "description": "\"Do you like duck?\"  This was the question that was asked of me (quite randomly I might add) by my friend while I was visiting him in London.  I do happen to be a fan of duck, so when he recommended we go to the Four Seasons in Chinatown, I was all for it!\nThe place is fairly small and looks like most Chinese places I've been to.  There were seven in our group so we were sat at one of the larger tables in the back that have rotating glass in the center (very good for family style sharing).  Since my friend had been here before, we let him do most of the ordering.\nWe started with hot and sour soup (one of my personal favorites) which was much spicier than what I've had here in the States.  I'm a huge fan of spicy food so that was no problem for me!  We then moved into our main courses of whole roasted duck and BBQ duck, both of which were absolutely delicious.  The whole duck came with thin tortilla-like wraps that we used with veggies and sauces to make our own duck wraps.  I'm not such a fan of the BBQ duck as it's a little fatty for my liking.\nWe also had a shrimp dish which was pretty yummy.  For whatever reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to order Lychee wine.....yeeeaaaahhhh....not the best.  It was way too sweet, strong, and just overall not good.  Wouldn't recommend it.\nFor dessert we had just plain old Lychee which WAS delicious.  Those sweet little balls made my mouth very happy (that's what she said).  When you're done with your entire meal, they bring you oranges (kind of like an after dinner mint).\nThe service wasn't too bad.  It was a little slow at times and one of the smaller dishes we ordered never made it to our table, but they were very nice about taking it off our bill.  Overall, I would have to agree with the masses and say that they have the best duck around.",

I think it's because I always get lost and have had one to many bad experiences of all you can eat buffets served in a trough! I want to be one of those people that can navigate themselves round windy streets and no the best place to get Crispy Duck and any time of day or night. Alas, I am not... until now. \nOK, so there wasn't much street winding going on considering Gerrard Street is the main street in China Town but none the less I am now quietly confident I can challenge any China Town veteran to the 'best duck ever' stakes. \nI came to meet my boyfriend and his Mum here, the previous night we had had a fight, now I was running late and screaming down the phone because I was lost. The ambiance was not great. No matter, once I got into the restaurant the waiters were so friendly and instinctively poured me a glass of wine that I suddenly began to feel more relaxed. \nThere was no pressure to hurry in this place which I think is one of the most important things. We were able to order our Duck and starters and take our time over them. The Duck was as good as I have ever had, really meaty, we ordered a half and we got a big half! \nAfter a leisurely start we were obliged to order mains, even though we were actually all full. Ordered was: Mixed Seafood and Noodle Soup, I thought this tasted like pond water but everyone else seemed to like it, weird! Salt and Pepper Squid, this was amazing. Best I've had in a Chinese restaurant. The batter was really light and crispy with just the right amount of chili's, there was way to much for one person but I didn't let it stop me. There was also Sweet & Sour Pork and King Prawns with seasonable vegetables. I presume these were also both delicious as I didn't get a look in. \nFor the four of us with 3 bottles of wine, duck, starters and mains it came to just over ÃÂ£100.",

I eat Chinese food all the time, yet this is by far the best roast duck I've ever eaten.  Hands down.\nduck in London is better than most other places because they are naturally leaner.  the duck was roasted well: crispy skin, scrumptious taste/barbecue, lean indeed.  the renowned sauce which is a well protected secret is the best roast duck sauce i've ever had.  it's not too salty and has a tad of sweetness to it.  the roast duck dipped in the sauce is heaven in my mouth.  the sauce over rice is also great.\nthe only downfall is that after a while, the duck gets really oily and the bottom of the box/plate is drenched in oil.\nthe barbecue pork is also extremely delicious, also one of the best i've had.  great marinade/barbecue taste.\nthe roast pork was slightly salty (but then again all Chinese roast pork is).  the skin had a great crunch to it.\ni was vacationing in London for a few days but i had to come here twice!\ni ordered the food to go both times.  the cashier/waiter was friendly and helpful the first time.  but the cashier/waitress was gruff and very rushed the second time.  but i still give this restaurant 5 stars for the best roast duck in the world.",

It came with a larger than normal portion of gratuitous chinese cabbage (i.e. more than 1 leaf).  As others have said, the soy gravy that comes with it is quite sweet, but I like it that way.\nThey were nice people there, with 3 types of chillies and gave me soured plum sauce immediately when I requested it.\nThe bad thing was they dumped some oranges on my table before I finished the plate and then dumped the check on the table whiles I was finishing the orange.  They took the bill away the second I reached for the mint and my hand left the bill container thingy.  Although I get that it is busy, I didn't appreciate being literally swept out of the restaurant.  I must say, it was probably them more than me who kept the meal to the 25 minutes limit.\nFood:  Solid 4.5 stars.  Service: (minus 1 star) = 3.5 stars.",

Four Seasons is known for their barbecued meats and for good reason. Their Peking Duck is succulent and tasty. I also have their Crispy Aromatic duck which is very flavourful and crispy- the most perfect incarnation of this dish that I have ever had. In terms of other starters I have had the Peking Dumplings (strong flavour and very 'juicy') and Vegetarian Spring Rolls (Crispy with a high amount of vegetables inside). In terms of Main Course I have a group of dishes which are some of my favourites in the world. The Pork chop in honey and pepper sauce (from the Chef's Specials) is delicious, the pork chops are always flavoursome with a crispy exterior, the sauce is absolutely delicious and sweet with an almost caramel texture this combined with chopped up onions makes an absolutely stunning dish. The Black Bean dishes are also very good. The Beans themselves are as tasteful as ever and are slightly soft as (in my opinion they should be) and with a kick of chili it is very good. I would recommend the Beef in Black Bean sauce rather than the pork as the Pork is sometimes a tad too fatty for me. The Singapore Noodles are also very good with another hit of Chili to add to the flavour. As someone who is a huge fan of Mushrooms the Chicken with Chinese and Straw mushrooms is delicious and always comes with a hearty helping of various Mushrooms. The straw mushrooms are especially delicious!! \nEven though I have visited many times and have eaten many dishes there, there are still loads of dishes I want to try, the Fish dishes will be next I think. Anyway it has a great range of dishes at very competitive prices; we spent about Â£25 a head and had more food than we could eat. The only negative for some people may be the service. It is not always particularly efficient and/or 'chatty' but thats exactly what gives this place it's authentic charm.\nOverall:\nPrice: Very good for the volume of food (Around Â£15-25 a head)\nFavourite Item: Pork Chop in Honey and Pepper Sauce.\nWorst Aspect: I honestly cannot name one.\nWould recommend? Definitely I plan to go back as soon as possible.",

                "description": "Best roast duck in the world? That's what Financial Times writer Nicholas Lander reckons and it was his write up about Four Seasons that led me there. I'm not too sure it's the best in the world but it's the best I've had in London and on par with the roast duck I had at the considerably more upscale Peninsula Hotel in Beijing.\n One piece of advice based on my experience at Four Seasons: forego the rest of the menu and just order the duck. Everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good but nowhere near as good as the duck. Besides there are plenty of other decent Chinese restaurant around Chinatown.",
