                "description": "In my younger days when lunch choices consisted of Soho's wide range of eateries as opposed to today's regimented packed lunches, there was one spot that was a consistent favourite. Wong Kei. This evening after a long day at work followed by a lengthy meeting and beer, I decided to revisit my favourite old haunt. It's as good as ever. I ordered my standard:\n- Ho fun with beef and scrambled egg\nIt is a dish that sums up my love for the restaurant; hearty, authentic, homestyle cooking that will fill you up on a budget with the finest of ingredients - simplicity. There is nothing fancy about a plate of wet noodles with a generous helping of tender beef and eggs. Its taste is mildly salty with a slight spring onion sweetness and there isn't much else to it. What you get however is a sense of warmth and comfort with every bite that few other places can offer at its price point. Wong Kei has long been infamous for its abrasive staff and unassuming environment (both things I have no problems with personally) but in dishes such as this, it provides care in the way it feeds you. It in some ways encapsulates the very Chinese way of expressing love without words and not many people appreciate that, or open themselves up to notice such things at places like this.\nI will forever love this place and hope it stays forever. As a little pro tip, this has to be consumed eating in to make use of the plentiful chilli oil crucial to this dish and for that rarest of perks by today's standards: free tea.\nWong Kei, please don't change.",

                "description": "After going through yelp and tripadvisor, I wanted to try a Chinese restaurant in London. This place was definitely very popular on tripadvisor and people describe this as good food but bad service. So that's what I think of authentic Chinese food - good food but lack of service is normal! \nSo I decided to check out this place since we were in this area and I heard lots about it. The menu has lots of different choices and variety. We ordered the fu-king fried rice, malaysian noodles. The food came out and I wasn't amazed by it. It was your typical Chinese food. I am not really sure if I like it enough to come back though. Everyone seemed to really love this place and the food but the food doesn't live up to the hype.\nSo bleh. Just Chinese food.\nAlso, I was surprised we had shared tables. So if you have a small party, they might sit you with a shared table, I don't know how common it is in London? I see shared tables as a norm in Asia/China though but not usually that common in America.",

There are several floors, and someone will direct you to a table. \nFood: It's simple and straightforward. The roasts hanging in their window are done well - duck, BBQ pork, roast pork. I had the pork and century egg congee, with a side of roast park. Congee was full of meat and egg, and had the right amount of ginger. The roast pork was fresh, with a crispy skin, and the meat was tender and not dry. \nService: Food comes out quickly, and you'll be left alone to enjoy it. Reasonably attentive if you need something. \nCost: The two items with tea cost me £17.50. \nOverall: It isn't fancy, but it does offer some decent food at decent prices.",

Both the food and the service, we have one friend who just had an injury on her leg so we asked if we can eat at the ground floor to avoid climbing the stairs. The waiter rudely checked my friend's leg to see if I am lying, we almost left because of it. \nIn the end my friend didn't want to ruin the mood so we still stay. Fortunately we sat at the ground floor as we asked but one of the guy in the counter gave us a disgust look. ( there were plenty of sits in the restaurant at the time we were really unsure why they make it so difficult) \nThe food was as terrible as the service, the rice was cooked with just too much water, the rice stick together like a rice ball, we didn't finish the rice. The grilled duck I had was ok but not crispy at all if you are looking for authentic Cantonese cuisine. The waiter who helped us to order was nice though, but the food and the main service is horrible. Skip this place if you can.",

The colours on dishes and tea sets may be worn, I have found lipstick on a cup before, hair on the plate of food, etc. \nHaving grown up in London and been a frequent visitor of Chinatown I have known what to come to expect of Wong Kei, and that is not to expect much in terms of quality but you can be fed with speed and at low prices compared to all its competitors in Chinatown. \nMany locals can feel at ease eating here even on their own (unless you feel embarrassed to have anyone you know spot you eating here). It is basically cheap (and not so cheerful) but it does its job and has served a useful purpose in London's Chinatown for many decades.",

A good amount of meat and a good amount of sauce over rice for a standard dinner. Prices are pretty decent too, I think around 6 pounds for my plate. Cash only.",

Very old furniture, very working class, not trendy, not cool, \"you get the best value here\" attitude of service. BUT I highly recommend it!\n1. Price is damn good for most chow fun, fried noodles and soup noodles. Cheaper than the United States Chinatown in NY and SF. For other dishes, prices are average NOT cheap.\n2. Roast duck is very good but NOT as good as Four Seasons around the corner which still has the BEST duck in London!  Half duck with NO bone is 11.5 pounds at Wong compared to 14.5 pounds with NO bone at Four (number may be off slightly but conclusion is the same). If you want the best duck, go to FOUR.\n3. The wonton soup at Wong is average. Soup is meaty, little salty and not clear, not very tasty. Good wonton soup should be clear and strong with seafood (shrimp) taste. Wonton itself is average average although each one has a big piece of shrimp! It could have some MSG in it and it will taste a lot better!\n4. Beef stew flat noodle soup is not bad and it is very vinegary. This type of strew is not common in Cantonese style. \n5. Tea is FREE.\nBathroom is acceptable marginally. Service is ok, not great.\nBottom line, good authentic Cantonese noodles restaurant BUT with very affordable prices earns Wong Kei  ****.\nCASH ONLY, BUDDY!",

The table next to us was eating Peking duck, and the duck looked like it had been hacked by an amateur. \nService is where it gets bad. They looked mad when we asked for extra bowls and chopsticks. And, when we asked to \"add tea\", the waiter looked at us in disbelief and said \"add tea??\" He then took away our tea pot and didn't return it for the duration of our meal. \nWhat kind of Chinese restaurant is surprised that it's customers drink tea? Tea is like, all Chinese people drink. \nFinally, the servers got mad when we walked up to the counter to pay, as if they were afraid we were going to run. As we left, a server was arguing with a customer, who yelled that the server \"didn't know how to treat women.\" The server just stood smugly at the door with his arms crossed and didn't let those customers in. We didn't get the whole deets but you get the point, service is terrible. \nTo be honest, when I look back at this experience, it's so ridiculous it's funny.",

The floors stunk of chlorine going upstairs. Then we were seated at a \"shared table\" when there were plenty of smaller tables for 2 downstairs. There were also tables of 4 upstairs which I was told when we asked to be seated alone. We were on our honeymoon after all. We walked out, absolutely appalled by this service.

I'm only here for the food! and then I looked over at the gaggle of staff hanging around the bar and then one stuck two fingers at me lazily (basically indicating a table for two) and I said yes and then he waved us off in the direction of the stairs. He didn't escort us upstairs nor did he come to the front to greet us. It felt very self service, almost empowering :D \nWe then helped ourselves to the best table of 4 after realising there weren't a table for 2 around but the waitress hurriedly ushered us to a 'table for two' which we later realised was a shared table with another two customers!!!?? I tried to protest but in vain as the waitress was having none of it. Honestly, the whole concept of customers are always right and you must prioritise customer's needs before anything else are completely foreign to these people. \nThe other two customers were as surprised as we were but later whispered that at least we all got into the exclusive dining area normally reserved for Chinese folks and as a Chinese myself, I got my non asian friend a free pass to the exclusive club which had linen covered tables with comfy enough seats compared to the greasy cheap looking mish mash of tables and chairs downstairs.\nWe were so fortunate that our fellow neighbours were such cool peeps and abit like the shared benches in Wagamama, we were like 'can you pass the soya sauce please?' etc. I mean I totally would've shared their food too (if they'd let me). Totally. Love the fact that Wong Kei forces us to interact with complete strangers. Such a unique perk. Also they know the issues with London's first world problems in their lack of communication with one another and has set itself on a mission to break these barriers. ;-) So admirable!\nOur neighbours even helpfully smacked down some annoying flies and wiped it off the table for us. :') The flies acted as a bonus decoration ;-) The authenticity in this restaurant to the Far East is so in tune. You want abit of China? Go to Wong Kei!!  \nIf a food restaurant other than your typical Mcdonald's and Burger King, offers a drive through speedy service then this is it! The whole service was comparable to a factory conveyer belt. Time is precious and every second counts despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty with ample amounts of unoccupied tables and chairs scattered across the floor. Compared to your typical Chinatown establishment, this one takes the prawn cracker! As soon as we were seated and handed our menus, a waitress hovered above waiting to take our order (like less than a minute after we sat down). When I asked her to come back in a few minutes, the look on her face was utter shock. Truly funny to see. Honestly our table was wicked. We interacted with our neighbours and made such jokes that the same waitress came back looking horrified with nose flaring, that we were enjoying ourselves lol. \nNow onto the food. This is what I came for. Prices have gone up ever so slightly since well, the last recorded menu prices online) but still remain ahead of competition in terms of value, portion and quality. We had hearty meals of won ton noodle soup which was laden with won ton dumplings that when I finally demolished those meat parcels, I was actually surprised to see noodles underneath it! For a fiver, it truly was the epitome of eastern comfort food like bangers and mash is to English folks. For the side, we opted for bean curd with chilli and salt. I would totally recommend it to anyone because once you try it, you can't stop! Might need some water at hand because they don't use that msg sparingly!! \nService is quick. You're in and out of there like fast food. In fact so quick you needn't worry about time. What they lack in service they more than abundantly made up for in quality and quantity of food.\nQuestion of whether you're genuinely welcomed sits in the balance. Service charge is optional (thank goodness!!) and the waitress counted the money at our table (quite insecurely) after hovering nearby for a while whilst we emptied coins from our purses lol! Not to forget that the tea is freeeeee!  \nComing here is an experience onto itself like a ghost ride in a theme park. You love to hate it. All in all, I'd definitely be coming back here in a rush!",

Not for localvores aka organic eaters.... I fear I will regret this later!\nMy stomach went upside down with the tea, I knew I was in the wrong place for my tastes....cheap food and boy you can taste it.\nI made it through the night, .. This place is well worth the experience, cheap Chinese.. Gotta  love it. The fried chicken is so salty and pressed dry like a salt dish bomb #195 ... The sweet n sour pork # 79 or 78 was boney like waitress said would be ... Quite tasty but pineapple was so canned, I knew if I did not stop I would not do well later. Would not trade the memory or experience for the world, total must do at least  once. Thanks Abigal....",

It was a good place for a quick, reliable meal to start or end an evening in the pubs around Covent Garden and Leicester Square.\nVisiting London again, I thought it would be good to renew my acquaintance with the place after what must be 15 years, particularly because I was traveling with a friend who grew up in Hong Kong - I was keen to get his take on the experience.\nI am glad to say Wong Kei did not disappoint after all this time. Apart from the staff's fun uniform t-shirts, everything else was exactly as I remember it. The brisk, efficient service was as unfriendly as ever. The plastic bowls and flatware was as classy as ever. The seating arrangements were as communal as ever. But best of all, the food was as tasty and good value as ever. I was always a fan, and I still am.",

I was asked to meet a few friends here from Hong Kong for dinner before we went to the theatre. They heard it was famous for their bad reputation so they wanted to try it. I personally do not understand why they came all the way from Hong Kong to the UK to have Chinese food, but there is neither here or there. \nFood: If there's food in front of me, I'll eat it! I completely forgot what we ordered, but my friend pouted and said they all looked the same: stir-fried bbq pork, stir-fried vegetables, stir-fried a whole bunch of stuff and deep-fried tofu with chillies. Whatever we ordered, it came quickly and that was a good thing for us because we were in a hurry.\nAtmosphere: It has a typical Chinese cafe-style atmosphere: busy, tacky oriental art, and a slight layer of grease on the wall that comes with a dive like so. Where the chairs are from an 80's diner and the plastic cutlery and crockery has been used so much, their logo is wearing off. If you're looking for 5 star dinning, you've come to the wrong place. If you're looking for fast, cheap eats, look no further than this lovely dive full of oriental tourists getting upset that it's not up to par with their home cooking or Chinese students that miss home and did not want to have instant noodles tonight. \nService: The service wasn't that bad. I do want to say, it was surprisingly good based on their bad reputation. We walked in, told them how many people and were seated accordingly. In typical Chinese fashion, sometimes you may need to wave them down to get some service, but I feel that is the norm for busy restaurants.",

I've lived overseas for a good few years but always make a point to visit WK when I'm back in London. The dishes had no change over the years at all: a good thing.

Wong Kei reminds me of a place back in San Francisco where a very famous waiter (Edsel Ford Fung of Sam Wo Restaurant) would insult unsuspecting patrons for not tipping, spit in people's food, and slamming food on the table.\nI figured with the curt treatment the place is a cheap, no frills, get in and GTFO kind of place the moment I stepped in. I didn't even need to read the Yelp reviews to know that I'm going here just for the food and not fancy table service. As soon as I enter, the waiter acknowledges me and tells me to share a table downstairs. Not even seconds later I'm asked if I know what I want. I politely asked for a menu and was given one instantly. That probably my first mistake. You should already know what you want. They run a very tight ship here and I was put on the spot like on the episode of Seinfeld where the Soup Nazi was scolding patrons for taking too long in the soup line and sent to the back for not following his rules. I settled on the roast duck noodle soup and it came faster than you can say, \"Long live the queen\". The food was delicious, the service was meh. The locals seem to come here a lot and don't mind. I really didn't mind since I've experience much worst service in the past. \nThe prices here are so ridiculously cheap that you're getting a great deal. There is no service charge and VAT is already included. Cash only!",

I used to go as a student a long time ago and so it's officially a London eating 'institution' in my book. For me, the brusqueness of the staff translates to efficiency which I would take any day over ineptitude and slowness which drives me mad.\nIt was the first time I've been back since the re-opening or new management or whatever happened. On this occasion I was dining solo (always a good spot for solo dining) and was immediately directed to one of the solo dining tables right in the entrance area. The waiter came straight over and asked me what I wanted. I kind of like that, taking me for a regular because if I did know, I would just say right away. I asked for a menu instead since it had been a while...\nI ordered a wonton soup and singapore noodles. Pretty straightforward.\nMy order came quickly and I was surprised to see that the wonton soup was a large bowlful with plenty of wontons which were really good. Prawn and pork, freshly made with big chunks of prawn with a good ginger note. It made me think how good this was especially for the price around £3.50 vs the £11 bowls of ramen noodles that have sprung up everywhere (was never comfortable with paying £11 for a bowl of soup noodles).\nSingapore noodles also didn't scrimp on the meat and shrimp and a good sized portion. A bit overly salty not helped by the salty soup but overall solid.\nComplimentary tea.\nSo. If in the mood for a quick spot of Chinese in the centre of town and want to get served quickly with no hype and no queues then come here.\nGreat value and good food. Still love Wong Kei and the quality seemed better than before.",

Here you'll be shoved into any seat anywhere, separated from your group like Nemo from his family and left to flounder and eat awkwardly in front of strangers, four flights away, up into an adjoining space in what seems like breaking into or being smuggled into an open-plan office block/ come restaurant floor next door to sit with said random people, whilst you're left to recount your steps and your experiences thus far. \nOn being escorted away from my dining companions, I'd have lost my mates if I hadn't grabbed a discarded prawn cracker at a nearby table and left a Hansel and Gretel-like trail back to them. \nSo, I ended up joining an adjoining end of table, table. On my own, within waving distance of one of my friends, but I had to muscle in on another couple who had been lucky enough to sit together. \nIt took sometime to get a waiter's attention, but it didn't take long to realise that the couple I'd been proffered to give my services to as a third wheel and Capering Gooseberry, had not just been stuck for conversation, but were simply too frightened to ask for; water, a napkin or anything else you'd usually expect at a restaurant. \nFinally a waiter, dashed to my attention. \n\"Drink?\"\nJust as I flicked my eyes down to the menu to enquire, he was off. Fed up by my too long split second hesitation. \nThe food came quickly, in fact when it did arrive it almost hit the linen before the plates did. \n\"Noodles\", my waiter announced. *Slam* \"Chilli Beef\" *Slam*. Down went the bowls, whilst before they hit the table, the broth defied gravity remaining in mid-air and began cooling from the gust of wind created from the clipped turn of my waiter's back again.\nHe'd gone! Thank Christ, but I'd still not ordered my drink. I saw a couple of my friends separated over on two other tables making perplexed gestures to me in nervous fits of laughter. I thought they were having a good time, but I was to discover their waitress did not linger, who's laconic tone implied she too could give even less of a rat's rear about my or their whining on about being thirsty. In the end she abandoned herself from their table for mine, offered me a drinks menu and rolled her eyes so hard I thought it'd affect the gravitational pull of the moon.  So I did the darnedest of things and ordered what was to be a flat sodding cola. \nWell, if you must hanker for Anglicised greasy run of the mill Chinese food, go here, go simply for the terrifying experience and GO ON, GET OMLETTE AND CHIPS I DARE YOU!",

As a first-timer at Wong Kei who was a little overwhelmed at the many choices, a waiter came over after 2 minutes of seating us told us to stop wasting her time when we couldn't tell her what we wanted to order, even though the restaurant wasn't packed. But regardless, we were starving, and the food came quickly, was cheap but a good value for the huge portions, and tasted decent enough for poor college students in London. \nRestaurant is cash only!",

My husband asked a complete strangers if the restaurant was good. He said, this restaurant is known for it's rude service but the food is amazing. So hubby decided that this is where we would dine.  \nOnce insided, we were lead to the second floor and were seated with the couple we asked outside about this restaurant.  The male happened to be a local and his wife was was California.  This meal turned out great!!!  My husband has the wonton soup, I had the crab and corn.  For our main, my husband had crisply beef and I had the spicy aubergine. The service was quite good. We did meet several wait staff.  I thought they were playfully rude which I actually enjoyed.  \nThis was our first meal here in London.  We enjoyed the food, the service and our impromptu dinner dates.  A big PLUS was the theater (for Book Of Mormon) was just around the corner.",

The prices went up a little (not by that much), although the portions are the same, the staff got a little friendlier and service just a tad slower. But what's important remains the same. It's a place where you can get a plate of relatively good Chinese food quickly for not a lot of money. It's by no means the best food in the world but it is at a price that's cheaper that the rest. \nBy all means go to the buffets in Chinatown, but unless you eat smart, you're losing out, the drink you have there will push you to the £10 mark... At Wong Kei, eat in, and your tea is free. I don't go for the really elaborate dishes, they specialise in the one plate meal in my opinion, rice or noodles with something on it. Larger plates are a pretty much a plate of the main, and you then order rice on the side, good for groups. I've only once ordered off of their Chef's specials list - udon with seafood and XO, and to my surprise I loved it, but it was expensive, so don't think I'd get it again. That and most of my colleagues didn't really appreciate it...\nSo stick to the basics, don't worry about sitting at the communal table (people, it's meant to zig zag so you're not sitting next to someone, please learn this! Talking to you Mr sweaty businessman who proceeded to elbow me for my meal and cluck that I was in his way - I was there first!). And enjoy the experience, yes the staff can be surley, but they're meant to be!",

                "description": "Ever since hubs saw the menu and found out there was eel with black bean sauce on the menu he was sold. This was the first sit down restaurant that we headed to in London. \nWe went here for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening and were seated on the basement (may be called the ground floor) and service was prompt and efficient. We ordered the eel, hot pot with tofu and Singapore style thick rice noodles. Hubs loved the eel since this is not something we have in the USA or at least in Michigan and ate all but two pieces. The tofu hot pot had fish tofu as well as the regular braised tofu. As is typical with everywhere but the US, the hot pot was smaller than what I was expecting but tasted on par with the average hot pot. Lastly, the Singapore thick noodles were pretty tasty, but I found the curry flavor be not as strong as it's done in the states. The flavor was still good and contained mini shrimps, BBQ pork, onions, and sprouts. \nGiven the price of around 25£, it's a great place to grab a reasonably priced, some may even say cheap eat when you are looking for a Chinese fix in London.",

                "description": "Okay first off, this place is awesome. You're might think that it's probably awesome because of the food. Wrong. Or that it's awesome because of the service. Nope. Or that it's nostalgia from child-hood days (You might be right). But overall no. It's pretty much the best place in Chinatown because of the no fuss (read: efficient) service, down and dirty, give the customer what they ordered and with complimentary tea. No service charge, but it does go appreciated so leave what you can.\nWhat elevates it above most other place, is the chilli oil. Hands down the best chilli oil in all of chinatown. Nobody else does it. Nobody else has re-created it. I have literally eaten here and nearly eaten half a glassful of the stuff. I know that's probably not a badge to be proud of, but it is just that good and I probably wouldn't eat here as the food is nothing special without it. Cheap, but not special.\nRecently however, they've started raising the prices a little and portions are quite variable. You used to always get a gigantic (how do I finish this) portion. But nowadays you could get that, or get something a little more manageable. This said, The price of the dish I always get, either the shredded chicken/pork fried noodles (always make sure you get crispy noodles) or the belly pork/bbq pork on hot rice have increased from £3.80 and £4.00 a decade ago to £4.80 and £5.00 today. Take into account inflation and this is probably a below inflation increase, you still get unlimited tea and the amazing chilli which haven't changed a bit.\nIf you're a wetherspoon snob however, and you know who you are, you absolutely won't like this place and this review won't convince you otherwise. For others that like to give new things and try and risk poor service/variable quality good, Wong Kei is great, you just have to understand how it all works. What appears rude service on your first visit is actually efficiency engineered over many decades. After all, if you're there on your own sitting at the front, why would they give you a menu?? You should already know what you want, and most people do!\nPS. Like other budget chinatown places. Cash Only. They also do takeaway. I kid you not, sometimes you can get this from ordering to in your hand in less than 45 seconds. They give you a little container of chilli oil, but do it properly. Open up your chinese foil takeaway box and add more yourself.",

                "description": "Apparently it's been a long time since the good old days of waiters telling you to piss off because there's a queue outside and being amusingly rude. Anyway, they're still reasonably priced (cash only, folks) and the food remains good. I wouldn't say it's a life changing culinary experience, but it usually delivers and I never had to send anything back. The trick is to order food from the back of the menu; basically lots of options of meat with rice or noodles. It's even cheaper and the portions are huge; you won't miss out for not ordering the \"posher\" sounding dishes on the first few pages.\nI can't stand green/jasmine tea, but if that's your thing you'll get it for free to your heart's content. There are some communal round tables where you sit in close proximity with strangers; if that's not your thing keep in mind it's always a risk. :)\nIf you want a chatty and smiley staff this is not the place to go (as it happens with most chinese places where staff is usually tired and overworked anyway), but if you like quick and good chinese food in central London, do try. I love sitting there during off peak hours with my tablet and munch on rice and meat while I people watch. There are always some amusing customers around, and sometimes the interaction between them and the staff isn't so smooth. Ah, the good old Wong Kei will always be the good old Wong Kei. ;)",

I somehow decided that something different would be a representative choice and rather than stick with something I knew, like Singapore Noodles or King Prawns, I stepped (more like leaped) outside of my comfort zone and ordered the steamed eel in black bean sauce. I still shake my head because I have no idea what I was thinking. I know I like the eel sushi, so how different could it be?\nI have no doubt that it was good, for being eel. It was served extremely hot and after a few minutes of waiting for it to cool down, I picked up a slice with the chopsticks. Do you eat the skin? Oh, there's bone in there too. It was messy. It was... interesting. It was... odd. Would I have it again? I think I can safely say I would have something else, though I would absolutely return to the Wong Kei. But I'll stick with what I know next time!\nService seemed decent. No one was rude or short with me. I wasn't rushed at all. My tea was refilled without prompting.",

The food tasted okay and the prices were average. My only real problem with my experience was the stingy portion sizes of our dishes. I'm used to the whole mostly rice, very little meat thing that asian restaurants do, but the value at Wong Kei compared to what you can get elsewhere in London straight up bad. As a tourist from a small Canadian city with superior Chinese restaurants (in my humble opinion), I gotta say...

The free green tea, people-watching opportunities and rock-bottom meal prices have incentivised us to return year after year, despite the occasional cheeky comment and disturbing rumours of the chiefs doing a circle spit into the dishes of punters they dislike (seriously wish I'd never been told that story!).\nWhen times are good I order the Chicken with Cashew Nuts and a side of Egg-Fried Rice. When times are not so good I order the 3 Cold Barbecue Meats on Hot Rice. I have never not cleaned my plate. Myself and my best friend usually, in addition, order the Mixed Hors d'oeuvres. And proceed to argue over who gets that last succulent teaspoon of seaweed when the rest of the savoury treats are devoured. And we do this every. Goddamn.

                "description": "How bad can you go... Purely relying on cheap prices to fill seats in your restaurant?\nWith this as their business model, I will always have a soft spot for Wong Kei!\nThe first time that I ever came here, I was introduced to the place by a friend of my dad's when I was still in my teens. I really did not know what to expect. Upon returning with my best friend, he and I spent the evening completely perplexed as to what was going on around us, even though we were the customers and we were the ones who were placing the orders. We most definitely were not in control or command of what was happening to us! \nI seem to remember almost random dishes appearing with no explanation as to what they were. I also remember very well ordering portions of egg fried rice and the waiting staff slamming the bowl down and me repeatedly asking where the other portion of rice was. Each time I asked, the waiter immediately started walking away and shouted at me \"You got it!\" \nAfter grabbing a more senior member of staff, he finally explained that two portions is one bowl. Thanks for that!\nSo when I returned here very recently, I was wondering if they still had \"the same magic\" that they used to.\nWell, to be brief. Prices have most definitely escalated compared to what they used to be here. However, you most definitely get great value for your money. I can most definitely eat & eat & eat. And.... The relatively few dishes that I did order really challenged my eating prowess. \nService here is still fairly crazy. But I suppose, it is all about perspective. I personally feel that over the last few years service in London has gotten worse and worse. Get me started on this topic I will tell you that it is the fault of including service in the bills, but I'll back off that for now. So, comparatively Wong Kei is no longer the worst place in London to be served food!\nAnd you know what, that sort of disappoints me.",

On our recent short trip to the UK, our first day in London, we walked all over the place.  by 4 PM in the afternoon, we were starving, having only had small snacks up until that point.  We rushed to Chinatown and decided to give Wong Kei a try.\nWe ordered half a crispy duck, wonton soup, pork and preserved egg congee, and a beef hue fen (stir fried thick noodle with beef).  The duck was a bit over cooked, but still got good flavors.  It came with pancakes, shredded cucumber and scallion to make your own duck wrap.\nThe congee was a very big size.  I was thinking it would be just a small bowl.  It was decent.  The beef hue fen was my favorite out of everything we ordered.  It has that 'big wok' smokey taste and the beef was very tender.  Our least favorite was the wonton soup.  The soup and the wonton filling were both bland.  \nThe price was decent, the food was decent... so it was A-OK for me.",

                "description": "This whole hype on social media in regards to Wong Kei closing and then opening with new management really got me wanting to go back to see if there has been any changes. \nWong Kei has always been a place for a simple fix of food at a cheap price and a place I can get fresh ho fun stir-fried at a reasonable price. Hate it when people state 'ho fun' in the menu when in fact it's just dried rice noodles rehydrated. Portion sizes is always a plus too along with no service charge and free green tea. But I never expect good presentation of food, wok energy, particularly good service or a very positive memorable experience.\nSo it caught my attention when news coverage was saying that the new manager is trying to input better service. Whilst customers were worried about the change in portion sizes, cheap prices and taste in their favourite chilli oil. So on Saturday me and my friend decided to test this new 'Wong Kei' out with a few of the most popular dishes and see if Wong Kei has lost it's original values.\nAlthough there has been a repaint, decor is still exactly the same, same off green/blue tables on the ground floor, plastic white plates with 'Wong Kei' printed on them. The only thing that looked any diffferent were the soy sauce that are now in Lee Kum Kee glass bottles. \nWe were given the new menu where the dishes looked exactly the same however all dishes were hiked up by 0.20p-0.40p. This certainly gives room for other Chinese restaurants to top Wong Kei in offering the cheapest one dish plates. \nWe started with the most popular Roast pork and pork belly on rice. Either we were very lucky on the occasion with the cut or the meat has improved in quality. I was quite impressed with how lean the roast pork was, succulent and well marinated. The generous slices of meat did have a good bounce to it with a generous portion of rice in the same sweet brown sauce I'm used to. Nothing had changed here, if anything it was better than a lot of times I have been. \nMy friend was so happy to find the chilli oil had not change either, still fragrant with notes of garlic and flavoursome. A spoon of that onto the rice dish add that perfect kick needed to make it a good simple lunch fix.\nMy usual char kway teow went downhill sadly. It was still fresh ho fun but it lacked flavour and depth. It was not as spicy as it used to be and in fact it was more bland than it used to be. There was minimal egg to be seen and portion went down as well. I've heard most of the chefs have left since the new manager took over but no reason was given. That could explain the cooking changes. They must be using a different curry powder or paste to.\nCrispy pork noodles had mix opinions. My friend was sad to find that the noodles had change and are a lot thinner. It didn't effect me as it just made things more lighter and crisper but some might like it with more bite. As a business perspective I can see these noodles being quicker to fry. This actually became my favourite dish of the three as I enjoyed the long shredded pork and the thinly chopped mix vegetables on top that created a good layered of texture. The sauce was seasoned perfectly for me and yes although greasy it was expected, nothing has changed there. \nNow I didn't feel service had change at all- not like it bothered me. But there was no major improvements. Still no smile or polite welcoming. Our waiter still quickly pointed to the back which some can consider rude and asked us to pick any table there. Our female waitress who delivered our food was nicer and answered the majority of our questions given but she seemed genuinely nice and not like she had particular training. \nStill quite intrigued if any other dishes have changed at Wong Kei especially the Wonton Noodle Soup. Still I somehow feel the old Wong Kei is lost and being the most 'cheap' and 'generous' portions in Chinatown is no more. But for it's roast meats, chilli oil and crispy noodles there is a reason for return.",

Overall, it was decent. None of the dishes really stood out to me. They're merely meeting my expectations for Chinese food. My parents did say the steamed fish dish that they had was actually amazing though so that counts for something I suppose. \nI encountered inconsistently slow service here which isn't uncommon for Chinese places. I'm pretty sure the two tables next to me got their food before me despite showing up afterwards. However, being insulted at one is new to me. When I asked the waitress where my food was long after her estimates had passed, she said it's my fault that I'm so impatient because I'm from mainland China. Thanks for assuming that just because I'm a foreigner who can speak Chinese, I'm automatically from China. \nI was also hoping for a break from pricey pubs, but in the end, the total came out to about how much I'd spend at a pub so it wasn't as cheap as I had hoped. Also an itemized bill would be nice so I can be sure I'm not being ripped off.",

No other place comes close with their chilli oil. \nService has gradually improved over the years, though still known for being rude, it is now more in a playful fashion, as if only done to keep up the reputation. I tend to find that you are treated nicer if you come alone and sit on the ground floor, and treated more as a burden if in a group.\nWould be 5 stars if they accepted card - cash only can be a drag.",

I appreciated that Wong Kei sticks with what they do best: noodles.\nWe shared a beef with black bean sauce and a shredded chicken with fried noodles. Both were good. they did not bring any white rice for the bean sauce dish, which is odd when coming from the US--they brought it when we asked.

I'm not saying this place is dirty (figure of speech), but its cleanliness is on par with a typical cheap Chinese restaurant.\nI've had the Beef Flat Noodle and Slippery Egg & Beef Rice, which were average to below average. Quality was okay, service was pretty nonexistant; just go in, eat, and get out. I did feel slightly rushed here - though it might have been a more psychological thing for me than actual waiters trying to rush us out.\nThe servers seem to give bad service on purpose, but it's all in good fun - as if they're playing a part. They actually aren't rude and quite courteous. I remember one visit I was watching as a waiter kept his eye pinned on a little kid jumping around in a seat. The server mentioned to the family that it was dangerous for the kid (~3 years old) to be jumping on the seat like that, and that it could tip over - which the parents just ignored. The waiter had his eye on the kid whenever he wasn't serving someone else, and would occasionally jerk towards the kid/seat when the kid seemed to be losing his balance. Nice guy - though he told one of our party to get their own chopsticks when asked to get a set of chopsticks (which he did get).",

Well, when I say amazing, I don't mean amazing in the way that you might be thinking. I mean amazing in that they're so blunt and rude that it becomes amazing in a quirky \"it's cool to be uncool\" kind of way.\nFor example the service goes something like this...\nUS: Walk in door\nWAITRESS: \"Yes, wha you want?\"\nUS: \"Table for 3 please\"\nWAITRESS: \"No, sit here\" (on someone else's table)\nUS: \"Sure, thank you?\"\nWAITRESS: \"Wha you eat?\"\nUS: \"Can we see a menu\"\nWAITRESS: Rolls eyes and reluctantly gets us menu's\nWAITRESS: \"Ready?\" (Before we've had a chance to open the menu's)\nAnd it goes on like this.

We entered as a couple and were ushered upstairs and pushed over to a table of 6, which had two others sitting there. We awkwardly sat down and said a little hello to our neighbours opposite us, already eating their meal. After they had finished and left, they were replaced by two others. So our date turned out to be not so much a date. We had it good though on our table of 6 with only 4 people. Behind us were an older couple sat opposite two young Indian guys on a four seater table. It looked super cramped and awkward. At least we weren't single diners. The downstairs is reserved for single diners only. I don't know what's worse...being singled out because you're single or being forced to sit within perfect distance to be able to hear the couple opposite whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears whilst we devoured our food.\nOnto the food...We had the deep fried salt and chilli squid which was actually amazing. Not greasy, lightly battered, great flavours. We also had a pork, chicken, duck and vegetable dish which has basically just pork with pak choi. Find duck or chicken and you were lucky. Good sauce though. \nWould we come back? No. Too many other places to try in Chinatown and this one did not stand out. Service was okay compared to what other diners have written. Complimentary tea was nice.",

                "description": "I heard of this place through the 2010 Not For Tourists Guide for London and a bunch of London guidebooks, saying that it is one of their recommendations for inexpensive eating in London. I decided to walk inside to grab a lunch and see how they do. \nWhen I got inside, they quickly gave me some tea. The tea was fairly bitter and tasted kind of bland. I don't think the people who work here speak English very well, and I ended up speaking Cantonese Chinese to them. The t-shirts they wore were pretty cool as well. \nI ordered the Fish with tofu over rice. The fish was pretty bony, but there was a decent crisp in the fish, and I thought it was decent at the best. It is not high on my recommendations to order at this place unless you do not mind eating fish meat from the bone. The tofu was pretty good though as well as the rice. The dish also had some Chinese mushrooms and ginger as well. The ginger put some flair into the flavour of the dish, while the mushrooms were pretty tasty. Portions were pretty good and I got my stomach full. As for the prices, most of the dishes were under £9, so it's fairly inexpensive for a city like London. I paid £5.70 for my dish, which is probably the least amount of money I spent for a meal in London so far. \nOverall, this is not a bad place to grab something inexpensive to eat in London and I would not mind coming back here again. However, I would not recommend getting the Fish with tofu over rice.",

However, this is not recommended for any delicate diners. The food is actually incredibly good for the most part, with some of the best duck soup noodles and soft shell crab locally in my opinion (a lot of the local competitors use a lot of veg in their soup so a lot of the rich duck flavour is lost). It is very good value for money, with massive portions, and is very cheap. You can tell it's cheap from the decor, the tableware and the fact that Wong Kei is infamous for it. Do not expect Western-style service. You will not get it. The waiting staff are very quick and also very to-the-point and for the majority of times I've been there, are not going to faff around. I personally have no problem with this but I know it's not for everyone. If you are a couple, you may be seated at a large table with other people if they're very busy. You could always wait for a smaller table to become available but it could be said to be part of the Wong Kei experience. This has only happened to me once and I've been as a pair several times, usually being seated downstairs on the smaller tables.\nGreat food, great price for said food, and exceptionally fast service.",

                "description": "Wong Kei. The best part about this is the name which let's be honest is a bit hilarious. Especially when your aunt keeps saying it in a slightly northern accent. She was raving about the Singapore fried noodles here and since she was the woman of the hour, we went.\nThe place looks like a canteen on a large scale. Not to worry, I thought, the best Chinese places tend to look unimpressive as they care solely about the food. So I said to myself (no I didn't say \"Self\"...I mean who actually does that?) that I'd judge it on the food alone with just a bit on the service.\nThe service overall was pretty good, barring a slight issue at the beginning where they refused to put two tables together (there were roughly 15 of us in the group). Why you ask? No, not because they were too busy or that they didn't' have the tables (they were about half full at best and could easily seat 100 covers), but rather because they \"just didn't do that\". A bit of an odd response for a restaurant to have as I'd imagine keeping 15 hungry diners in a half empty restaurant is a pretty good idea business wise. So we had a mini-standoff between several angry Indian mums and 2 Chinese guys...needless to say the mums won.\nAnyways, finally seated together, I get left with the dubious honour of ordering for the group (as seems to happen more often these days...). Naturally we got several portions of these Singapore fried noodles along with a selection of meat dishes and a roast Peking duck to start.\nThe duck was alright but by no means up to par with that for the Four Seasons (the lovely restaurant in Queensway or Chinatown not the hotel). It has some decent flavour but too much of the fat had been rendered away leaving the meat just a tad dry. We also ran out of pancakes quite quickly and couldn't get the attention of any of the waitstaff to ask for more.\nThe meat dishes we had ordered (the typical staples of Westernised Chinese dining) included beef in black bean sauce, pork in oyster sauce and chilli, cashew chicken, and grilled eel. The eel turned out to be a popular favourite despite not being the melt in your mouth bbq eel I had expected. It was grilled with the skin on and a light flavourful sauce. The skin was too rubbery to really eat but had done an excellent job of protecting the tender meat within. The rest of the dishes could not distinguish themselves from the average Chinese takeout but were satisfying in general.\nFinally, the Singapore noodles. I love my aunt, but I don't know what she was on about with these things. They tasted a bit bland and limp and lacked any of the fiery bite of other such noodle dishes I've tried nor did it have sufficient variety in texture to be appealing. They functioned just fine as a base for other dishes but then again so does egg fried rice. Overall, very disappointed in this but that might be due to the hype as well. \nThoughts: It's cash only so be sure to bring a few notes. Price wise it's pretty decent with the whole meal coming up to around £10pp (which in true asian fashion was fought over with each adult trying to pay for all of it). You can BYOB but they will charge you a corkage fee of £3-5/bottle that they see. So bring a case of identical bottles, just open one, and switch out the empties for a full one whenever the staff aren't around!",

But they were nice about it! And some of us spoke canto, so the guy chatted with us for a little bit and that was nice.\nFood: \n- Ma Po Tofu: really good! I was surprised, considering it isn't really a canto dish. If you order this, remember to get a rice dish or just a (pretty large) bowl of rice (for about 1.50?)\n- Roast Duck (cold): I didn't particularly like it because it was really fatty (Though I know some people like it) and I found it a bit salty (yet again, some people like that).\n- Yang Zhou Fried Rice: DELICIOUS. haha, get it!\n- Choi Sum w/garlic: pretty good, not what I would say best I've ever had. It wasn't the freshest, but the garlic was good (it was his recc).\nPrice: We had 4 people and it came up to 10 pounds a person, which isn't too bad since I was pretty stuffed.\nOverall: I'm pretty happy about this place!

                "description": "I went here about 6 months ago with one of my best friends who can speak Cantonese so that was very helpful for a start and because she'd been here quite a few times, she knew the best place to sit was higher up the restaurant. Apparently on the Ground Floor they're really rude to you - which was ironic as they certainly wouldn't have won any awards for being particularly friendly on our (the third) floor - and it is one of those establishments that is famous / infamous for being rude and that's part of the attraction for some people frequently the joint. Each to their own I guess. \nThe food was delicious and the service okay, but it was annoying to be sat at a table with two pervy older men who sat and drooling over my friend and I for our entire meal and I felt particularly uncomfortable when she went off to the loo and I was left with them. \nWhen it the time came for us to pay our bill, it was annoying to be told that they did not take cards and that we would have to go to the nearest cash point. The waiter even shouted loudly, \"SHE (nodding at me) can go and get money out, whilst YOU (aimed at my friend) wait here.\" We did this after saying, tactfully, how ridiculous it was that they weren't in the 21st Century and didn't have the ability to take card payments. When the waiter was being rude, this was when it was useful that my friend could speak Cantonese as she had a slight, let's call it, debate with the rude waiter. \nGreat location and very convenient, just make sure you come armed with cash and attitude - and you're probably better in a group so then it'll just be you sat on your table!",

There were four of us and we ordered two dishes to share but the waitress did not want to accept our order saying each of us has to order one meal. She was rude to us, took the menu from our table without asking nicely and only said \"cannot cannot\". Clearly her English wasn't very good. I had better experience previously but this time they made me not want to go back there again for their bad service.",

For people dining by themselves, sit on the main floor.  For larger parties, keep walking upstairs.....  \nLike most Chinese restaurants, waiters are brusque and very fast.  Empty dishes seem to disappear in the blink of an eye.  The bill comes almost telepathically to your table.  \nThe food.... so good.  I had a roast duck noodles, which was all of £4.20?  Seriously?  It was delicious and filling and just what I needed.  I shall be back again.  \nBTW - my rule of thumb for Chinese restaurants - usually it's good if a) there is a lot of bad grammar on the menus, plastic tablecloths, lots of people, it's slightly dirty, and brusque staff.  All achieved with Wong Kei.",

                "description": "If you like Chinese then you will like Wonkies. Its situated on the end of China town in the height of central London. The food is great, the service is quick and the quality is fabulous.\nThe thing is about Wonkies and this is whether you like traditional Chinese meals or not there service of feeding people is known all around London and the rest of the world, the prices are reasonable and the restaurant itself has the all the Feng Shui you need to know where you at, what style of food your eating and more importantly you will be able to eat in the knowledge your not being over charged.\nThe grubs great, its always busy and the staff there have been there since day one. This business is making money, and they need to because the overheads down West End are sky rocket.\nThe type of people who eat in this restaurant vary, you have the traditional China town residents, regulars and people like me who venture down West regularly to eat Chinese food. Even if it was not Chinese food I would probably still eat there, because I like Chinese tea (sound familiar?). If so you will love Wonkies as am sure you already know having been there is you get free green tea, not just any old green tea but green tea that helps you clear your palette before eating and green tea that helps you wash down your food.\nIf I have any grumbles about Wonkies it is about the pepper, now it has not happened for a while perhaps because its the summer and the air is much drier but previously I have found the pepper shaker to be blocked. This means simply tapping the pot and sometimes means having to take of the top lid and scrape away the troublesome blocks of pepper, once years ago the pepper fell out onto my food, but anyway I still ate it because I get very hungry. I once invited my pops and brother but unfortunately they declined coming and took me to the pub instead.\nWell what did they miss out on rather than just speaking about the free condiments and wonderful abundance of chopsticks. Sweet and sour is always a favourite with us English. For the health fanatics out there I recommend asking the waiter for greens with your meals, the crispy belly pork is great. The best thing about Wonkies though is the duck is does not matter whether your talking duck pancakes or Duck on rice is all very yummy. Another great meal if your ok with pork and don't mind prawns is a pasta based meal. This meal is called fried Quon Dou its yummy just try it with a huge dollop of the yummy chilli sauce, you will not regret this one the foods great.\nSea lovers ship ahoy there's a great meal that is a set meal with pasta that comes with yummy fish-balls calamari or squid and a yummy spinach based leave to soak up the gooey sauce.\nIf your in two minds about eating Chinese when your down the West End in London and are unsure where to turn or take your large party of hungry friends then Wonkies is where you should turn.\nP.S. Another little tip there is often budget meals on the walls with special that are not necessarily on the menu, there nice but I would not get to distracted the food I spoke of here is well worth checking out for now. If your really adventurous your could try the intestines or the offal dishes but I usually go with what's your normal Chinese grub, but if its a dessert your after your stuffed there are no sweets at Wonkies. Final note yes they do sell Chang beer. Happy eating.",
