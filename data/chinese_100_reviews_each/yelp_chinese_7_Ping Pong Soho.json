We were on our last night in London in the area visiting friends and wanted a quick bite to eat before heading back to our hotel and upon searching for nearby restaurants, this one caught my eye.   I haven't had dim sum in a very long time and my fiancée was up for it so we popped in.  \nWe were greeted immediately and sat promptly, there wasn't much of a wait time until our server approached us and explained the menu and took our drink order.  Drinks arrived and we ordered shortly after.  It was no more than 3 minutes that passed that the food began arriving.  It amazed me to see that many people I the restaurant receiving their food so quickly.  \nWe ordered 6 dishes.  Pork puffs which were packed with flavor yet light.  Prawn crackers which had a nice tangy chili dipping sauce along with it. Crispy prawn balls which had a nice crunch and another great sauce paired with it.  Next up was the firecracker chicken roll which packed some awesome heat, not too much but just right for our palates.  Traditional xiaolongbao was next and there were delicious; seasoned just right and I wish I ordered a second order.  Lastly we had one of the specials which was Crispy duck bao... oh my word!!!  This was the absolute best!  The buns were soft and fluffy, the duck had a nice crunch to the skin and seasoned perfectly and the plum sauce accentuated everything just right.\nThe service was exceptional and the food was amazing.  This is a must try for any dim sum fan or someone who wants to give some delicious food a go.  Cheers!!!",

We requested to be seated at the bottom level and they said we couldn't be seated there as they were close to closing it was still an hour and a half before they closed.  I realized when I looked below that it was all adults seated there and the guests with kids were seated upstairs.  It's not really kid friendly as it is kid tolerated.  The food was okay, I ordered a lychee martini which was decent but they forgot to wipe the bottom of the glass which was wet so when they settled on the table it was wet as well.  Our server did his best but with one server waiting on 7 tables it was just okay.",

They have a mix of authentic dim sum with some fusion ones they've created... but it's hit or miss! They have chicken cashew dumplings and the chili chicken bowl to be very salty and not spicy a all. Some wins are your basic har gau dumplings and we had the soy ginger salad that was pretty good! Service was pretty good despite them being short staffed and the atmosphere is awesome. I wouldn't recommend coming here for actual dim sum but I don't see myself coming back! Not worth the price.",

The only best dish is the special dessert green tea custard bun - however green tea paste is more like green bean paste with green colouring. \nThe service is often delayed here but not fault of the waiters or waitresses, this place is just understaffed!!",

I found most of their dimsums acceptable but not the most flavourful. For instance, the soup within xiaolongbao should have been served much warmer, succulent and tasteful. Nonetheless, most everything got the job done, so I would give the place three stars. \nService was generally good. Whilst there was a slight glitch with our reservation, they were prompt in finding us a table for six. Throughout the meal, they served most everything on time. However, the bill they calculated turned out to be wrong on many items, so we had to manually check them and get them to correct for us. \nAmbience was modern and spacious. Not your average Chinatown dimsum place and good for reasonably stylish gatherings.",

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because many of the items on their menu they didn't actually have.  One of the items they show off on their side walk board out front of their entrance, they only serve for lunch. So we were a little disappointed. But the food was amazing nonetheless. I'm glad we didn't walk out. We ordered 2 different chicken dumplings (chicken with cashews and spicy chicken with vegetables) and both of them were so fresh and flavorful. They were surprisingly out of vegetable rice so we opted for plain sticky rice and it was good and fresh. Their chicken skewers (3) were delicious and well portioned. Lastly, since their pan fried noodles advertised outside but only served for lunch were not available, we chose a vegetable dumpling and noodle soup and it was still hot when we got to the hotel and was packed full of goodies. We were very happy with everything we ordered and hope next time we can try the items they didn't have available. It was busy the entire time we waited for our order and every wait staff we encountered were very pleasant and kind. The place had a great vibe!",

I booked a table for 3 on a Weds eve and we were given one of the solo tables rather than being along the shared bar which was great as it's much easier to talk when facing each other!\nUnfortunately it all went a bit downhill from there as the service was inexcusably bad. We had around 45 minutes of happy hour left when we arrived so were pretty confident we could fit 2 drinks into that time, I ended up chasing the waitress down in order to get our second drinks ticket in on time. We also had to wait around 20 minutes for them to pick up our order sheet, despite the fact that we filled it in straight after ordering our first drinks. The biggest bug bear was after our food arrived my friend asked for a fork as she can't use chopsticks, and after at least a 10 minute wait sitting with our food going cold she had to go and ask a second waitress to be provided with one.\nI've given 3* rather than 2 as the food  and drinks were good and reasonable for the price we paid. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is buzzing, but on this occasion the service could have been a lot better.",

                "description": "I do find it amazing how rare it is to find a restaurant that offers dim sum after the 5pm cut off point. Although not your typical china town establishment, Ping Pong has obviously honed in on this little niche market and has done quite well in delivering food quality wise and has even produced dumplings which have been experimented on Heston style. We are talking art form here and everything in this restaurant is very classy, very modern, very artsy. One place you definitely need to pay a visit to are the toilets (not for that reason!!) which is situated down a dimly lit corridor (which is my excuse as I accidentally walked into a room with funny wall sinks...) and which are accessible by swiping a hand over a motion sensor panel. The decor is very upscale market and although the food is quite expensive individually, it does work out better value when opting for the set menus which offers several dishes and which does fill you up! In the event of you not being full, and wanting to try more or as much of the dishes as possible, then please do visit Sunday's special buffet, neatly labelled lazy sumdays ;-) for under a fixed price of £25 you are treated to a wide range of dishes which you can easily get carried away with. \nIn terms of drinks, try the teas, as healthy as they are, it's also very fragrant and they come prepared with a 'tea bag' propped open with the tea contents shown.",

I've never experienced such a restaurant in Japan.\nSomething like Dim Sum which is considered that that served warm are the best way of eating should be always served one by one. Never ever all at once.\nIs this just the difference of our custom?! If so...  I should've told that when I ordered. OK I will from now on then. \nAnyway.... when it comes to the taste, (I ordered SHARING SELECTION FOR 2)\nOnly 'crab and prawn dumplings' and 'honeyed chili chicken&mushroom rice' were tasty. The others were ...... I wouldn't want to eat them. But I really liked this chicken rice. It was flavorful. full of Chinese soup taste.So I rated 2 stars.\nSorry again but I was sooooooo shocked that they brought them at the same time........  :-()",

If it was in Lexington, Kentucky, I could see the novelty but with the great options in Chinatown (and others) I would not return.\nWent with a friend and we tried multiple dim sum.  None were bad and some were pretty good:\n--  Duck bao.  One of the more disappointing.  The duck was smoked and I prefer roasted while the sauce was somewhat thin.  It was a nice sized portion, though.\n--  Duck spring roll, good but not great.\n--  Prawn toast with sesame seeds, one of the best options.  Tasty, a lot of prawn, not much filler.\n--  Spinach and mushroom dumpling.  A surprise success, especially as I normally don't care of mushroom.  Very tasty, fried but not greasy.\n--  Honey soy chicken wings.  Looked and sounded good, meaty wings, not much flavour\n--  Char siu bun, a standard but well prepared and tasty, good balance of filling and bun\n--  Prawn and chive dumpling, good but not great\n--  Black prawn dumpling, most interesting and innovative dish, good flavor\n--  crab and prawn dumpling, good but not incredible\nI also didn't like the service.  Empty restaurant but they could not put us in any of the tables we wanted.  Ended up eating outside, which was great, but they were really kind of jerks about finding us a table.  Overall, a competent meal but not worth the opportunity cost.",

You almost feel as if you're in a fish tank looking out! There's a lot of natural light for an underground floor. \nThe wait staff are very polite and gave us a complimentary bottle of beer as it was a birthday in our group which was a nice touch. \nOn to the food...considering dumplings aren't really a speciality dish in their native country, Ping Pong manages to make the dish very appealing both to the eye and the palate. The selection is huge - seafood, chicken, beef, pork and lots more. Our favourite was the Shanghai Xiaolongbao. It's necessary to get the dipping sauces to add extra flavour to the dimsum. \nAnother top dish was the broccoli with the mustard dipping sauce. Then it's also worth trying the duck spring rolls with black sauce. \nThe portion size of the seaweed and prawn crackers was slightly small however they are of a higher quality than you'd typically find at a Soho Chinese restaurant so not too big a complain there. \nHuge recommendation whether a small family group or a large gathering of friends.",

None of us could finish these courses before the next arrived.  Needless to say it felt like they wanted us out!  Then the long wait started...  Over 20 minutes before I could get the attention of a waiter who when I complaint said it is not her table...\nIn summary bad service and most of the drinks were out of stock... Skip this branch they don't care about customer service!",

                "description": "I was invited out to lunch by a friend and we decided to go to Ping Pong; I had heard about them and she had already been. I love dim sum and wasn't too disappointed; it isn't the BEST in London, but it's tasty enough, the price is right and it's served on a decent environment with good atmosphere and sleek, modern decor (typical dim sum places can be noisy, too brightly lit, uncomfortable and that cliché \"chinese takeaway joint\"  decor can put one off).\nYou are given a menu and a list where you tick your selected dishes - quite fun and makes ordering easy. Each portion comes with around three pieces and most are under £4. The baskets come to the table all at once and will be stacked high if you order a lot; tables are on the small side, so it can become a bit awkward juggling all that stuff. But you'll manage. :) It is the right thing to do here, though; the portions aren't huge (they shouldn't be; it's dim sum after all) and it would be very time consuming to keep refilling your table everytime you finished a basket, increasing waiting times.  \nIf you're not too ravenous you could order two or three + a small main meal (one of the rice dishes, maybe). If you're really ravenous, well, you're going to spend a little more or go elsewhere. If you're going for the set menus they are good value, but remember you'll get mostly individual pieces instead of a portion of three as in the a la carte.\nAlmost everything I ordered was tasty, especially the honeyed chilli chicken and mushroom rice pot (not a big portion, but it's only over £6 so I certainly wasn't expecting a bucket). The char sui buns (steamed bun with BBQ pork) are ok; I've certainly had better, but also much worse. Loved my drink called Hibiscus Spritz; you are given a glass of fizz with a flower inside an ice cube in which you pour a concoction of liqueurs; very \"chemistry class\" and deliciously refreshing. Didn't have time for more cocktails and dessert, but will do next time - the drinks menu look particularly appealing and I really liked the one I tried.\nApparently they are always changing the menus with the seasons. A good trick to get you coming back, and I intend to. :)",

Belly soooooo full!\nAll you can eat Sumdays rock here at Ping Pong.\nAs we had arrived before 1pm, we were also able to avail of their free cocktail on their Sumday. Woo hoo. \nEverything tasted great at the start, but by the end it was difficult. Too much food ordered and I for one was not going to embarrass myself by leaving any behind. By the end the taste of the food was not the priority and the novelty had worn off. \nBut still I recommend Ping Pong for their service, which was excellent. Also for their decor, which is very cool. And the food, which was great up to a point. \nJust don't make a pig of yourself and you should be grand. \nRecommended.",

Make sure that you book a table and maybe have plans for where to go afterwards. \nAs part of London restaurant month, they had a special dim sum set menu. Everything came out relatively quickly, but the portion that came out was a little small. It was also not the best dim sum I'd ever had, but I haven't had a good one in London yet.\nThis place was geared towards the foreign palate as opposed to real Chinese dim sum.

I suppose I feel the same still but I was very pleasantly surprised at the value for money here! We were in the area and starving so we basically just picked the first place near us. We each got the set menu for 1 -- I got the vegetarian and my friend got the chicken I think. A rice bowl, 3 or 4 appetizers, and 4 dim sum for around £12.50 if I remember correctly! We were both shocked at how much food we got and even though service was mediocre and my wine glass came out a little dirty.. I'm not mad about it. We had a good time and the seating at the bar looking down was pretty cool. Wouldn't be opposed to coming again if I was in the area! The food was satisfying, the wine was good, and my company was great :D",

Ping Pong offers this non - territorial atmosphere where you can order a lychee martini or mojitos and have it with your dim sum. It's a great hang out place for 3+ people so everyone can have a sharing + fun experience. It's a great place to take your non-chinese friends for their first dim sum experience. Fantastic!",

It's not the place!\nSpeaking about the food, the quality of it is really high: dim sum are great, with several different fillings and everyone with its characteristic taste and smell, delicious! strongly suggested the black ones (called black prawn dumplings), with squid ink pastry, and the chicken shu mai, chicken and asparagus in a top opened dumpling. But, just take some of them, portions are not that big (from 2 to 4 dumplings each) and it's just so good to share everything with your table!\nDon't forget to have a cocktail or something to drink, this place has a lot of different options you rarely see and their presentation is always special (as example, take the hybiscus spritz: awesome!)\nI still have to try the upper floor, with tables surrounding the kitchen, but I can't say anything bad about this place, this is just great! ah and it's not that expensive!",

Here's what's good:\nHar gow - can't go wrong with this classic (again, says the white guy who has no business calling anything a classic)\nSteamed dumplings: spicy chicken, spicy vegetable, chicken and cashew nut oh good lord it is my absolute favorite thing there\nLemongrass Jasmine iced tea - get it everytime!\nHere's what's not good: leaving this place, not eating at this place, and anyone who reviews it less than four stars. Eff you.\nLastly, everything comes really quickly. You can't go wrong here. Really! If they were franchising in the US, I would sink some cash into one. And eat myself out of business.",

                "description": "As restaurant chains go Ping Pong has to be one of the better ones.  I have been to a few of them over the years and they always serve delicious tasty food.\nPing Pong Soho is no different.  When I ate here recently it was full of people happily indulging in their favourite dim sum dishes and guzzling Ping Pong's fantastically exotic cocktails.\nThis is a particularly good venue for big groups and looking around this time I could see that most of the tables were filled with large groups of people.  The only small issue I had this time was my group of 16 were seated on two separate tables.\nThe food here is really delicious.  For those of you not familiar with the concept it is mainly Dim Sum, small bite sized portions of food which are traditionally served in small steamer baskets.  They can be steamed, fried or baked.  In addition to the dim sum they also serve a number of rice dishes such as Honey-Chilli \nChicken Rice Pot or Vegetable Sticky Fried Rice and some small plates such as Honey Glazed Spare Ribs and Chilli Squid.\nFor those of you a bit unsure of what to order there are set menus which will give you  a decent variety dishes to try and this is particularly good if you are ordering for groups.\nIf however you do fancy ordering for yourself then I can heartily recommend the aforementioned ribs, the Potato and Edamame Cakes, The Crispy Prawn Ball and to start the Garlic and Black Pepper Prawn Crackers.  Just don't go mad.  The food is a lot more filling than it looks and you can always order more later. \nThe big selling point for me though has to be the cocktails.  They put a big twist on your common or garden variety cocktail.  With names like Hong Kong Colada, Wasabi and Amaretto Sour and Smoked Nashi Negroni  they are sure to be a conversation starter and the best bit is they taste as good as they sound.  For those of you not so keen on alcohol they have  a good choice of mocktails and lemonades, and for those of you who want something simpler they have a good selection of beers, ciders and wines and a huge selection of teas.\nAnd the best bit of all is the bill at the end of the night will not break the bank!",

                "description": "when i found out ping pong was a chain, i was ready to hate it, but it's actually pretty tasty! we ordered a bunch of dishes to split between three of us (probably about 8 plates) and i liked everything. we got a mix of things from buns to dumplings to edamame and it was all really good and served quickly *\nin total we spent about 20 pounds each including dessert (least fave part of the meal - get dessert somewhere else), a cocktail (these were good, just don't get lychee martini unless you reeeally like lychee) and enough food to completely stuff us. i thought it was a pretty good deal. our other friends got the set meals which were 10 pounds but didn't seem like such a good deal since you can't really pick which things you get..\n* the food comes out all at different times so you get all your dishes staggered. it's actually kind of better like that though, since you always have something to look forward to until the very end (and then you can look forward to dessert obviously)\n** also the bill came with two cute little wooden dolls which i took and will be re-gifting to some sad \"friends\" back in america this christmas and passing off as vintage japanese dolls from the uk. thanks ping pong!!!",

                "description": "Ping Pong definitely has to be one of my favourite dinner spots. \nIt's a really modern, trendy, vibrant place to eat dim sum and have a few cocktails. I would definitely recommend going on a Sunday when their lazy sumday offer is on: £21.50 all you can eat (excluding a couple of areas of the menu). As ping pong is a dim sum restaurant, this offer definitely pays off, especially when in a group as you can all sample a large amount of dishes for far cheaper than you could ordinarily. \nThe cocktail (though excluded from the lazy sumday offer) are absolutely delicious as are the non alcoholic drinks. I would definitely recommend the Hong Kong Colada as well as the Passionfruit lemonade.\nAs far as food goes the dim sum is expertly made and really delicious. If you are unsure of what to order, go for anything in the Ping Pong selection but, as I said, I would recommend going on a sunday so you can experience many different types of dumpling. \nDefinitely recommend this spot for dinner/drinks in the city.",

When I say much, I'm really referring to the dumplings, those steaming piles of slimy stuff delivered in towering stacks of bamboo baskets.  They're just not for me.  I really enjoyed everything else that we had, the edamame, duck rolls, honey chicken and rice.\nThe service was really efficient, although our waitress was either stoned or just extremely disengaged with the planet.  The beer was too expensive (£6.95 for a 640ml bottle) although this seems to have become standard at most chain restaurants these days.  If you can get a seat at the bar I'd recommend it - it looked much more comfortable and spacious up there.\n4 stars overall - a chain place like this can never really get 5 stars so to get 4 is doing very well indeed.",

I met a group of friends at the restaurant, great location, just a short walk from Oxford Circus underground station & perfect for a group of girls. The service was spot on, the staff were friendly and welcoming, the restaurant has a great feel to it with gorgeous interior decorating and warm lighting. After viewing the menu for a second time I was so excited about ordering food. We decided to go with the set menu, extremely cheap for central London and looked amazing. I think we paid £15 for a 3 servings including dumplings. When the food came out it looked great but was cold and unfortunately not all that tasty. Rice dishes weren't fresh, dumplings slightly over done. I would give this restaurant a second shot but I wouldn't go for the set menu. They also have gluten free options available which is great!!",

We have specifically ordered one menu because of one dish which they didn't have. Which would not be a big problem if someone would actually tell us that they don't have it.

All the classic dishes are on the menu - but with little twists, like using fragrant jasmine rice instead of glutinuous sticky rice, and prawn toast using french garlic baguette instead of normal toast.\n The menu is extensive and all the food, especially the seafood ones, were bursting with flavour and extremely fresh. You must try some of their more unusual dumplings - the seabass dumpling is a delight to the eyes, with a dunpling skin dyed purple using red cabbage juice.\n What sets Ping Pong apart from other dim sum restaurants in London is that its not a boring and stiff place - there's a lounge area, and their cocktail menu is quite extensive. You would go to Royal China for example if you had a business meal or a proper Sunday brunch with family. But you go to Ping Pong for a fun night out with friends.\n Pricewise, its more expensive than your usual dim sum in Chinatown, and probably the same price as other great dim sum places like Pearl Liang and Royal China.\n Reviewed by The London Insider\nlondon-insider.co.uk/201…",

In fact, I often come here with a Chinese friend who agrees with all of the above.\nSo, what is it that I don't like? Well, it comes down to the interior design and the customer service, which this place is kind of lacking. Inter-design-wise, I am sure that lots of people would disagree with me, but for me this is too slick, too stylish and too wanna-be funky. As for the customer service, the people here seem to be lacking a great deal of motivation - no smile, no sign of personal acknowledgement whatsoever...and this just doesn't go well with me.\nPlus, it's also not a cheap meal, unless you come on a Sunday, when you can do Lazy Sum Day, which is an all-you-can-eat-kind-of-deal for GBP 18.99...still not cheap though.\nWhat this place is lacking is the authentic Chinese experience of push cards being rolled around in the restaurant, the steam baskets piling up in the trolleys and also the fact that you can order in a more leisurely style. Along the lines of: I still could eat one more, let's see what the next lady is having in her trolley...\nWell, if you want this experience in London, I suggest you go to New World in Chinatown...",

There was special effort put into creating a modern ambiance for enjoying dim sum.  Regardless, I thought the food fell short.  \nI ordered the vegetarian special menu.  It's a great value because I was extremely full for only about 12-13 pounds.  However, I wasn't in love with any of the 6-7 items I received.  Everything seemed to lack flavor or have an oddly mushy exterior.  Nothing tasted bad, but it there were no moments of culinary interest.  Also, things felt a little too commercialized with the open demonstration of pulling pre-made items out of a fridge and plopping them on the steamer.  Efficient, yes.  Appealing to showcase, no.\nI think this place is great for a social gathering, where the focus is more on the company and less on the food.",

I usually to the sum-days deal of the 21.95 all you can eat as eating there on a regular day is a rip off. After this experience of poor service and horrible food I will not be going back. Embarrassing how I took a friend and she hated it too. It's the worst to have to shell out good money for food you hate you just leave feeling ripped off and £30 each poorer as cocktails are a good £7 per cocktail. Never again ping pong.",

The dim sum was delicious, and the cocktails were good too. Apparently the staff don't get all of the tips (management takes a cut), so we took that off the bill and left cash instead! That way it goes to the waiter. Overall it was good, we had booked a special Chinese New Year menu online for £16 per person which was good value - otherwise I'd say it might be a bit pricy for the portion sizes. Definitely book ahead, otherwise it was a 30-45 min wait on a Wednesday n",

From the food to the service, Ping Pong is a bore and I'm shocked that it has received 3.5 start from my fellow Yelpers.  \nMy hubby and I had to flag down a server to place our order and actually had to ask for our drinks to be delivered (they had been sitting on the bar counter for close to 5 minutes) after our horribly bland food arrived.  Sure, the decor is cool, but the only saving grace for their food is the spicy chili sauce that actually provided our bland dim sum a bit of flavor.

We were trying to ditch the impending rain and fill our slightly soured hangover bellies when we waltzed in. \nLittle did my friends and I realise we had arrived for \"Lazy Sumdays\", possibly the best invention ever! On Sundays and on weekdays in most of the City locations, Ping Pong has an all you can eat special for just over £18 a head.  If you've never had dim sum, which many in my party had not, and you are superhero hungry then this is the deal for you! Most of the menu is available for this deal but the only trick is everyone in your party has to order this deal.  This was not a problem for my friends.\nWe basically ordered at least one of everything on the menu and if we came across anything we didn't like (which was rare) we simply moved on to the next thing.  We could barely waddle our fat rumps out of the door by the end. It definitely sorted our hangovers out and sent us off as lil happy dumplings.\nSign-up for the loyalty card for more deals and make sure you get one of their yummy cocktails or one of their beautiful gourmet teas.",

I think I counted three other guys in there, everyone else seemed to be twenty or thirty-something groups of women (can't say that I was complaining!) \nI'm not a big fan of chains and prefer to support indie restaurants when possible, but sometimes when you're out with people you just want quick and easy 'safe' options. \nPing Pong is a very safe choice. Everything is fine at this branch. \nDrinks are ok. Good taste, but weak measures + too much ice) \nDim sum is ok, but a bit bland and pricy for what it is. \nService is good, lots of staff, typical of this sort of high-end mainstream type of restaurant (think Strada, Bertorelli etc.) \nSame goes for the surroundings, clean, well designed, with moody colours and lighting, but a bit soulless. \nAll in all, if you want a safe option, very close to Oxford Street tube, you could do a lot worse than Ping Pong. It's close to a 4 star rating, but expect to feel a bit rushed if they're very busy and they also don't accept American Express, which is pretty poor considering the number of restaurants in their chain + their enormous margins.",

On paper it seems inexpensive. £2.99 - £3.99 for three dumplings.

                "description": "Ping Pong dim sum, London's latest all day dim sum haunt. We're great fans of Yauatcha - Alan Yau's (creator of Wagamama) fantastic all day dim sum place and we'd heard that Ping Pong was just as good but cheaper.\n Well was it?\n Certainly on entering it looked great. We were taken downstairs and there were a number of huge round tables with a subdued light in the centre. We sat on one of the squarer tables but this had a great view of huge ornamental Japanese style courtyard, with trendy projections playing against and enormous wall.\n The food and cocktails were certainly cheaper than Yauatcha (not that Yauatcha's expensive) the cocktails were only six or seven pounds each, which was terrific value as they were very long, full of fresh fruit like kumquats, lychees, blueberries and grapes. Mine in particular had tons of fresh mint and was very alcoholic - so much so I managed to knock a third of it over - D'OH!\n We chose about ten dim sum dishes between the three of us and they averaged at about £3 each. Ping Pong provided a handy menu that we could tick to keep track of our order and make it simpler to give our order to the waiter.\n Onto the food. If I hadn't already been to Yauatcha's several times, I would have thought the food was brilliant. It was certainly very, very good. Some dishes such as the chive dumplings stood out. The sticky rice in parcels was also tasty. The puffy buns were light and filling at the same time. The chilli sauce that was served with most dishes blew my head off - so handle with care.\n My friend had an amazing jasmine tea to finish - boiling water poured onto the head of jasmine flower. It looked like something out of Alien as it grew tendrils in the heat and eventually a white flower wound its way through the water looking like a sea anenome.\n Like all of the new dim sum places in London the toilets were highly trendy too. Black granite everywhere and sensitive taps which turn on as if by magic.",

                "description": "I agree with another reviewer that this is a great restaurant for socializing, but the food can go either way.  I arrived as part of a group of five, and we sat downstairs around a (too large) round table with benches.  It was a work-meeting at lunchtime, so non-alcoholic, and I had a delicious lemongrass-flavored iced tea. The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, but the ordering and delivery of food was confusing, in part because it is all small dishes, and in a group it was difficult to figure out how much to order and sharing some of the dishes proved awkward.  Some of the deep fried stuff was great, but some of the others - meh.  Also, the bill escalated quickly, as all these little dishes add up very quickly.  I would suggest this as a place to go with one or two others who like to share, but it was not great for a larger group.",

They didn't come back when my glass was empty to see if I would like another, or when the food was gone we waited a long time for attention when we were asked if we wanted dessert not if we would like to order any more dishes which came as a surprise to me. They had the potential to get more money out of us!\nSo, no extra drinks and no extra dishes....we went for dessert at Starbucks with a cheescake and coffee...pity Ping Pong missed out this time as on other occassions we have enjoyed our dinner there.",

                "description": "Ping Pong is my ideal place for dim sum. It is where Western standards meet Eastern foods and the jasmine flower balls are a pretty entertaining gimmick first time round. I'm not really a fan of gristle or fat on meat, which you can tend to get in a lot of Chinese restaurants.But Ping Pong is polished dim sum, there is no poor quality meat to be had here.\nMy usual list of things to order are: Traditional sticky rice parcels, the jasmine tea (with the ball!), chicken puff, har gau, spicy chicken and vegetable dumplings and char sui buns. This is usually enough for two people and me and my friend always eat them in a particular order as well.\nI like the dark decor as well, its very masculine and the seating is generally good. Though beware the curved tables at the back in this outlet, as although they have a great view are rather cramped when the food comes. Ask if you can sit downstairs if possible, it's equally as nice. There are couple of these around town, but I would say that this one has the best location and the best seating despite it not being the largest.",

                "description": "Not at all unlike eating dim sum in a nightclub. It's nothing authentic, but a fairly swish operation, with decent quality ingredients and drinks abound.\n The ordering process is more than a little bewildering, and though the waiting staff do offer to help out with choosing and so on (a la Wahaca), I got the feeling they wouldn't put themselves out too much. Pah, maybe they're just busy.\n We had cocktails to start off with, which possibly wasn't the smartest move, but we had to wait for a table. They were worth it though, unusual and very well made. However it meant that tastebuds were somewhat dulled when we were seated and the tea came along. The teas are great and quite well sum up the whole experience - far from authentic but snazzy. The flowering teas open up when they are poured. Nice touch.\n Anyway, back to the food. Ordering is done by ticking boxes on your own lottery-esque ticket. Pretty standard stuff on display. In addition to a large array of dumplings, we tried a few pork buns, soft shelled crab and a chef special chilli prawn concoction. All the food was tasty, yes. Didn't set my world alight, but it was tasty, arrived quickly and made me happy.\n Ping Pong do a Dim Sumday on Sundays, eat all you can / like for £17. It's not a bad deal for Ping Pong, as it's not a cheap place to go on a regular day, but the formula works. Fresh, quick, accessible. People leave happy.",

As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that this restaurant has going for it is the ambience. The portions were small and the food was bland at best. Definitely not up to the standard of restaurants found in Chinatown even the not-as-nicely-decorated ones.

Well, Ping Pong's baked 'Pork Puff' that's what's not to like. This was the first dish to arrive to our table and it was essentially a mini sausage roll that someone had poured honey onto. Sickly sweet and unpleasant, it did not fill me with high hopes about the rest of the meal.\nFortunately, this was as bad as it got and although the Soft Shell Crab was greasy, all three of the steamed dim sum we chose were delicious. The service was very quick and efficient but I resented the waitress encouraging us to over order. Three to four dim sum each seemed a bit over the top and these dishes weren't cheap. In fact, being a big fan of dim sum I noticed that these prices were at least a pound more than anything you would pay in China town. Ok, you get to sit in sleek surroundings and sip cocktails but frankly I prefer my dim sum with a little more character and would rather sit in some weird Chinese back room restaurant than have another watery 'Lychee and roses' cocktail for £6!",

There are lots of Ping Pong's in different areas in London, therefore a safe option to find one in your part of town.\nIn my opinion this place is perfect for visitors who like to put little bits and bobs together. The choice is extensive and for those who have a hard time making up their mind, there are set menus.\nYou get a pencil to tick the right menu box for the dim sum chosen. Ping Pong recommends 4-6 dishes each, which mean a table for two will be covered by all sorts of dim sum baskets in every shape and form. 'Surprise' is the right word to describe the dumplings you choose, as you do not know what it tastes like before you have tried each of them.\nI little tip, ask the waiters to not bring everything at once - it is a shame when food gets cold. The place is an experience, it not only holds surprises for you but also engages with the customer interactively. You will not get bored and you need to be skilled in eating the dim sum with chopsticks.",

                "description": "We went to this restaurant as a group of about 15 for my friend's birthday.\n Upon arrival I went to the bar and asked that I seperately order two bottles of expensive champagne and pay for them now in cash so as to keep them off the main bill. I wanted this to be a nice surprise for the birthday girl. They looked at me in a total state of confusion as to why I would want to do this. I eventually paid up and returned to the table.\n The champagne took 20 mins in getting to us, meanwhile I was trying to put everyone off ordering drinks so as not to spoil the surprise.\n The drinks eventually arrived and we ordered the food. The waitress was rude and uninterested. It took ages for her to take our ordering slip which we had promptly filled out. We each expected to make 2 or 3 rounds of orders but in the end it took 2 and a half hours for them to serve us just 2 dishes each, we gave up and I asked that the cake be bought out. Someone said they would deal with it. A few minutes later the rude waitress returned and asked loudly right infront of the birthday girl \"should I bring the cake out now?\" it was meant to have been a surprise.\n 20 mins later and the cake hadn't arrived, I asked her again, but still no cake arrived. Eventually I asked the manager who said he would deal with it which he did. However, as soon as 10 members of our party (including the birthday girl) left for a cigarette, he bought out the cake... To an empty table!!\n Eventually we complained and only paid a fraction of the bill. But this wasn't the point. It took 3 hours from start to finish and we received very little food. It totally ruined the evening and we were all still so hungry that we ended up getting noodles on the way home.\n If I could, I would only give one star. Thoroughly disappointed, will never visit again.\n Also, food that DID arrive was average.",

                "description": "The food is... ok. But it always feels like you're paying as much for the decor as the food, and the whole place is trying a bit too hard to tell you how cool and urban and happening you are. There are half a dozen places around the corner in Chinatown you could go to for better food (Top of the Town, maybe) - just ask for the dim sum menu and point at random.",

                "description": "Where I come from something like ping pong would be amazing, but in London it arguably is nothing special. I nevertheless love to go there for a quick lunch (it's so close to the Soho office). And I don't really mind that they trade true authenticity and top quality for style and price. As long as they serve dim sum the way they do I'll come back.",
