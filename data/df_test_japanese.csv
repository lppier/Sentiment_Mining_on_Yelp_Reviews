japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,We were back this July and made a point of returning to Zuma. The food was still great.,1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Zuma has maintained it's consistency in food quality through the years. It's delightful to be back, to witness the robata grill being fired to its full glory! Seafood and meats galore, grilled to perfection in a wonderfully delicate and exquisite taste! We had the black cod, amazing Chilean bass, baby chicken, king prawn, skewered meats, maki rolls and the juicy Iberico pork- everyone is just happy!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"The sushi and dishes here are spectacular. Black cod is a must and the soft shell crab sushi was amazing. Every sushi I ordered was just so deliciously and beautifully presented. One star down however - this was because I called in and asked if I can wear trainers. The staff on the phone suggested I do not wear them (so I switched to heels). Upon entering the restaurant, I saw a couple of men eating near the bar wearing trainers themselves!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,2,"In short, over-rated.I apologize if I'm gong to be brutal here. 
So I have been told, that Zuma is amazing. Likewise, the way Zuma treats their customers, you'd think they have something to give.  So,  I was totally excited to dine.afterall I'm such a Japanese food freak, I was all set for this dinner! 
My husband and I arrived first,  he said that Zuma finally got our reservation in and they had us booked in a private room. That was really cool.  But since the rest of the party didn't get in yet, we decided to hang out at the bar. The place looked like any other modern Japanese Fusion restaurant you'd find in Vegas & New York, w/ an open kitchen concept to the diners the tables were set lower but it's inter-mingled with the bar.. making it look packed. To me, its more a mess.
Others may perceive it as cozy, & bustling. To me,  its just crowded & a total cluster! If you're claustrophobic,  avoid the place at peak hours. I got myself a non - alcoholic cocktail drink called Norisan, made of fresh mint, passion fruit,  pineapple, shaken w/ orange. But honestly, it's just orange juice w/ some crushed ice mixed w/ some crushed mint leaves. Lol. That's how it tasted to me. 
A couple of photo shoots here & there, our friends started arriving. The bars main focal point was the impressive display of different saki bottles.  You'd think that was the only alcoholic drink they serve. Lol.
When everybody finally assembled together,  we asked our host if our table was ready. They told us they'd check on it. 5mins passed, nothing.  15mins.nothing. So my husband decided to ask again.Now we are all thinking maybe they made a mistake in giving away our room to someone else. 
2 minutes after the second time my husband checked, we were lead to our private room. It had a nice wooden table. They handed each of us our own menus & we all decided to order & share it w/ everyone. We got Edamame, Miso Soup, Wagyu Beef, a Sashimi, Sushi & Maki Roll assortment, soft shelled crabs, eggplant salad, etc. Photos attached.
To me, the edamame, salad & miso soup should've been served first as they seem to be a first course dish & the rest would've been best served all at once.  But instead, they served them one at a time. With a crowd of 6, it was a bit awkward. Not for nothing,  it would've been ok if their servings were enough for 6, but when a dish comes out good for 1 or 2 people,  a restaurant should be thoughtful enough to think ahead.  But not Zuma I guess. The plates went from one side of the table back & forth. All of you can request them to do that next time you dine to avoid this. 
They offer you two types of water, still or gas.  We got both. My preference was still.The server was in a rush to kick us out towards the end of our meal that he poured seltzer into my glass which totally ruined my water. Extremely a huge faux pax!
My miso soup was ok. It tasted like a regular. Nothing exceptional.The Edamame were just medium sized. We get plumper Edamames in the US. The Wagyu Beef, I was excited to try,  but they were tasteless.  I'm wondering if they didn't season them for a reason except drizzled peppers on top of them? So not impressive.  I'm very particular w/ my steak. The only steak so far that impressed me the most came from Ruth's Chris & John Howies. Other than that, I make my own & my kids rather eat the steak I make than to eat outside at a restaurant. This steak was a fail. As for the Sushis & Makis, we are from the Pacific Northwest & we've traveled to far & wide where Sushis almost a staple.. conveyor belts of Sushis graze airports & restaurants like a fast food joint. I've tasted the best sushis in Washington & Japan. This one was just mediocre. But I can say the seafood they used was of exceptional quality.  That is commendable. But that does not say much of its flavors. Likewise, the eggplant salad, it was ok, but nothing memorable. It didn't leave anything in my palate wanting for more.  You have to put a zinger!
But there is one dish Zuma did right & tasted wonderful! That's the Soft shelled crab! It was perfectly fried, cut, soft, crusted & seasoned,  perfectly presented w/a side of lemon as it should be for every seafood, & a dipping sauce.  It reminded me of the flavors of the ocean w/ a hint of garlic & a touch of citrus,  totally satisfying in every bite. I would totally get just 2 orders of that & a bowl of rice & I'd be happy at Zuma. 
For what could've been $100 worth of a dinner in the US or at any Sushi place, we spent â‚¬350 w/c is equivalent to $485. So be prepared if you want to spend that much. If it is just to scratch off a bucket list, think twice.. I'd say totally NOT worth it. Explore the world,  there's better places to get better food out there,  you just have to discover it yourself.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,Cool / fancy place to have some great japanese food! Everything we ordered was delicious. Kinda pricy but worth it. Make a reservation.,1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Excellent service, lovely ambiance and very lively. The quality of food is great. Love the outdoor sitting.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"This remains one of my fave restaurants ever and every time I come to London, I'm there. The service is top notch and the food is interesting and fresh. Whenever I'm in a city with Zuma, I'm happy but nothing is like the original experience.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"London is not exactly known for having great Japanese food (sushi especially), but Zuma really defies that idea. The atmosphere is sleek and stylish, with an open kitchen and contemporary decor. The employees cater to you as soon as you enter, with the welcoming hostesses quickly checking our many shopping bags. The great service only escalated as our waiter led us through the menu. We absolutely loved our meal! Each dish was innovative and delicious, with such unique flavors. The fish was so fresh and we found ourselves wondering how anyone could possibly think that London lacks a quality food scene. One of our personal favorite parts of the meal was the tempura popcorn- you've never had anything like it! Our experience at Zuma was truly memorable, and made for a wonderful first dinner in London.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Strictly on food, our favourite meal of the trip. Stunning surroundings, too. It's tucked away behind a hotel. We enjoyed everything that we had but that didn't stop us from looking longingly at the plates moving passed us. Seating options include the cocktail bar, the grill bar and tables. Reservations are a must.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Finally came here after a university friend had recommended this restaurant to me about 2 years ago. As I just found out Zuma is a sister restaurant of Roka, which is also really good - it is no surprise that they have quite high standards. As much as I love the food here I have to admit that the taste of tuna has changed over the years.. this might be an environmental problem but the fatty tuna here just does not taste like the one I have had in Japan. Either way, it was a very pleasant experience as I popped in during the holiday season without a reservation and still was able to get seated rightaway. I had the seared beef which I could highly recommend and the yellow tail sashimi which also was a delight! The lobster as a main, what else could a person ask for, the most satisfying low carb meal I have had in a very long time - happy new year folks!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Fun, expensive. Fresh and well executed fish, pricey. Loud, boisterous, casual, and quality but high prices! A snack for two can set you back almost $200. But nice location.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"We tried our luck and came in without a reservation, we didn't book in advance but you know how it's,it's all about contacts, it's annoying but that's how it works be with the right people and you will get a table anywhere!
As usual service was great, delicious food, best restaurant in London!
Black cod, yellow tail the stars of the night, softshellcrab roll superb , great cocktails, Zuma always leaves you with that je ne sais quoi, always leaves you wanting more I'm coming back soon very soon ha :)",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Everyone about Zuma is 5 stars. Food is incredible. All of it. Recipes you never thought would be great (spinach and peanut butter) are amazing. Staff, service, location and atmosphere are just 5 stars. Amazing.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"I rarely give 5-star reviews. If there were 6 to give on Yelp, I'd give them that. 
It's that good.
We last Sunday night, & although we had tried to book a few weeks ago it was already full. I understand why now. The Hostess was lovely & accommodating, & offered to try to seat us at the sushi counter 45 mins later, & would come find us at the bar. That 'can do' & friendly attention to service permeated our evening: the bartenders were attentive, friendly, and so efficient that the replaced half-empty bowl of edamame was like a sleight of hand. And the bar was packed!
While waiting to be seated, I was perusing the insanely good collection of wines in their glass wall case, & as I was about to take a picture of some very rare Petrus, one of the staff came rushing up saying ""No, no sir!"", & then with a smile, opened the case & said ""you'll get a much better picture up close!"". Nice!
Five minutes later (after about 20 waiting), the hostess found us and sat us.  The Sommelier came over to talk to us (a charming young American with an excellent pairing knowledge), and helped us make a great choice (sadly, not the Petrus). Then, the food.  I can literally blather on for hours with food porn descriptions, so let me just say: if you just stick with the specialities (although its ALL unbelievable), you cannot go wrong. Get it all.
Zuma was a terrific experience! If you love great food & wine & want to be wowed by some, while being treated like royalty..go to Zuma.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,I love this restaurant very much! This is one of my top places I go to in London. The food here is absolutely amazing and really do enjoy it with family!,1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Well for starters, this place has absolutely amazing food, an upbeat ambiance of total excitement, lots of patrons having a great time either dining, lounging at and around the bar area or waiting for a table, and an insane number of employees all working feverishly hard to keep everyone happy. The patron mix is varied, younger, older, European, Arab, visitors and locals alike all seem to love Zuma.
     We've now been 4 nights in a row (without reservations) on our 5 night visit to London from Honolulu.  Got seated twice without a wait, but you'll want to make reservations. We ordered different dishes each night to see if it were just a few that were amazing.  All 15 dishes we tried had flavors that definitely rival the greatest restaurants around the world. You will not be disappointed. Sushi rivals Nobu & Morimoto even though the sushi portions seemed slightly smaller.  The fire grilled meat & seafood (Robata) are done perfectly every time. 
     If it's just two of you get a pair of the 15 seats that surround the grill and watch the cooks in action. You will be very impressed by the level of detail that goes into each dish. The menu is extensive, each dish is a unique creation of well paired flavors.  It was impressive watching the head chef check the temperature of each grilled entree and inspect every dish before releasing it. By far one of the best restaurants in London.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Fantastic. It is hard to get a better restaurant than Zuma. Everything from start to finish was top notch, esp the service and the food. It certainly is an expensive dinner but worth it. The bar is also nice to have a few drinks at.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Zuma is giving a good and reliable experience, prices are reasonable compared to other first class venues. We enjoyed the giant shrimp, the lamb and stakes, sushi and sashimi might be better.Ambiance is great but the service is not in the same level as the food and ambiance reception is not paying attention, waitress forgo to bring dishes and drinks ( apologized but no compensation. )In sum good but not excellent",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,1,"I'm japanese, so maybe my opinion is too hard. 
This restaurant is same like  FRIDAY EVERYDAY.
Foods are good and atmosphere are good , however never better than like a restaurant Wagamama, or normal franchises restaurant.
But if you want to eat Japanese dishes in huge cafeteria, here is the best place !",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,1,"The food was very good; the wait staff was excellent.  The restaurant manager made the whole experience disappointing and overall 1 star - perhaps even 0 stars.  
To sum up the horrible experience - My wife and I stopped in about 6:45 PM on Tuesday with no reservation.  The receptionist indicated that they could seat us, but they needed the table back at 8:30 PM.  We indicated no problem.
We told the waiter that we had a time limit, he assured us there would be no problem.  This was our first time at Zuma, and he wanted to make sure we enjoyed the meal and the service.  He also indicated we would have time for dessert.  This was all true.  We finished our meal by 8:00 PM and finished dessert well before 8:30 PM.  We asked for the bill, but then waited.  After about 20 minutes, one of the restaurant managers came to our table and indicated that their 8:30 reservation had arrived - politely expediting us.  What it did was infuriate us.  Why didn't she coordinate with the wait staff?  We had asked for our bill but were waiting for it.
After paying for the meal, I requested to speak with the restaurant manager.  First the reception manager, Agnes Moravecz apologized.  She indicated that it was all a mistake.  She offered her business card and told us she would help us with any reservations in the future.  She handled it well.  
I asked to speak with the restaurant manager.  The woman who expedited us came by and told us she was one of the managers.  She didn't offer her name or business card.  She didn't really listen to our complaint nor did she seem to care at all.  I told her that she really put us off and she seemed to become quite defensive and literally pushed us out the door.
We will not be visiting this place again.  Further, we will spread the word about what rotten management they have.
If you are looking for excellent Japanese food nearby, try Kurobuta or Nobu.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"For a sushi lover like me, I expect extremely good sushi if I know they're known for their sushi. The sushi at Zuma is good although my favourite at this place is their amazing popcorn! Don't know they prepare it, but I haven't tasted anything similar before! It's perfect as a little appetiser snack!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"This was my second visit to the acclaimed Japanese restaurant in Knightsbridge. 
There is a lot of energy to absorb, whether sitting at the tables or at the sushi bar, watching the art and science of the chefs, or being warmed by the robata. grill. 
I was by myself and was lucky enough to get a seat without to much of a wait, maybe because it was a Sunday evening
Of course you would expect excellent sushi and sashimi and you will not be 
disappointed.It
 is fresh and delicious as it is beautful to look at. I had the seared black cod wrapped in a leaf for my main and it was melt in your mouth wonderful. This is one place were you can really just take one slow bite at a time to savor the flavor. The other interesting thing here is the vast selections of sake, served warm or cold. The sake sommelier will help you match the right sake to your meal.
Finally, I will warn you this place in not inexpensive. While the atmosphere is casual and the dress is informal (but well heeled), the meal will soon add up. Also note that this is a favorite for athletes and celebrities, on my first visit the paparazzi were camped out front waiting for some footballers to leave.

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"The food is delicious and so is the service, but there is something missing, I don't really know what. Maybe a cozier atmosphere.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Brilliant Japanese cuisine with a great atmosphere and a fun bar with little need for reservation. 
Alternatively you can book to a private room where you get the amazing food complemented by a secluded room ideal for the family or a celebration of some sort.
Expensive food as to be expected in Knightsbridge area but the cost is met with brilliant tasting food.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"Good food. Good drinks. But if you prefer vegetarian options, skip this place. The Dubai Zuma has way better options.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"It is not easy to get a reservation (by telephone only), so, don't give up. Also, I found it a little hard to find at first, located nearby Harrods, tucked away in a mostly residential city block. 
This is another brilliant restaurant space designed by Japanese interior designer, Takashi Sugimoto (a.k.a., 'Super Potato'). Brilliant gastronomy, service, and design equals Zen, and then some at Zuma. Without question, my favourite Japanese restaurant in London.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,So yummy! The lobster sashimi was amazing! Atmosphere was really nice as well as some excellent service. Will recommend to everyone!,1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,1,"Simple enough: just a social place. You pay great price but get just above average food in return. Not worth it, if u want have good Japanese food, don't go here. I spent 90Â£ on 3 crapy dishes (lobster miso soup, Wagyu beef dumpling, fried squid) and 1 dessert(flourless chocolate cake with pear and ice cream). The sashimi was the only thing actually taste ok here. Also, the service is not good at all (especially those girls at the entrance, do they know how to smile and welcome guest?)",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Amazing Asian food.  Drinks are amazing, great vegetarian hot dishes and sushi. Also, a very fun place.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"Was super excited to try out this place on my visit to London. However, I was a bit disappointed when I got there. We were seated towards the very back facing a wall with an emergency exit. We asked if we can switch tables since there were 3 available tables in the front of the restaurant. Our waitress told us she would call the supervisor, but that never happened. She came back to us less than a minute later telling us that the tables have been taken up already, when clearly they were not. We did not get to enjoy the atmosphere of the place at all.. Also another thing that threw me off was that our waitress was speaking over our open bottle of water that we had ordered. She had stopped at another table before approaching ours and began speaking into the bottle as the cap was in her other hand. I honestly expected more from this place.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Wow! This place is hip and positively up beat! We got there at 10p on. Monday and the place is packed. Definitely make a reservation. We got in nevertheless but it was nail biting. We had the the skewers, some sashimi, some sea bass, seaweed salad, and off the menu dessert. All fantabulous! Great service from Ronan. Overall A+. We will definitely be back when we are in London. Our receptionist was accommodating ... I wanna give her a drink :-)",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,1,"This review is for the sushi and service at Zuma.  From reading other reviews, it's clear I should have ordered from the Robata grill.  Though, the service still leaves an incredible amount to be desired, considering the price point.
Let's start with the sushi.  At best, it's ""not bad.""  Typically, the sushi rice should be about room temperature to warm -- mine was cold, as if it had been in the fridge.  The fish should be chilled to cool, but mine was room temperature, as if it had been taken in and out of a cold area too many times in the evening that it was no longer cool or firm.  The botan ebi was mushy.  The toro was not marbled at all, and I'm confident at most places, they would simply call it tuna.  The sake (salmon) was ribbed and stringy. 
I also ordered soft shell crab.  It was good. Honestly, probably the best part of the meal, but the bar here is low. If you've had one fried softshell crab with a wasabi mayo, you've had them all.  They did not mess this up, and it was good. 
Now let's switch to the service -- three complaints -- 
1) The sushi bar was not full, is claimed to be first-come, first-serve, but they refused to seat me without making me wait for 30 minutes.  When they did seat me, they put us in two seats that had been empty the entire time I was at the cocktail bar.  I have no idea who they were saving them for since again, it's first-come, first-serve at the sushi bar. 
2) The waitress was very nice and took my order promptly, and the food came promptly, but it took multiple requests and a lot of waiting to get a bottle of still water. We were mostly through our softshell crab by the time a bottle of water finally arrived. I stopped short of going up to the cocktail bar to order my own.
3) At the end, the waitress brought the check, and had tacked on a ton of food and drinks I didn't order.  It was our check, but like it had been merged with someone else's.  When I pointed this out, she basically made me review my own check again, instead of realizing I hadn't ordered half the things on the bill.
In the end, go to Nobu if you want sushi. It's cheaper and the service and quality are substantially better, across repeat visits. I should come back and try the robata grill.  For the price (which is very expensive) and reputation of this place, none of the above should have happened or been tolerated.  One star.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Every time we attend Zuma, it's an amazing experience. We love the sesame and pepper steak, the sushi- you cannot go wrong, and the watermelon martini is the best in London. Make your reservation early, it's almost impossible to get a table without one. The ambiance is noisy on a weekend so when you make reservations for a romantic date, ask to be away from the and chefs area.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Zuma is somewhat hidden, but it's reputation clearly makes up for it's out of the way location. The place was packed at 6pm!
I like the atmosphere and the food is delicious and aesthetically pleasing. I ordered the Asian Cooler Cocktail, by recommendation of the bartender, l and absolutely loved it. My only issue was my order of sweet potatoes. They were undercooked and didn't have much teriyaki sauce at all. But I tired my friend's beef and it was to die for so maybe one of the chefs was just having an off day in the kitchen.
I would recommend Zuma to anyone looking for delicious food in Knightsbridge.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"One of the best Japanese restaurants in London by far. Staff is amazing, food to die for, menu is innovative and classy, good wine list, good cocktails, great atmosphere.",1

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"An unforgettable night was had here for a friend's ""hen do"". With her wedding approaching, we took her out for a girl's-only night of fun.
The food, service, drinks, everything  was absolutely incredible and impeccable. We were there for about 3.5 hours on a Wednesday night, and though the place was packed to the gills with people, not once did we feel rushed. We were allowed to sit and enjoy as long as we pleased, and were constantly looked after. No glass was left unfilled, no drink left empty, no dirty plates left to linger on the table. Every bite was a piece of heaven!
Absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend for a special night out or just to meet up with friends.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"My absolutely favourite! I love love Zuma. The atmosphere, the flavours everything about deserves 5 stars!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"One of my top 5 japanese restaurants in London.  It's expensive, but you totally get what you pay for. Generally need a reservation to eat here, they have private rooms (need 6 people to get one)  you feel like you have stepped into a fashion night club, quite noisy, low lighting, stunning decor and an upscale crowd.
The service was wonderful, pleasant and efficient even though it was a busy night, amazing wine & sake selection, the food was more than great,  chopped scallops with a wasabi dressing, the famous (Nobu's) Black Cod was excellent, Wagyu beef plate we had was absolutely tasty, juicy and most important, tender, the sashimi moriawase was standard + and the presentation totally top notch. 
Highly recommended",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"This a bit out of the way place has just amazing Japanese food. The outside of the building was quite unappealing, but once you get into the restaurant you will see they did a nice job of decorating.
The food is fresh and everything tastes delicate and decadent at the same time. I have never have had a bad experience here in terms of food quality or service. I have only eaten in the main dining area - I have never eaten at the bar.
Favorite Food:
-Wagyu Beef
-Rock Shrimp
-Black Cod (this and Nobu's are my favorites)
-Edamame (they don't overcook or undercook it - just the right amount of crispiness)
-Sushi and maki - All of it. Seriously the freshest sushi I have ever had in London 
I would also recommend having someone make a reservation a little a head of time.  
Now that I think about it, I like this branch over the Zuma's in Istanbul and Dubai. The staff doesn't have the attitude I saw more of in the other branches. Ex: The Dubai branch charged us a ton for ordering chili sauce and chilli pepper flakes because, as they put it, anything else you put on the food would ruin the quality of it. I totally get and understand the concept, but they should have told us they would charge us a hefty amount... eh, to each their own I guess.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"The food here is really, really, stupidly good.  There was basically nothing we ordered that wasn't absolutely top-qaulity in presentation and taste:  the black cod was as good as everyone says, I am still thinking about the steak tartare (seriously, I'll be back just for that), the fish was all top-quality, and even the dessert (green tea banana cake) was special.  Next time I'm in London, I'll be back.
So why only four stars?  Because the service was worse than awful.  I've been there twice at the sushi bar, and both times (different) servers seemed really irritated to have to bring people food, take orders, get drinks, etc.  Both nights (with different people) we were forgotten about for stretches of time, and both nights there were really odd pacing issues with the meal that didn't seem attributable to the pace of food from the kitchen.
So, while this place is worth a trip--the food is that good--the service keeps it from being among the very best of the best.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"Honestly the food was better at Nobu. The king crab legs, one of my favorites, were lackluster. That said, the scene is better here. The cocktails were awesome though. The Hentou (sp?) Sour was amazing.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"We were a party of 10 people, it was a Wednesday, and the joint was packed and in full swing. Our group didn't have to wait much to be seated (reserved for 7pm), and once we were there the army of attentive staff just kept it all coming with impressive efficiency.
Zuma is all about the 'family style' arrangement of food, and the host of our particular group did just that as he proceeded to order a large selection of dishes for everyone. Once the first platter arrived, it seemed to never end as we were brought plate after plate of beautifully presented and masterfully crafted seafood, fish, and meats. My glass never stayed more than half empty either which was comforting, as the sake (they have many to choose from) was a delight.
Since I didn't actually do the ordering I have no idea what the dishes are called but there were a few notable things you should look to try when you go.
-Chopped scallops with a wasabi dressing of some sort
-Black Cod (i'd heard of this in other reviews, and my god is it good)
-sweet corn tempura dish kind of looks like popcorn and is highly addictive.
-The sashimi is also top notch
The only thing that was slightly unpleasant was that we were effectively asked to make way for the next reservation toward the end. As far as I'm aware they give you some sort of warning beforehand about this, but after an enjoyable night with a hefty tab mounting it's not so nice to have to go stand at the crowded bar again when all you want to do is sit back a bit and carry on the conversation.
However, all that aside, Zuma was an experience I highly recommend and the food was really quite excellent. Go check it out.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"I know a lot of fellow Journalists love this place because of the diversity of food and - as the Lords who run my Journalistic Manor are kind when it comes to my expense account - I have eaten here on a number of occasions, but mainly because it appeals to the victim I have chosen to eat out with and pump for information. Therefore, working on the basis that the snitch is always right, until they spew out the goodies, I have been accommodating.
Would I choose to eat here by myself or with a friend? No!
Why? Well, to be very frank, the cuisine is not always constant. Whether the owners have a dose of 'Change the Chef often before he get's lazy' or whether that character is fickle, I have no idea. I haven't attempted to grill him to find out. I only take the bright lights to put in politicians eyes, besides, Chefs are usually already conditioned to heat.
I am presuming that the restaurant was named after Zuma Beach in Malibu, California and the owners have spent time there watching the Beach Babes and not enough time watching the staff - or perhaps too much time watching the staff nick the silver, because every time I have been there, I see new faces, but same type of menu. Which I should mention always looks superb on paper: asparagus tempura, crispy fried squid with green chilli, wagyu beef, black cod with miso, and sushi etc.
I am prepared to say, in defence of the place that anything that hasn't been well cooked is not usually my cup of Twinings, therefore, perhaps my comments could easily be put down to seeing too many people eat Sushi. Then again, being a person who likes consistency and good service, I do try to be objective. In that department I must say they really never came up to my standards. But, as I could say the same about Horror Films with giant crabs in them, you can swallow all my criticism with a light grain of salt.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"Consider this half of a review. I didn't eat at Zuma so I can't tell you about the food or food service. 
But as a lounge it has a swank decor, plenty of space, low lighting and an upscale crowd. This is the kind of place where you dress to be seen and while you're at it, take a look around yourself. 
It's definitely a good place to go for a pre- or post-dinner drink, especially if you want a sophisticated feel and large beverage choice. Not for the weak-in-the-wallet types.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"AMAZING SUSHI!! I was beginning to give up on sushi in London and this has redeemed my faith.  The sashimi small plates are INSANELY DELICIOUS!! The seaweed salad is some of the best I have ever had and even the tempura (which I only ordered because my friend wanted it) was unique and delicious! Our service was incredible, very helpful and great recommendations. I was there for lunch and can't wait to go back for dinner. A MUST try!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"I came at the ""wrong"" time on a Tuesday, I wanted to see the place while packed but I was shopping and decided to pop in for a quick glass of wine. I was still very pleasantly impressed. The doormen were also helpful while I looked for places during my monthly Knightsbridge visit. I will report back again on my second visit when I have time to experience the full ambiance.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,Love this restaurant. The idea of it is pretty cool but as a first timer it was quite confusing that all the food comes at different times. The concept is that everything is shared which is very unique. The desserts are AMAZING. The chocolate fondue is the best i have ever had.,1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Zuma opened in Knightsbridge in 2002. I was young(er) back then, but I knew amazing food when I tasted it. My opinion of Zuma has changed only slightly in the past decade, swayed by occasional visits here and there. Either the food has become even better, or my adult senses have developed more attuned receptors.
The restaurant bills itself as serving 'contemporary Japanese cuisine', but for some odd reason the place itself always reminds me of Africa. A weirdly jolting contrast to make, but for me that's a positive. The tables and chairs are all chunky light-coloured wood, the walls bear matching panels, there are green potted plants peppering the dining area and the base of the bar is formed from uncut stone, like an organic boulder of granite that grew naturally at the heart of Raphael Street. These rustic elements are juxtaposed with a lot of glass and the suave cosmopolitan clientele. It is hard to find a table here in the evenings, booking is definitely recommended, while at lunch time you may be asked to wait on busy days.
This was the case the other day, but we made it back to find the largest table in the place ready for the three of us. We weren't positioned in the main dining area, but from my seat I had a clear view of the kitchen, aromas and all.
We ordered the Crispy Fried Squid with Green Chili and Salt - hands down the best crispy fried squid I've ever had. Not only in taste and texture, but also in its consistent excellence (I always order it). The batter is light enough to taste the squid underneath and fine enough to form an irresistible crunch. The seasoning is sublime. It tasted so good but I was unsure about exactly which ingredient was doing all the flavoursome work. Upon asking the waiter, I was told that the fried squid is tossed with shichimi pepper, a Japanese mix of anything from red chilli pepper, Sichuan pepper, ground ginger, black and white sesame seeds and even roasted orange or Yuzu peel. A juicy squeeze of lime and I'm telling you it's perfect (we ordered a second round).
We also ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi in Ponzu Sauce with Crispy Garlic. The fish is soft and supple, while the flavours are strong and refreshing.
The Thinly Sliced Seabass with Yuzu, Truffle Oil and Salmon Roe was equally fantastic, with that distinctly appetising scent of truffle emanating from the plate as soon as it arrives to your table. Again, the fish is of the highest quality and so each piece melts in your mouth. Each slice is so delicate and dainty but altogether the dishes accumulate to ensure you are full in the nicest of ways.
An absolute favourite of mine is the Aubergine with Miso Paste, which probably pips Chutney Mary to the crown for best aubergine small dish in London. I will also definitely be re-ordering the new-ish Mackerel Roll wrapped in thin slices of cucumber for the delicacy and freshness of its ingredients. It's a roll without rice, which makes it lighter and more refined to taste, so that you really enjoy the soft mackerel meat and the contrasting crunch of the cucumber. It is served marinating in a dish of pickle juice, which adds a subtle tangy flavour. Such a fine and enjoyable dish.
Two other delicious rolls are the Dynamite Spider Roll and the Salmon and Avacado inside out roll. The former comes stuffed with tempura soft-shell crab and a dab of chilli mayonnaise on top, adding a luxury hint of creamy spice to the crispy interior - another must-have dish.
I haven't really come across a non must-have here, and I look forward to returning again and again over the next decade to sample even more of their dishes and try something from the Robata grill. Presentation, service, decor, food - it's all crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me. Zuma is the place to go to for exquisite food and a buzzing ambiance. Expect to have to book, to pay the price for the quality, the name and the location - then nothing can disappoint you. Just enjoy.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,2,This place is a bit pretentious and overpriced for the quality of food.  I remember being thoroughly disappointed by the food.  The place is great for the atmosphere and people watching.,-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"Dear London: if this is the best Japanese you have to offer, New York totally owns you in this category (as well as some joints in California as well). That's not to say that the food wasn't good here - it was definitely above average - but given the exorbitant cost of food here in the UK, you have to live up to some pretty high standards to make the cut...and I've been to places in NYC that cost less than half of what I paid tonight that was a better overall epicurean experience than this was.
We did the omakase because...well, you figure you're going to get the best the restaurant has to offer. Courses often came out two at a time, which was nice because it meant we weren't waiting for the food to come out. The first two courses were very delicious - tuna tartare on a rice cracker and the sea bass in truffle oil. The former is something that is very simple but works well, as most of the tuna tartare I have had is plain. This was lightly seasoned and had very thin cuts of scallion with it, adding a nice little twist. The truffle oil on the sea bass was a revelation (it's not something I've had anywhere else); the mushroom-infused marinade worked very well on the sea bass, and the side of ikura worked well to add a touch of saltiness to the platter. The other fantastic dish was the tempura-style langoustine with a vinegar-based dipping sauce. Regular tempura is akin to beer battered fried food, but this was done very lightly instead, with the crispiness looking more like fuzzy threads coming off of it...but it works because it doesn't dominate the dish and allows for the langoustine's flavor to come through. The black cod wrapped in banana leaves (or was it lotus?) was done well for a fairly standard Asian dish; I liked the accompanying citrus dip that took the edge off the heavily baked-in miso marinade.
That said, I took issue with a couple of the main dishes that were served: the wagyu beef and (very unfortunately, since this is crucial to a good restaurant) the sushi/sashimi combo. I've had amazing beef at shabu-shabu and cooked over a stone, and that is delicious. This beef was clearly cooked as a full filet and then subsequently cut up...as such, instead of all of the pieces being a tender medium-rare, a quarter of them (towards the ends, and even some in the middle) were closer to medium-well and well-done - definitely not the aspired result. The accompanying sauces were banal - a standard sesame-soy dipping sauce and a mayo-based dipping sauce that didn't have that needed kick. The sushi was disappointing because we got all of 2(!) pieces, and one of them (the yellowtail) was probably the worst quality I've had at a high-end Japanese shop. The other (a piece of aburi sushi) was absolutely delicious, which makes me wonder why there's so much inconsistency. The sashimi was equally inconsistent: the semi-fatty tuna was very good, and the mackarel was on the better end of what I usually get in this fish, but the rest was unmemorable: the sea bass was way too chewy, the salmon didn't have that fresh buttery taste or deep flavor you get from the truly fresh stuff, and the grouper (with some kind of vinegar jam on top) was bland. Bland ain't grand; it's forgettable.
Dessert was a bit on the large side (six dishes served in a huge bowl of ice; Zuma does like serving lots of its dishes on ice) and was a microcosm of the inconsistency of the main course. The best was the chocolate lava cake filled with chocolate caramel; this was absolutely delicious, with the caramel adding a nice layer of flavor to a dish that is usually chocolate on top of (and inside of chocolate). The banana cake with regular caramel was also quite tasty, although it tasted a little too much like banana bread with caramel syrup added to it. The coconut pudding with fresh fruit was tasty, but the problem here is that the consistency of the pudding was different: it was quite thin (almost liquid-like) at the top, but quite a bit more viscous at the bottom. As for the ice creams served, the vanilla was bland (I think someone forgot to add sugar or anything that would make it sweet), the green tea was green tea (i.e. unexciting without being paired with anything else, like red beans), and the coconut was the best, but the flavor of the fruit was muted (probably the same deal as with the vanilla).
Service was pretty decent, but for 96 pounds a person + 20%(!) tax + 15% 'optional' gratuity (why is it called optional when every place I've been to adds it automatically?) + 4 pounds for edamame (the most expensive edamame I've had, and not noticeably different at all) + 4.50 pounds for flat water(!!!), I could've spent the money better elsewhere. The food was alright, but if I did come back, I would save money by picking individual dishes instead of going with the tasting menu. Pick the dishes that are good, and not only will you not be disappointed, your wallet will feel better as well. That's what I call a win-win.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"This is one of London's most well-known restaurants and a favourite for work dinners, nestled off the main street of Knightsbridge and buzzing with a trendy bar and delicious modern Japanese plates meant for sharing. We ordered a selection of plates for 5 people, but didn't get sushi except for a sashimi platter and instead went heavy on the cooked meat. Some takeaways: the spicy edamame much better than plain edamame (wasn't too spicy, but very good flavour), the aubergine dish was quite nice, but the creamed spinach was missable. As for the seafood, the crispy fried squid was good but nothing spectacular, and same for prawn tempura, whilst the sashimi selection was very enjoyable and well presented.  And the meat was the highlight, especially the grilled pork skewer and the seared steak. The chicken wings were tasty but had very little meat, and a pain to eat because it's nearly impossible to eat with chopsticks. I also had a watermelon martini that they are famous for, and I highly recommend it. The service was mediocre, as we had to ask a number of times to get forks, initial drinks, and drink refills. But overall a great experience and I completely understand its continued popularity.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Oh my word. 
So, a little bit of context. We were in town for a few days and, being Japanese and having lived in the Middle East for far too long, I really wanted good Japanese food. We scoured Yelp reviews, TripAdvisor reviews, Time Out reviews for hours until I saw a couple of Asian reviews for Zuma and figured ok, let's give this one a shot (I'm sorry, white folks, I love you but you don't know sh*t about Japanese food). 
In fact, we vetted Zuma for so long that we timed ourselves right out of a reservation! Our concierge mentioned that we might be able to get a seat at the sushi bar if we went at around 7 pm, so what did we do? We waltzed in at 9 pm on a Saturday night. Well, long story short, although they told us we could get a seat at 10:45 (at which point we had a brief and intense discussion about how badly we wanted this food; conclusion: pretty badly), we went for drinks, came back, and got seats promptly at 10. Not bad. 
We had a hilarious waiter, who was not shy about telling us exactly what we should order. In most cases, we took his suggestion, and were not sorry that we did. In our normal ridiculous fashion, we ordered a ton of food:
Thinly sliced hamachi (like carpaccio) with green chili and garlic
Seared tuna with chili daikon and ponzu
Sea bream, chu toro (semi-fatty tuna), salmon sashimi
Wagyu sushi (let me just take a moment to add that my boyfriend was talking to me as I put the first bite in my mouth, and had to stop for a full two minutes because I was definitely no longer paying attention--this is easily one of the best things I've ever had)
Unagi nigiri
Lobster sashimi (oh lord, so good)
Grilled jumbo tiger prawns (when this came to the table, it was so large I thought it was the lobster)
Roast lobster (this was actually a mistake; the waiter heard roast and we meant raw, but we took it anyway. Very good but a tiny bit too heavily spiced)
And then, when I thought I could take no more, they came with a plate of chicken yakitori on the house--I actually begged them not to give it to us because I was so full, but they put it in front of me and of course I ate it. After, the waiter blessedly came by with some green tea, winked at me, and said, ""Good for digestion."" Good thing he did, because I might not have been able to walk out of there.
No, it's not Japan. The fish, while incredibly, unbelievably fresh, is still not as good as what you can get in Japan. But that's like saying that you don't like your Riedel wine glass because it's not the holy grail. 
Next time, I'd like to try the tempura, which looked slightly too heavy on the batter but otherwise good and some of the other grill dishes. We will definitely be going back. Oh, and one other thing: they have fresh wasabi. That's an automatic win in my book.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"I love places with a clean kitchen and clean bathrooms! 
If you dont want to spend money shopping in Knightsbridge, go to Zuma and some some money there.... 
I think Roka (sister restaurant) is a bit sexier, plus it has that posh bar downstairs. The food is definantly a bit better at Zuma though. Love the small plats place where you can eat a bit of everything, especially when everything is yummy. I didn't have any think I didn't like, great ingredients, cooked well, enjoyable....

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Ok, so I came back two times already. 
With the grill finally working, I must say, I absolutely loved the grill! You can watch the chef  grill skewers as you eat, so it's a posh, fun atmosphere.

First you will be blown away by the Japanese decor which transports you to another world and many moons from busy London, so relaxing.
I ordered the tori no tabasaki which is basically chicken wings but flavoured with lime - delicious. I followed this with wagyu no sumibiyaki (elegantly presented flavoured beef). I washed this down with my usual warm Saki, I always end up drinking too much of this stuff.
I really fancied the banana cake but was full from my main. Next time I will definitely save space for cake.

 Zuma is a restaurant for special occasions. It is part of a small world wide chain with subsidiaries in Hong kong, Istanbul, Miami and Dubai. You might be able to get away with a semi-affordable bill when ordering carefully, but in the end you will want to splash out. Zuma invites to decadence and gluttony, and at this night, for my birthday, I was part of it.
 In London, Zuma is located in a very ugly building not far from Knightsbridge tube station and doesn't look like much from the outside. When you enter it however, you feel like you have stepped into a night club or into one of these bars I never go to because I refuse to pay 15 pounds for a cocktail and I usually don't confirm with the dress code.
 Surrounded by the young, rich and stylish I was glad I had dressed up for this special occasion feeling like a real Chelsea girl, wearing something rather short together with very high heels in the form of my almost virgin golden Sergio Rossi stilettos. Sipping my Saffron and Poppy Seed Martini (10.50) I was waiting to be spoiled.
 I really liked Zuma, in fact I liked it about 1 million times more than the only other posh Japanese restaurant I have been to in London, Nobu Berkley Square.
 LIKE
 1. Lovely staff: Even though we didn't have a reservation the lovely people at the counter found us a place at the sushi bar within 10 minutes. Friendly and forthcoming they had nothing in common with the pretentious waiters at Nobu.
2. The menu: I liked the fact that in addition to some astronomically priced dishes they do have a good selection of dishes costing less than 10 pounds.
3. The wine: There are also quite some wines for under 20 pounds, which allows you to maybe order a couple of dishes more
4. The food (see below) was sublime. I loved the fresh and exquisite ingredients, the exotic and well-balanced sauces and the inventive take on Japanese food without losing the traditional touch.
 DISLIKE
 1. I really wanted some cold sake to go with my Japanese delicacies, but they were out of the two cheapest sakes! (19Â£ and 29Â£ respectively for 300 ml). We did not go with the next expensive one (40Â£) but had wine instead. Wanted sake though!
 2. The Sushi Counter: the person who designed this should lose his/her licence really. The broad stone surface gives you plenty of space for all your plates but underneath  this is a completely different story. Even I with my 5.3 ft had no idea what to do with my legs. Not only was there absolutely no space, the inside surface of the counter was ragged, which not only destroys stockings but also hurts! This reminded me of the story that I once heard about McDonalds, where they intentionally use tilted chairs so that the customer does not feel to comfortable and doesn't want to linger. I wonder if similar incentives were in the mind also of the people behind the Zuma interior design?
3. Why don't they put prices on their website? I really don't like this, people should know what they are in for. And while I'm at it, did I mention that I HATE websites with music?
 Anyway, the most important thing is the food, here we go:
 Suzuki no osashimi (12.60)  thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, salmon roe and truffle oil  one of my favourite dishes
 Tokodai wafu asperagasu (5.80)  beautiful fresh and with delicious wafu sauce and sesame on top.
 Shitaki Mushrooms (4.80)  tender and garlicky this was a rather generous portion for not quite 5 pounds.
 Chicken Yakitori (5.80)
 Yellow Tail sashimi (8.00)  boring compared to the other dishes.
 Unagi Nigri (8.80) however, was all the better.
 Aubergine (8.60) something
 Inaniwa Langustine Noodles (14.80)  this was one of the specials, the chilled noodles with the sweet langoustine and the ripe mango were very pleasant indeed.
 Wagyu Beef Sushi with Black Truffle (27.50)  loved the raw beef melting in my mouth together with the subtle truffle flavour. Expensive but worth it :)
 Banana and Green Tea Cake with Peanut Toffee Sauce and coconut ice cream (8.80)  weird combination but worked somehow. While I didn't pick up the green tea flavour, the soft and juice banana cake was all the better with the sweet and salty peanuts.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"One of my top 5 restaurants in London.

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Zuma is not a place for a casual meal.
Zuma is not your average sushi-carousel lunch joint.
Zuma is a lean, mean, dining machine.
And you know all this because Zuma's still there after many years of business.  Although I used to not fully understand why sushi has to be so expensive, Zuma changed all that (along with Gari in NYC) by showing me that eating sushi is an experience.  Try the unique, off-the-wall items and soak in the atmosphere.  Last time I was there, the service was pleasant and efficient even though it was a busy night (even with reservations, we had to wait for our table -- of course, this may be because we were late...we may or may not have gotten lost) but relax.  They take good care of you.  So come, eat lots of amazing food, and walk away happy.
I cannot wait to try Zuma again.",1

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Zuma is one of my all time favorite upscale sushi chains. With a presence in most major international cities its a go to when traveling and craving sushi in a upscale setting. I prefer Zuma over Nobu, Bond St, and Blue Ribbon three of the other most recognized upscale sushi chains. This location is very busy so make sure you make a booking in advance, we went on a tuesday night and were able to squeeze into a couple bar seats after ordering a few items and bottles of saki while standing. The service is great as expected from a restaurant of this caliber. 4.5 for the food and 5 stars for the scene. Many celebrities frequent this place so you never know who you will run into. Great fresh sushi, the lobster was also fantastic and the saki list was impressive. If they have butterfish available that is a must try!  Zuma deserts are also always a must!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Without a doubt, pretty amazing.  You walk and and you just want to hate the place - it looks too trendy for it's own good and you'd often find yourself tripping over a Ferrari or two parked out in front.     But the food revives it and begs you to come back for more.
You need to get a few things out of the way first:  It's going to be so loud that you'll struggle hearing people at your table.  It's going to be so busy that you're going to fight to walk to the loo and you probably won't get seated on a Tuesday without a booking.  The portions are not going to be big.  And you're going to pay.   But it's worth it.
To die for:  Spicy Lobster, Wagyu Beef and the lamb chops.  Probably the best prawn tempura sushi roll I've ever had.  Anything from the robata grill is cooked perfectly and simply flavorful.
Hint:  Escape a bit from the massive crowds and book a private room in the back, which is slightly separated with perforated wooden blocks.  But you'll have to take your shoes off before you sit...",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"I think I've made my view on sushi in London clear.  You can't get good sushi without going to one of the fancy places: Nobu, Nozomi, Roka.  Add Zuma to that list.  
Finally made it to Zuma after living in London for year.  Don't have any ""pull"" so had to book a few weeks in advance.  8pm on a Wednesday and was very busy, with not even a place around to bar to stand.  Wasn't seated til around 8:20 which didn't bother me but it's something to note.  
I'll start with the meal: I was craving sushi rolls so ordered a dynamite spider roll and a spicy tuna roll. Both were exactly what I wanted and were far above average for sushi rolls.  Next we ordered sweet potato with teriyaki but wouldn't order it again.  Next up was beef tenderloin with sesame and it was excellent. Can't remember the rest of my order but I was very happy with the food and would go back for it.
Now I'll get to the clientele of this restaurant.  It was a mix of businessmen, and old men with young women.  Basically, don't go to this restaurant with anyone ultra-conservative (although I wouldn't really expect them to want to go anyway). The ambience was quite nice though, dimly lit and not too too loud to chat (although I suspect the noise level would increase on the weekend)
So all in all, I wouldn't say that Zuma stands out as any better than the other high end sushi places.  But if you've gotta pay a certain price for good sushi, you might as well as this to the list.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"This place is Knightsbridge at its best!
The food is delicious and unique. Yes, it's expensive, but you totally get what you pay for here. I've been here for lunch with a group (we dined in one of the back private rooms, which was a great, personalized experience) and for a date (we dined in the main restaurant, which is louder and busier but has a great vibe). Go for sushi and lots of it - don't bother with much of anything else because the sushi is just that good!
The bar is also awesome. I've been here for just drinks and it's a great time. The barmaids are attentive and make excellent cocktails. Plus, there is a good selection of wines by the glass. 
A few notes:
- You generally need a reservation here, so make one!
- The bar closes pretty early (before midnight if I remember correctly) so get there early and head out afterwards
- Get a private room if you are 6 people or more - totally worth it!!",1

If sitting at the bar please try their take on popcorn made of tempura and sweet corn (it was wonderful). We had the tasting menu and it was amazing. A bit too much food but the sushi was incredible and every dish was interest. I would place this place above Nobu in NY when Nobu was at its height. It is expensive so be prepared to spend.",1

ps. great people watching. yourself included.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Best fish in London!! I really enjoyed it. I think they could upgrade the style of furniture. If you look for clebrities, that's the place to go. Pricey but worth it",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"This place was amazing! One of the tops restaurant I've ever been to for sushi in London..  Atmosphere was great.  Waiter/waitress are very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and will offer their opinion.  I like that ^_-.  Beats going to some restaurant where  when asked what's good here will say ""everything""? or "" I don't know"" and they always have this stupid look on their face when doing so.  Sake was good.  I especially liked the Edamame.  Edamame was seasoned with this special sauce that just was so good!
I give this place 5 Stars! and I would definitely go back again.  In fact i'm planning on returning sometime later this week. but this time with reservations!  you should make reservations in advance or you might have to wait for at least half an hour and will be seated at the grill area.   Which can be a bit hotter.  If you prefer to be in a  warmer environment then fine but if your body temperature is normally hot maybe booking reservations in advance is the way to go or you will get seated at the grill area-Just a heads up**",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"FABULOUS sushi and Japanese fushion food. 
I came here with 5 other friends for lunch and had a fabulous meal. We all had some cocktails, which were delicious, then ordered a lot of food to share. The sushi was to die for, some of the best I've ever had in London or New York. I also enjoyed the variety of interesting dishes on the menu. The popped corn was not to be missed - it's basically corn kernels tempuraed and served with salt. 
The service was wonderful, as to be expected in a restaurant of this calibre. 
Lots of ladies who lunch and well dressed international business types. Quite pricey, as to be expected. Lunch (with a few drinks each) set each of us back about Â£100.
I'm a fan.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"I love Zuma.  I have been there a few times and I have loved every dish and every cocktail I've tried.  I don't love the prices so much, nor the 19-year old prostitutes who hang out at the bar, or for that matter the man receiving a blow job in the ladies bathroom last night, but all-in-all, gotta love Zuma.
The Saffron and Poppy Cocktail is to die for, as is the Rubabu which is rhubarb-infused sake with vodka and passion fruit.  The cocktail with Johnny Walker is also fab.  I would go there just for the salmon and tuna tartar and the drinks, but order as you wish!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,The Japanese cuisine is kind of a new passion for me. I'm keen on exploring the new exciting and appealing taste of the meals.

Go.  Enjoy.  Bravo!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Zuma is a very, repeat very nice place for an enjoyable evening
Place is crowded when we got there around 9pm and despite having a reservation need to wait a little while.
Bar / lounge scene is worth it just for that.  Definitely a see and be seen scene.  Great decor, music.  More on this later.
But first we had a private dining room, which was very nice.  Great service.  Our waiter made some great recommendations and generally helped us out.  We got the sake sommelier to hook us up with some nice sake.
We started with some sushi, fresh and very nice.
We had a number of the grilled items for sharing: seabass, squid, several beef dishes, chicken, tofu, vegetables, etc.  All were spectacular.  I especially liked the chicken - very tasty, although done a little rare as is common with Japanese places.
We split the chocolate desert and the banana cake.  Both were outstanding.
So after dinner we met some friends in the bar/lounge area and just hung for awhile.  Lots of fun, nice place.  Too bad they close up a little early.
All in all I add Zuma as a must go to place in London.  I love Japanese food and this place has a great take on modern Japanese in a fun atmosphere.",1

I give four stars because of its creativity of the menu.

If you like Sake, try Zuma's cocktail with Sake. I think it's quiet unique.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Zuma is a hot and chic spot in Knightsbridge. It's definitely pricey but;
- Great food and drinks
- Sushi and sakes are great. They've 40 different sakes in the menu. 
- Service is excellent
- Dress code is, 'dress to impress'
I highly recommend trying the black cod!! It's a must. Also try unagi bo zushi!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"I REALLY wish I could give this place 5 stars. The sushi and sake are to die for. But, the only setback was how incredibly rude the hostess/ ""person that sits at the front desk"" was!
So it was raining VERY hard the night that I came here. Our hotel was just a block away so we thought we could make it without getting too wet. We were wrong. So we came in with wet jackets and slightly wet hair. We didn't look gross, though. (God forbid we wreck their scene of ""hot' people) We just looked like we got caught in the rain.
So as soon as we got in, the beautiful, blonde, hostess sneered at us sarcastically saying, ""May I help you?"". We had reservations, of course, so we told her our information and she reluctantly searched for our reservations. After about 3 minutes she found our reservations, looking annoyed that she even found them. She then said, ""You guys should get rid of those wet jackets..."" and paused. After 5 seconds of awkward silence she sighed and said, annoyed, ""I can take them..."".
At that point I wanted to shout dramatically, ""Do you know who we are?!?"". I didn't, of course. I guess I came in with a sour attitude to start with because of the crazy weather, but still!
Other than that small incident, our waiter was amazingly friendly  and the owner of the restaurant even stopped by our table to see if we were enjoying our sake.
To make a long story short, I would definitely come here again, despite the bi*chy host. :)",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Oishi!  I was in London for fun, and this was a fun, super-hip place to eat.  The sushi was very good and the scene was great.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"I recently went out on a date to this restaurant. I'd heard of Zuma mainly through magazines where celebs had been spotted.
 On entry the interior is modern/plush and there is a bar section to the right, where apparently lots of hot women go to snag a wealthy man - you men are soo lucky :-)
 My date knew the owner as a friend, so he managed to get seats in the section where the cooks are opposite cooking. I wasn't too sure whether I would like the food, but boy was it amazing! I had crab and spinach for starters, steak (small pieces) and black cod (you have to try this), finished off with warm chocolate cake and icecream - heaven!
 The service was excellent as the woman who served us was very friendly/approachable. Zuma is probably the best place I've tried so far. It is expensive but a very fashionable/trendy place and definitely worth a visit...",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"What an amazing place... the decor is stunning and the food is incredible.
You do pay quite a lot- but it worth it. The only thing I did not find that great were the desserts.

Great sushi and tempura, and then the black cod and wagyu beef are their specialties. The bar is excellent as well - recommend the Passion Bellini or Watermelon Martinis.
Be sure to book at least 3 or 4 weeks in advance for a weekend, and beware that you'll get moved in and out of the restaurant pretty quickly - staying for longer than 2 hours is difficult.  You also pay for what you get, but well worth a viist.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"This place was recommended by my trusty concierge at the hotel. He was able to secure a table for us at the last minute. 
When we walked in and saw the decor and the kitchen area, I was a bit worried - it looked like a typical fusion place where they make anything from sushi to teppan-yaki, yaki-tori, with no specialization. 
But as soon as we got food, my fear disappeared. Wagyu beef plate we had was absolutely amazing - so tasty, juicy, and tender. Our server was a Japanese girl and she knew very well about what the restaurant offered. She was fantastic.  After a bunch of yummy dishes we had, I wanted to have some typical closing items in Japanese meal - steamed rice, pickled vegetables (tsukemono), and miso soup. 
Although the menu did not have pickled vegetable, our server managed to get some for us (was good, too). Along with hot green tea, I was a happy camper. 
After all, I would give them:
Food: 5, Decor: 5, and Service: 5+",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Totally worth a visit. Food was delicious. The lobster was amazing! So was a sushi roll they were experimenting with. Don't remember the name but it was glash fried beef carpaccio or something. You need reservations. The place is crowded all night, every night.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"After a bit of a random disorganised day, two friends and I hung our heads as Harrod's closed in front of us, withdrawing all hopes of a hot chocolate on a cold winter afternoon. Stocking up on some emergency supplies (caramelised popcorn for one, sausage roll for another) which we devoured, I brought up none other than the qype app on my iPhone (possibly one of the best things about the iToy!), to look for some emergency sustenance and prepare the foundations of plan B, since plan A (hot chocolate at Harrod's) had failed miserably. In the nearby listings, something crept up to the top. It had 5 stars. Out of 5. This was the average from 35 reviews. I figured Hey, this has got to be good! And proposed it to the boys. A few seconds of umms and errs quickly morphed to us all walking over round the small lancelot street to get to raphael street where Zuma hides. As we turned the corner, it looked like we might have gotten lost in an alley. Then we got to the doorway. Golden light streaked out, warming the stone that lined the walls. We walked into the warmth, spotting the beautiful hostesses who were welcoming despite our lack of reservation. We could be seated at 20:00, she said. It was 18:30. I turned to my friends and explained (in french) we'd have to wait for an hour and a half. We all shrugged. And raised eyebrows when the hostess continued our conversation in fluent French. A nice touch. We spent a very happy hour and a half at the rather crowded bar, where we watched lovely waiters handle bottles in ways you didn't think bottles could be handled, pouring double or triple beers one-handed, and generally shaking and stirring things up like nobody's business. I had a kiwi bellini. I think. Not that it matters. It was delicious, layered in flavours, and generally to be had again, and again, and again. Well, maybe one again short of that, given the Â£12 price tag At 20:00 sharp (I was very impressed with the timeliness) we were seated. Mesmerised by the sushi masters, it took us a while before we opened the menus and drooled over the contents. Ordering was quick and painless, the food arriving incredibly quickly. We shared all dishes, being mediterranean. And frankly it's the style of the place. Every single one of them was SO delicious! A complete symphony. The sweet, the tangy, the spicy, the crunchy, the smooth melt-in-your-mouth salmon teriyaki, crunchy spicy fresh and perfect calamari. So perfect, in fact, we ordered another later on and when the kitchen somehow lost track and made a third, our waiter brought it to us, laughing, saying he was sure we'd appreciate it more than anyone else. We did. We SO did! At the end, you had to roll us out from the food we ate. And we had wine. Given our bill came in at under Â£100 for each of us, with the wine, and we were quite stuffed with the most delicious food we had every had (well, the best seafood, that's for sure), we thought it was an absolute bargain! We'd all go again at the drop of a hat, should anyone find a good enough excuse. Or a poor one. Any excuse, really. I just want to have my eyes roll back and my mouth be stunned at the delicious melting softness of that salmon teriyaki. Truly. You have GOT to eat there. Even if all you can afford is one dish. It'll be the best thing you ever had. I promise.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,2,"This place was a disaster!  I was looking forward to a posh sushi fusion lunch with friends celebrating a birthday.  The first server was aloof--it only took 20 minutes to get my drink ordered.  And from then on it was like trying to hail down a black cab at rush hour in the City on a rainy day--waving them down to take our food order because we only had the table for a limited time, hailing them to refill empty wine and water glasses--it was exhausting.  When the food did come out they plopped it down wherever they pleased and people had ordered specific dishes so we were passing plates to and fro.  Not to mention when they did bother to place a soup with the right person that they basically reached in front of someone to set it down.  
But it wasn't just a problem with the service--it was a problem with the kitchen too.  I ordered a salad with asparagus.  Well, it came without the asparagus--so again had to hail them down and with my chopsticks toss my salad to show them there was no asparagus!  
My friend who had been there many times complained to the front of the house and we had a free dessert.  
The food was good--the aubergine was quite memorable, but the experience was so bad it left a sour taste in our mouths.  
Oh, and not to mention they put an extra pound on the bill to give to the charity of their choosing.  WTF?
It was also weird how many young kids were there on a Sunday, which also was a mega buzz kill.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"This place is absolutely amazing. I've been a total of four times and never been disappointed. 
I could go on all day about what to eat, but I've never really had anything bad there. A few winners, however, are the Black Cod, which is absolutely incredible as well as the Wagyu Beef, which is also perfectly seasoned and so juicy. 
The massive tropical fruit dish at the end is also a winner for dessert and is a perfect way to cleanse the pallet. The decor is awesome and the waiters and chefs have always been fantastic to me when I've been there. 
I've heard getting a table here is a bit hard. I've been lucky enough to always go with footballers, which means instant service and great treatment. If it means anything and shows how much they care, Cesc Fabregas, Philippe Senderos, and I all went in one day for an unplanned lunch and, despite the restaurant being completely full, managed to put a table together for us. Service with a smile...",1

We tried a range of things on the menu and everything was amazing (even the mysterious looking fresh tofu), but the showstopper of the night was the marinated black cod.  Also, all of the beef dishes were incredible.  Too bad the service was poor and the hostess a little rude (this was partially our fault, as we were late for our reservation - even so, the scolding we received was a poor start to the evening).

The sheer amount of waiting staff is amazing especially when you find it a struggle to get any attention from anyone during the meal!
In my experience the weekends are terrible for the food as it becomes a total mess. You can also come across attitude from the door reception which is shocking considering the sushi bar has a no reservations policy.
Very expensive to take the gamble especially considering the higher standard of  london restaurants for the same price (and indeed much cheaper).
A see and be seen restaurant rather than a culinary revelation.",-1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"5.30 I arrive from work. Sitting at the bar with a girlfriend, drinking the amazing rhubabu (rhubarb, passionfruit, sake cocktail) Over the next 2hrs, a steady stream of 'working girls', clearly of eastern european origin, arrive and leech onto the first sad soul who will give them the time of day (and a drink) They're easy to spot- usually two come in together, buy one glass of sauvignon blanc to share, and then find a man. Usually old and fat, or young rich and socially inept.
 Possibly the most amusing place for pre-dinner drinks anywhere in London.
 Dinner is best at the grill bar- often a little too hot for comfort, but way better atmosphere, and cosier, than the dining tables. The salmon and tuna tartares are divine, as is miso black cod. Actually pretty much everything i have ever had here is lovely... As you would expect being in the heart of knightsbridge, it is not cheap, but I think money well spent.",1

Very accomodating staff members, and always there when you really need them.
The sushi culinary chefs are fantastic simply serve the finest sea food. I've encouraged this eating house to quite a few, many folks and none of them happen to be unhappy!!",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"The quality of food at this fashionable and very popular high class Japanese restaurant is indeed brilliant. Zuma offers traditional Japanese dishes with a modern take on them like various sushi, sashimi and tempura, as well as some exclusive specialties such as black cod, wagye beef and foie gras, all prepared to an exceptional standard.
 Judging by the food, it's certainly one of the best Japanese restaurants in London. The only drawback is that it's very noisy. There are lots of people crowded around the bar in the evening and, needless to say, the lounge and the dining hall are always full. Overall, this place has a club-like atmosphere. There were six of us at the table and I could barely hear the person next to me, not to mention those on the other side.
 It's probably a great place to start a big night out, but if you're looking for something calmer, Miyama or Shogun, or even Nobu and Matsuri, are perhaps better choices.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"When my friend told me we were unable to get a reservation at Zuma, I was crushed. But here's the catch, there's sushi bar/counter seating! 
It was Thursday night, fairly packed (with the pretty people), but getting late for a London restaurant, probably around 9pm. We gave our names for the sushi bar and they said it could be up to a half hour wait. We decided to give it a shot and hung out at the bar. We immediately noticed three or four empty counter seats, but didn't say anything. Sure enough, within ten minutes, we were sat. Weird, right? I'm still not sure what the hell went on there. 
The counter was beautiful and had a great view of the grill. Our waiter was super friendly but I think partly because he was gay, and within minutes figured out my friend was as well and proceeded to flirt with him. The service still wasn't amazing. It became too personal and forgetting my drink isn't okay just because you're too busy batting your eyelashes at my bestie. 
The food was small and overpriced, but delicious. We only ordered apps/small plates. What stood out was the hamachi sashimi, pork skewers, soft shell crab and the giant grilled prawn. The sauces which come with the grilled pork and soft shell crab were amazing. The grilled prawn was just good, but cool because it was so big! For dessert we had a delicious green tea and banana cake. Very yummy!

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"Oh dear, I'm going to get shouted at by all the other reviewers who have given Zuma such rave reviews. I think this place is awful - but I don't want to score them lower than 3 stars as there's no reason why someone like me (not a professional food critic) should affect their overall rating. And after all, not all the other people can be wrong about Zuma, I perhaps just had a one-off, awful experience....
 So, in my opinion: Where Roka is fun, buzzy and serves incredible food and good portions, Zuma is a too-packed, too-noisy, too-huge hanger of a restaurant serving tiny portions of (imho) sometimes quite poor food.
 The sommelier is one of the most patronising I've met, who clearly thought 2 women were incapable of choosing their own wine. Don't get me wrong, I like to be helped and guided, but I don't like to be told 'Sauvignon blanc is awful, I'll give you something you'll like' as he snatched the menu away from us and flew off to patronise the 300 other diners packed like sardines alongside us.
 And as for the loos....not sure how to write about those, but anyone else got any comments on the 'clientele' and goings-on in the loos?!
 I really wanted to love Zuma, but I didn't. But I've been back to Roka twice now, so this moany old bag will shut up about Zuma and spend my pennies at Roka instead.",-1

Out of the dishes we ordered, the black cod was (imo) the most unique in terms of taste.  I don't know if I would give a place like this two Michelin stars (I was told it had two) because while the dishes were interesting & the presentation very well done, no dishes really stood out to me besides the black cod.  Honestly, my old neighborhood sushi place in SF had more choices of fish (and amazing quality as well).  Maybe one Michelin :D ?

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"Where to start? I walked in and expected to not get seated because the front bar area was packed; however, a very nice hostess checked the sushi bar for me and I was seated immediately. 
It was mesmerizing to watch the sushi chefs and I was fortunate to be seated right in front of the head sushi chef.  There was also a woman working behind the sushi bar, and that was really cool to see. It was fun to watch this chef, because he had such a precise rhythm to his work and you could tell that he was really into it.  
It's so hard to say - which was better - the food, or the service?  The waitress that worked the sushi bar was so great!  She was extremely kind and very knowledgable about all of the items on the menu.  She helped me with my choices and told me that I made excellent decisions - one of which was the Wagyu Beef Tataki. It came somewhat covered/sprinkled with scallions, which I hate, but I simply pushed them aside. I was informed by another server that they made the cooks re-do the dish because it wasn't done properly the first time.
I got a 6-piece chef's choice sushi. The head chef prepared it and I must say, it was delicious.  This was the first time I noticed a distinct ""flavour"" to the sushi, where usually you just know that there is raw fish and seasoned rice. But this was different - the fish *tasted* really good and the rice was done really well, which is very important, in my book.
I think you will just have to go there yourself to experience it - it's quite hard to explain!

The experience was nothing less than perfect in every way: food, service, ambience and the total dining gestalt. WOW- this was the best spent money for the most outrageously delicious meal that indulged every taste bud and visual experience. I highly recommend making a reservation as quickly as possible for the luxurious and elegantly beautiful. The service was perfect, the choices for each of the courses were magnificent. My meal at ZUMA definitely takes a top billing in my many gistatory experiences.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"Zuma is the best Japanese restaurant where I have ever been I went there one time, it was full and I had to eat in the entry but the quality of the food and the busy atmosphere of this place are unforgettable.

japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"I headed to Zuma on Friday night and thought it was fabulous. It does have quite a nightclub atmosphere (this may be different during the day) with heaps of people clustered around the bar, but the food was all brilliantly executed and the cocktails were fabulous which scores them big points in my books. If I went again I would try and get a seat in front of the Robata Grill as it was fascinating to watch all the chefs at work.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,My favourite restaurant in the world! Great lively atmosphere and amazing food! The sparkling sake is amazing and the lobster too!,1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,4,"My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to be treated to a meal here by my generous boss. He eats here nearly every night of the week when he is in town so he ordered for us. The stuffed king prawn was absolutely mental, I still have dreams about it now and the wagyu steak is a MUST have - cant believe food can taste this good! We also had the pleasure of trying the sole and some other dishes I cant remember now but it was all amazing. Of course this place is really mega expensive and we didnt pay (our meal for 3 with wine was Â£400) but if you want to treat yourself you will not be disppointed and you will enjoy the ambiance the service and of course the incredible food.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,5,"A fantastic restaurant with a great buzzy atmosphere. The bar area isn't very separate though so when you're sat down you can still see people stood around drinking. Maybe the area is a bit more separate when the place isn't quite so busy. It's not really a problem though and you may get a table right at the other side. The food was gorgeous, though my favourite Japanese dish - black cod - was no where to be seen back when I visited. (They do have it on the menu now though.) The salads are gorgeous - a real taste explosion in the mouth. You can also have more of an informal meal and sit round the grill. Service was good.",1
japanese,4c4AG8gZ73-qHLzaWk-pRA,Zuma,3,"I love this restaurant. The quality of food is excellent, and the price is fairly reasonable for it's quality. We had shasimi, sushi, and also tepanyaki. It's a night to remember.",-1

Ayako, my wife loves it for the truly excellent modern Japanese food (generously overlooking the fact that the chef is German) while our daughter loves it for its high-class buzz and celebrity pulling-power (Russell Crowe et al). Service is exemplary; the waiters are brilliant at explaining the frankly rather complicated menu and recommending dishes - so that you end up with a smooth and seemingly endless feast that has to include: asparagus tempura, crispy fried squid with green chilli, mouthwatering wagyu beef, black cod with miso, superb sushi and sashimi (very unusual in London) and anything with wasabi mayonnaise. Everything should be shared and is, except, unfortunately, the bill. The wine list is long on spicy or smoky wines that go well with Japanese food, like the Franz Haas Traminer from Alto Adige. The sofa seating behind the bar is a good place to chose to eat and watch the parade of London's fashionable young things",1

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Misato is easy to miss from the street, but it'd be a shame if you did! In a city where large, comforting portions in a thoroughly unpretentious setting can be hard to find, Misato is a breath of fresh soup. They have a large menu with udons, curries, katsus, tempuras, udons with katsu and curry in it, you get the idea. 
Here's what you should do. Come hungry, with cash, and be prepared to wait for just a short while, maybe 15 minutes. There are many tables and they move quickly but it is very popular, for good reason! Order some tempura for the table and crack open an Asahi Super Dry, or a ramune for the kids. Then enjoy your plate of crispy katsu drowned in curry, or your hearty bowl of udon or soba. Leave with a full belly and satisfied grin.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Honest review from going to this place for over 6 years.
Food:
The is generally quite enjoyable with a good variety of Japanese style dishes, although the authenticity of the restaurant I wouldn't say is high, some dishes have their own more unique taste, rather than authenticity Japanese. I suggest dishes with teriyaki sauce, although abit sweet. Ramen/Udon dishes are also a solid option, the sushi tends to be abit dry but overall good. Quite cheap, dishes costing generally Â£4.50-Â£7 for mains, Â£2-Â£5 for sides.
Atmosphere/Facilities:
The restaurant is often quite busy, more so on evenings during Thursday-Sunday. In the summer the restaurant tends to get quite hot and humid if you need to sit more deeper inside the restaurant, I recommend trying to get a table near the entrance during the summer. The restaurant appearance of the restaurant is dated and would benefit from a refresh such as making all the walls more brighter and the tables/chairs being updated. The toilet is downstairs that could also do with the same treatment as it's quite dark the locks on the doors aren't strong/stable
Staff: The are generally friendly, some more talkative than others, but always at least polite. The staff can often be busy so you may need to wait to get service. I would say the more polite staff is the male cashier.
Overall Misato is a cheap spot in Chinatown you get what you pay for, good taste, although not highly authentic, nevertheless give it a shot, you may enjoy it like I have over the years",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Good portions, fast service and the price was very reasonable for the area. I recommend this place if you're looking for a quick meal.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Stumbled upon this little Japanese hole in the wall. Once I saw Katsu Don on the menu, I was hooked! And sure enough it's spot on with ones I've had before! I tried the sushi and that not bad either. Cheap, good eats, good service! Authentic with a great price point!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"Good simple food, I ordered udon beef and was a good portion the broth was yummy but the beef was ok",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,So that's what the line was for! Everything is dirt cheap. Don't recommend the fried chicken but the chicken Katsu was decent. The tea was excellent as they gave us a pot so we got our fill. Service was incredibly fast and polite.,-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"The prices are cheap. I had the chicken katsu curry and it was so good. The portion was decent. I must also add, the service was quick. There can be queues at times, especially during peak hours. This is quite understandable as their food is really legit. I love their home made salad dressing. The only thing is, they do not accept cards.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Simple. Inexpensive. Delicious. 
Come here to get your fix for Japanese comfort food. This small joint in the heart of London offers big portions of quality food for more than affordable pricing. 
It was my GO TO when I lived here and now that I am a cross the world I come here every time that I am in town. 
I had the chicken teriyaki ~$7. Salad, chicken with homemade teriyaki sauce and white rice. 
Salmon and Tuna roll ~$4 for 8 -10 pieces of delicious fresh fish! 
The restaurant is very small, around 11 tables, expect a 30 minute line at all times. 
The bathroom isn't the cleanest but good enough. 
I will keep coming back! 
Cheers!!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"It's always busy, but no matter how busy or how long the queue is they're always very FRIENDLY and their food has always remain a top quality and big portions for a little price.
Compared to Eat Tokyo this is so much friendlier and staying small has really pay off.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"The food is remarkable with low price.

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"I hadn't been to Misato for years and was a little underwhelmed with my return. I ordered the following:
- Curry beef udon
The curry arrived with a neat mound of curry paste in the centre of the bowl which needed to be stirred in which I thought was a nice touch. I like dishes that are left incomplete to encourage an interaction with your plate for the added sense of freshness and satisfaction that you have in some small way contributed to your meal. The taste however was a little sweet for me with nowhere near the amount of savouriness it needed. The half boiled egg it arrives with was also boiled a minute or two too long resulting in no added creaminess which could have helped.
The beef slices were tender and the noodles also nicely spongy however so it does have some redeeming features. The staff were also fast and efficient so I may come back in future (perhaps in another few years!).",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Misato..i visited here I guess a lot of times since it first opening. It has my local favourite restaurant...you can't beat the price here for Japanese foods. That is why they always have a long queue. They still do big plate of dish and rice cost Â£4.50. I like tori karaage, avocado Maki sushi and chicken or Salmon teriyaki rice dishes here. It is always taste good and satisfy me.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"This place isn't particularly expensive but the quality definitely isn't the best. I ordered a beef udon bowl and it's soup was ok at best. It wasn't rich in flavor. The beef cuts were grainy and were essentially over cooked. However, the low price does justify it a little. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to a date here, maybe as a last ditch affordable restaurant.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"What a great discovery in the heart of Chinatown. A fast and casual Japanese restaurant serving sushi as well as noodles and rice dishes. The restaurant is small and I wouldn't consider the food top quality but people come here for a no frills dining experience - everyone knows the drill, which is to order, eat, pay and leave because you know there's always people waiting. I came here with a friend on a Friday night and only had to wait a couple minutes. The staff aren't the friendliest but they're definitely efficient. 
My friend and I got the chicken katsu curry. First thing I noticed was the portion size - it was huge! There were about ten strips of chicken next to a heaping pile of rice and some side salad. The chicken katsu was crispy and juicy, and the curry sauce was so flavorful, it tasted like it had been cooking overnight. I was so content after my meal and the best part is, it only costed me Â£7!
Misato will become my go-to spot. Definitely come here if you're in the area and craving some fast and easy Japanese food.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Excellent food and very reasonable prices, service was very nice, tourist friendly...hidden gem!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This is one of the best Japanese restaurants in London because of its tastes, price, and portion. It's relatively cheaper than other Japanese places and yet are generous in portion!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Awesome food and even more awesome a price! Is it the most authentic? Well not really but hey you won't find authentic at that price point and certainly not in china town. 
I cannot recommend this place more! The curry beef udon, pure yumness!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"This place wasn't TERRIBLE, but I honestly thought from the reviews that it was going to be some kind of underground experience where the sushi was low key mind blowing. We ordered nigiri (they called it something else on the menu but this what we call it in the States) and the rice was cold and chewy. They were pulling it from a fridge and plopping some raw fish on top. It was cheap, sure, so I suppose you get what you pay for. Not mad about it, but would have def gone somewhere else for sushi and paid top dollar for legit nigiri. I think you're better off going elsewhere for a few bucks more.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This place is my family go-to restaurant for kinda-quick, delicious and filling lunch/ dinner. If you go at lunch, probably 2:00 for less queuing, and if you decide to go for dinner, go at 5pm or 7pm to avoid that traffic of people all wanting a piece of that cheap but delicious food. 
Donburis (less of a rice bowl, more of a rice plate because it's too much to fit in a bowl with the salad, meat and rice). The bento boxes are good but if you go to Misato and want to get your money's worth and feel full and satisfied go with donburis. Bentos are like Â£11(?) Donburi's like Gyudons cost Â£6.50 and go up from that. Ramen is alright, nothing really that authentic IMO, broth is clear but meat is lacking when it comes to the ramens, and I wouldn't recommend getting udons as your noodles. 
Staff is an it overworked (dropped a piece of tonkatsu as they brought out my dish) but they're still polite if you're not a total poo towards them. 
The place is quite small and so you'll share tables unless you're lucky. And the place is cash-only as I recall. 
Drinks are a bit overpriced, ramune drinks (carbonated soda that tastes like lemonade but with a marble inside that reminds me and every east-Asian whether Chinese/Japanese/Koreans of their childhood).",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"Had high hopes for this place as it always seems to have queues outside all the time, so finally decided to try it but went a bit earlier to avoid the queues, and it worked and got a table straight away.  
We decided to try a sushi platter to share to start off with and followed by the beef udon, and my companion the Pork Katsu Curry Udon.  The drinks came pretty quickly, a beer and a aloe vera.  Then my companion was served his dish and he had almost finished his meal before I was able to get the attention of any of the waiters who were busy running around at the back of the restaurant or sorting out payments at the front of the restaurant, and at no time look over to where I was sitting and waving for their attention.  Finally, caught an eye of one waitress who said she would check.  Then a long wait before my meal came.  And what a disappointment. The beef was so shredded that it looked like it was the left over bits. The texture was really weird and tasted strange.  I did not enjoy it at all. Also the soup was much too salty.  
I then had to ask several times for the bill.  After the third time, it finally came.  When I went to pay, I gave them enough to pay for the meal without the service charge and the girl who had just returned from her break, asked if everything was ok, and I said not really, although the sushi was good. 
I have never had a bad Japanese meal, even very cheap ones, so the experience here was very disappointing.  A pity.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Loved this little Japanese restaurant. Got the chicken katsu curry with rice, pork katsu curry udon, salmon teriyaki with rice, and shrimp tampura. All were really great, and cheap. Each dish is about 6-7 pounds. Highly recommend.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Exactly as advertised: cheap and cheerful. These kind of restos just have a special place in my heart. I just love the hole-in-the-wall-ness and the fact that everyone piling in is there for the good eats. I find that in these cases, everyone queues nicely, politely. You sit, order, eat, pay, and clear out because you know there are people waiting for your seats. There's no pretence, it is exactly what you see, and the event of sit-order-eat-pay repeats itself hundreds of times a night. The servers know their roles inside out, and everything runs like clockwork. 
I had katsu curry and rice, although their bentos looked good too.  Food was hearty and tasty. I was perfectly happy and full by the time I left.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Once you eat here you understand why there's a line outside. The fish is so fresh it melts in your mouth like butter. Inexpensive, no flash and all substance. Make it a destination!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Misato was a total discovery.
I was stumbling around Soho, checking the same restaurants, high prices and wondering, where can I get some decent Asian food?
Misato is everything you can ask for. Japanese inspired cuisine, with HUGE portions and really low prices.
The menu is quite wide, rice based dishes, sushi, sashimi, rolls, curries... There are vegetarian/vegan options. Just so you have an idea of how big the portions are, please check the photos.
The tofu balls filled with rice, are absolutely spectacular, sweet tofu and well cooked rice on the inside (but really filling beware), and the tofu steak rice is also amazing, it comes with a generous amount of white rice, an amazing sauce in the middle and grilled tofu with a big side salad. The dressing is mayonnaise based, so if you are vegan please ask for this to be aside.
My friends have ordered Katsu Curry more than once and the amount of chicken is ridiculous, I will say this again, I hope you are hungry when you get there!
Cheap, good, filling. My favourite 3 words when it comes to a restaurant :)",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"What an affordable price!!! walked in for dinner at around 7:30 on Monday. There was a queue 8 to 10 people were already waiting. But we waited only 15min. The rotation of the customers must be quick since many of them come alone.
Went for pork ginger which was quite nice. A little bit sweat taste.I liked it!! And only 6Â£.
The stuff were no Japanese though...by the way.
It's bustling with people, cramped and not really comfortable. So suitable for quick dinner ,dinning alone or when you are budget-conscious.
I'll come back soon!!! It has a wide range of menu so I have many of them to try ; )",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Easy place to find in chinatown at the end of the street.
Came here around 6pm but got sitted right away after 5 mins
Ordered the Katsu Chicken bento. Very cheap price and large portion. They give you a big amount of rice which was ok but a tad too mushy for me. Also there was a large portion of chicken katsu that was pefectly crispy.
My boyfriend ordered two plates of sushi but they were quite small sized so I would not reccomend ordering sushi plates because of that.
Overall nice staff and cheap place to go for good asian food in london",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"Went in for some sushi and chicken katsu on a Saturday evening-6:30pm. It was pretty busy, the line was outside the door. Waited about 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad considering the line. The food was pretty tasty and reasonably priced. I wouldn't mind coming again for a quick bite.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Good food but seems to be bulked out a little by rice. Ordered takeaway to take back to my office last night (sad I know...) and was happy with the price, but not that happy with how long it took. The Katsudon was ready and bagged and happily steaming away inside it's cellophane wrapped bowl, but the sushi was nowhere to be seen. It was only 10-12 minutes later that the sushi roll turned up.
However, the food was good, a good amount of wasabi was provided as well as a bowl for mixing and dipping (rare!). The egg in the donburi had cooked maybe a tad more than I had wanted and there wasn't quite enough 'stuff' to go with the rice, but it was a good meal.
I'll head there again for takeout as it was some good food. But I'll make sure that I order just one dish at a time. Warning if you're getting takeout, there is a chair but you'll be bumped every time someone walks past (which happens often). Standing is an option but there really isn't a place to wait.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,I had a pork katsu rice for 5.50$! 10% service tax made it 6.10$. The food was pretty good. Large portion!! Service was nice but they were understaffed so it took a while. I would totally come here for lunch again. Good for the yummy and pockets!,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"I love this place! When I was still a student back in secondary school, I would also struggle trying to have money to pay for meals particularly in Central London. My friends recommended me Misato. Misato is a Japanese restaurant located by Chinatown which offers cheap dishes with big portions. For most dishes the price for one dish is under Â£10 - although you need to consider the 10% service charge with the meal. It has quite a variety, and the place is usually quite busy because of its popularity. The restaurant isn't very big, but I personally enjoy the food there so I tend to come there a lot when I can - particularly if I'm aiming to be cost-efficient with food.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Portions are huge for most meals (the cold noodles are a little more manageable), and prices are very affordable, especially for central London.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Misato- the place is quite small but the service is quick. Sushi & Sashimi are great value. We ordered and were served in about 8 minutes. Quick, fresh, delicious. Highly recommend!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"We were looking for sushi in the area and after Google failed we decided to go with the favorable Yelp reviews. You must try the curry anything here. I had the curry pork Katey and I wish I lived here so I can come back. The soup my fiance has was good but not our cup of tea so to say. We also ordered the eel, salmon and tuna nigiri and should have ordered more. The cold sake is one the best I've ever had and no, the alcohol is not blowing this review out of proportion. Enjoy",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"Great price for a large amount of decent but average food.  There is nothing special about the dishes like a unique take on these traditional dishes, which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars.  Chicken curry katsu is just chicken curry katsu. Rice is rice. Salad is letuce + dressing. I could have put this dish myself. Also, the curry tasted like the bullion curry bricks you can buy in the asian grocery stores...not the made from scratch goodness. This place is worthy of a second visit though.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,1,"According to local Londoners, the line for this place is usually out the door, but I guess I just got lucky when there wasn't even a line.
I got the chicken katsu teriyaki, mainly cuz it was recommended by yelp-ers. Poor decision -- the chicken was breaded pretty heavily, lots of fat too, and just drenched in sauce.
Large portion size, if you liked the dish.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,I stick by my old review - this is still an extremely reasonable priced  resturant with reasonable quality food. Where else in London can you get a Sasimi bento box for under Â£10 that fills you up and send you off waddling home - especially this central?,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"Super affordable casual dining in Chinatown.
This place is great for the price and portion, but the food isn't anything spectacular.
They have simple bentos, rice plates, noodle dishes, and sushi.
CASH ONLY.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"So, I've heard a lot from several sources about Misato, but hadn't had a chance to try it until yesterday. That's mostly because whenever I'm around in Chinatown I don't usually have a Japanese meal in mind (even though I love it). But yesterday I was out with some budget-conscious, sushi-loving friends and we decided to give it a try. 
It was past 9pm so there was no queue. The local itself is small and rather plain, doesn't look pretty or anything. But it's not the wrapping, but the gift itself, so... The staff were very polite and took our orders quickly. The food came in giant plates. I had Tendon (tempura veggies and prawns over a bed of rice and a side salad) and was quite good. The bento box the girl next to me had was the biggest I've seen in London.
I wouldn't classify this as gourmet food, but it wasn't bad at all, either. Very good price/quality ratio, specially considering it's Japanese food, which tends to be on the pricier end of the spectrum. We spent about Â£10 each and were really satisfied!
I'll probably come back some time again :)
P.S. It's cash only, so remember to bring some before going in (there's an HSBC nearby on Gerrard St).",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"This is not a sushi restaurant. They have sushi but the Yelp reviews/search results were misleading. Very easy to get in and out, very attentive service, but the food was only average and the sushi options were so limited we wound up getting other food. The salmon teriyaki was edible but not something worth paying for - but to be fair, it was cheap. Fine for locals wanting cheap quick mediocre eats but not worth the trip for tourists.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,A good and cheap Japanese restaurant in London! I ordered the vegetables tempura with steamed and it was as good as the one I ate in Japan!,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,The stand-alone feature of Misato is that it offers mighty portions of Japanese food at budget prices despite its location in the centre of London. It's also nice that it provides salad with all its meals. The set-up is very basic with simple furniture and amateur-like employees. The china or bento box is also plain white and the cutlery or chopsticks without any design and actually reminds me of aeroplane quality. Everything is fine but lacking personality and a touch of class.,-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"IMO, this place is overrated. It is okay and very much akin to many of the mid-range Japanese places where I live. I've had much much better versions of the few dishes I had here (I had the katsu, pork ginger, popcorn chicken (though it was not called this--I forgot what the actual name was)). I am willing to give this place another try, however, as the sushi looks very good. If you are from the SoCal area, I'd just pass on this place, if I were you. If you are a local, this restaurant might good to go to if you happen to be in the area.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Are you a student? Are you broke? Are you always hungry? Do you always complain about portion sizes and prices?
COME HERE FOR A Â£4.50 CHICKEN DINNER!!!
I love this place so much like this place fulfills all of my needs. I can get CHEAP and YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD and BE FULL and NOT BROKE!!! That is pretty much all you need to know. 
But if you want to know more, they have quite an extensive menu and everything is considerably cheaper than other establishments considering how expensive London is! Like, this place is cheaper than McDonald's, LOL. I have a relatively big appetite and I'll admit, even though I finish all of my food here, I could still definitely eat more. But the important thing is that I won't be hungry here, I don't get bloated but I am full! At a great cost! The place is quite ""hidden"" but it's worth the search! It's along the right side of entering Chinatown from Shaftesbury. Food comes out super quick and even though there's a mandatory 10% service charge, it's still well worth it. I have had their Zaru Soba, Tori Karaage Rice, Tori Teriyaki Rice, and Tonkatsu Curry Rice! Curry Katsu is more expensive, it's like Â£6.50 but it's still way cheaper than elsewhere. Also, all of the rice comes with a side salad which is AWESOME and wow...their cherry tomatoes? Only one, but so refreshing and awesome from all of the heavy comfort food. Nice touch. 
Okay, so you definitely can't beat value. Taste wise, it is also super good. Their wasabi is really weak though, which surprised me. But, that's pretty minor. I probably wouldn't recommend ordering the Zaru Soba (Â£5.00) since it isn't really filling but it's a solid tasting dish (dipping sauce could be better). Tori Teriyaki Rice was REALLY good though, their chicken is crisp on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. They cook their chicken really well! The teriyaki sauce was also fantastic, just enough sauce and subtly sweet. Same goes for the Tori Karaage, which was battered perfectly! Outside had a nice crunch and was crisp while the inside still remained juicy and succulent. The rice is also amazing too, like it's nice and sticky and short grained!!! Great texture and taste, it is seriously some good rice. Tonkatsu Curry was  pretty good, but the meat itself was lean at parts. But when you eat the fatty parts...YUM. It was nicely battered and crisp with your standard curry, which was pretty good. I wish they gave you more curry though, since portions are massive LOL. Food tastes essentially like japanese comfort food, and everything is really well cooked! You really can't beat the price and the quality of the food.
Portions are bigger than a human head and you will definitely be full and happy here! They don't skimp on ingredients and the food is really well cooked, despite how constantly busy this place is! There's always lines at your standard dinner/lunch time so if you're not looking to wait, try to come a little later or earlier than the typical meal time. However, the wait wouldn't be really long and they're super efficient and quick. Their take out is also fantastic, great packaging (they use plastic tupperwares and it pleases me greatly) and portions still!!! Anytime I'm in London and hungry, this is the place I ALWAYS go to. I brought my friend from Nagoya to eat here and she loved it and I quote, ""it tastes like I'm eating real Japanese food back in Japan!"". So, I guess this place is pretty authentic too, LOL. 
Also, MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH! This place is cash only!
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Fresh succulent sashimi, sushi at reasonable prices. Soba just average. Recommend for different  Asian cuisine within Chinatown.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"I was about to give Misato only three starts but because it is so hard to find a decent food for 'normal' price in London, I decided to go higher.
As the reviews have already mentioned, this is nothing special, the sushi is fresh though and probably the best thing on the menu. Curry is okay and I would not order any of the soups again. Although I have to say they don't taste like full of sugar or salt as usually in other restaurants that are considered to have better seasoning in their food. 
Their drinks are quite fun, you can get some stuff that is a bit different than anywhere else and are cheap as well.
So if you are in the area, quite hungry but angry at the society for pricing other ramens around 10 quid a portion, this is a great place to go to.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"A  good place to eat sushi while abroad. Like most hole in the wall places back in the states, cash only but an ATM is right around the corner ( HSBC bank). Service is quick and very friendly. Don't be surprised if there's a line out the door as it's a popular spot.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This place is delicious, cheap, and has humongous portion sizes for London.
It does not seem like much from the outside, but inside you are guaranteed a yummy meal (or two if you have leftovers) for Â£6! If you are at the M&M emporium, it's across the street, quite small and could be hard to miss. 
I've only ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry because it's such a great deal. I would highly suggest going to Misato for lunch, as you'll surely be filled till the next day. My friend ordered their soba noodles which looked fine as well, just not as much food if you're looking for quantity.
My only slight complaint is they add a strange gratuity or tax? I wasn't sure, and no one at the cashier explained it well so I just paid. Overall, this place is so inexpensive it really doesn't matter much. The service wasn't the most attentive, so you may have to call someone over to your table a few times. 
This place is quite popular but small, even when my group went for a meal at 4pm.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,love this place! decent affordable prices for big tasty portions. their chicken katsu is good! meat is tender and tempura isn't super oily. one of the cheaper alternatives in Chinatown London. highly recommend,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Once upon a time there was a student studying for hours in Senate House Library. It became very late and she became very hungry, suddenly craving Japanese food for dinner. Using her trusty Yelp app she found a place called ""Misato"" that was not very far so she walked to Chinatown to go eat there. And the rest is history. 
Seriously tasty food and shockingly inexpensive! The katsu curry is absolutely perfect in portion and flavour, very authentic (even the little salad that comes with it!). I could literally rave about the breading on the pork cutlet for days. I was so hungry when I got here but I left extremely full and satisfied. 
I also ordered cucumber maki sushi as a side and that was also wonderful. 6 pieces for only Â£2.50! I would come back here just for the sushi alone.
Came here after the dinner rush so there was no queue and got a seat immediately. Despite the dinner rush being over all the tables were full so it took a little bit of time for the food to finally arrive. Also, I'm pretty sure I saw a sign that said cash only so bare that in mind! 
This is now my ""go-to"" place in London for Japanese food. Especially considering the hit or miss of the surrounding places in Chinatown, you can't beat the prices or the quality of Misato.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"Long queue and rude staff. Although, the food is cheap and it still tastes decent.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"I walked into Misato after seeing the good reviews on Yelp and i wasn't disappointed. 
First of all, i know some people noted the place didn't look like a million dollar or went simple with decorations etc  but come on, that's the point. If you want to lower the prices, that's first thing you cut. And i'd rather they don't do cuts on the quality of the food.
We came quite early in the evening so we didn't queue. The staff was nice and efficient. We were served fast which happened to be extremely convenient for we were starving. 
We ordered sushi makis, sashimi and a Tori Soba for me (soup noodles dish with fried chicken).
I was surprised the makis were as good as the ones i'm used to at my favourite Japanese place at home. The sashimi were a generous portion of thick cut salmon. All these dishes were really cheap (6 makis starts at Â£2).
The Tori Soba wasn't exceptional but the chicken was reaaaally well cooked. I regretted not taking the curry udon. 
All in all i was satisfied and i'd happily return to try out more things. 
Note that it's not your full-on traditional japanese food restaurant.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This place is so worth your money. It was the perfect place to go for drunchies and, as everyone else said, you get a LOT of rice. I got the chicken curry Katsu and it was so good. The curry sauce was amazing and the breaded meat was delicious. My friend ordered tonkotsu and we poured the tonkotsu sauce over the rice. Try it! I just love the sauce on its own. For 5 people our meal was Â£29.15 including the service charge!! So worth it",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Stopped in here for an impromptu dinner, and so glad we did! This is what Yelp is all about: finding a hidden gem that you would never hear of otherwise, and supporting a local business too. 
This place can best be described as ""cheap and cheerful"", like a Japanese greasy spoon. Generally a young student-age crowd due to the incredibly low prices. It was Â£3.50 for six piece salmon and avocado rolls, which actually tasted super fresh and were generously portioned. The huuuuge pork Katsu curry plate came with large spoonfuls of Japanese rice, a big portion of meat and a small dressed salad, all for Â£5.50. 
Service is quick and impersonal, but tap water refills come free and often. Expect a wait at dinner time of around 10-15 minutes, which you'll spend lined up in the narrow entrance hallway. But it's well worth it for a filling, tasty, and cheap Japanese meal. Looking forward to trying the udon next time!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Stopped by because I was in the area and had not much cash on me. I'd been meaning to check this place out, but never really was motivated enough to walk all the way over there. 
The place is kind of hard to spot, as it's a small door squished between some larger establishments. It is in the ""heart"" of Chinatown, but like aaaall the way down the street. The interior is pretty humble and simple. At around 7:45 on a Wednesday night, it was still quite packed and I waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. I ordered the curry pork katsu-don as soon as I sat down, because that's what I was craving, so didn't even look at the menu. (The server was like ""... LOL ok????"")
It took some time but wow, the portions are indeed very large. I usually eat a TON for someone my size and rarely find things filling enough that I can't find room for dessert, but that's exactly what happened! It was so good that I wiped my place clean. 
The pork cutlet itself was not as thin as I expected, but it wasn't the most tender, either. Granted, you do get quite more than what you pay for. A small downside is that the curry seemed a little cold... maybe because it was mixing with the salad? Everything was running together, but that was understandable.
Overall, good place to drop by if you're on a budget! Heads up that it is cash only.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"insider tip from a good friend of mine.

probably the best chinese restaurant in China Town.
we definitely come back!

Got the sushi bento and a ramen bowl. Not mind blowing awesome, but not bad either.
Not sure why, but I had a little trouble finding this place. It's more on the edge of Chinatown, rather than right in the middle of it.
They don't allow drinks from outside, though that's a typical rule. My friend brought in some boba and the waitress was like, ""Say what?!"" But in an asian way.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"Slapdash and fancy-free is my first reaction to this popular and busy Japanese cafe in the heart of Chinatown. Like many it seems, we were seduced by the numerous positive reviews.
While there's certainly speedy service and the food portions generous, it's nothing extraordinary. We each had a teriyaki rice dish with chicken and salmon respectively. Perfectly edible if bland. 
The accompanying salad leaves drizzled with mayonnaise were an odd choice; some Asian greens in garlic sauce would have been just the ticket. 
Still, for a bill that came to less than Â£20 for two meals and a beer, you can't complain. Just don't expect to linger - queues of hungry customers are waiting, and you'll be told to leave.",-1

It was a bit hard to find as they have no name sign or anything outside, we walked past it a couple times before going by house number. But once we found it, it was amazing!
The food selection was good and the prices are more than reasonable for central London. The portions were huge, the staff was nice and the atmosphere was pretty okay for a cheap place to eat. Will definitely go back.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table at 6pm on a Saturday night. The line just got longer and longer as the night went on. I had high hopes for this place but was sorely disappointed.
We three dishes and two of the dishes included extremely cold food. The Karaage Chicken was unbelievably cold. It was as if they made it hours ago and then let it just sit there collecting dust waiting for a customer that ordered it. The batter was soggy and it was just disgusting! The Sashimi Bento came with a couple of fried shrimp dumplings that were also cold and soggy.
This place is pretty cheap but.you get what you pay for! When the waitress took our food away she asked if we wanted to pack the chicken and I almost told her no your chicken is disgusting!

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"For only Â£6, the chicken katsu curry really hit the spot. It was a cold rainy day and a plate (the size of my face!) of warm curry was perfection. They gave a very generous portion which I feel could easily be split into two meals. But I ate the entire plate in one sitting because I simply could not stop eating - it was that good! The chicken katsu was perfectly crunchy and there was a lot of it too. The side salad was good. The rice was good. 
Damn, everything was great. I will definitely be visiting again!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Excellent Japanese food and absolutely affordable. Cherry on the cake, staff was friendly and smiling. I would totally recommend.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"I was with a friend attempting to try Shake Shack. Put off by the horrendous airport check-in queue, we decided to head to Chinatown at her request to try a small Japanese place she'd heard good things about.
Thus we found ourselves at Misato, a tiny Japanese cafe looking place with nary any indication it was a shop, apart from the A4 piece of paper in the window showing the name of the place. This in no way hinted how amazing the food would be once inside.
There was a small queue when we arrived, around 8-10 people and seeing the size of the place, we expected to have to wait ages. Luckily!, as we arrived, a table opened up for 2 people and we were shooed right in. So get this, if you want a table quickly, go in small groups of 2. Otherwise like the unfortunate people with 3 or more in their party, there is a long wait due to the limited number of group tables. As we ate during that 45 mins, the queue only got LONGER.
The food itself is brilliant on two levels. First, the value for money is astounding. The Unagi Nigiri (That's the Sushi wraped in Eel) which is normally a little pricy in other places was Â£2 for 2 pieces of reasonable size. 6 pieces of sushi ranges from Â£3-6 from California rolls to salmon. My jaw dropped. Not to mention the main dishes were served in giant portions for Â£4-9. Katsu curry, Bento boxes...I cannot fault the value here.
So a place that does cheap sushi probably tastes cheap too right? Wrong. I've eaten in quite a few sushi places of varying quality and I can honestly say this place serves the most tasty sushi in the whole of london. It wasn't bland, dry, nor too cold, plus had the right amount of vinegar in the rice, good amounts of filling and the Unagi Nigiri was so succulent...and the california rolls to die for. I just don't know how they do it. 
My main arrived, the Chicken Teriyaki and again, lettuce smothered in delicious mayonaise (I think Kewpie) a mass of real breaded chicken, big rice portion and again, delcious Teriyaki sauce. I'm just salivating thinking about this meal.
For sure I'll be back, and will be in a group smaller that too. I mean the important thing is that I get in. And once in, I shall feast like a king on a budget.
Seriously, if you're in Chinatown and in a small group. At the risk of making this place even more popular that it already is, consider Japanese. Consider Misato. Just look out for the A4 piece of paper in the Window and no actual name where you'd expect a shop name to be :)",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"If you're looking for a budget-friendly place that serves huge portions, definitely come here. If, however, you're looking for more authentic Japanese food, don't. This place definitely caters to the former.
A couple friends and I came here on a Friday night and the place was packed. Thankfully we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes before being seated. They also hand you the menus to look over in line, so we ordered pretty much right after we got seated. I wanted something light so I ordered the Tofu Steak (grilled tofu & sauce, w/ salad) and asked for the salad dressing on the side. When the dish came out I was already a bit disappointed. Not to be picky, but they didn't remember to put the dressing on the side. Ok, fine. Whatever. Maybe the dressing will actually taste good? Unfortunately not the case, as it tasted super watery. The dish also came with a mysterious brown sauce (which I assume was for the tofu). Curious, I dipped my chopsticks in and gave it a taste. It literally tasted like diluted soy sauce. Not a fan. By this point I had pretty much given up, so I was actually pleasantly surprised when I tasted the grilled tofu since it was decent, although - again, this seems like a trend but - watery. Nothing special to say about the salad either - I mean, what can you really say about lettuce and a tomato?
Overall I was not impressed. The service was fast and I appreciated that they constantly made sure our water glasses were filled, but honestly the food was so subpar I can't even justify the incredibly low prices (mine was 4 pounds). I wanted to love it, because it would've meant good food for low prices - which is definitely a struggle in London - but I just couldn't. I will not be returning.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Oh, I can't believe I have not done a review of Misato yet. Let's start! 
This is how I imagine my grandma would cook if I was Japanese. Massive portions, fresh and tasty food enjoyed equally by Asians and Europeans. There is always a long queue in the street, that says it all. Although you do not usually have to wait more than 15/20 minutes.
Do not expect the nicest place ever, though, this is not about style, this is about real food and the restaurant could have easily gotten a new look one decade ago. The toilets are clean, but damn, I guess you better wait a bit and use the loo somewhere else where you do not get oil de parfum just by going downstairs.
The main dishes are great, but I would recommend you a bento box with a bit of sushi and a bit of rice with meat or fish, they are just delicious (and the best option if you can't decide!).",1

The menu is so, so cheap - we definitely over-ordered assuming this meant the portions would be small but oh how wrong we were. The bento boxes were huge and so, so tasty - I went for the pork ginger and the box was quite honestly the size of a laptop. It was so yummy and the beer was only Â£3 too!! A special mention to the waiter who had baked his own brownies that day and gave us each one for free! Only downside is it is quite packed in there and the food came out quite staggered - but it's a minor gripe.",1

The waiting staff are so friendly and very happy to help, the food was out quickly, which was brilliant because the lovely smells can induce real hunger pangs whilst you wait. The fish was very fresh and was set out simply and very humbly. The food was delivered as food, not a masterpiece on a plate, but if you don't mind that (as I don't) it's barely a problem.
For value and a reasonably tasty bite to eat, I'd recommend this place.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"Portions are a great size, in fact it could be argued that a standard rice dish is too large for all but those with the biggest appetites. 
We had the chicken teriyaki rice dish along with an order of the Sake Maki roll. Between the two of us, it was a fine meal. 
I did not care especially for the quality of the chicken in our dish (very fatty, etc.) and the sushi was acceptable yet plain. 
Our experience was really hampered by the service. We waited about 25 minutes for our order to be taken although food did come out quickly after that. Once we finished our meal I was still a bit hungry and wanted a second roll as well as a beer. The language barrier was so thick between the staff and myself I ended up receiving no roll and all and a second person coming around to inquire about the beer since the first person forgot to ask which I wanted. On top of all of this, my communication with the staff was very rudely conducted over the heads of the guests next to us since the tables are oriented against one another.

It seems a japanese restaurant run by chinese people in the middle of ChinaTown. But because of the great reviews on yelp (especially coming from Hannah, Jing and Katie) I still wanted to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did it!
Come here around 9.30 on a Sunday, and there was still a queue, but... how can I say.. they have the typical asian attitude combined with Londonese hurry, let's say the you won't wait a lot in queue!
No experimentation in the menu, mixed sushi, some bento boxes and a bunch of hot dishes like chicken and pork Katsu. Stop. Awesome, the only thing I usually hate from asian restaurants (it's a problem I saw in several of them, thai, chinese, japanese, you name it) is the size of the menus. And the lower the quality, the bigger the menu! 
We ordered sushi, sashimi, and chicken katsu. Now, it must be said that the quality per se of the food is not excellent, but if you compare the quality of the food for the prize that's where it gets the 5 stars!
Now, on my personal list this actually got two different grades, a 4 stars for the sushi  (good, but that's it) and an awesome 5-stars for the katsu, so.. if you want a quick and big portion of katsu don't look further, otherwise you can still consider it as an option but nothing more than that. Unfortunately the service is... a bit rushy! yes they are going to bring the menu while you are still in queue, yes they are going to to ask for ordering while still in queue, but you know, it's central london, I ckind of understand that!",1

Don't be intimidated by the outdoor queue (there will most likely be one) as tables clear fast.  Misato is relatively worth the wait, mostly for its value in Central London- hefty portions of rice and noodle-based mains barely approach the Â£6 mark.  
I had the Tempura Udon- big fatty juicy noodles in broth with fried shrimp and vegetables- and I thought it was good but not great.  My friend and I shared an eel and sea bass nigiri, which tasted fine (though I wish the eel tasted a bit fresher).  
The most delightful part of my meal- besides filling my then-starved belly- was trying a Japanese drink I never heard of, Calpico, which is a sweet yogurt and milk based soft drink.  I want to think I'm moderately adventurous, so I thought ""why not,"" and I'm glad I did!  If you like sweet drinks I'd recommend you try it (cost Â£2).
Would I go back?  Yes..though I would try the katsu curry chicken next since many have raved about it.

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"I was on a lone late Sunday wander in Soho headed for my usual haunt of Wong Kei only to find it mysteriously closed for 'refurbishment'. Being still hungry and, having originally been dead set on a giant, juicy plate of Singapore noodles, I found myself lost in a sea of unfamiliar Chinatown eateries, casinos and unorthodox revellers. It took me a few moments to collect my thoughts, but then I remembered: what about that tiny Japanese place that I had read about somewhere on the social media train? Always a queue, I had heard. But maybe at 9pm on a Sunday, there might just be a free spot for one.
Walking down towards Leicester Square, I kept looking out for Misato as I thought I'd missed it, but stopped in time. Menus printed on A4 paper and placed inside plastic wallets in the window. A spot visible through said window! I went in and after a quick look at the menu, instantly ordered a can of Sapporo beer, some miso soup and a katsu curry.
The soup was warm and comforting, and the curry just giant. The portion size was reminiscent of dishes I'd cook up during my student days. Two breaded cutlets of pork slathered in Japanese curry sauce, with a dressed salad and an extremely generous heap of sticky rice. All were pleasing to this ravenous kid recharging his batteries after a hectic weekend.
The bill? Â£11.50 including tip. Some may baulk at the 'optional service charge' suggested at the foot of the bill. I've read many a review shrieking about waiters asking for tips and customers refusing through their rigorous, dogmatic obligation to take offence wherever humanly possible, but let's be honest, these are people earning tuppence trying their luck. So what? I paid it anyway and left.
Five stars. Will be back with a friend next time.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,Great amount and not too pricey. Great if you are a budget backpacker same as me. Go their earlier (around 6) if you don't want to wait too long. Also check the map first because it is so easy to miss the place.,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"If anyone knows me, they'll be able to tell you that Japanese food is my favourite cuisine of all time. I genuinely spend like 30/40% of my time at Yo Sushi. I wish that was an exaggeration. 
I decided when I was in London I'd grab a quick dinner before seeing Book of Mormon, and with this restaurant being just around the corner, and with takeaway being an option, I decided to go for some chicken teriyaki. 
The restaurant inside isn't very big, but it was relatively full. The menu offers little but I've often found that menus who offer little do what they do best. Unfortunately this wasn't the case here. I didn't wait very long for my food, and when I got it I went and sat in Leicester square to people watch as I ate. The chicken was cooked, but that's probably the best thing I can say about it. It was alright, but I probably wouldn't go back. The teriyaki sauce wasn't very sweet, but the rice was nice and fluffy, so I suppose there's positives and negatives. 
Alright if you're in a rush, but I wouldn't return for a sit down meal. Also it should be noted that they don't accept card!",-1

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"As a Vancouver sushi snob I can't recommend the sushi dishes, but the rest of the food was fine, especially considering the crazy cheap prices. GIANT portions of salmon, curry and katsu! They also have cheap plum wine and other Japanese sakes and beers!
Definitely worth the lineup if you are looking for something casual and satisfying.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"I actually kinda like this. The udon I ordered (beef) was a good portion, and i was stuffed at the end. It was like 5.50 or 6 pounds, can't quite remember, so it was a bargin. There was actually a line to get in...and i came for lunch on saturday. So i'm guessing the other stuff is good? Though my friend said her fried pork rice plate was a bit bland. The tea they have is real nice. My udon was quite soft, just the way i like it :)
The sushi was okay, nothing special.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Finding this place is exactly why I use Yelp. Having moved offices to the area, we've all been looking for new and better places to eat. A couple of us had a hankering for proper Japanese katsu curry (and not the cheap mess you get from the likes of Wasabi), so we asked Yelp. 
Most of the top reviews paid homage to Misato's katsu curry, and it did not disappoint. I took away 4 (four!) containers for Â£6, which made up the salad, rice, sauce, and chicken. It was great that it was separated as you could mix it as you like; the chicken wasn't soggy by the time you got back to the office so retained that amazing crunch from the coating. The sauce was a little sweeter than I expected, but I can't complain as all katsu curry is different depending on where you try; and I'd thoroughly recommend you try this one.
I didn't sit down at the restaurant itself but it was busy, with a great atmosphere, and very friendly staff. It seemed small but bustling, in a good way, and pleasantly decorated. I did miss the entrance going past as there is nothing more than a piece of paper in the window, but once you're in, you're set for great katsu. We were most pleased!",1

It is perhaps one of the cheapest Japanese restaurants in London if you excluded the likes of Itsu and Wasbi. While far from top notch, the pork katsu curry here is solid, very smooth and consistent in texture, plenty of mild sweetness and spiciness. Don't order starters or side dishes unless you are a big eater as the portions here are almost twice as much as most other restaurants nearby.",-1

Delicious, and with salpico, the typical refreshing juice they usually have in Japanese summer you pay like 10 pounds for a meal including service. I do not think there is a better option, although I would avoid if you get stressed with queuing and are going to be meeting people at the restaurant. I would suggest you meet somewhere else before going to the restaurant, since they do not allow you to sit down while waiting for other people. Everyone needs to be there.

It's a little place, easily missable on Wardour street near Chinatown. When I got there, it was fully occupied and we had to wait in a queue outside just to get in. I waited for like 10 minutes to get in. I think it's easier for groups to get in since the tables really prefer groups over singles. The decor wasn't that impressive, nor should it be. Simplicity is key to this place.
For only Â£6, I ordered the Chicken Katsu curry and it was really great. I love Japanese cuisine but I admit I've never been to Japan so I wouldn't know how the real thing tastes like. But this place offers big portions and for that I was excited. Prices are really great (compared to other Japanese restaurants I tried)
I definitely recommend anyone to try it and I will definitely go there again!",1

They have noodle, sushi and bento boxes on their menu, so far I have only tried their noodle dishes which are delicious and cheap. 
If you go at a busy time you may have to wait for a table as it's such a small restaurant with only few tables inside. It is most definitely worth the wait and I'm looking forward to my next visit.",1

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a Queue outside the door already. Luckily, it was a sunny day and we only had to wait for about 15 Minutes until we were seated.
The restaurant is fairly small and has no decoration or anything that might entice you to take your time while having your food. However, I felt that it's part of the charm - basic wooden tables and chairs, crammed together to seat as many people as possible. 
The waiters seem a bit stressed and rather reserved, but friendly. There's a really big selection of Katsu Curry dishes and nice Bento Boxes, as well as Sushi and Udon. I had the Salmon Teriyaki Bento and he had the Chicken Katsu Curry. My bento box was big, with a more than generous piece of juicy, perfectly cooked Salmon, a big serving of rice, salad, to makis as well as two pieces of fried pork and a seaweed salad. His chicken Katsu portion was ginormous (yes, that is totally a word) and could have fed two people. The food is really tasty and it's great value for money. Is the food worth the Queuing-outside-the-door? Yeah, I'd say it is - as long as you don't expect an amazingly unique dining experience, but really solid, tasty Japanese staple food.
Will definitely go here again!",1

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,1,"I cannot believe that people are giving this restaurant good reviews. To paraphrase Vizzini, I find the assessments ""inconceivable""!
It was easy to spot the restaurant. A long line. Does long line = good? That was our mission. Luckily, while waiting in line, we got a good look at the food. I pressed my face against the glass, steaming it up, and stared down the food as it passed into unsuspecting customers.
The tuna had an off-color. Not good. The soba arrived wilted and sad. It wasn't even on a bamboo plate. Not good. OK, I thought, can you really ""see"" unpalatable-ness? Maybe it will taste good.
As we progressed in our line, we got a good view of the cashier's area. In the area was where they apparently prepared drinks. I saw filthy water cups washed by simply wiping them with rags. The large novelty sake bottles were re-filled from sake-in-a-box. They also prepared some other concoction by mixing instant powder.
I suppose this might be part and parcel of any restaurant operation, but it was disconcerting seeing them do it so nonchalantly in front of customers.
The food. I ordered sashimi. The salmon wasn't bad but the tuna was. It felt like someone had defrosted it. My friend ordered tonkatsu rice...
Now imagine, if you will, that there exists a planet beyond our solar system made entirely of eggs. Suppose the inhabitants crafted a ship and landed it on your tonkatsu. That's what happened. A huge UFO of an egg was plopped onto the tonkatsu. Really? 
The breading on the tonkatsu was far too thick. The worst part is I could TASTE fish oil in the breading. In other words, they probably have a huge vat of oil and just throw everything in it. Yuck.
Yes, it was cheap. But would you pay even a cent for crap?",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Cash only. Not unexpeceted at a place like this, but still annoying.
As other have said, massive portions of Chicken Katsu Curry (with rice and salad) for a really small price (under Â£7). Wish it came with those little red pickles, however. Really solid Japanese homestyle comfort food and great for winter time if you've never tried it. 
Big food, big flavours, small pricetag. Go late (like after 9) and there is no queue.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,1,"It wasnt what I expected. Food didnt look nice, chicken didnt taste as chicken, I would not recommend this place at all.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This place is great. The amount of food that they give you like other people have said is quite large. For less than Â£10 you could very easily feed yourself quite comfortably. The food itself is very good and I eat the Tempura Udon most times I go and it tastes great. Drinks aren't the cheapest things in the world but it's a small price to pay for such a good restaurant. The atmosphere is what you'd expect, mostly Japanese people however you will find the occasional tourist. You might have to wait for some time before being seated but even at lunch I haven't waited for any longer than 15 minutes. There aren't many tables but they do clear quickly. In my opinion this is one of my favourite places to eat in London.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"I love this restaurant. I really, really love it.
Why the 4 stars rather than 5 then? Well, this simply comes down to the lack of air conditioning (at least the last two times I visited). It is very warm in London right now and it was very warm in Misato yesterday. Almost too warm to eat, except...
Well, except that the food and service in Misato is always excellent. So are the prices. As some other reviewers have said, the restaurant is not a sandblasted, ultra modern place. It looks more like a slightly student-like place in terms of its appearance. But the food is outstanding, the portions are large, they come quickly and the price is great. 
The food is also very nicely presented in traditional Bento style. I had the curried pork steak yesterday, with rice and salad. It was so tasty I almost miaoed. Yes, it was that good. On the other hand, it was probably not the wisest thing to eat on such a warm day when there was a lack of air conditioning.
Anyway, the food (the curries and noodles especially) and the service are excellent. I highly recommend visiting Misato when you're next in Soho China Town. 
Really delicious!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,Went there with a friend and luckily did not have to wait in any queues....enjoyed the katsu chicken curry with rice. It was awesome and a massive portion for only Â£6. They also have lovely plum wine,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Who doesn't love a huge helping of katsu curry (breaded pork) and rice with veg for under Â£7?! There is no such thing as too much of a good thing.
Any foodie who appreciates good value for money and a love for Japanese curry should experience Misato. My advice would be to arrive early, i.e. 12pm for lunch and 6pm for dinner - trust me, there is usually a queue to get into this joint.  Also they are cash only and we all know how rammed atm machines can get around Chinatown, be prepared and bring your pennies.
Misato will not disappoint. If it does, then I would question your taste palette!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"Came here for lunch as it seemed to have good reviews. That was a mistake. The portions are huge and the price is cheap. However, that is it. The soba was tasteless and the soup tasted like something out of a packet. The katsu was borderline. The rice was not japanese rice and a bit bland. Come for the prices and portions, not for the quality.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Ah, Misato. What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a pokey little Japanese place that serves fantastically unpretentious food in gargantuan portions.  For those times when you just want a decent meal and couldn't care less about the trappings of fine dining, this is your destination.  It's a shame there's no option for brown rice, but ho hum! 
I really recommend the Katsudon, a massive slab of pork katsu topped with a frankly terrifying amount of wobbly egg... stuff, sitting on a bed of rice, served (slightly hilariously) with salad. It looks weird, but ZOMG the taste, and you really can't argue with the price. Come hungry! Oh, and come early! The queues really do extend out the door during busy periods.",1

When I walked in I was initially taken aback a bit but I trusted my friend's judgment. She had eaten here before and loved it. And I can see why. The service is quick and the food came out after about a ten minute wait, if that.
I ordered a chicken cutlet bento box and it looked gorgeous. I tried to eat it all but it was a bit too much food. Too much of a good thing? Love when that happens. The added bonus was that it was cheap. And that left me cheerful.
While I was sitting there a lot of people came in so expect a bit of a wait if coming after work. Luckily the servers turn the table pretty fast so I doubt you would wait long.",1

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"Very torn here because there are so many great reviews and I've only tried two things from the menu so maybe other things are good. The lady eating next to me raved about her order and said its her favourite meal and she eats it every week. The Chicken katsu curry was massive but also not very nice. Chicken was brown, very fatty and heavily breaded with a very thick sauce that we didn't love. Portion size is huge, it could easily feed two people and yes it's very cheap. But I'd rather have nice/food. Maki rolls are ok, just plain nothing amazing. They don't do hand rolls which I was really craving. For such cheap prices i wouldn't except the meat or fish to be of any good quality which put me off. Side note, the staff were amazing, incredibly nice and helpful. My 5 year old left his museum map on the table and started crying 5 minutes after we left when he realised he forgot it. We ran back and they fished it out of the bins for us even though they were so busy. Very nice people!",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"Having lived the better part of the past six years of my life in Japan, I was looking forward to enjoying some familiar favourites at the highly rated Misato. What I got instead was a confusing derivative loosely based on Japanese food.
Our party of three overzealously ordered enough food to feed five people from the lackadaisical staff who only acknowledged us when we drew their attention. The portions were quite generous, despite the fact that half of the large plates were taken up by shredded lettuce slathered in dressing. 
The katsudon with its bland, overcooked egg, lacked any type of onions, was not cooked with the pork cutlet and was served on a plate instead of a bowl (the ""don"" in ""katsudon"").
The katsu curry was edible, but the pork was dry and the curry sauce was quite sour and definitely not the same slightly sweet flavour of a Japanese style curry.
The pork and ginger rice dish was passable, approximating the flavour of the sauce well, but the preparation of the pork seemed very lazy. The slices of meat were far too thick and rigid.
Perhaps the most offending item was the tori karaage, which was a disastrous, soggy, greasy mess of overcooked meat.
Fortunately there were several dishes that helped save the experience. The tempura was acceptable and the tofu steak was enjoyable, though you have to question the difficulty of lightly frying a piece of tofu.
Perhaps I am being a little harsh, as the generous portions meant that we all left with very full stomachs, and this kind of food is perfect for a quick, cheap and filling meal for lunch. However, if you're looking for a Japanese food experience, look elsewhere, because while this was a very filling meal, it was also a very unfulfilling experience.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Fav. Japanese restaurant in London so far.  Why?  Because it's cheap, portions are HUGE and the bento boxes are amazing.  It's not fancy food or a touristy restaurant- just straightforward, affordable Japanese food. Cash only.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"A good evening is generally accompanied by food, or at least that's the rule my friends and I abide by. Slight issue was money - neither of us had much. So cheap and cheerful was the brief. And Misato was the solution. 
I met my Korean/ NYC friend, Crystal (great name huh?) outside and I have to admit, during the couple of minutes I'd had sneaking a peek at the menu before she arrived, I wasn't too keen. 
Although I love Japanese food, I'm more keen on the sushi and the rolls as opposed to the big udon soups and noodle dishes. And whilst I have a special spot for Katsu, I associate it with Wagamama's and therefore only eat it there (yes, yes, ridiculous, i KNOW). However, I jumped in and opted for the Tempura with rice. whilst Crystal opted for the Katsu with egg sauce. 
Tempura was standard and for the price, decent enough. What caught my attention though was the egg sauce on the Katsu. Firstly, egg sauce just sounds wrong and this wobbly, semi solid 'mess' looked absolutely rank if I'm being honest. I eventually plucked up the courage to sample a bit of the gelatinous, globby gloop and to my surprise, if you can get over the weirdness of, it's actually pretty tasty. 
Service was quick and efficient and the lychee juice was the perfect option for a sticky evening. 
Bill came to just under Â£20 for a giant meal and drinks (1 beer, 1 lychee juice) and yes, I'd def go there again for something cheap, casual and easy (sounds a bit like a description of some tacky pick-up joint...)",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"If you like Wagamama and fancy bigger portions for a lower price then Misato is the place for you. Having said that, apart from the menu, the two couldn't be any more different.
 Misato is a tiny little Japanese restaurant, only slightly longer than it is wide, hidden away on Whitcomb St, right next to Leicester Square. It is instantly recognisable in that there is nearly always a queue which often stretches out onto the pavement, past the shop front and blocking the doors of its neighbours. If you weren't looking for it, you'd miss it.
 The menu is varied, from sushi and bento to katsu curry, and it all looks great. The portions are big and unless you're very hungry you're unlikely to polish off a whole curry as the volume is simply overwhelming. Some of the dishes are a little too salty for me but for the price you pay, which can be as low as Â£5-6 a plate, it doesn't hurt much.
 The staff are great, but unless you go when it is a bit quieter, it can occasionally feel like they are rushing you out to get the next customers in, and with the restaurant seating maybe only 40 at a time, it can take a while to get to the front of the queue, but I would advise anyone to stick it out.
 My only other criticism is that it does get very hot in there sometimes due to the lack of air conditioning, but hey, good food, cheap and cheerful with a great atmosphere. As long as you brought good company, you're in for a lovely time, and a filling meal.

First off, the place is tiny. The line from the hostess extended down to the steps outside. We were waiting for about 15 minutes I believe. All I remember was being so hungry but for some reason I remained patient. 
I ordered the tofu steak which came with white rice and salad. I also ordered a miso soup to warm up from the cold. Food was incredible! What made it even better were the HUGE portions. You receive a plentiful and you'll definitely satisfy your hunger.

As it turns out, the food isn't amazing, but the portions are very large and the prices are low. A sushi dinner goes for Â£7 and most of their cooked foods katsu, teriyaki, etc. are under Â£5. I tried their sushi and was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. Not amazing, but not half bad.
This is a real student joint. Not date material unless your date is sixteen. Unless you're sixteen too, I'd say the whole thing is a bad idea and you should probably just stay home. But if you're a student or low-budget and dating someone age-appropriate go for it.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"I make frequent visit to Misato ever since i discovered this place, which was like 5 years ago. Misato does good quality food. You will be amazed when you see how long the queue is during lunch and dinner time. Don't go in a big group because it would take you forever for a table as the restaurant itself is tiny.
Nonetheless, the portion is HUGE at Misato in comparison to other Japanese restaurants in London. I love their Curry Katsu Rice and Terriyaki Chicken Rice, they do good Tempura Udon as well. However, the sushi sets aren't the best food that they serve! Hot dishes like noodles and rice, are better quality-guaranteed compared to the cold dishes, e.g. sushi.
Anyway Misato is a good economic-choice if you want to spend less for some promising authentic Japanese food.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"The clients were mainly young Chinese and Asian when we had dinner last night. It was poring with rain, so we didn't have to wait.  If you want the basic Japanese, this is it.  Don't expect fancy, sophisticated meal here.  The best dish is Pork Cutlet Rice.  The portion is big and the pork lean and tasty.  But ask them not to put dressing which is basically mayonnaise. I was going to order Chicken teriyaki, but was told that it was deep-fried (menu said grilled), so I changed my mind. I have never heard of deep-fried teriyaki (teriyaki means grilled and basted with glaze) in my life. The popular dish we saw was the Chicken Karaage Rice.  It looked huge but had guey sauce on top - in Japan, it comes without the sauce - and I think it's way too heavy for me.  The price is very reasonable and we are happy to eat Pork Cutlet again soon.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"the food is served in large portions, is very cheap for what it is, and is tasty/satisfactory. nothing about it will blow you away, but if you are looking for filling japanese staples which are less hard on the budget than usual, you'd do well to go here. 
i had a salted salmon bento box and my boyfriend a mixed sashimi bento. both came absolutely piled with food, and we both felt they offered good value for money (Â£8 each i think). the katsu plates at the table next to us were absolutely ginormous and were being devoured by students who ignored the salad part of the plate and powered through the chicken/pork and the rice. 
the staff here are brusque, bordering on surly. i don't mind quick, efficient service (which, for the most part it was), but i don't think it takes any extra effort to be polite with it, and i think they could perhaps amp up their politeness a level a touch. 
i've also read that queues can form outside this place. yes, it is good for what it is, but honestly if there was a queue, i wouldn't wait in it!",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"It's really a very generous portion for this reasonable price. My stomach literally showed after ate a half of it, however, my hands uncontrollably keep feed the SATO CURRY RICE to my untamed mouth. However, try not to go there in normal eating time like lunch or tea time, because there will be a long queue before you can get in this crowded little space.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"I give it five stars for quality and price. London is one expensive town, but if you can get the biggest serving of rice and A LOT of chicken (i got the chicken katsu with curry) and salad on the side..... all for Â£4.50 + everything tastes good, well then London just got a little bit cheaper. I just about died when i saw the prices as well as when i saw the servings! This place is generous. But beware, the line is a long one! I suggest eating half and taking the rest to go- it can't be healthy to eat an entire plate in one go!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Ahhh, it has been nearly 4 years now since I lived in London, and I still think of Misato's Ginger Pork. Swoon. My boyfriend would also get the Chicken Katsu Curry. It was cheap, and the lines were always long. 
Anyway, I guess there's not a lot of value in reviewing places you haven't been in 3 years and say, 8 months.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Not much to say, good Japanese food and above all, affordable offering generous portions. The only thing I wish not so many people knew about it, it s always full! Well done Misado!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"delicius and cheap...there's something wrong, no courtesy, bad staff and  not enough modern to be a suchi bar close Leicester Square!!!",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"Cheap and filling are the best words to sum up Misato. This is a great option if you're looking for a large filling meal for under 10 pounds in the West End. 
Misato serves the usual homestyle Japanese/Korean food including katsu curries, bentos and noodles, but for a price that is extremely reasonable. There are definitely better quality restaurants serving this kind of food all around the West End (Tokyo Diner comes to mind), but few other places do it for as cheap or as quick. Service is bare bones, but its mostly what you can expect in Chinatown and at this price point. 
The place fills up quickly on evenings with tourists and the student crowd from Asia, so be prepared to wait in line if you don't come early!",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"If I want Japanese or a cheap and cheerful meal in Soho, this is almost always where I come. There are almost always queues out of the door and the service reflects this with an emphasis on speed often making it a little brusque. They also won't let you sit down until your whole party has arrived so no sneaky queue tactics. I usually go for a bento box as they are excellent value and provide a bit of variety so you don't have to choose between sushi and a full meal. Not only are the portions massive but the food is also pretty good. Most people are young and pretty cool and you get the impression that they're all also regulars. Definitely one of my favourite London restaurants.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Huge portions of decent Japanese food, great location, unbelieveable prices. What more could you ask for?
 Sure, the restaurant's pretty basic, but tables aren't crushed together to the point of discomfort. Service was also prompt and polite.
 The only downside with this place is that they don't take reservations, so there is almost always a long queue out the door of people waiting for seats.
 The day I was there, I ate the teriyaki chicken rice which was accompanied by a generous portion of salad. The sauce was delicious, and there was a lot of meat and a lot more rice. I ended up giving one third of the chicken to my dining companion because I simply couldn't finish!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,This place does the best one plate meals! You are guaranteed to either not be able to finish everything or feeling very full up after eating. Affordable and well worth it! Be prepared for a long wait as this place is massively popular!,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,Would you believe this hole in the wall was our favorite restaurant in London.  My husband's tonkatsu plate was huge and delicious.  $10 for dinner was a bargain.,1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"I've been going to this place for years and i still love it. it's a casual restaurant but its really good value, the food is good and the portions are huge. You usually have to join a line to get a table but it moves quickly.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Lovely little Japanese restaurant with speedy service, friendly staff, authentic Japanese atmosphere,  tasty and very affordable food. Left more than satisfied spending just Â£5. Highly recommended.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"I lived in London four years ago and still miss this place. Especially now that I've widened my digestive tract for American serving sizes, and I can't find a decent katsu curry place near where I live.
There are lines/queues out the door typically and limited seating, so don't come in with too big a group nor too many expectations of ""dining"" or ""service"". But of what I've sampled it's cheap and yum - though I've never had anything other than the katsu curry.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,3,"There are always queues for Misato, which is a good sign really, because people are willing to stand outside for more than half an hour to have a meal there. Make sure you go somewhat early, to save the aforementioned queuing and you'll have a nice cheap meal that the hoards of students so obviously enjoy.
I like sashimi and miso soup here, as its very fresh however I'm not a fan of the chicken katsu curry as although the portions are really generous, the quality of the meat is not so great, which is why I stick to fish. Service can be abrupt but it's a cheap eat and you can't really expect them to bend over backwards when they are rushed off their feet non-stop.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"I don't know how many times I walked on Wardour St and never noticed this tiny gem. I'm so lucky a friend of mine told me about it and actually brought me there.
 The place is small and obviously always crowdy, so be ready to stand in a long queue. The menu is simple and honestly you don't have a lot of dishes to choose from but the price and the amount of food is unbeatable. I ordered a Sushi bento and was enough naive to add a small bowl of rice... I seriously had some trouble finishing it!
 The food is very good and, having been in Japan, really authentic. They use wasabi in the sushi rice and this little detail tells a lot about how really japanese this place is. It's difficult to spend more than 15Â£ because people cannot understand how cheap this restaurant is until they go and eat there. Moreover, there is no service charge, but leaving Misato without leaving some kind of tips would make you feel very, very bad.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This is my absolute favorite Japanese restaurant in Central London.
Food is tasty and portions are very generous. I almost always order the sushi bento, which has lots of sushi, salad, seaweed and dim sum style bits and pieces. I am addicted to the sushi bento! I tried other dishes, too and have never been disapointed.
Prices are very good however from the 01/01/11 they have introduced a discretional 10% service charge, which I don't agree with as the service isn't anywhere good. It is a canteen syle place and you are in and out very quickly. The waiting staff doesn't give you lost of time to look at the menu, they mixed up the order a couple of times and most of them hardly speaks english. The bill is on your table as soon as you finished your food.
There is a long queue most of the time, but it's something I accept as part of the experience.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Loved the FOOD...
 Its very economical and after waiting in a LOOONGGGGGGGG Queue? It's Worth the wait...
 YUM!
 Try my fave Beef Rice, Torikara Age Rice, Pork tonkatsu
 While waiting for your food try ordering edemame beans...
 and Asahi Beer Perfect!
 Hope to see u there!!!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Pointless review as this place doesn't need any, you can tell by the people queueing up outside even if it is not the place you would want to go in at the first glance.
One of the best value for money in central London I think. I'm almost going there once a week.
Pros:
 - Enormous food portion
 - Good sushi and good hot food (but fried, jap though)
 - So cheap!
 - Shy and reserved but nice staff
 Cons:
 - Busy so take time to go in sometimes (don't have to do the queue for take away though)
 - Not the nicest place, a bit small and dirty, packed
 - Cash only
 At the end, definitely a good place to eat. Maybe not for a romantic dinner, a party or to invit your family I guess.
Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"I know and am very fond of Japanese food, having travelled to Japan very often some years back. The problem is that it can be quite expensive in London.
 We were all the more surprised to discover this establishment in Chinatown, while vaguely thinking about eating Chinese. A cursory glance at the menu (and prices) drew us in straight away.
 Pretty basic and no-frills, but at that price, I don't give a damn.Yakitori starters, followed by sushi and sashimi starters, with plenty of Japanese beer were very enjoyable indeed.
 Seemed to be a lot of students there, which reinforces the cost-effectiveness aspect.
 I don't understand comments from other Qypers who mentioned rude staff. Japanese people do not do rude. And they certainly didn't when we were there.
 Four stars for value.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,2,"Two good things about this place are that the price is inexpensive and the food comes in a large portion. Other than that, I couldn't think of a reason to re-visit.",-1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This is an awesome place for big eaters like me. Even better when I bring my girlfriend along as the portions are so enormous that she can only finish half of hers and I get to eat her remaing portion as well. So dinner always mange to fill me up and get me belly busted taking a full on one and a half portions. I suggest trying the Chicken Katsu Curry and add an omelette on top! The ultimate combination! The restuarant is a casual sort and offer quite a cheap night out. 
Do try to go earlier or later than normal dinner time as there is always a queue (quite long) in front of the shop. You will be reuquired to wait for between 30-45mins depending on the crowd. As a rough gauge, dinner for 2 with drinks cost about Â£15-20.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"I hadn't been here for years and was had a good meal with my Japanese wife and friend. It's cheap for sure and you get tons, it's almost like the Japanese noodle king (bethnal green road). I think for 3 people with a drink each was under Â£20 which in London for satisfying food is pretty amazing.
 What impressed me most was the quality of the Ten Don. Usually this is quite an expensive dish, and even for somewhere in the region of Â£6 it was good enough to go back again for. I wouldn't be against paying double for that in another restaurant.
 Meals starting around Â£4.50 and going up by a few pounds, you're pretty much spoilt for choice since everything seems affordable, and looking around at other tables, everything seems to look pretty tasty too!
 I'd only say 4*s because it's the kind of place that you come away feeling like you've just eaten cheaply, and although I don't want to spend lots of money on every meal, you don't really come away wanting to tell people about the place.. I guess it depends, but I'll be going back in the not to distant future I'm sure!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"love the beef udon and beef rice! they don't charge for 10% service fee and very nice staff ! always long queue and only cash available, but its worth after you tried their tempura!",1

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"I love this Japanese restaurant. A Japanese friend of mine once brought me here and we returned many many times. It gets busy at times, so you might have to wait, but it is worth the wait! In London prices, this is on the budget side of prices, you can get great sushi bento boxes, but they also serve lots of other bento boxes, noodles, rice, etc. etc. Portions are HUGE and being a girl, I could never finish everything on my plate. The staff is nice and friendly. Place is simple, but is def. a great eat. Not for a special romantic dinner or a first date, but for a simple lunch or hanging out  perfect.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This place really doesn't need any reviews as the queue speaks for itself- any weekday a queue snakes out of the door even when it's raining! 
Why, when there are so many excellent japanese places in this part of london? The main attraction has to be the prices- standard for many of the Ramen places but exceptional when you have sushi and sashimi options, tempura and chicken in addition to the Tonkatsu set and other ramen house classics.
I often go for one of the bento options- nicely presented compartmented boxes with a couple of salads, some chicken, some rice and then your option - sashimi or sushi. All the portions are big no matter what you order and the price of a main course ranges from Â£6 for a large rice-based main course to just under Â£9 for a big bento box. And all this just a stone's throw from Leicester Square where everything is poor quality and overpriced!
So you arrive, and size up the queue. It'll take about 25 minutes to get inside. At least another 10 to order and then 10-15 for the first food to arrive. Should you wait? And it's starting to drizzle... 
Of course you should! You won't get better value for your money or better quality japanese food locally!",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"Expect huge portions. If you are tiny, you can probably share a portion of rice with a friend. Taste-wise, the food is ok, nothing spectacular, but you don't really go to Misato for the taste. You go for the portion and the portion alone. For less than a tenner, you leave Misato with a happy tummy. Don't expect five-star environment or service. The place is tiny and the queue is long. Not a first date kind of place.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"This place is BY FAR my favourite Japanese restraunt. The staff are friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and the food-the reason we go to the restraunt obviously, is just AMAZING! Purse friendly. That is all I can say.",1

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Now, I guess most people need to have their mindset refined before visiting Misato - it is a truly no frills restaurant. Imagine a restaurant version of easyjet and you are about there.
 Misato serves fairly decent food, true, you cannot sit there for long before their staff give you the bill, shortly followed by the stare, but for the price charged, I would not honestly expect more in the central London location. Their selection is not bad and the food comes pretty quickly so it does the job - granted the queue can be fairly lengthy if you arrive late, but for those that like cheap Japanese food, I cannot pick a better place in central London.",1
japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,4,"One of my favourite places to have a satisfying and filling meal in London. Quality Japanese food at western sizes, and at great value! If ravenous, go for the chicken katsu, which is massive. They also have pretty good bentos. The crowded atmosphere is like any unstuffy eatery you'd find in the big Asian cities like Hong Kong or Singapore, but then again, the crowd, as many reviewers have said below, speaks for itself.",1

The katsu curry is huge!!!! I dare anyone two eat two of these bad boys..... The shame is, that because I'm a bloke I will always go for the curry. In truth, the sushi is really good, the bento boxes are really swimmingly good, and their tempura is excellent.

japanese,P3k-TuoP7q5j88hoykbKag,Misato,5,"Misato is a cute Japanese restaurant which despite its basic layout, cooks excellent Japanese meals. Within the main streets of China town, in the centre of London, lies a small sized Japanese restaurant that owns queues, of customers, that end outside its door. The traditional cuisines provided such as pork kato curry, chicken teriyaki or katsudor are absolutely amazing. The menu has a trademark salad and I always wonder to myself, how do they concoct such a tasty salad crÃ¨me? What's the recipe ? Give it to me! Another bonus is the price that is as cheap as Â£6.50 which is a bargain considering how large the plates are for such quality foods. You definitely get your moneys worth here as well as your traditional Japanese cooking. What I would suggest is to avoid the busy hours and come in advance such as 1pm or 5pm. No matter what day it is, the food is always in demand because its dishes are 'totemo subarashii' (super duper) and you can even get take away.",1

Ive been to this restaurant several times before because the food is very good value for the portion size but today I vowed that I will never go to Misato again. The staff must have some basic English yet they behave as if theyre mute, they dont seem to know the meaning of the word MANNERS as they do not greet customers and youd think theyd get shot if they were to manage a smile and a hello, instead they can just about mumble How many? as they point to the table. When you order theyre not attentive, the waitress today didnt have the common sense to think that as there were 2 of us that wed both want drinks, so several minutes after my partner got his drink, I brought this issue to her attention and she just rolled her eyes, didnt apologise and then just dumped the drink infront of me. Then when my partner had just about finished his meal the waitress quickly grabbed his plate away before he barely had the chance to put his chopsticks down! Keep in mind this wasnt peak time, it was mid afternoon and there wasnt the usual long queue and lack of seats. Then to top it all off, when the bill came the waitress gave us the wrong change and when we approached her about it she just slapped it onto my hand, again no apology, no thank you, no goodbye etc etc. If the staff were somewhat nice then I may have just left them the 5 Pounds as a tip but theyre not even worthy of 1p!!!

Got seated outside.. while there were open tables indoors- (80% empty) - was told they have big groups reserved for the day. Not a big deal- but was surprise that two guys could not get squeezed in, it blessing in disguise- the one out door table was not bad. (for the record when we left - restaurant was still half empty. We also got the rookie server) 
The food was okay- it didn't do justice to their pictorial menu. (If you're going to glamor shot your menu and present it to guest- I suggest you make sure the kitchen executes) - that menu is one if the best I have seen- so might be a little unfair to kitchen to set that expectation. 
We ordered the Gala menu and a chirashi bowl- I enjoyed the bowls. Sushi was so-so and ""sticks"" were only okay. I
Overall - it's a good spot for showy first dates and client dinners. But the service we received felt perfunctory and I think we got dismissed as riff raff by the staff.",-1

About the food:
Ebi bites- was ok. Didn't have much of a flavor of anything
Mamma Mia & Ebi Panko maki - loved the rolls. Can't wait to go back and try more of the maki

I am no expert on sushi, but I thought it was good. However, my sushi had a little too much rice than what I am used to.

First off, from our experience and what we were told, the Covent Garden location is packed, all the time. We came during the week and it was mayhem. So just know this before planning - we snuck some bar seats after a while.
On to the food - the menu is huge! We grabbed a variety of stuff.
Grilled avocado - delicious starter
Seaweed salad - overpriced, I'd skip it.
Spicy edamame - awesome, done perfectly
Spicy miso soup - with salmon and shiitake! Wow!
We then ordered the ""perfect day"" menu combo for two, and it was amazing! Also, they put all sauces on the side since I hate mayonnaise. Here are the highlights -
Crab croquettes were crazy good. Super crispy and not too gooey.
Spicy tuna maki - perfect amount of spicy, and not too much rice.
Seared salmon tataki was good, not that memorable
All nigiri was fresh and delicious (tuna especially)
The yakitori was good, not amazing. The chicken meatballs were by far the best.
An awesome spot! Very good service and lots to choose from.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,This is my favorite sushi place in London. There are a variety of choices and they all taste legit! Our favorite is the black cod stick.,1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Great sushi with some delicious variations on your typical sushi dishes.  Sampled a few of their 'sticks'.  Great flavors and unusual dishes for a sushi restaurant.  The asparagus with bacon was fantastic.  Veal.....meh.  Had to send first one back due to the grizzly texture that made it inedible.  Server quickly replaced it, but was duly unimpressed even with the more tender version.  Amazing place over all and worth a visit.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Yum. Did not disappoint. Love the tuna tartar, salmon carpaccio, and the skewers and vegetables. The broccoli was so delicious!!!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Try the Green Grass Salad!!!  It's incredible and the name doesn't do it justice. We started with that, had great sushi, and then finished with another Green Grass Salad because we loved it so much. We sat in the basement and found it rather warm.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"I was strolling around Covent Garden with my best buddy and a sleeping baby and we realized this was the perfect window to grab lunch somewhere a little nicer. I was pubbed out, and sushi sounded perfect.
Sticks'n'Sushi is a seriously swanky lunch place.  In Toronto, where I hail from, there is a spectrum of types of sushi restaurants. In lovely Londontown, but it appears there are only cheap sushi places or fancy shmancy ones.
Due to the shmance, I was a bit sheepish about bringing a baby, but after cuddling up in a corner with some sake I was soon over it. She woke up, she watched an ipad and ate lots of rice and soya. No one seemed to care. Everything was fresh, beautifully presented, and yes, very pricy.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,Delicious food  and the service was excellent. Also Price  was reasonable. The ambience and the servers were attentive as the environment was very clean.,1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"The sushi restaurant was quickly booked via the website. We could easily take our table. The atmosphere is relaxed. Maybe a little dark to study the menu. The waitress is very nice. The selection large. All in all, the sushi tasted great. However, I could enjoy much better sushi's. Overall, however, a good impression.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,Group of 16. We split the 9 kids in a separate table across the restaurant. 5 stars for that alone! Menu is huge! Saki is fantastic. They have creative sushi choices they were yummy. What they don't have is Unagi (eel). Apparently endangered and not allowed in London. That is not the case in Paris or the States. Seemed odd but whatever. Didn't take away from the ambiance and the great food. The adults sat in the very front by the door and had no issues with being cold or traffic. Even our people with dairy and gluten allergies found food they loved.,1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"The day we had a reservation here we got an email that their grill broke and they couldn't make the sticks. We decided to come anyway. It turns out they use their grill to make a lot of other things besides the sticks and the menu was basically cut in half.  That really put a damper on things. We just ordered a few rolls and an appetizer and some drinks. The cauliflower was good, the rolls were good, the drinks were good. Nothing great or memorable. Oh well!",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Love it!  yummy food, reasonably priced.
Nothing fancy but good value for the money. You can order from the menu, or just pick up food from the conveyor belt. I would come here again. Also, I would advise to call ahead of time and check if they are open.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"If you're looking for great Japanese cuisine near Covent Garden, Sticks'n'Sushi is the place for you.
We were 7 guests and we were welcomed by a very friendly waiter who tried to speak French to us, which was as cute as funny. We were given oshiboris to freshen up our hands moments after we arrived.  
The menu features detailed pictures of every dish, so it is very easily understandable, even for non-English speakers. 
The yakitoris were perfectly cooked, the sushis, nigiris and makis were succulent and the fish dishes were so fresh that we even found a scale chip on a slice of salmon. 
I definitely recommend this place to anyone willing to have an unforgettable Japanese experience in the heart of London.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"I can echo Alex's review. However what I loved about this sushi menu is that you can be strategic. I went on my own for a little treat before the theatre. I was able to order two rolls and an app and not break the bank. 
The daikon roll is cheap and flavorful. I loved the fried shrimp starter too.
The staff was really friendly with explaining their menu, which is more like a photo album. 
Will go back to try more things!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"This was my first visit to Sticks'n'Sushi and it certainly won't be my last. Upon arriving at Sticks n Sushi, the first impression is of a modern environment. All of the streamlined furniture amidst the rustic backdrop of brick walls and wooden floors give the entire restaurant a homey feeling. Not only that, but I was greeted by a friendly staff that was happy to show me to my seat and advise menu items based on my preferences. They were always prompt with their service and everyone was very personable.
When I first looked at the menu, I saw several options that I wanted to try. With the staff's recommendation, I started off with ebi bites. The ebi bites were brilliantly mouth watering. Featuring shrimp with several spices to bring out their flavor, the ebi bites were a an excellent start an excellent meal. My friends and I chose the Four Meal Drive Big (6 types of nigiri and 6 of maki)  to share, we began with the nigiri selection. I sampled each of the 6 nigiri - the salmon and seared seabass being my favourites. Among the maki selection preferred the spicy tuna and salmon ceviche. On to the dessert we couldn't help but choose the taster, which consisted of 12 different kinds of sweet delights! The mochi ice cream, yuzu sorbet and creme brulee were definitely the standouts for me. 
The entire night was full of great service, excellent food and certainly left a wonderful impression. A must-visit for anyone in the area who loves sushi.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Great, fresh, flavorful food. The cooked meats were suuuuper good too! Awesome ambience, good crowd of tourists and locals.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,2,"This restaurant is ok and mediocre at best. They brought out the ""bites"" (starters) with the main meal. I ordered the mackerel but ended up with salmon. It had no flavor and was challenging to break apart. The average and the rib eye with herb butter was well seasoned but very small. The spicy miso soup was not spicy yet had good flavor. Overall overpriced and not worth it.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,Really amazing food experience here. Get some of their set menu pieces because everything they bring out is delightful. Staff is somewhat aloof but when they actually attend to you - they're pretty helpful.,1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,2,"The hype brought me in, It was Packed!, we almost didn't get a table (make a reservation ahead) I love that they offer a unique sushi/menu selection, What we tried was good overall. The lack of stars is for our server, She was extremely rude and condescending, I wish I remembered her name, she was super short and had a dark tan with black/maybe black and ombrÃ© hair. She totally ignored my guest like they weren't even there and had a super snippy/sheisty tone the whole night ( bad attitude overall and skipping on refilling my guest while making sure my drink was filled the whole time, She almost entirely ruined our experience here.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"Friendly staff. The place felt very hip and trendy. However the food is only mediocre. I ordered 5 sticks (pork belly, wagyu beef, oyster mushroom, blackened cod, and scallops wrapped in bacon). In general, my sticks were not even hot, just luck warm. The cod was a bit disappointing - I definitely had it better at other Japanese restaurants. The pork belly and the oyster mushroom were good. The scallops and the wagyu beef were ok, but nothing special. I would recommend the place for its ""trendiness"" and it's location, but not for its food.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Wow! Best sushi I ever had and for a reasonable London price! 
This place was recommended by a local to me and I am so happy to have been here. I tried many different veggie makis and inside-outs as well as the cauliflower in truffle. Wow! 
Friendliest service, food came quick. Busy place suiting everybody. Will be back for sure! 
Paid ~100Â£ in total for 3 people including drinks.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"I have been to three Sticks N Sushi locations, including Wimbledon, Cambridge and this one. And all three have the same consistency, albeit different ambience. 
All sushi at Sticks n Sushi is amazing. However, there are other items that really stand out. For instance, their Ebi Bites are incredible (Shrimp tempura with chilli and coriander). The Hotate Kataifi (scallops) melt in your mouth delicious. The Black Cod and Wagyu Yaki are divine. 
If you like to drink, they have an amazingly fragrant sake a la prosecco which I quite like, but just a fair warning, it goes down very easy, much like everything else at this restaurant. 
Happy sushing!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"We wanted good sushi while in London for Christmas holiday and read about this popular spot.  I was little skeptical being multi-location.  There was a good vibe here.  As far the food, we ordered a wide assortment of sushi, sashimi and sticks (skewers).   I enjoyed the sashimi platter, sister of sushi, with tasting fish but the pieces were a bit small.   My family liked the Hell's Kitchen and NYC roll both variation of the shrimp tempura roll.  We tried different sticks and liked the wagyu and chicken meatballs best.  The menu is a bit overwhelming and waitress did not offer much help.  Overall, the food was solid but not outstanding.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,Sticks n sushi is one of the best sushi I had. We ordered the tuna tartar and miso soup and edamame for starters. And a big plate of sushi maki and cucumber skin roll and sashimi. It was very good!! Great service. Our waiter was very nice. A little bit pricey but the place food and service worth it!!,1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Yummy food and so much space for seating. The food comes out so quick, literally 5 mins after we ordered.

Great sashimi  platters with a fresh and modern twist
Delicious sushi  selections with impressively creative options including duck, caviar and waggyu beef ! 
The setting is beautiful and the ambience really chill and relaxed, cool music  
Totally recommend",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Happened into this place, and they happened to have space at the bar. One of the best menus I've ever seen. Both salads we had were amazing. Tried two of the edamames and several of the sticks. Will have to come back for sushi!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Danish sushi chain, why not?  The food is decidedly Japanese but with a strong dose of Western bravado. If you're looking for the normal subtleties of Japanese cuisine, you're barking up the wrong Scandinavian tree. But don't let that deter you. Sushi N Sticks is loud on cool wood design and big flavours. 
A copious meal for two with drinks came to Â£99. The menu is a beautifully photographed but slightly ridiculous (and overwhelming long) menu of sushi, yakitori and other bits and bobs of Japanese food items. There is a shorter book of preset menus to help those who can't muster the energy to work through the main menu. 
We had:
Grilled and green salad:  there must be something ridiculous like 20 ingredients in the salad. It's pretty to look at and topped with a bold salad dressing. I enjoyed this but my eating partner found it too strong. 
Spare ribs:  delicious! Fall off the bone meat coated in a super tasty sauce
An assortment of sushi rolls:    
- crab coal sushi roll was with black coal rice which was a cool contrast to the normal white. I didn't really like this as much as my friend. I thought there were too many things trying to happen at the same time.
- Hells Kitchen Roll:  I was slightly apprehensive about the BBQ sauce but I liked this roll. Pretty to look at, tasty to eat
- crispy ebi roll:  this was my favourite. I thought the shrimp and the crunch came through really well to contrast with the rice
We also had two smaller rolls which were good but not necessarily outstanding (ebi and chilli and salmon and scallion). 
Our waiter was awesome. He was a bearded Asian guy with a fab smile and friendly demeanour. Why can't all service in London be like this?",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"I think the concept of this place is genius; it's a true crowd pleaser and a fun dining experience. I went here on a Sunday night and the place was bumping - which I liked. Service was great and the food was good. We got a sampling of pretty much everything and I liked it all except the fried bacon wrapped cheese - this was just a bit.... gross to me. But thankfully there were many more ""fresher"" options for me to choose from. Although the sushi was not the best I have ever had, it was good and the roll combos are creative and fun. A good place for a fun night out and a great place for groups as there is truly something of everyone.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Probably the best sushi I have ever had! It was great to eat here after having sushi from Yo! Sushi the previous week. The inside of the restaurant is modern and comfortable. Servers are friendly and very helpful. 
My fiend and I ordered a large plate that we shared. A little pricy but very worth it. The shared plate of a variety of sushi was plenty for both of us. Served on a layer of ice, you could smell the freshness. 
The sushi tasted extremely fresh and we could tell that it was just made, maybe even just caught from the water! The fish was extremely fresh and did not taste too fishy or old. I'm not a big raw fish eater, but this restaurant was a great place for lunch. If you want some great sushi, go here.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"This place was delicious! It's pricey so I don't know if I'd be able to come here again unless it was a special occasion, but I was visiting London for a few days and I decided that I wanted to try some good Japanese food. First about the ambience: it's a very modern, sleek, and clean design. I think that if you're a fan of minimalistic design and you like the dim lights, it's perfect for you (I tend to like that kind of design as well). Oh, also, they have beautiful pictures displaying their menu items so it really gets you excited for the food.
My friend and I wound up getting three dishes: the rice paper (it's a unique roll with duck), the salmon sashimi, and a dish called man food. My friend got the rice paper and couldn't stop raving about it. It didn't fill her up, but she had already eaten and said that the flavors were delicious. The salmon sashimi was actually my first time eating sashimi and it was pretty good, though I have no reference points so I can't say much about this. My main dish was the man food dish which provided me with a ton of different meat on sticks (duck, beef, chicken) as well as some ribs. All of this meat was fantastic and even though it cost quite a bit, it was delicious and filled my craving for meat. It also came with edamame and rice which was a nice touch (I love edamame). Overall, this place was wonderful and it gets a solid 4 stars and would be 5 if their prices weren't so freaking high.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"I had high expectations from this place as I saw some great photos from here so I knew I needed to come try it out! I went for 3 sushi rolls (16 pieces!), including Rainbow Roll, Crispy Ebi Roll and just a normal salmon and cucumber roll. Also had some cooked duck breast with Apple sauce. Of course I had some sticks too, pork belly and sweet potato. 
The food was tasty, but not that authentic Japanese food (nothing compared to the food I ate in Japan). The restaurant was very busy and very loud! The waiter I had was lovely! 
I probably won't be going back unless my dining partners want to... However I would recommend everyone to go visit this restaurant at least once! 
Overall, I give this restaurant a 7/10. Paid Â£75 for 2 people.

japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Definitely a must try for London sushi. Went to Nobu the next night and honestly thought this was better. The vibes were great with fun decor and architecture. 
I liked how it was more Asian fusion than just sushi but don't worry, the sushi was still top notch. Will definitely be back.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Ever since my friend told me about this amazing sushi place I had to pay a visit! I finally managed to get some time and off I ventured out for lunch. 
Been scoping the menu online so I knew what to expect when I got there and could just order my food. The interior is beautiful, high ceilings, they have two entrances making life a lot easier, beaming with light, nice black tables with comfy seating, and eyes staring at you from the walls. The menu once presented immaculate, the waiters and waitresses are a joy, they give you the best advice and what to choose. The food is presented really well too. 
Nothing is amissed. The spicy edamame is the best I have had!! It's so modish, juicy packed with an abundance of flavour. For drink I opted for the rhubarb fizz as it was only 12 noon when I had arrives. 
For sushi I think I played it a bit safe, I didn't want to overeat and have food left, I don't like leftovers. So I opted for the hand rolls, veggie and crunchy. I'm not usually a fan because of the seaweed but wow these ones are beautiful, the seaweed is not even noticed, packed with loads of flavour and sauce inside till the end. Matched with the Wasabi, soya and pickled ginger I could eat that all day. Only little hitch is that it does make your mouth dry, the seaweed I mean once it gets caught on your lips. But that is so minor!!
Then I opted for sticks, a variety of mixed yasai yakitori, chicken wing, tsukune and grilled oyster mushroom. I loved them all apart from the wing, even though the skin was nice and crispy, the whole thing lacked flavour. It was just a wing, nothing special which was a let down. However the tsukune (chicken meatball) was delicious, cooked to perfection and could taste all the spices and less of the chicken which is what you want. The vegetables accompanied the meat very well and the sauces of yakitori and teriyaki was perfect and the extra lemon slice goes a long way. 
Service was very attentive, always making sure I was ok and the food was up to scratch. I wish I had stayed for dessert but will definitely go back again and be more adventurous and perhaps take a date so can share a lot of dishes. 
Price is not too bad either, it's a beautiful place. Highly recommend it. 
Make sure you book in advance though, I was lucky to get a table during lunchtime, they were pretty packed! Even for a Thursday!!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Great sushi!! They also have meat skewers of all kinds. Really good/ quick service. In a fun area of London, right next to Trafalgar Square. Try to make reservations ahead of time! We had to sit at bar but still worth it",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Sticks and Sushi was highly recommended to me by my friend I was staying with in London this weekend. I live in San Diego CA and my friends from home told me I should check out Sushi Samba but he said that was very touristy, hard to get a reservation and the food at S&S was much better.  Now I eat a lot of sushi and sashimi and I am beyond impressed with the food I had at S&S.
First of all we had a very nice server by the name of Sebastian who was from Denmark, my friend let him know it was my Birthday and he wished me a happy birthday.  He walked us through both menus, took our drink orders and gave us some time to look through the menu.  I could have ordered everything, it all sounded delicious and their menus are mini booklets with a photograph of each option next to the bite and description.  I've never seen a menu like that before, it's a great idea as it makes everything look and sound more appetizing.  We picked out several things we wanted and out of that Sebastian gave us his recommendations and I'm glad we listened.
We started with edamame, you can never go wrong with that, we had the plain but they offer a spicy option.  Next we had the tuna tartare which was my favorite bite out of everything we had on this day, it had pine nuts, avocado, was full of flavor and truly was to die for.  Next we went for rolls, I chose the salmon rice paper roll which was a very neat concept and something I've never had before.  It was more of a wrap, it had lettuce, carrots, cucumber and shrimp tempura (light on the batter side) all wrapped up in rice paper and then sliced into 6 pieces.  I personally avoid to many rolls with rice so this was a perfect option for me.  We also had the gipsy big roll which was very good then we had one of the small tuna chilli rolls.
I wanted more and if I come back I really would like to try their mini sides of vegtables.  From looking at the pictures the oyster mushrooms looked good along with the cauliflower, broccoli and mini corn on the cobs.
We didn't have cocktails as we had a busy day ahead but they have a variety of cocktails, beers and non-alcoholic beverages. 
I highly recommend Sticks and sushi for their service, atmosphere, food and my favorite part...looking through their cool menu booklet with the pictures!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"For me it's one of the best sushi chains in London and it didn't even open up its first restaurant in London but Denmark. 
Even during the busy Christmas season for our annual Christmas lunch, high quality of food and service delivers. 
We started with some soy cured salmon with minced shiitake mushrooms. The salmon was beautiful and rich in flavour. The texture was smooth and the minced mushroom was a lovely companion adding more depth and silkiness. An excellent start. 
Next was the Japanese potato salad, a lovely simple potato mash contrasted nicely with the crunchy vegetables of carrots, cucumber and onions. Tasty light and healthy.
The salmon and avocado maki were perfect. The rice cooked well and held perfectly when you held it. The flavour of the silky rich salmon shone straight through the roll. Quality right there.
The only dish that didn't tickle my tastebuds was the green salad. It was too dry for my liking, too crunchy with the softer quinoa being lost in there. More softer leaves would have been preferred for a more equal texture so the avocado could be enjoyed and played its role.
Amongst us all we also ordered a  sharing platter from the set menu. We chose the Upgrade platter that came with a variety of rolls and meat on sticks. Beautiful glistening sushi, all so incredibly fresh and the rolls were paired so well with the ingredients it came with too, all perfectly balanced in texture and flavour. So much creativity. 
The sticks consisted of fresh tender flakey pieces of tuna, flavoursome, herby chicken meatballs and succulent juicy lamb chops. All delightful.
Last to arrive in the savouries were the scallops in a light kataifi pastry. The texture was amazing. A light crispy pastry incasing a fresh and bouncy scallop with burst of saltiness from the trout roe for that little extra bit of joy!
Dessert could have been the steal of the show itself. All presented beautifully and made with such creative flavours, fusing Japanese and Western flavours together. We had the coconut cake, creme brÃ»lÃ©e, dark chocolate fondant, dark chocolate and sesame balls and vanilla icecream. All delicious and was the perfect ending to dinner.
I cannot recommend Sticks n Sushi enough. The atmosphere is fantastic, romantic and sleek as well as being child friendly. Bar seating downstairs for those who want to watch the chefs at work or large group tables for families and celebration. They have everyone covered. Of course the food is fantastic, of the highest quality and staff are trained to be knowledgable and as friendly as could be.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"I'm very picky when it comes to sushi, and I'm always careful when traveling. I came across this place while being in the neighbourhood and the good reviews lead me to give it a try. I'm glad I did! Everything was SO fresh and so good! The restaurant is beautiful, their menu is endless and literally everything is worth the price!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"A great dining experience. We were first seated at the bar directly in front of the grill which was hot as hell but once we were moved a couple seats down things became more comfortable. The waitstaff was helpful and the menu itself somehow achieved that rare balance between being visually appealing and informative. It's anomalous to say the least. 
The wait for the sashimi combo was more than 45 minutes but since I was able to drown my sorrows in champagne it didn't matter too much. The only reason I had to knock a star off was that we were told it would be right out something like 15 minutes in, but ended up still having a lengthy wait. Aside from that minor incident, presentation, freshness, and level of service were all exemplary. From apps to drinks to sushi to sashimi to dessert and whatever else came our way, I was impressed. I wish we had tried the sticks.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"I needed 24 hours to think prior to rating Sticks n Sushi's food.  Overall, for the prices they charge, three stars represent a very generous rating.  Here we go:
- Sushi - I had Hells Kitchen roll (maki).  The tuna it was topped with was anemic and laked the intense color of a good sushi grade tuna.  The tempura shrimp that is in the roll has more tempura than shrimp and was overcooked.  2.5 stars.
- Yakitori - overall rating 3 stars. Individually, some sticks were better than others but none exceeded the above rating.  ALL skewers were overcooked!  I had two different steak sticks and on both steak was well done (overcooked). Same was the case with pork w/basil, chicken w/chili and bacon wrapped swiss cheese.
The service was very friendly and efficient which is the main reason the rating score is not lower.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"I like this restaurant, salmon are very fresh and tasty. I will go to next time, but really need reservation especially at the weekend, even the lunch.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Sushi restaurants are popping up all over the place at the moment, which is great. The problem is lots pop up that are not so great...Stick n Sushi is not one of them! Considering it's in the middle of Covent Garden it is also one of the best value Sushi Restaurants around!
It's a great modern setting, with great service which is always important. But as usual it's all about the food for me! 
Sticks n Sushi has a great menu...delicious sushi, along with some great meat sticks which is what makes these guys a bit different.
Make sure you share as there is so much to choose from, and you don't want to miss out. Some of my favourites include...
Sashimi Mix
Ebi bites
Yakiniku steak
Sushi Rolls-Mix it up, we love Duck and Crab the best
Spare Ribs
Emmental in Bacon sticks
Black Cod sticks
Scallop in Bacon sticks
That will give you a great mix, but go for what you like..it's all good!
The sticks are really good, but don't go overboard as the usual suspects on the menu are great. 
Sticks n Sushi also has a great cocktail menu, so try and wok your way through them as well!
Go with at least 3 other people, and give yourself a couple of hours to enjoy the place!",1

- very fresh sushi, good variety, big menu
- good value for money
- big place, very cosy 
- enjoyed the salmon ceviche and hotate sushi
Cons
- Sake in their soya sauce - watch out non alcoholics 
- uncomfortable chairs downstairs; not good for chubby and fat people 
-waitress kept touching my sushi when explaining",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"I was pretty impressed with Stick N Sushi. We ended up ordering a combo plate for two so we could try both sticks and sushi. They brought out the cold (sushi) part first, which involved a couple rolls and the four common nigiri you'd expect: salmon, tuna, shrimp, and sea bass (I think sea bass is common - the others definitely are!). Anyway, everything was fresh and tasty. 
Next came the skewers, and I have to admit, although I was more excited for the sushi, the skewers were really good! Chicken teriyaki, pork belly, and chicken meatballs were all excellent, and it was all the right amount of food in the end. I was full, but not overly stuffed. 
The food came quickly, but it took a little while to actually order - it was incredibly busy, and we didn't have a reservation, so I wasn't too disappointed by that, and the food and drinks more than made up for it. I'd go back, which is the main thing I look for in a restaurant!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,2,"The restaurant is beautifully designed and the shape and use of the shared tables are brilliant.  You are certainly impressed when walking in, and equally so (if a bit overwhelmed) by the massive but beautifully photographed menu.  So my disdain for the crass name of the restaurant quickly disappeared... yes for that 1 second I was being a complete restaurant snob. 
Anyway as I reminded myself that I am sometimes partial to a McDonald's cheeseburger we proceeded on our way through a few snacks and a few platters.  The sushi was not bad nor was the teriyaki.  However the more and more I continued through the meal there was this absolute feeling that we were being fed ""Japanese"" inspired food by people who didn't really get Japanese food.  The constant yelling of Irasshaimase in a very un-Japanese restaurant grated on me even more as I put another mouthful of soulless food in my mouth. 
I get that it's Japanese with a Danish touch, and the food isn't bad - neither the sushi nor the teriyaki were bad, a notch above Yo Sushi or Wasabi.  But I'm not going to be conned by the great decor here.  
Fish quality was distinctly average and seasoning was all over the place, often meat would not be seasoned enough and batter would be over-seasoned.  But it's ok the distinctly average fish and seafood would be smothered in a spicy mayo so any semblance of natural sweet ocean freshness was gone, scallops tasted like shrimp etc. etc. Perhaps the most underrated part of sushi is the rice.  I'm sorry but if the rice is not fluffy and bouncy or even seasoned correctly then you shouldn't be charging these prices. 
And this is my biggest grief with Sticks and Sushi.  I feel like I've been conned with the beautiful decor and menu.  The food is a notch above your average London high street sushi place (and the quality of sushi in London is not great in general), yes a single notch.  We paid Â£120 for 2 at lunch (with 2 beers and 2 cocktails) for very average soulless food.  Staggering!  It saddens me to think that restaurants like this who focus on image and looks more than the food itself can become popular.  And don't get me started on that melted cheese wrapped with ham on a stick.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,2,"Sushi was lovely, sashimi and tepenyaki were all undeniably good. But I was extremely disappointed by the arrogant attitude of the waiting team, the tricks playing around the waiting system, and the way they manage customer makes me felling like idiot. It is one of those tricky restaurant that I am feeling being fooled. 
We walked in, didn't book. The host by door told us will take us to the bar and having few drinks till the table is available. I certainly respect that and have no problem to wait. As soon as we were led to the bar, the waiter told us will be dinning at bar. To be honest I have no problem to eat on bar, but I hate the way they lie, this waiter was right standing at the door with the host. I wish to point out that there were plenty seats at that time, and I respect that reservation goes first so that I nicely asked if we could wait in case there are free tables. Anyway that never happened. 
We felt exhausted and hated the service.",-1

It's a place MUST GO! You and you friends will for sure have already time there.
Food was so nicely done and you can tell the chef really cared about the style and flavour of the each plate brought out.
Don't go for the big plates of sushi/sashimi for share, try the small plates such as grills, tempura, caviar and those creativity dishes. They WILL BLOW YOU MIND!
In addition, their cocktails are amazing as well!

japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,Good restaurant all round from service to food to decor.The chicken wings skewers were fantastic and the sake also tasted pretty good. I think this venue is probably better for a smaller group or even just for two people so you can sit side by side at the sushi bar area downstairs.,1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"Brilliant, efficient and enthusiastic service. Why couldn't everything meet the same standard? I love that one of our waiters took the time to explain to us which fish are currently sustainable, the ethical element really added to the experience. 
Sadly there were some issues, and for the price, I'd expect a little better. Firstly, our drinks: the glasses were all wet, and had been garnished with an old lime peel. It really should have been freshly cut. The menus were also dirty, which is a shame because they're so nicely designed! It's just poor attention to detail.
The positioning of the tables isn't good. There is not a clear route through the ground level of the restaurant, which lead other customers to squeeze between tables. We really had to keep an eye on our water glasses, in case of rouge butts and elbows! 
So as for the main event : the food, they have a huge selection, so it felt a bit like ordering from a canteen. The dishes we tried included the scallops, Jerusalem artichoke, sashimi selection and avocado nigiri. The artichoke and crab balls were a bit too salty and the nigiri did not hold together well. The quality of the fish overall, was not great.
Sushi in London is often disappointing, and I think that this place falls in to that category. But I will say that it is  better than many others.",-1

japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Popped by for a brief dinner, and the food was great but the service was very disorganised. 
We had time for only small dishes. I went for an 8pcs plate of rainbow rolls. The ingredients were very fresh which I appreciated. However, perhaps it was too fresh -- the rolls disintegrated very easily and I would have expected better, neater rolls than that from a restaurant of this price range.
Service, once again, was very disorganised. They messed up my friend's plate, and it took them some prodding to finally bring it out. 
Ambience was quite nice. A bit noisy, but posh enough for dates. 
I'd go back to try out some of the other dishes -- the menu looked good. I do hope their service will have improved by then.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"I am an avid lover of SUSHI! 
I was recommended Sticks and Sushi by a friend, again very chic and modern (slightly pretentious). 
Cocktails are lovely, mostly made with Japanese influenced alcohol, including sake. 
There is a lot of varieties on the menu from ramen to raw fish sushi and steak fillet sushi. 
For starters I had the scallops placed in a light batter with a mustard base sauce. Very pleasing for the pallet.
The food is beautiful presented, for mains we ordered a variety of sushi fish based mains. I'd personally pick out a dish on every page of the menu to give yourself variety and a choice of flavours. Throughly enjoyed my experience and the food was definitely vibrant and flavoursome. 
HIGHLY recommend sushi lovers to visit, the only downside to the restaurant is that is very pricey.
Don't be afraid to add a pinch of wasabi to your sushi!",1

The food was average. The famous skewers were nothing special and there was some weird flavours. Desserts was OK but I'm not a sweet tooth so not gonna comment too much.
The bill was very expensive as well. Too overpriced for what was offered.
Staff were very friendly and helpful though even though it was very busy.
The place was OK, but I'm not desperate to come back here any time soon.",-1

japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"This was a solid 3 star experience. 
Things they did well: The service. We were seated promptly. Someone took our coats. Our waitress walked us through the extensive menu, made some suggestions, and continued to check back in on us throughout the meal. Can't say anything bad about the staff or the service. 
Things that were just ""okay"": The food. My boyfriend and I split the tuna tartare, which didn't taste like a whole heck of a lot. In fact, it sort of tasted like it has been sitting in a refrigerator for a while. The tuna as well wasn't a great cut, it was hard to pull it into bit size pieces. 
My boyfriend ordered one of the sushi platters. He said it was ""pretty good"". It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. 
I ordered a few of the ""sticks"" - oysters wrapped in bacon, grilled vegetables, and salmon. The oysters came without the bacon, and instead of a ""miso butter"" were smothered in teryaki sauce. So was the rest of it. I was hoping for that smoky Japanese grill taste but it was really just speared meat and vegetables slathered in really sweet teryaki. I was kinda bummed. 
All in all, it was affordable and the service was prompt, but the food was just average. Beats the other chains in the tourist swarmed Covent Garden area but I wasn't mega",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"So much yes for SticksNSushi! 
I have mad love for any place who can sit two overdressed and under-dated ladies on a Saturday night sans reservations, so... props guys! 
The lowdown as follows: had a crapton of sashimi, because carbs before marbs are the death of my social life, and it was sensational. 
Also had a few ""sticks"" and non sushi items, including this cauliflower thing with truffle that was excellent, and a lamb with miso and butter stick (very good) a beef with garlic stick (good, tad chewy), an emmenthal and bacon (oh mother) and some rolls, including the Shake Daikon (good) and a hell's kitchen roll. 
Now I'm reading all of this, and what the actual fuck did I write that whole thing about carbs if I was going to order an entire wagon of food? Who knows anymore. 
Anyway, the place is LOVELY and their menu is easily the most visually stunning I've seen in mah laaaaaf. Seriously. Great place, shall return upon becoming thin again.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"If you want proper Japanese food you've likely come to the wrong place. It's not a bad thing though!! It's just that the portions are relatively small compared to some other Japanese places that I've been to that were priced the same. THAT BEING SAID, their food is really good and they have such a wide variety of things to choose from! I also love their popped rice dessert and the sesame chocolate truffle thing. I think it's ideal for group dinners cause then you can order a selection platter - which is probably more cost effective - and share all sorts without having to order a bunch of small portions.",1

So don't come to late, the kitchen doesn't forgive any minute.
Otherwise very high recommended.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Copenhagen's finest Japanese cuisine is now available in...Covent Garden? Come again? The Danes are known for many things: great design, Lego-blocks, and even the little mermaid....but sushi....isn't Copenhagen a bit far from Tokyo? The thought of going to a Danish Japanese restaurant in Central London shows how truly global we've become.
Nevertheless the concept of this hip Nordic chain of Japanese fusion restaurants works rather well. This location (apparently the first London location was Wimbledon, yes, Wimbledon really) that oozes Scandi-cool---think clean lines, high ceilings, stark colours, lots of exposed wood, and unusually shaped communal tables. 
Once you navigate through the complicated menu (it's almost comical how complicated it is...way too many choices of set menus and individual items on offer, all slightly oddly named...it took a bit of explaining from the waitress on how it all worked), you're in for a treat as the food does impress. 
The main premise here is quality sushi combined with an assortment of grilled ""sticks"" which are skewers of meats and fish. I shared the ""upgrade"" set menu with a friend. For about Â£60 you got an assortment of rolls, several delicious slices of salmon carpaccio, and skewers of shrimp, chicken and tuna. The salmon in particular with its fusion-y sauce was a highlight as were the rice paper wrapped duck rolls. The skewers were ok but not super memorable; I expected more from the chicken wing skewers. Surprisingly the side of broccoli was amazing, some of the best broccoli I've ever had. I definitely need to figure out how to make it at home. While Â£60 sounds steep (Â£30/person), it actually is a lot of food, no room for dessert!
There is also a nice selection of fusion cocktails and Japanese whiskeys on offer though they're on the pricey side (Yamazaki 18, a great whisky to try for sure, but at Â£35 a go is excessively steep).
4 stars overall, worth the trip even if just to try their Danish take on Japanese cuisine.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"Well worth the wait for the sashimi. Excellent taste and strong wasabi made it one of the best I've ever eaten. Would definitely recommend! The sushi rice, in particular, were amazing.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"I ended up at this place on a whim when I was wondering Covent Garden looking fit some grub, and may have gotten a bit over excited when I saw sushi! I wasn't disappointed though, and could quickly see why it was such a popular restaurant. There wasn't any space for us to sit at the main restaurant, so we went for the bar menu. To be honest, it was more than enough! We went for one of the sharing plates for two, which had an array of sushi rolls. A little on the pricey side, but there was plenty of food and we ended up having to take the left overs home as we couldn't finish it between the two of us. The staff were a little slow (I think it was a busy night), but very polite. Definitely a place to go if you want to treat yourself (or someone else).",1

Definitely the best sushi place in London!",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"I absolutely loved the place. I believe service and the setting are almost as important as food and it counts in my notation of a place as I find it hard to enjoy good food in a discouraging environment. Well, Stick n Sushi got that admirably. 
When coming in you can't fail to notice the interior design. Subdued light, wooden furniture in sometimes funny shapes, dark dark dark (I like dark). It's big on the ground floor and there is even more sitting downstairs. The wooden chairs are comfortable
You're welcomed at the entrance by a waitress/waiter. We had the chance to find a table for 4 within minutes but they recommend you make a reservation for they are packed even with so many tables available. It's a hot spot and it's in the heart of Covent Garden. 
Our waiter came to introduce himself. He was jovial, kind and very energetic, we had a good time with him. He even summoned all the remaining french he could find within him to chat with my parents. He was very thoughtful without over doing it. He helped and advised us on the huge menu.
Speaking of the menu.
You'll find anything and everything from roasted cauliflower, edamame (nicely roasted in a spicy sticky sauce and tasty) and broccoli to teriyaki (meat sticks), nigiri sushis, makis, meat and salads. 
We tried a bit of everything.
I had the kimchi, the black cod dragon roll, the shake daikon and the panko breaded duck. I found the kimchi too salty and too full of flavour, but I had wanted to try it for a while. It's fermented vegetables so obviously, it would taste strong. The black cod dragon roll was my favourite and it's worth its Â£12. Flavours are well put together and it's melting in your mouth. The shake daikon is an interesting concept. It's a maki roll but they replaced the rice and the seaweed with a sort of radish (the daikon). It tastes good without the rice taking the podium on the flavours and it's perfect for those on a low carb diet. Finally, the duck stick was a good surprise as I didn't know what to expect. I have eaten duck in many forms and this one was a novelty. The meat was very well cooked and melting in the mouth, the bread coat was crusty and didn't taste too oily and the wasabi sauce it's served with, perfect. 
I heard same praises from my family as they enjoyed their dishes. 
For the dessert, we had an assortment of chocolate fondant, crÃ¨mes brÃ»lÃ©es, chocolates and the coconut cake which is the only thing none of us appreciated at all. 
My brother tried the Japanese soda, which is basically sprite in a Japanese bottle (which does make it funnier), and a french Chardonnay to our taste. Note that they offer a sufficient range of wines from different origins and for a wide pricing range (from Â£20 to over Â£50 a bottle).
It was a no mistake for Sticks n Sushi. I would recommend it to anyone on the lookout for a very good yet not too expensive Japanese restaurant in London. I mean, it is pricey, but not as unreasonable as we expected. If that make any sense.",1

The atmosphere is a mix of professionals and creatives which makes you feel hip and the service seemed busy but the right level of attentive. The food was AWESOME! Sushi can be hard to great right but I loved the slight twist on standard dishes (grilled edamame - why hasn't it happened before?!) with the platters a great selection for when you're so hungry you can't choose. The price point was right with it costing Â£50 for 3 courses, a cocktail each & some wine. I plan to bring the hubby here for one of our date nights, he definitely won't leave hungry!",1

The Yakitori was good, particularly the tsukne (chicken meatball) which was very good. They didn't bring out part of my order but it wasnt on my cheque so no harm no foul.

If you too would like to join me in my love quest to Sticks N Sushi, I would recommend you order the Ultimate (enough for two), make sure you go on a weekday night (for fresh fish, do not go at weekends), and seriously, enjoy everything from the service to the food.

Full review:
A friend invited me to lunch at Sticks N Sushi after she missed visiting the original concept in Denmark. So there you have it, it's a Danish import and hence why you'll find quite a few Danish beer on the menu. 
The restaurant has a hipster feel to it, in a positive way, giving it a good ambiance. The menu is beautiful - every item has a picture and laid out like a guidebook rather than a normal menu one would scan from top to bottom, left to right. It was distracting at time as my eyes dart from picture to picture, but I enjoyed the novel experience. 
The food that arrived at our table looked as beautiful as the ones pictured in the menu. The flavour of the sushi wasn't mind-blowing, but they tasted good and looked even better. On the other hand, the beef we had came with a wonderful sauce, and the dessert I had (black sesame ice cream) was packed with flavour. 
The staff was very attentive to allergies requirements and double checked with the kitchen to make sure we don't ingest anything we shouldn't. The only downside is the Soho prices, roughly Â£30 each for lunch (a plate of beef, two plates of sushi, two desserts and one tea), but it is worth a treat. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends over some visually enticing food.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Wandering around Covent Garden, hungry but not sure what for, we stumbled upon Sticks n Sushi. After a quick glance at the menu outside we decided it was worth a shot.
A chain serving sushi and yakitori platters, Sticks n Sushi started in Denmark and this is their second London branch. It's lovely inside - dim, music isn't too loud and tables aren't crammed too close together. The staff were very friendly too - we were made very comfortable and welcome (and one waitress even stopped to compliment my homemade flower brooch!).
Now the food. We decided to order the 'Table for 2' sticks n sushi platter which is a selection of sushi rolls and yakitori sticks served with all the appropriate embellishments and dips. It took a little while for our food to arrive, but it was all fresh and delicious when it did. We were told the providence of all of the seafood in our sushi. Believe me when I say everything was DELICIOUS! This type of food is deceptive - because everything is served to you in little bites you don't realise how much you've eaten until you are rolling out of the restaurant, fit to burst. This worked out about Â£30 each for the platter, drinks and tip.
Definitely one I'll make a return visit to.",1

Even the duck heart was delicious, which I had never tried before.  The sashimi was incredibly fresh to the taste and light as well.

+ Fresh sushi and Japanese skewer grills
+ Tasteful interior and excellent food presentation 
Sticks N Sushi is a restaurant chain from Denmark that serves quality Japanese food in a stylish space that is characterised by its chic minimalist interiors. As the name suggests, they specialise in sushi and sticks (skewers). The dishes are served with elegant presentation.  
The restaurant in Covent Garden was pretty busy when we arrived for a little late lunch (2-ish) on a weekend. Since we had reserved a table beforehand, we were shown to our group table without a hassle. 
We ordered one shared board each from sushi and sticks sections and a few small dishes. 
My miso soup came in a china bowl with an old-school wooden top. (See photo) The sticks (skewers) board, which consisted of chicken, pork and salmon with veggie sticks as side. The sweetened miso-based dip sauce which accompanied the sticks board was very tasty. The sushi board consisted of salmon carpaccio, cucumber and crab meat roll, duck roll, as well as the usual nigiri sushi. This board was served with a slightly spicy mayo-based dip sauce. 
Overall, the food was delicious and presented beautifully. I particularly liked the elegant but functional approach to presentation with no gimmicks. 
This place is not cheap but definitely worth a visit when you want to treat yourself with fresh Japanese food in style.",1

japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,3,"We went here as we were staying at a friend's flat in Convent Garden.  
First, the menu is oddly laid out and takes about 5 minutes digest the first time you are there.  Second, our initial server seemed to be a bit overwhelmed to the number of tables she was serving.  The staff also seemed to be going through the first set of cuts so the server rotation got a bit messed up.  Once we got our server, I'm blanking on his name, he was legitimately the best server I have ever had at any restaurant.  I was extremely impressed.   
Second, the food was good.  It was also a welcomed break from the starchy British food I had been consuming.  I decided to order from the set menu as it came with a nice mixture of both sushi, nigiri and a few yakitoris.  Again, food was solid but it seemed over priced and this was with a favorable USD to GBP conversion.
If I lived near there I would probably grab takeaway if I was in a pinch but would definitely venture out elsewhere before I made this a staple in my restaurant rotation.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"The waitress was an absolute dream - charming, funny, appropriately flirtatious, and very attentive without being overbearing. She deserved five stars. I felt sorry that she (and everyone else) seemed to have to shout something unintelligible in Danish to signal our arrival - this seemed to be a little artificial and unnecessary. Perhaps I missed the cultural context. Anyway, I digress.
The sashimi was marvellous, and not too pricey - I could have ordered double the amount. However, I felt that the rest of the food was a little hit and miss - the hits were absolutely brilliant - like the Ebi Panko maki roll, the spare ribs, and the oddly named 'Hell's Kitchen' roll. On the other hand, the salmon ceviche roll tasted a bit like fairy liquid, and the teriyaki sauce on the marinated salmon was a tad sickly.
The atmosphere, layout etc are all very good, and, strange as it sounds, their soy sauce was really delicious! Overall, I would recommend trying this place, and would probably come back again; though perhaps next time I'll be better off asking the delightful waitress for recommendations, instead of her phone number...",1

Its also quite likely that if you're not willing to spend at least Â£25 a head then you are going to leave kind of hungry.  The prawn tempura was fab, as was the salmon/trout roe platter.  The beef carpaccio was far smaller than the picture indicated.  The waiter seemed overwhelmed and quite rudely called a lady I was with a ""very impatient woman"" - not in a jocular way - not good enough.  The waiter was also very keen on topping up my Meantime IPA so that it had a ridiculous head of foam.  If you are going to try and make people drink faster at least don't mess up up their beer!",-1

I had the Kumahi (or something like that) and a great gin martini.
The food. Oh, the food. My friends and I are still talking about it, and my somewhat uppity friend even said this was top 5 restaurants he's been to. That's a rave review.
We shared the big sushi platter. It was perfect between six. The bacon wrapped scallops made me want to cry; they were so good. The salmon sashimi (and the rest!) was extremely fresh. I loved everything I ate. Perfect for sharing.

japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,1,"Summary: bad quality, bad service and bad value, I will not return.
Review: I'm usually one to give a bad restaurant experience the benefit of the doubt and try a second time but my experience today at Sticks N Sushi was undeniably bad.
I chose to go here because it was a nearby and good quality (according to its Yelp rating) sushi restaurant. First impressions were good - a comprehensive menu with a balance of traditional and fusion in addition to great decor and welcoming staff.
I sat at a high table in the bar area and after sitting for ten minutes figured it was traditional London, requiring me to order at the bar. I ordered a drink and a few minutes later a waitress arrived to take my drink order; turns out there was just a 15 minute wait from first sitting down and seeing a waitress.
By that time I had ordered food. I wasn't very hungry so ordered a light meal and the waitress seemed insulted that I was not ordering something more substantial-- I got two small sushi rolls and some nigiri.
The food took about 45 minutes to arrive, after needing to ask about the status of the meal from another server. When the food came my server was lightly apologetic.
The food was not good. It was bland, the fish was low quality, and the sushi rice was poorly made. The serving sizes matched the pictures on the menu, however, so I was not surprised by the size.
After finishing and waiting several minutes to ask for the cheque, I gave up and paid at the bar.
All in all for a light snack, I was at the restaurant for about 90 minutes.
I will not return to Sticks N Sushi. The food was not good, the service was remarkably bad and the prices were not at all good value. There are many other nearby London sushi restaurants which beat Sticks N Sushi in all of the price, quality, and service categories.",-1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,4,"Nice spot near the Covent Garden market. Large menu with lots of selections. Pretty solid food and service.
Rather large dining area with a ground floor and lower ground for seating that is dimly lit and pretty good for an intimate dinner. Several friends and I came here for a weekday dinner. 
The name of the restaurant is aptly named as they serve sushi and yakitori. So we grabbed one of the platters for the table which included various maki sushi and skewered meats (mainly chicken). Quality of the sushi was rather good. The yakitori was well made as well. These platters are huge, so be warned and bring enough people. No way could 3 of us finish a single platter alone.
Drinks are so-so when it comes to the cocktails, so stick with standbys of sake and beer. Don't get their take on an old fashion.. overly sweet and comes with chocolate chips... a bit weird for me.",1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,1,I heard good things about Sticks N Sushi but it was such an episode of endless disappointment. The services was very good and friendly and the restaurant atmosphere was very nice. Everything was nice apart from the FOOD. Sushi rice was so dry and dense as if they have to really push it together for the rice grains to stick. I asked for recommendation and turned out that the dish recommended was the worst. We had 'Coal Crab' the coal black rice inside was especially bad. The price is relatively expensive for what you get. It was not worth it. I guess if you are not asian then it would have been an amazing experience.,-1

The sticks are good and matches perfectly with the tasty sauces on the side. they're just a bit expensive. I always ordered different type of rolls to share and they all have an amazing taste. From traditional Japanese to fusion. I'll definitely recommend it.,1
japanese,-lEj_deBzWFE563GKJ8yUg,Sticksâ€™nâ€™Sushi,5,"I had heard good things about Sticks N Sushi and was so glad when a fellow sushi addict wanted to meet up for lunch. From the outside, it looked shut as it was dark and there was no sign of life. However, after trying the door we walked into an open spacious room with the sunlight streaming through the glass roof as we were welcomed by a member of staff and shown to our table. We made no reservation as it was a weekday and relatively quiet.
We had a lovely waiter who talked us through the menu and offered suggestions. The menu itself is quite impressive with images of each dish. With many, many options it took us a while to decide. We even ordered seconds. The best sushi I have ever had and the most fresh.
As addicted as I am to sushi, the highlight was the fresh green juice! Not being much of a juice drinker I decided to give it a go and I am so glad I did. I've already made plans to visit again..can't wait.",1

Service was friendly, knowledgeable and slow.  An interesting menu with lots of choices, great wine and spirit selections and a central grill area surrounded by bar seating are all pluses.  Unfortunately, if it's terrific food you're after you're going to be a bit disappointed especially at their price point.  I had a seaweed and watercress salad, kimchi (Japanese?), kyoza, grilled eggplant and ribs.  Meh.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"So delicious!  My husband and I luckily got some last minute reservations here the last night we were in London.  Pro tip- even if the online reservations says its full, call them!  That's what we did.
As far as the food, my only complaint was that it was hard for us to tell what would be a larger plate and what would be more of a small plate.  We started off ordering a few things, and based on the size of the first 2 dishes, we thought we might need another 2.  The third dish came out, and it was so much more food!  We regretted getting those extra plates (even though they were good, we were just so full!).  So, either ask or just be aware you might get a surprise large serving!
On to the food!
The first thing we got was the sashimi plate for 2.  This came with salmon, a medium fatty tuna, snapper, prawn, and a small bowl of tuna tartare.  Good way to start out the meal- simple, great quality fish.  I really liked that they included the med fatty tuna - a nice surprise.
Hubs got a few extra pieces of sushi which was also very good and clean tasting.
Third dish (the big one!) was the crab hot pot.  This was so good!  The rice is a bit creamy but not porridge-y, lots of crab, and tobiko sprinkled throughout for texture.  However, it was easily 4 servings and we struggled to finish it.  We could have stopped here but we didn't know it was going to be such a large serving!
We next got two of the specials, the cuttlefish and the kobia.  The cuttlefish was ok, hubs liked it more than me.  The kobia, on the other hand, was delicious.  Make sure to stir this dish before serving yourself!  There are pieces of fish, some sort of grain, a sweet corn mousse, and ""micro asparagus"" (not sure what they were but that's what we called it!).  You want to make sure that corn mousse gets distributed around the plate, because it is awesome!  Also fair warning, this was not as large of a serving as the hot pot was, but it was a bit much for our end of the meal.
We also had sake and drinks which were lovely (they feature a lot of floral flavors which we like).
Highly recommended!",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Even though Nobu London is arguably their best location, (with the possible exception of Nobu Malibu), Roka is actually better. The quality of their sushi Is truly exceptional as is their range of sake.I would strongly recommend their hamachi tuna.

japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"We had a wonderful evening at Roka. The evening began with cocktails including chilled saki.  They have an extensive menu and almost every type of saki is available. The staff was Friendly and knowledgeable.  Standouts were black cod crab dumplings and sweet potato tempura cooked to perfection. We had four maki rolls and all of them were a twist on a traditional sushi concept.  Expertly seasoned is how I'd describe all dishes. Much of the food is grilled out In the open by an exuberant team of chefs.  
The decor is exceptional.  Wood grain and glass gives the sense of tradition with a modern flair.  A great place to impress a date or client for that matter.  You have a wonderful view of the street and you can people watch to your hearts content.  The staff is extremely attentive. Pork belly with a little spicy vinegar sauce and sliced apples on the side was a stand out. The baby back ribs with cashew nuts and lime were fun but the sliced, rare duck was the best of the best.  Desserts all had an original feel. We ordered donuts with Carmel although- we were stuffed and happy as can be at that point.  Dishes are fun for one but easy to share.  Roka truly is one of the best restaurants in London.  Try it.",1

japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"Had a wonderful meal last night.  My friend and I had the Premium Tasting Menu and I would highly recommend it.  Not cheap but well worth it.  I don't remember every course but there were no let downs.  Some of the things that particularly impressed
--  The quantity of food.  Plate after plate, and not small plates. I probably would have preferred slightly slower pacing but overall it was a ton of food.
--  Went with the Wagyu upgrade on the tasting menu, one of the best food decisions of my life.  I don't have Wagyu very often (I prefer a US style steak) but it was incredible.  It was clearly Wagyu, not a hybrid where you can't tell the difference except by looking at the price.  It was fantastic flavor and texture.
--  The sashimi course was great.  Very fresh fish and even the scallops (I normally don't like shell fish sushi) was not too chewy
--  The yuzu truffle dressing that comes with the yellowtail carpaccio was incredible, best sashimi/carpaccio I have ever had
--  The seared beef with black truffle was also incredible, tasted like typical Japanese beef appetizer but the truffle made it very special
--  Dessert was over the top.  I huge plate with great fresh fruit, multiple ice creams and a molten chocolate cake
Service was better than I had been warned about.  Overall, great experience.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,2,"Very generic, not good as expected, tasting menu is disappointing. Not recommend if you expect a great Japanese dish, the fusion is too western and it feels like it's not respecting the ingredient and its combination of ingredients is confusing (e.g. a very bad use of truffle and Waugh)",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"The food is delicious and staff was super helpful and friendly in deciding what we should order.

japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"Roma Charlotte Street is a reasonably sized restaurant with attentive staff.   The kitchen is very strict on serving times, if you don't order your food within the given guidelines, the kitchen may request you came back another time.  I was able to order in time but was highly rushed by my waiter.  
I ordered their signature dish yellow tail sashimi salad with truffle dressing which was really good. I also ordered the lamb cutlets with korean spices.  It came with a small amount of chilli sauce and I ordered a side dish of rice (which was a bit undercooked).  The juice of the day pineapple, spinach and ginger was just ok and came in a tiny cup.  The lamb was just ok but for that price I expected it to be amazing.  Overpriced in my opinion. 
It was nice to see the chef's cook the food in front of you in the open style restaurant. 
My personal waiter didn't particularly come across as friendly and didn't smile despite my efforts to engage him. Most of the other staff are pretty friendly.
There is also wifi available.

The food was something of a mixed bag, but let me qualify that:  I'm from California and we get GREAT sushi.  The sushi and rolls here are good but I've certainly had better in California.  The absolute highlight was the yellowtail sashimi with truffle oil - that was amazing!  I'd go back there just for that.  We had the Rotaba beef, which was good, but in my opinion, needed more salt.   The experience was really nice and the neighborhood had a cool vibe.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Came here during a business trip in London in November last year.  The location that we went to was at Aldwych not Charlotte.  The ambiance was very modern and lively.  I had made reservation very last minute so was able to only get a table for 2 that was in the bar section.  Although we were not in the main dining area, it was still very comfortable.  This was a high-end restaurant so the prices were on the expensive side but the portions were good for sharing for two.  I got my favorite rolls, negi-toro (fatty tuna with scallions)...it was so yummy!  My friend got the soft shell crab rolls and she said it was delicious.  We also got a mushroom rice hot pot for sharing which was not your traditional Japanese dish but it was really good.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"So my wife tells me ""Five, it was an excellent meal.""  And it was.  But it was so rich that, being used to very low fat food, I would have liked to have had a little rice to serve as ballast.  But most people would not have that problem.  I enjoyed the meal a great deal, each of 8 courses surprising and delighting the palate.  And this was only the ordinary tasting menu.  Service was unimpeachable, the decor was terrific, and, of course, my company was unparalleled.  We had to rush.  We did not have a booking ahead of time and even though we arrived early, to finish all of our courses by 8 when they had bookings that were going to be filling all of their tables, we had to keep eating.  This was not a problem, as the wait staff brought courses 2 and 3 at a time, only waiting for us to finish devouring each in a fit of gustatory delight.
Yet I will still fault them for having an insufficient amount of starch and vegetables to go with the fried courses, each resplendent in the glisten of delectable oils.  Sometimes too much of a good thing is unbalanced.  And I'm afraid I would conclude that you should come prepared to have an unbalanced meal.  Unless you request rice.  And, if you can make it stretch over a little longer than 2 hours.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"A couple of weeks ago we went to ROKA Charlotte St.  a superb Japanese Izakaya western twisted cuisine restaurant in London, just a five minutes walk from Goodge Street Tube station, it was totally sugoi!!!! 
Upon arrival, the staff welcomes you with a nice and lovely smile, since the moment we got in, the service was wonderful, very discreet and attentive from the beginning, everybody is friendly and will do anything they can to improve your experience in a crowded but at the same time relaxed ambience, with nice music and dime romantic lights, loud and clear enough to have a conversation and read the menu without any trouble.   
There are two areas, downstairs where you could find their amazing Shochu lounge, here you may enjoy a nice Japanese or classic cocktails with some Nihon tapas, or one of the 50 different references of Whiskies they have from the rising sun's country, among other interesting things, before you go upstairs to have your meal. 
The main attraction is the Robata bar island, in the middle of the room, which allows you to observe the skills of the chefs and obviously their show cooking with some Japanese shouting orders, and at the same time it guarantee the freshness of every single ingredient and of course that they make everything at the moment, for me is the best place to seat.
What an impressing meal, absolutely everything was prepared and presented more than very well with a perfect timings of serving, our table was always with food on it. We went for omakase style, Daniel one of the managers looked after us, and together with the waiter did the unforgettably order for us, excepting for the salty edamame and sakemaki or salmon hosomaki for my daughter, I ordered for her, she cannot visit a Japanese restaurant without eating it.
We started with the aburi sake tataki with ponzu sesame out of this world dressing and very crispy sweet potato, fantastic balance between acidity and creaminess, very light but flavorful at the same time, we just loved it. One of the best western twist salmon tataki I ever had. The deep fried Nasu (eggplant) salad with sesame miso dressing and bonito flakes, really surprised me, the texture was firm, I couldn't feel any oil at all, the touch of the spring onion, miso and katsobushi gave it the perfect combination for a nice umami, it melted in my mouth. At the same time we had a crispy soft shell crab tempura in ponzu sauce with shichimi togarashi shiso, kizami nori and some arare, it was sublime, but the jewel-like squid tataki with yuzu shallot dressing was even better. The Scallops from the robata served with a wasabi and shiso cream and the tenderstem broccoli with ginger and moromi miso were delicious too.
Regarding the sushi, I must say the sashimi moriawase was one of the best ever in a long time, they offer different sizes depending on amount of persons, you will always have a selection of sashimi chosen by the chef, usually sake and toro are fixed included, there were hotate (scallops), lobster sashimi with different dressings (depends on season) this time was Mandarin Koshu, salmon tatar, hamachi, sea bream and ama ebi with imperial osietra caviar, all of it with nama wasabi, the fish was unquestionably of the highest grade and well execute, more than oishii. Unfortunately the maki selection was not at the same level, the ingredients and fusion were more than ok, but the quality of the rice was not the proper one, was too dry, however the temperature and the flavor was very good, my favorite was the wagyu tempura maki, quite impressive and nice move.   
  
At least but not less important we enjoyed the tai no miso-yaki which is a fantastic sea bream fillet with miso and red pickled onion The fish was cooked perfectly, falling off with ease and silky soft inside, the taste of the miso was amazing, this dish impressed me a lot, it was a clear example that sometimes less is more.
If you were waiting for the sweet part, let me tell you that the dessert platter was 100 times Sugoi!!!!! I do not know how to start, lets see.... It was a simply beautiful plate with assorted of exotic fruits with some real good ice creams, a lovely soft and warm dark chocolate brownie with a surprise viscous green tea pudding fondant inside, had a peanut, vanilla and chocolate sundae with sesame poki sticks and banana tempura, this one was my favorite, but the coconut and passion parfait, pineapple and kiwi fruit simply blowed my daughter's mind away.
Definitely Roka, rocks!",1

It's a busy fast moving place that offers a wide and not inexpensive variety of Japanese and vaguely chinese themed items. Expect to order Shared/group Tapas style.  It's loud, and it's fun.
They have an extensive drinks menu, and one that I found particularly tasty was their Bentai-san, basically a Manhattan made with Tequila.  Quite good.
 The Grilled lamb chops (called cutlets) here are an excellent starter.  The duck is fantastic too.  Sushi is high quality, but don't some here just for that.  
They have a tremendous selection of Sake and also Shochu (basically Korean vodka).
If you are looking for a fun meal, get a reservation and someone else's wallet!",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Roka is a good japanese restaurant when you needed to feel pampered. This is the perfect kind of ""Girls night out"" restaurants I like to go with my girlfriends so we can put on some cute dresses & heels and chat about our boyfriends or husbands over wonderful champagne and sake. It's like an ultimate pedicure for your belly.
Food at Roka is wonderful, we loved the sashimi platter, posu yellow tail sashimi, black cod on hobo leave, and many other dishes. The portions are rather small but very delightful. Expect a rather pricey bill at approx 100 pounds / person, a bit more if you drink a lot... but it's worth it.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"I was taken here for my birthday. I am a huge fan if Japanese fusion and did a little research before i selected this as my final choice. This particular restaurant specialises in islandic type Japanese cuisine with a modern an playful twist. All the dishes including my sea vegetable salad was made with fresh authentic ingredients. The overall atmosphere and neutral contemporary interior, combined with that stunning natural light made this a perfect early dinner hot spot for a summer evening. Our starting cocktails gave a perfect balance of fruit and alcohol. The impeccable service and selection of dishes and 'made-to-table' concept of the venue made my birthday evening memorable. Worth going for a late lunch also. The terrace had a great seating area outside too.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,2,"Very disappointing meal at Roka. Quite simply not up to scratch across a range of factors, but mainly the service, quality of food and value for money.
Let's start on service: I cannot stand when waiters continuously try to up sell more dishes and 'recommend' the most expensive items on the menu. Ours did this on at least three occasions, grating on us more and more each time and generally just spoiling our mood.
On quality of food, the sushi was really poor. Nizuni across the street serves better at about 2/3rds of the price. 
On the dishes that did deliver, the price left a sour taste. Their black cod is undoubtedly amazing, but should be about Â£10 cheaper. Again you can get great alternatives elsewhere in this area for much more reasonable prices. Willing to overlook price if the restaurant delivers on amazing overall experience, but the poor service just compounded my negative feeling towards this place.
I've been told the new Aldwych branch is a much better operation, so given the strong reputation of the chain, I may give them a 2nd chance via a visit to that location.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,2,"My love for sushi always blinds me to the fact that London restaurants are not very good at making sushi. I live in California and I am not Japanese, so I am not an expert, but at the same time... I have a mouth and I have taste buds and I have other senses like telepathy and kinship with treefolk and who cares what else I am capable of, I know what good sushi is.
London sushi always disappoints me. Always. It is at the point where I actually don't think it should disappoint me anymore, but somehow it still does.
Roka is highly regarded. I think it even got some Michelin attention, but that could be fabricated and I didn't bother to check on that one. Anyway, people say you should go here and as a guy here for a table of one, it still took a while to find a spot, so people clearly still think they should go here.
It was just nothing special and the price was acting as though it was. The rolls I ordered all had some sort of gluten containing ingredients that weren't listed on the menu, so I had to send them back. Gluten in your food? Not a problem. Secret gluten in your food? Problem.
The nigiri was fine, but it wasn't that great. I had a rum and coke and that was the best part of my meal.
I went to Tesco after and got some food to snack on. I won't be coming back, though I will say that the service was pretty good. If you live in London and you are content with the sushi you have had in your city thus far, you may like it here.
But, be warned... you have poor taste. I'm sorry that I have to be the one to tell you this! Really, I am. I don't even know you. So I'm sure that stings a little. But it's true, and someone should tell you. So, it's me.
Come to California and eat our sushi. Or better yet, go the other direction and go to Japan. Then bring back what you learned and start your own restaurant. Please. I will visit you and pay you money for you to feed me.",-1

Quality fish Roka does deliver, albeit just tiny slivers.
It's a place one would take to impress a lady friend. See the onsite sommelier for something cheerful to go with the maguro.
Dropping Â£200 on sush did nothing to satisfy, and that's just my share. Still ended up at London Bridge Gaucho for dinner round 2.
Don't come hungry. You've been warned.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"NB: I was lucky enough to attend a complimentary pre-launch sitting at Roka so cannot comment on value for money, and am unlucky enough to be a vegetarian so cannot comment on the meat and fish!
However, the food we ate here was absolutely delicious, from the glazed tofu (which was cooked to perfection, neither too soggy nor too greasy), to the granola dessert. The atmosphere is fantastic - if there are only two of you, I would highly recommend reserving seats on the bench-style tables, which face directly onto the grill - it's fantastic to see the cooking up close, and to hear the ""OI!"" shouted every few minutes.",1

All the food was beautifully balanced as had all the delicate flavouring you expect from good Japanese food. Gorgeous presentation and a menu you want to order everything from. The Baby back ribs were a particular highlight for me as was the Black cod marinated in yuzu miso and homemade hajikami.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,1,"Horrible, incredibly rude experience!
I've eaten here many times, and have enjoyed it until recently. Unfortunately, my last two experiences were sub-par, and the most recent so bad I cannot imagine returning. They've lost their edge, and are no longer worth it. 
Actively avoid this place.
We made dinner reservations in advance. Within minutes of sitting, we ordered the tasting menu, at their suggestion.  I've had it in the past; it's a large tasting menu, with many courses (twelve?).  The food was generally good, but it took them a long time (30-45 minutes?) to start serving us, and once they did, it was very, very rushed.  We were eating very quickly--even by American standards, and by European standards it was a flat-out race to finish.
Toward the end, they were bringing us multiple courses simultaneously, and taking away dishes before we could finish them.  Finally, they brought the desert--which looked pretty. I wish I could report on how it tasted.
Unfortunately, as they brought the desert, they also informed us that they had people waiting for our table, and they needed us to leave. They acted as though we had done something wrong. This before we'd even had a chance to eat our dessert! We pointed out to the manager that we had been eating as quickly as they served us, and that we wanted to finish the meal.
Now, here's the crazy part--the manager actually came and took our desert away while we were eating it, informing us that it was time to leave!
So here's my response:
We did not design their tasting menu. We ordered the most expensive item on their menu, and ate it as fast as they delivered it. It is not our fault they took a long time to get started, nor that they are booking tables too closely together given the menu they have designed, and their ability to serve it.
We didn't expect them to take as long to serve the meal as they did (2.5 hours total). And I hate feeling rushed by a restaurant who clearly cannot get their own act together.  But to actually come to the table and remove food, which they've charged us for, and tell us (in front of our guests) that we had to leave because they had booked the table, is simply inexcusable.  
Hey Roka: if you want your tables turned more frequently, don't take so long to start serving, and don't design and recommend a menu that you cannot serve in the time allotted!
The food is okay.  
The price is very high (Â£120 per person, without alcohol).
The service sucks.  
Avoid.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"My friend and I decided to check out Fitzrovia and we happened upon Roka. We were attracted by the fishbowl design of the restaurant and the huge wooden front doors. Good thing about eating lunch at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon is there was no wait. However, that is not to say the restaurant wasn't busy. I reckon you have to make reservations in order to eat here for dinner.
The services are was amazing, especially by London standard. We sat down and immediately we were handed warm towels. After learning that my friend has gluten allergy and is lactose intolerant, our waiter went away and came back with a list of dishes on the menu that are safe for her. And when he served the food, he made sure to put all the sauces in front of me, so she wouldn't accidentally use them! 
However, due to the dietary restriction, I have to say, the flavor of my meal was compromised a bit. We basically ordered simply grilled dishes. The sea bass grilled over banana leaf was delicious, especially the smoky flavored part that was close to the slightly burnt leaf. Roka offers a tasting menu that looks divine, especially the dessert boat I saw on the neighboring table. I had serious food envy that afternoon. I am definitely coming back for the full tasting menu.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"I'm a bit disappointed as I was given so many recommendations about this place, but felt my dining experience last night failed to live up to expectations. My friend and I ordered glasses of wine and Japanese sangria throughout our meal. We started with the edamame, assorted tempura, and cod dumplings, all of which were delicious (as expected). When our main dishes arrived - duck and sea bass - we poked around at the dishes but were generally uninterested in consuming our meals. 
Did we just order the wrong dishes??
From the minute we arrived, we were excited to devour the food and keep ordering to hearts' content. This didn't happen :( 
I also ordered the sorbet dessert and the waiter was kind of rude. I wanted my dessert while my friend was still eating her main course. The waiter refused to serve my dessert until the entire table was clear and we were both done with our main dishes. What's the big deal?? 
In any case, I do plan to dine here again and I only hope my next time will be better, both in terms of food and service.",-1

My husband and I tried the premium set course since we wanted great food with not much effort and it did not disappoint. We also added the Japanese Wagu so it averaged to about $97â‚¬ a persons which was well worth it. We had no reservations, just walked in to the bar area. The restaurant was booked but we got lucky. The service was great, they even made me a Special Michelada once they caught wind of me trying to make my own! Turns out the head bartender is from South America and knows all about making good Michelada's in London! Afterwards we walked downstairs to the bar, which was equally awesome. Great music, great drinks and great service. Vibe was very hip and trendy but not too pretentious. I think we found a gem!!",1

The quantity of food seemed to be the same but the premium tasting menu came with ""better"" cuts of meat.  For example the black cod vs. the sea bream.  Or yellowtail sashimi vs tuna ceviche.  Both menus provided tons of food, you will definitely be full afterwards.
My favourites were the yellowtail sashimi and the black cod.  I think the rest of the menu was just ok and the sushi definitely was not the best I've had.
Service was attentive but some servers delivering the food had no idea what it was or which menu it came from which was a bit annoying.
Overall thought it was expensive for what it was but if you want to try something there, just go for the black cod and maybe a couple of other dishes to share.  The cod and overall atmosphere was enough for me to bump it to 4 stars instead of 3.",1

The foie gras was served as four sliced disks from a large torchon, wrapped in seaweed, and served with some crackers and pickled vegetable.

The phone booking service is useless and online is hard to book if you are aiming for a dinner within the week - you have to book weeks in advance if you are after dinner 
However, I managed finally to book (online) a table for two on a week night! 
It is nice inside and hostess at the entrance was so friendly 
We opted for the tasting menu - which I was not keen on (as most restaurants from my experience stretch out the serving of courses to over two hours and to me that is too long for such small bites) 
Anyway, Roka's tasting menu service was very quick and yummy 
However, because I did not take long time to read (memorise) the dishes, and because it is extremely loud and busy restaurant , I had to ask the waiter once more to repeat what he has just served (only once I promise) and he answered my question in a sort of shouting tone !! Now I understand that he might not be the happiest in his job (I am not) and he might be doing this till his next casting is a success (he was handsome) but I did not appreciate the attitude!

Not much to say on specific sushi or tapas items, besides they are very good and do come with interesting presentation
We tried the special wagyu combo beef robata grill - it was very good, but I am not the biggest fan of wagyu, still too rich and oily for me

I came here for a work dinner, so we could order a lot more than my un-rich self would have been able to afford, and sampled all kinds of stuff on the menu. It was fairly hit and miss - some items were delicious, some just good or okay.
If you come for dinner without a reservation, you will probably need to sit at the bar, but I liked that anyway because we could watch the chefs prepare the food. My favorite dishes were the nigiri with quail's egg and the desserts (we ordered a few and shared, and I honestly don't remember which ones - it was a whirlwind of food entering my face!) We also had some tasty wine, but again even the cheapest of glasses and bottles is pricey.
For London standards, I think this is fairly good sushi. But I've been to a few London sushi places now, and I'm realizing that the standards aren't very high. Strange, because most of the sushi I've had so far has been in the midwest US, and it doesn't seem like it's even on that level.

Sushi and sashimi were excellent although my order of marinated sea bass sashimi was so small it was perched in tiny shards on top of a lemon half. At first I thought it was an amuse bouche from the chef due to the diminuitive portion . Gyoza very good. Great tempura and grilled sea bass (again) was simple and excellent. 
Attentive and friendly service and well organized. Cocktails were another high point. I like the open grill in the middle of the room. Buzzy vibe and cool understated decor.

japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"We had a fantastic dinner at Roka in Summer 2014.  They made room for our party of 7 ""on the fly"" on their patio and we celebrated a 15th birthday with all sorts of Sushi.  To end it all we had a beautiful platter of dessert options.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"When my wife and I planned a trip to London, we were told by many people that the food was not very good there aside from Indian food and meat pies. Our expectations were pretty low when we arrived at this Japanese restaurant, but I walked away proclaiming that this was the BEST JAPANESE MEAL of MY ENTIRE LIFE.
We ordered everything from the grill (rotabayaki): Baby Back Ribs (AMAZING, flavored like Pork from a Chinese Butcher shop -- trust me, this is a good thing), Filet Mignon, Salmon, and Tofu. All were delicious with a unique flavor that I haven't experienced anywhere else. For dessert, had the black sesame mochi ice cream and a chocolate soufflÃ©/pot dish. Both were PHENOMENAL!!!!
Great ambiance, service, and above all, food, I wish I could eat at this place more often, but for now, will have to wait until the next time I am in London...maybe in 10 years? Would love to try the sushi next time, but don't know if can resist all the things i ordered this visit!",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"Silly me for calling the day of to try to make a reservation- no luck. I was informed though, that we could show up and get a seat at the bar. Fair enough, I had slacked my reservation making duties, so sit at the bar I would. 
Sochu is warm, trendy and lit just enough to see your food/drinks but just dark enough that everything looks amazing! It's the kind of place that's ideal for a date and it seems like everyone there knew it! (We were the exception be prepared for PDA from every angle)!
We ended up staying down there for dinner because someone had just canceled their reservation. Lucky us! We ordered drinks- a glass of red for my friend and the kimono (which was delish). We ordered a number of dishes to share, which was fine, but there was no stand out. All in all, they were all just okay...",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"My favorite sushi anywhere. And my anywhere in this instance is pretty much all over the US - and London. I go to Roka on every visit - lunch or dinner, each one is fabulous. Not sure you save any money by going for lunch, unless maybe you drink less. The yellow tail sashimi is sliced so thin you can see the plate through it, a must have every time. As is the tuna tataki. Love the miso cod, the eggplant, I could go on. Great atmosphere, trendy without feeling like you have to be uper cool to go there. Very good wine list. Go.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,1,"I had a horrible experience. We waited 30 min at the bar for a table because the original table was in front of the door. After our dinner we were asked if we can pay the bill right away because they needed the table. They assured us that we can pay, finish our tea and there would not be an issue. The moment we paid, we had 2 waiters and the manager asking us to leave. They were rude, obnoxious and demonstrated the worst customer service I have ever experienced!  The manager was so insistent that he basically stood by our table practically harrassing us.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"Excellent place. We came on a Friday evening (c. 8pm) without a reservation. It took about 30 minutes of waiting to get seated (not bad) but we sat at the counter as all tables were booked. (There is a downstairs bar where can grab a drink while you wait, although we just stayed outside.) The counter is a nice option, though, as it allows you to watch the chefs as they work in the 'open kitchen' in the center of the restaurant. 
There are plenty of food options here and a range of alcohols. The beer selection is pathetic; how about some Baird, Ise Kadoya or Hitachino? (These are all Japanese craft beers.) Anyway, we had the glazed pork ribs, roast duck, edamame and beef dumplings. Everything was very, very good. The duck was more succulent than you could ever imagine, and I would recommend it. The prices for some of the dishes aren't actually that bad; a the medium-sized rack of pork ribs ran about 10 quid. All in, the meal was a little over 40, which didn't include any drinks.
The service here is excellent and everyone from the matre d' down to the bus boys is really on their game. Even the head chef bid us farewell as we departed. The ambiance overall is great. I can't really find fault with any aspect of this restaurant - except maybe for the beer, but I'm guessing I'm one of very few people with this qualm. Well worth a visit.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"Had one of the best meals of my life here.  top 10 for sure.  I am so glad that I made the decision to get the tasting menu.  While I wanted to go all out and get the premium tasting menu, the regular was still phenomenal.  I was scared that a restaurant with such a trendy ambiance would fall flat on the quality of the food, but instead it exceeded my expectations.  Even the kimchi was phenomenal.  All of the sashimi plates were delicious and my favorite dish was the sea bream (cooked).  It was amazing.  The sake selection was diverse and every bottle we tried was very good.  The desserts were also great - there was some sort of chocolate pot of mousse and a couple of other interesting desserts that were subtle and very tasty, not overwhelmingly sweet.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,The food and service here were very good. But the price and the extremely small portion is why I gave the restaurant 3 stars. The main entree I ordered felt more like an appetizer. Maybe I'm just use to bigger portions back in the states?,-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"I have been to Roka twice and both times the food was amazing! The tasting menu which allows you to try all different types of dishes, from Tuna Sushami to Miso Cod (which was my favourite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone without hesitation. The staff were extremely helpful and made sure your glass was constantly full. A great place!",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Excellent service and food.
The concept of Roka is family style eating but on a very small scale. The dishes are very small (our server recommended ordering 4-5 dishes per person). For example, the chicken and spring onion dish only includes two skewers. Our table of 4 ordered too many dishes to count and we ended up leaving about 3 dishes total at the table. I think a better recommendation would be to order 3 dishes per person and then order more if you are still hungry. The prices of the dishes add up very quickly!
As a side note, the menu on Roka's website is not inclusive of everything they offer. They have a much larger selection than what is noted on the website.
With 12.5% service included in the bill, our table of 4's bill was Â£225 which included food, one glass of wine, one mixed drink, one bottle of Coke (200ml), and one bottle of sparkling water.
Below are the dishes we ordered and our thoughts:
-Edemame - very large serving, nice sea salt on top
-Spicy tuna maki - the smallest rolls I've ever seen but excellent (nice crusty touch on the rice)
-Chicken and spring onion skewers - our favorite
-Salmon - excellent
-Sea bream - too meaty for our taste
-Sea bass - good but as a warning, it is served with skin on (deboned)
-Beef dumplings - excellent
-Lamb - excellent
-Duck - chewy, would not order it again, left all but two thin slices
-Chili beef - excellent
-BBQ ribs - very little meat, would not order again
-Chicken wings - even less meat than the ribs, tiniest wings I've seen
-Steamed rice - nice serving size, cooked well, needed salt (no salt or pepper on the table)
-Asparagus - grilled to perfection
-Broccoli - cooked perfectly, excellent taste
The only reason why I did not rate Roka with 5 stars is:
1. Serving utinels are not provided with the dishes, so you are forced to use your chopsticks or cutlery to cut off pieces or scrape pieces off skewers (e.g. asparagus). My husband and I met his friend and her husband for dinner and it was a bit strange to have everyone's cutlery touching all the food, especially since this was the first time I had met them.
2. There is not enough room on the table for all the dishes, so staff was constantly moving plates around to make more room for the additional dishes as they were coming out of the kitchen. Perhaps it is just me but they always seemed to move my water glass or another dish near my right forearm, so my arm was either always almost knocking over my water or rubbing in one of the dishes. They need to invest in some sort of tiered structure in the middle of the table that can swivel. The table was too cluttered and it was impossible to pass dishes around as there was nowhere to set them after you have taken your portion off the plate.
Overall, excellent experience. The nicest restaurant we have eaten at in London after having lived here for a year.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"3 words: BOTTOMLESS BUBBLY SUNDAY
I probably shouldn't be saying this out loud as it's pretty lethal. Basically you add Â£25 per person on the tap and we definitely made the most out of the Â£25. I think they might've stationed a staff at our table just to refill our glasses because it was constantly filled. 
Drinks aside, food was good. Standard Azumi restaurants quality. Fish was fresh, I've had more buttery yuzu cod, more flavorful tuna tartare and fattier o-toro from the same chain. But nonetheless really fab food by London jap food standard. I loved their fried eggplant dish. It's so simple and delicious. The green tea molten cake was also surprisingly good and I love how watching green juice gushing out of my dessert makes me feel like an extra-celestial being. 
So yes, overall 4-star because they made my sunday afternoon absolutely fabulous. It won't make a 5-star because I'm an uber-snob when it comes to Jap food. My advice is, go on Sunday, have a blast and take Monday off. oh, and go soon because if my friends and I keep going back there they might cancel their champagne offer very soon.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"Really nice sushi but the service was grim. Wait for a table. Don't let a pushy host cram you in at the counter. If you prefer a table, wait for one.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"I don't know. Maybe I'm spoiled by the amazing Japanese food in San Francisco but I thought Roka was a bit too trendy for it's own good. Our food was good but overpriced for what we received while service was friendly but amateurish.
If you've got a wad of cash burning a hole in your pocket and want to hang out with the pretty people, Roka is your place. If you want great food and reasonable prices I'd suggest you look elsewhere.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"I went to Roka for date night and had the premium tasting menu. It was a magical 7 course tasting menu, I still dream of the yuzu truffle oil dressing they used to drench the super high quality sashimi. The meal only got better with Wagyu beef cooked to medium rare perfection. The atmosphere was super cool with an exposed center kitchen/grill. Definitely highly recommended. 
ALSO! How could I forget the humongous dessert boat filled with sorbets, tropical fruits, brownies filled with green tea, and coconut ice cream filled with citrus amazingness.
I'm drooling.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"Roka does real special food. It's a fantastic restaurant doing modern, exciting and brilliantly tasty Japanese food. The main bit of the gaff on street level is open, casual with a little dash of Swedish minimalism and centred around the big robata grill where most of the fish and meat gets a roasting, if you're not eating it raw obviously. The menu is varied and as with all these sorts of restaurants best eaten shared with a group of people - the whole place has got a social vibe. For a little bit more romance ask to sit downstairs in the shochu lounge where the feel is totally different, red and black, soft sofas, big cocktail bar and pretty much the same awesome food as upstairs. 
Roka has won loads of awards which is cool but in sometimes the place itself can seem overrated or hyped by the media. Not so here, this is a quality dining experience, great for mates packing a good wallet, your parents, your work do and maybe a date you want to impress with a bit of class food and pre 'who knows what' atmosphere.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"Trendy decor and menu. Very expensive. Noisy. Loud, shitty music. A few of the cocktails were excellent. Wine list is well selected, but incredibly, disgustingly overpriced. Service was decent. Some of the food was very good. 
Good for expense accounts, or any case where you're not paying.
Butterfish sushi - extremely good.
Some beef carpaccio w/ shaved mushrooms - excellent.

japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant I've been to in London so far.  We came here for a Thursday night dinner and it was packed.  We called ahead earlier in the day for a reservation but could only get something around 10:00pm.  We walked around Charlotte street for a bit and left our names for a seating by the grill and actually opted for that instead of waiting another 45 minutes.  Roka is a robatayaki restaurant (Japanese grill) so it was pretty cool to be seated by the action (kinda like sitting by a sushi bar) .  We also ended up sitting beside Jared Leto.
I loved the atmosphere of the place.  It was busy, live and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Around the grill was an interesting carved wood table top.  It was a little uneven but added to the feel of the meal.
The food was really good too.  We had a couple orders of maki, some sashimi, meat from the robatayaki and a few small dishes here and there.  It was well made and the fish was fresh.  I like the black miso cod, but it wasn't quite as good as Nobu's.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"I had really big expectations for Roka, however was quite disappointed. Don't get me wrong- the atmosphere is nice, as is the Shochu Lounge downstairs, but the food is very average.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Roka is a high end Japanese chain with two locations in London - one on the west end and another branch in Canary Wharf.  Overall it is excellent sushi and Japanese cuisine; however, you'll pay for it.  The Canary Wharf location is located on the third floor of an office building overlooking a nice park / square.
The decor is nice - they have a very unusual cut outs in their wood paneling around the restaurant.  It has a very modern and hip feel, which is designed to appeal to the Bankers on expense account.
Service is efficient, especially by London standards.  The waiters and waitresses come by often to replenish drinks and check in on the table.  Food is delivered promptly and with a minimum of fuss.
The food is top notch; although, serving sizes are small.  Their blackened cod is particularly good - it comes served marinated in miso and served on top of a banana leaf.  The sashimi is good - the fish is definitely fresh.  The rolls are not that great - but then I'm spoiled by LA sushi.
Prices are high - aimed at people who wear Rolexes and have expense accounts.  Sushi Rolls are typically around GBP 12, the Blackened Cod was about GBP 30.  
This is one of the better sushi places I've found in the London area and highly recommended if you're on expense account or have a special occasion.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"Make no mistake, this is as good as it gets. While I'm usually in it for the 'best value', I will be upfront and say this is a special occasion, splurge fancy affair, but the quality of the food, service and ambiance seems worth the dough. Or quid, if you will. 
We were invited out with some new and old friends here (and it happened to be Valentine's Day so we made this our celebration as well) and everything was incredible...not just for London standards but right up there with the best of SF and NYC too. 
We shared a boatload of sushi rolls, sashimi, meat and drinks...more than I can possibly remember, but my favorites included (but are not limited to) the lamb chops dipped in a spicy sauce (tenderoni) the salmon sashimi (like butta), and this insane Wagyu beef roll with truffle shaving (worth a decadent dance). Oh, and my fav dessert--although stuffed, we did not pass up--was this caramel sponge cake thing that I can't describe other than heavenly. 
Come here, drop lots of cash, eat lots of amazing sushi and Japanese meat and be happy (until you step back outside into the freezing rain.)",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,a bunch of white people pretentiously serving overpriced Japanese food. huge waste of money on something that is completely lacking in any ounce of culture/flavor. food is okay but you can do a lot better for a lot cheaper. (not to mention our food took an hour),-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"I really don't understand how anyone could have had a bad experience here. We ate here last night, and I was blown away by how good the food was here!! Coming from NY, I've had the opportunity to dine at some excellent restaurants. When people say there is no good food in London, I tell them they just haven't been to the right restaurants. I think without a doubt that Roka is one of the best restaurants in London!!
We originally had a reservation for a table in the lounge downstairs, but one look at it and I asked to be reseated upstairs. While the lounge wasn't terrible, it was just very loud and more of a lounge to have drinks in, not dinner. Luckily, there was a table outside, so that was great, even though we didn't get to sit inside by the robayata grill.
Everything was perfect, from our food selections, the drink suggestions, and dessert (ok, so the only thing we didn't care for was how incredibly slow the service was, but the amazing quality of the food compensated for that). 
Do be warned that the portions are small, and not cheap. Here's what we ordered:
- Edamame: standard fare, nothing exceptional
- Spicy tuna roll - small but really tasty
- Black cod and crab dumplings - amazing!! One of my favorites from dinner
- Tuna tartare with quail egg yolk - amazing!! Must try
- Hamachi tartare with yuzu - very good. Can't beat the texture of a good hamachi
- Lamb chops - probably some of the best lambchops I've ever had in my life. Soft, succulent and extremely flavorful
- Sea bass with yuzu - this was sooo amazing. The skin was perfectly crisped, the fish was buttery, soft yet firm, and the yuzu flavor was incredibly fresh.
- Steamed rice - I know, how can you improve steamed rice, but here they added cracked black sesame on top, which made it very nice
Dessert:
- Chocolate pudding with matcha tea - very nice, rich chocolate taste, however it completely overwhelmed the flavor of the green tea
- Chawanmushi with fruit - incredible, satisfying and so comforting.
I was lucky to have my birthday dinner here last night. You should definitely check it out, too!",1

We had the kani no kama meshi (the rice hotpot with crab and wasabi) which was like a totally novel risotto, delicious crunchy grilled asparagus with sesame, some very good tempura prawns, huge grilled scallop dumplings, a foie gras maki roll and some sushi and sashimi washed down with lots of Dog Point Sauvignon.

japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Came in here off the cuff on a cold Monday evening. They seated us on the bar around the kitchen, without having previously made an appointment. Then before we had barely sat down, they were asking for our order, a bit too efficient, I thought as I had barely had
time to read the drinks menu, let alone decide on which course. 
The sushi when it arrived was amazing, arriving in a bucket of ice, and which mixed with the sauce just melted in your mouth. So I would definitely give them top marks for the freshness of the food, the presentation and the thought which had gone into creating the dishes. But I found the service a little too intrusive as they came by every 5 min to give the table a wipe, or clean away barely used dishes. Also at the end I found the price overly expensive. 
So to sum up, fantastic food, as good as it gets really, but the steep prices and over efficient waiting bring the experience down somewhat. I would say it is not an every day eatery, more of a special occasion place that should definitely be tried once.",1

The server also never put my order in and when I asked about my hot dish towards the end of my meal I was told they didn't have it and it would take 20 minutes.

 I didn't try sushi for years - it's raw fish WTF? - but my worldly wise other half led me to Roka's doors in the manner of Dumbledore giving Harry a wand and booting him off to Hogwarts. Utterly delicious food, smashing cocktails (although downstairs' Shochu bar is a bit of a thrill vacumm) and a truly memorable experience.

 If you do want to blow the bank, I recommend the Black Cod in Miso, the asparagus stack and the unbearably good chocolate pudding with maccha (green tea) centre. Roka is definitely way above my budget for everyday eating but as a special occasion blowout restaurant, it's one of the best in London.",1

Roka is one of those fusion sushi places that serves beautifully presented food to beautiful people. If that's what you're looking for, then it's perfect and sometimes that is what I'm looking for. However, I generally go for the hole-in-the-wall sushi place that  serves me amazing fish; no deep fried rolls, no cream cheese with my sushi, no silly salads: simple fish, done simply and simply delicious. I know those places in LA and I'm hunting for them in London. I'm determined to find them. In the meantime, Roka gets 4 stars for great quality fish and a beautiful atmosphere - even if it is a scene I wouldn't generally choose for myself.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"I had to eat at the London Roka as a promise to the staff at the Roka Akor in Scottsdale AZ, where I had my first Roka experience on vacation in September (reviews of places from my September vacation on its way!). They were curious to know how the 2 restaurants would compare on separate continents.
Both restaurants are dominated by a robata grill in the middle of the restaurant where you can see the chefs at work.
Drum roll..... well I preferred the Roka in Scottsdale though the London venue is also a good place to try Japanese food without breaking the wallet too badly. My gripes with the London venue are that the restaurant is crowded with tables close together and you do feel quite rushed with dishes flying in even though there's not always space on the table for them.
I had the premium tasting menu and again at the London restaurant, you do feel short-changed. In Scottsdale, the sashimi in the premium tasting menu includes top fish like toro whereas the London restaurant served salmon and tuna. Don't get me wrong, what did arrive from the London kitchen tasted great and I would wholly recommend a meal there but in comparison to the Scottsdale restaurant, it just came up a notch short.
The tasting menu allows a variety of dishes to be tried and is probably a good introduction for those new to Japanese food. Presentation is beautiful with the signature Roka trick of presenting the fresh food on huge chunks of ice carved from a block at the bar.
My personal favourite dishes were the scallop skewers - the scallops were huge and sweet and given a kick from the spices. The lamb cutlets with Korean spices were also tender and yummy. An unusual dish I've had at Roka was the kamameshi rice pot, a sort of Japanese risotto with king crab and a kick from wasabi pearls.
So a nice restaurant but Scottsdale wins.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,Definitely the best asian fusion food in London. In my opinion better than Nobu.

 If you can, go for one of the tasting menus  highlights include wagyu sushi, grilled scallop skewers, grilled quail and their giant dessert platter.

They use such lovely fresh ingredients, no sushi dish will disappoint you, in fact the tasting menu is so good that the first couple of times I was there I had that rather than choosing from the complete menu .The atmosphere is buzzing, the place is airy and vibrant. Service is excellent, which is to be expected. Keep in mind that it could be a bit on the pricey side. If you want to eat at the counter rather than at a table you wont have to book in advance on weekdays, but on w/e this place is crazy and gets packed even in the early hours for dinner. There's a bar downstairs where you can also eat and is a bit less noisy, and in my opinion it gives you a bit more privacy. I prefer the top floor. Definitely worth a visit!",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Let's get one thing out in the open - my name is Alex and I'm a sushi fiend. Ok, now that's cleared up, on with the review.
 I like Roka but I don't love it. Once again, trying too hard. What they do, they do very well but if they toned it all down a bit the experience would be enhanced significantly.
 The decor is fantastic, very modern, chic and enticing. The staff are excellent, attentive and knowledgeable if just a bit cold.
 About the food - when I eat sushi I look for three things; freshness, flavor and simplicity. If you're adding all kinds of ancillary crap to a plate of sashimi then I'm immediately going to be suspicious of the actual fish itself. Roka cannot be faulted on the quality of their food though, it was fresh, flavorful and well presented. If they move away from the haute cuisine just a bit and focus on their great product just a bit more then they'd be able to compete with Zuma and Defune. Yeah, I said it, what of it. I think Defune is better.
 One of the things that garners them an additional star in my book is their wine and drinks list. You'll struggle to find better in quality of quantity.
 I'd go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,1,"Talk about the ugly stepsister! This restaurant is related by ownership to the stellar Zuma restaurant, but this outlet does not even come close to stacking up to the quality & ambience of Zuma. Roka's atmosphere is not as cool or fashionable as Zuma's (which could be a good thing, but the missing ambience is not made up in any way)
 I have eaten here about 10 times, including downstairs in the very cool Shochu bar (I recommend this place for a drink!), and the food is not great. They have dropped the crispy squid from the menu, and the there are no real amazing dishes here. Most recently I ordered the shrimp tempura (it was AWFUL), an assortment of sushi (flavourless and forgettable), miso soup (white which had a nice bit of oyster pieces, but overly salty), black cod (it was OK) and some hamachi tartar (which was awful).
 On the whole, the food was either bland, poorly prepared or overpowered by sauces. Meanwhile, the prices are just as high as Zuma, so you know what?? Just go to Zuma!
 This place is awful and getting worse.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,1,"Standards have dropped drastically at Roka! The service was terrible, the food not what it used to be. Most shocking of all was witnessing a chef at the open robata grill kitchen handling raw meat and cooked meat without washing his hands!!!! SHOCKING!!!! We complained ofcourse and the ""manager"" seemed gobsmacked! This used to be our favourite restaurant, needless to say not anymore!",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"In my memories Roka has the place as one of the best Japanese food experiences I have had, during my most romantic dates ever. But don't worry this praise is not going to be too sweetly flavored..the relation ship is over, now go there just for the divine food.
On my unforgettable dates we had this seafood tasting menu for two, that pretty much covered Japanese cuisine from raw fish to a divine deserts. They just kept bringing us different plates of food like art pieces, that was fun and cute to share. I have no idea what the bill was, but I am sure it was a lot. 
The place is cosy with contemporary interior and with a big open grill on the first floor. The food is amazing, not just sushi and sashimi but also roka and rokata, and other Japanese modern dishes with names I have never heard of. 
Because the word has spread around you need a table reservation during the weekends.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"The first thing to mention is that the food was lush! So fresh and just damn tasty. I was vocalising all the way throughhonestly think Harry & Sally x 10.
 It could have been better signposted, I walked up and down Charlotte Street twice before I found it (but I am slightly blonde). Even on a Thursday evening the place was heaving but that did not impact the level of attention from the waiting staff. We were constantly attended to and they were more than happy to help work through the menu.
 The sashimi was brilliant but that is a given so I will talk about the things I tried that was new to me and might be for you as well. The Ko Nasu (Eggplant) was magical. Seriously, it melted in the mouth and the flavours of the ginger and other marinade just made my tongue squeal. The asparagus with seasame seeds was also amazing, in fact my heart is skipping a beat as I write this - gosh food can evoke emotions - it was so exciting to eat something so familiar yet served up in such a different way.
 The only thing I wasn't so impressed with was the dark chocolate and maccha pudding (that had ROKA etched all over it!!) - it was YUCK but hey you might love it. It might as well have been marmite on a plate for me. There was some noxious looking green goo leaking out of it as well which I think the waiting staff (that recommended it!) mentioned was green tea somethingIt just looked like slime to me.
 The ladies toilet (I can't help but mention them in my reviews :blush:) was clean, small and dark. The lighting could have been better but I loved the dark wood and chrome. There were individual hand towels which I thought was a nice touch but no hand cream which was a bit blah.
 We stayed upstairs in the dining area so I can't comment on the bar below but it sounded really buzzy. I also know they do great cocktails or at least I have heard so but as I didn't try any last night I can't comment on this. My date and I went through a few bottles of rather lovely dry white wine though.
 All in all, I found it a great dining experience but although the company was much better last night and the food just as good, I would still choose my Umu date over it as my Japanese restaurant of choice in London purely on the understated glamour & exclusive stakes alone (oops does that sound as shallow as it reads?!). The atmosphere is a LOT more lively at ROKA though so it depends on what you are looking for.
 Can't comment on how expensive or not it was because I did not get to see the bill but I do know that I would happiy return regardless of who was picking up the bill!",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Fantastic sushi, vocalised my apprieciation throughout, it was perfectly presented, and it just melted In the mouth. Also it was so fresh I almost felt it flapping. We had no booking, and as it was just the 2 of us we sat at the central bar that surrounds the kitchen. Only drawbacks to the whole experience; the staff were too intrusive as they came a cleaning every 5 minutes, and the prices even for London were exorbitant.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,This is a great place and the food is amazing. I love it. The Atmosphere is great and nearby you have the Charlotte Street Hotel which is great for cocktails..,1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"Definitely my new favourite restaurant in London. Shame my bank manager doesn't agree. And going against the tide, I have to say it's a million times better than Zuma - which is my current least favourite place to go.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,2,"Wanted to treat myself to a nice lunch. Went with a friend. The food was delicious, but the service was a bit lacking. I a college student and I look young--and so did the friend I was with. I don't know if this contributed to the poor service we received, but it was very disappointing. When the bill came, we refused to pay the 'discretionary' service charge and were harassed by the waiter. Definitely never going back. The only reason they get any stars at all is that the food really was very good.",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,3,"Since day one Roka has catered to a trendy crowd who want Japanese food but not the formality of a Japanese restaurant. Glass walled on two sides, walls which fold back to allow a terrace on warm summer days and nights, with the main robatayaki grill square in the middle edged by an elm bar and closely packed tables of simple yet elegant design, it's a place to be seen in.
The food is very expenive. Here though it should be pointed out that no Japanese restaurant is cheap. Top quality raw fish is expensive and the penalty of eating non-quality raw fish doesn't need spelling out. I would particularly recommond the aubergine from the grill with mirin, ginger and soy. This made this sometimes unassuming vegetable take on new depths of flavour.
A word of advice-steer away from the Â£50 taster menu. It gives you a full variety of the dishes on offer; but with some help from the waiting staff you can get some more interesting dishes at better value..",-1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"Roka is buzzy, very busy (almost rushed) and ultra cool. Like many Japanese restaurants the portions are fairly small and, before you know where you are the bill mounts up. With drinks you can easily spend Â£70 to 80 a head (including the 13.5% service charge that's automatically added to the bill). But the food is ingenious, beautifully prepared and quite excellent... leave space for one of their sweet dishes which are absolutely superb.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"One of the best japanese restaurants in the capital. Glorious sushi, amazing cocktails and excellent service. Be sure to take someone special and either go on an empty stomach or a full wallet as the portions are tiny.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,Fantastic! Go for the Black Cod and the evening will be a success!,1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"I love japanese food. Even more than chinese food, and considering I am of chinese descent, it means a lot.
 I've been to Roka a few times, all were 'special occasions'. It's that kind of place, with it's trendy decor (love that bar made from a beautiful piece of tree) and it's even trendier bar downstairs (overrated methinks). The main attention here, is it's robata grill. Sitting in the middle of the restaurant, it's hard to avoid the lovely smells coming from here. And it's also the thing to remember when you are looking at the extensive menu wondering what to order.
 Anyone who has been to Japan knows that the restaurants tend to specialise in a particular type of food. It might be something simple like ramen, or something special like hokkaido hotpot. So, when you go to Roka, look at the grill, look back at the menu and order something that will come off the grill. I have had the tastiest asparagus ever experienced from that grill. Lamb chops, smoky and marinated in a lovely sauce, amazing. And from the grill. Everything else, including the sushi - not bad, not amazing. Desserts - rather disappointing in fact. Service, pleasant. Bill, look away and drop your credit card quickly.
 I'll be back for sure - Roka sits in the list of places for those special occasions where I want to go somewhere nice and have a great meal. I've paid more for much less. Much much less.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,4,"I loved Roka. The atmosphere was buzzy, the food spot on. Scallops, dim sum, marinaded lamb was all meorable. It isn`t cheap but it far exceeds anything I`ve tried in other up market oriental restaurants. We didn`t book so we sat on the bar in front of the grill. I think I`d rather have a table if I were going with a party of four or more as you all have to sit in a row. The bar downstairs is intimate and dark with lots of stained wood and soft lighting but I wouldn`t go there for the bar alone. Â£9.60 for a glass of sauvignon was just too steep.",1
japanese,CtnWWH95S4EicWi-noE9Cw,Roka,5,"my boyfriend took me here when we first started seeing each other and boy did this place impress, and the food was so tasty i still think about taking a trip to London just to go have the tuna tarter. yum.",1
